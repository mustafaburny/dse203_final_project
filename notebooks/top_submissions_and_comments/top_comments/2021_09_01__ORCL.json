This is because the renminbi is a hard currency, and China has very few competitors for the renminbi. So its very unlikely that they will be under pressure to devalue the renminbi against the dollar, given that the renminbi is a stable currency. It would be hard for the US to make a move on China by saying that they can no longer have imports in dollars, as China is the #1 consumer of US imports.  \nThe only possible crisis in the next 24 hours is that Chinese companies might try to borrow in dollars, because they cant really borrow in renminbi. Its not that the renminbi is not a hard currency, its just that there is a lot of liquidity in the Chinese market, and banks could borrow in any currency they want. But since the Chinese government has been very careful in the past not to print money to finance bad assets, they will only go with renminbi.\"",

        "author": "TackleMySpackle",
        "body": "Personally, I only trade strangles when there is a known event coming. For example, with AFRM, I bought the ATM strangle (I think it was $95) about an hour before close of business on earnings day. \n\nI knew there would be a catalyst one way or the other within the next hour and that the next morning the price would swing likely in the positive direction. It did and I was successful.\n\nWith Nike, I jumped in a few days early thinking I would beat some of the IV. I was correct on that, but I guess a lot of other people did the same and that drove the price up $5 more than my strikes. When it crashed, the puts just didn't cover enough and I never adjusted - I should be flayed at the stake. \n\nI also bought Oracle ATM the day of (I think the morning of), and it dumped after earnings. I cashed the put out at about a 25% profit, but kept the call, because ORCL has a history of pumping a few weeks after earnings for their dividend. As of today, that call is now up about 10% so I went green on both sides of the straddle. I highly suggest you look at how ORCL performed a few weeks ago compared to last earnings. The chart patterns are almost identical. \n\nEach play is unique, but if you straddle just \"under the suspicion\" that the price will swing, without any assured date or event that might unfold, you might get lopsided.\n\nOne good rule of thumb I like is that a perfectly balanced straddle should find the put and call prices almost identical. Take CCXI, for example. If you bought the $17.50 straddle last week, the underlying has now moved up to $20. The $17.50C Nov is now worth more than the $17.50P Nov (for obvious reasons). If you wanted to balance this, you'd be better off rolling your put to the $20 because the pricing of the two is almost equivalent. It wouldn't technically be a straddle at that point, but you probably smell what I'm stepping in. \n\nOf course, if you find yourself rolling to the next higher strike, you're not really doing yourself any favors either, but I'm just trying to point out the balance aspect here. \n\nOne other note with straddles: IV can fuck you. CCXI is, I believe, the highest IV stock right now. If you straddled it now just in case the FDA approval doesn't go through, you might get IV crushed while your calls evaporate. In which case, you're not really reaping the benefit of the straddle. If you do CCXI, your best bet is to either sell puts and collect fat premiums and hope it skyrockets, or buy calls and hope it skyrockets. Buying puts right now, IMO, is not smart, but definitely track it so you can see how it would have unfolded for you. That's the best thing to do.\n\nTLDR: Buy an ATM straddle with about 45-60 DTE  just before an event; hopefully before IV gets nuts. Expect one side of your straddle to be sacrificial, but don't sell it if it does die. Milk the call/put that does perform for everything it's worth. Then, hang on to the dead side in hopes of a retraction/bounce in the other direction. Try to collect on both ends of the straddle.",

Things were going down, so I sold my ASAN calls and decided to get humble on American in general, buying some puts and Oracle calls and SMAR calls, anyway.\n\nASAN turned around.  Even though I'd be up 50% had I held it from where I am now, I am glad I got out with a big gain since ASAN was a yolo, and I didn't have much, left.  Riding the trend makes a profit, so here is to riding the downward SPY trend!",
