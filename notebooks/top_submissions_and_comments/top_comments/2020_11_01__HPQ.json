        "body": "I noticed AMD around 2017, I think a year after Lisa Su came in. I saw the Ryzen product and looked into the company as a whole, then looked into their competitors. Based on that information, I predicted a price of $75 for AMD at that time. Today, AMD is ~$90.\n\nI don't look at PE ratio much. I look at the company website, how they represent themselves to themselves, what products they sell, who do they work with, and revenue over time. Then I look at their competition and see if there is a market they're dominating in, is their competition capable of competing? Who's their customer?\n\nBased on that I purchased AMD. Intel seemed incompetent and incapable of competing. AMD is, and realizes that they can't run their own fab, so they relied on outside sources for that and they did excellent. Engineering leadership led them to success. Now they're going to continue to dominate and lead.\n\nI did this exact search over this past week on Lam Research and ASML, along with their competition. I have a strong belief in both of these companies, and I bought even though they are now at an all time high. In my mind, these companies are able to compete and will dominate this EUV market for a VERY long time. There used to be an argument for Lam Research to not be able to help in EUV, but they recently made a dry method to make things faster. That's innovative and competitive, they introduced themselves as a need in a market they were once recognized as not being able to penetrate.\n\nI stop investing when I see better opportunities elsewhere, I sense a worrisome market and need to keep cash aside, or I reach the price target and sense that the company is no longer able to compete. Again, doing the same research I did above but periodically and keep up with the news for the companies I'm invested in, and in their competition.\n\nIt requires time and energy to do all of this. I hope this helps.",

They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house?

Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out. I've replaced them with Pinterest in my portfolio as my new search/advertising stock. Social search is the future and I now see the genius advertising potential of the Pinterest platform; I see them stealing advertising dollars away from Google and growing much better than Google over the next 5 years.",

        "body": "Amazon won\u2019t be literally wiped out. The mistake is assuming stock returns will remain positive as long as the company continues to do well. \n\nI use this example all the time. Qualcomm is THE wireless chip designer. If you\u2019re using a piece of tech that has wireless capability, there\u2019s a very good chance it uses QCOM tech. Obviously wireless has exploded over the last 20 years, mostly with smart phones, but pretty much everything... TV, consoles, microwaves. \n\nQualcomm was perfectly positioned for the 21st century. They make money on every piece of hardware sold that uses their chips. \n\nTheir revenues were $2-3bn in the late 90s. With the advent of the smart phone, revenues jumped to &gt; $10bn by 2008. \n\nIf you knew wireless was going to explode in the 2000s, QCOM was as sure a bet as anything. I mean, *smart phones!* \n\nExcept if you bought QCOM in 2000, ignoring dividends, you made your money back... this July, 2020. Qualcomm predictably did very well with the rise of smart phones. Their stock? Trash. \n\nThe point is that markets are far from one dimensional, and overly simple narratives display a clear lack of understanding of market psychology, market flows, how and when valuations matter (they don\u2019t, until they do), etc. \n\nBubbles are a hell of a thing, because they can destroy the stocks of good companies for years or even decades. \n\nAmazon? IDK. But I see MSFT at 11x price/sales and I\u2019m reminded of one of the all time greatest stock quotes, ever:  \n\n&gt; At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&amp;D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need any transparency. You don\u2019t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?\n\n- Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems. \n\nThe last thing I will say is *a lot* of high flyers this year have charts that display the hallmarks of a bubble; exponential ascension with no regard for long term fundamentals, big drop, claw back some of the losses from the initial drop for a few weeks/months, before the steady decline hits and before you know it, the stock is stealthily down 40% despite no major catalysts or changes to the company.",

If you wait until the news cycle starts reminding us, then you've already missed a bigger bounce than you can reasonably expect from this year's biggest tech winners over the next few weeks.",
