Long term I think there were issues with their copier business and xerox wanted a take over prepandemic but the price per share was too low and rejected (I seem to remember the numbers 18 and 23 for some reason).\nI could very well be wrong\n\nThe CEO came out and said that it's undervalued by xerox and our share price should be higher and rejected that offer. \n\nThe share was around 14-17 for most of the pandemic. They had a backlog of orders during pandemic due to unable to transport stuff from China to here. \n\nThe prime competitors are Lenovo and DELL who are doing better than HPQ.\n\nHp split into HPQ and HPE.. I would look into a little more deeply.\n\nThe pandemic is almost over. Stay at home is almost done IE schools will open next quarter. Max by summer they will start opening. S&amp;P is at peak and there maybe transition into value stuff soon.\n\nI'd look more into it.",

They won't spend money on updating the consumer hardware. Previously worked for the big companies and I can tell you they had cycles for updates but when the economy got ugly, people were forced to used their laptops for 4+ years which usually means the laptop have problems but because of funds users were left struggling. Unless HPQ has some ground breaking products out there not sure they are worth all that. AAPL on the other hand might be a better bet as they have the iPhone which basically is still running strong.
