I've listened to the CEO in an interview recently and while I am sure they are doing big things especially with self driving technology and graphics stuff I somehow get the feeling that they are more akin to a Nokia or Motorola in the dot com days, a big player in the here and now but how will they be doing in 10 or 20 years?  I feel like they are just riding a giant wave as Semiconductor stocks usually do and I wonder what their margins will be in the long run since technology is deflationary so you really have to have the right values and adaptability long term, not just some high tech products here and now.  What do you think?  Am I totally off base?  I haven't studied this company in depth, I just gather scraps of knowledge from lots of places",

        "body": "ok lets do that:\n\nHealthcare:\n\n1980: AIDS treatment costs infinite money and you die within 12 months\n\n2020: AIDS treatment costs $20k/year on the high end and you will die roughly when you would have without AIDS\n\n1980: Breast cancer 10 year survival rate 48%\n\n2020: Breast cancer 10 year survival rate 76% (The drugs used to treat breast cancer in the 1980's cost very little today though they are less effective than current treatments)\n\nAlso, most increases in healthcare costs are covered by total compensation increases. So while wages might not have risen, total comp usually has and is usually rising at the exact same rate as healthcare cost inflation. So not only can you buy better and more stuff with your wages, but your increased total comp means you also have access to more treatments and better outcomes than ever before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHousing:\n\nCosts per sqft are almost identical to what they were as far back as 1970. What has changed is: houses are bigger, less people live in these bigger houses (household sizes have declined), they have more amenities (80% of new builds in the early 2010's had 2+ bathrooms vs less than 50% in the 1980's), and they tend to be safer with more durable materials used as well as improved fireproofing, and their running costs tend to be lower due to improved and increased use of insulation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEducation:\n\nYeah, i mean, for primary and secondary this is in line with inflation. For tertiary, this has risen faster than inflation, but people's ability to pay for it has somehow also increased. So even though university education costs spent 40 years rising faster than inflation, more people are able to afford to attend university than ever before. I will let you try to figure out how wages can remain unchanged, something can get more expensive, and yet more people can afford it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy car example is picked because it is a very easy thing to understand. You can take almost any consumer product and it will both cost less in inflation adjusted dollars AND have more features.\n\nCell phones are probably most obvious: the Motorola DynaTAC came out in 1983 and would run you about $10,000 in 2020 adjusted money. You could only make calls on it. And your service charge was around $100/month (inflation adjusted) + about $0.70 per minute.",
