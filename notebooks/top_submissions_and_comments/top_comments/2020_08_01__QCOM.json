Personally, I'm *extremely* doubtful this is going to happen, the least reason being that I've met Ford several times and who did he remind me of? Paul Jacobs and XCOM. Long story short, few years ago Jacobs came up with a harebrained idea to take QCOM private. He was basically laughed out and ejected from his chairman spot. \n\nThis is the *exact* same setup - family scion thinks he can pull off the heist of the decade while actual investors laugh their asses off.\n\ntl;dr F $4P Jan 2021",

There could potentially be a lot more runup if/when it goes pop.\n\nAlso, I was in the market back then...there was A TON of warning from the FED. They seriously gave like a 2 month lead to the intrest rate hike...so its not like everyone just woke up on Monday and blew their coffee into the morning newspaper.\n\nWas there FOMO? Hell yes, and a ton of denial. But people who were playing the market did fine...the guys that lost there asses were the dudes that YOLO'd their live savings into Pets.com and then took out a third mortgage on their house to get a little QCOM on the side.\n\nAs long as you aren't doing something like that right now I honestly wouldn't sweat it yet, theres zero indication that anything is going to turn the market. FAAMG just smashed earning in a quarter where the entire globe was shut down. Microsoft is trying to buy TikTok, Facebook just partnered with SHOP, SHOP just partnered with Walmart, Google just bought a stake in ADT, Amazon probably absorbed 15 more companies on the downlow between breakfast and lunch.

Investing in it 5 years ago, or even 10 years ago, in a set and forget style strategy would have yielded very middling returns.\n\nBut if you look at the recent spread, it had a golden cross on June 25, which is not too long ago.

Intel has had virtually unlimited supply of money to invest if they wanted to. But they didn't, because improving the next quarter's bottom line took priority over long term development into new markets.\n\nAtom is a perfect example : it failed first because Intel sold their ARM division (they thought it was not profitable enough - first big mistake), and then they made an half-assed effort by scaling down their x86 stuff which was cheaper than getting back into ARM (again being too obsessed with cost and margins rather than taking a long term view and putting in the work). To the surprise of nobody, it failed while Qualcomm thrived.\n\nBy comparison the FAANG invest in pretty much any emerging idea that shows up. Facebook acquires or imitates any new trend. Google puts money in a zillion different ideas (most end up killed, but at least they make sure they get their foot in the door if it goes big), etc. They know there will be new big hot markets and they don't want to be left out, and they are willing to lose the money on failed projects just to be sure they won't miss the boat on tomorrow's next big thing.
