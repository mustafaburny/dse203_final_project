        "body": "Here are the three main things I have discovered from my own trading over the last couple of years:\n\n1) Liquidity is KING! This is important because the bid-ask spread will eat away at profits faster than you can imagine, especially when things aren't going your way. Moreover, the less liquid that options are means the less reliable the probabilities and greeks are as well (as they are derived from option pricing). \n\n2) Trade ETFs as much as possible. I know at times they can look really unattractive with low premiums and even high BPR compared to individual equities but everything is priced for a reason. The equities are priced as they are because of the risk specific to the companies themselves that can lead to exceptional gains/losses (e.g., QCOM beginning of 2019). Unless we are able to construct our own portfolio of 30+ underlyings, we are going to be greatly exposed to the idiosyncratic risk of individual equities (not to mention individual stocks are usually not as liquid and have less reliable probabilities). If I do any equity options now, I make sure they are defined or that I'm willing to lose the 20% of money required for undefined risk trades. \n\n3) Trade small and often. For example, let's say I have a $100K account and I'm only willing to put 2% of my money into any one trade. This doesn't mean I have to do that though. I prefer to look at placing trades at a consistent contract size and making sure it doesn't exceed 2%. That means I may only have to put up $1k per trade or maybe only a couple hundred dollars. I can come back the next day and place another trade (maybe even the same trade). By doing this, I can be more nimble with the market and even choose to place different strategies (another form of diversification). Basically, the more often you are able to trade, the more you can cost average and smooth out all the greeks (e.g., volatility averaging).\n\nI think there are a lot of benefits to trading options (e.g., learning to take calculated risk, make quicker decisions, keep a pulse on the market, etc.); however, I also think passive investing has a tremendous amount of opportunities as well (e.g., long-term capital gains, loss-harvesting, company retirement matching, scalability, etc.). It probably makes sense to have a portfolio that is constructed with both individual stocks and options.\n\nThis is what has worked best for me; however, remember that none of us know as much as we think we do, so take everything with a grain of salt and try it out small. Hope that helps!",

        "body": "So, regarding airlines: you\u2019re right to think \u201cthis industry is distressed right now, I should buy it to earn on the recovery\u201d, that is a logical thought. However, airlines are taking on an *insane* amount of debt to weather this storm. They\u2019re straight up burning *tens of millions a day* to keep what travel is allowed available. Airlines are getting hit even harder than casinos right now, and that recovery will take a very, very long time.\n\nBut, if you step that logic back a couple steps into something more fundamental it avoids a lot of those issues. No, I\u2019m not talking Boeing (that will be shorter but still extremely subdued), I\u2019m talking about Amphenol. They\u2019re an electronics manufacturer that makes aerospace-grade parts. The further you get away from consumer habits, the wider timeframe these profits and losses operate in, and (right now at least) the more attractive that makes an investment.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t flying, companies aren\u2019t going to be replacing planes any time soon either, but there\u2019s foundational companies that are already up and running in anticipation of that. Because that\u2019s *their* business cycle. Same goes for other industrial companies, like Air Products, or raw materials manufacturers on the DOW.\n\nDon\u2019t play this recovery at the consumer level, whatever you do. Play it at the manufacturing level, and play it as diversely as you can.",

About an hour after market opened my alerts all blew up. I bought in on many, averaged down on a few, and ended today green. I have $12,000 allocated to averaging down on current positions if necessary and nearly 1/3rd of my portfolio available for new positions. Today was awesome! I now own SUM, CTXS, NET, IMOS, SIMO, &amp; IVC. Even took a small position of DFFN for a short squeeze and very small position in BKYI because ... well ... freaking because!",
