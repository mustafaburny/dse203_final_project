I definitely wouldn't advise you to put all your eggs in one basket, but I do believe that AMD is a very good buy in the long-term.\n\nFundamentally, they have an absurdly phenomenal management team. Since Lisa Su's inception, the company has experienced tremendous growth and even managed to steal away Intel's lead architect. Although AMD has always has great products, Lisa Su has really managed to take it to the next level and make AMD nearly a household name at this point with the rise of customized computer building.\n\nI guess to answer your question better, if you're planning on holding this for 10+ years, I have no doubts that this stock will grow especially with its acquisition of Xilinx and incredible product line. These synergies match especially well and I don't see a way that Intel could possibly topple AMD as it previously has. The semiconductor industry has been seeing a growing prevalence, especially with its intertwining of AI (i.e. NVDIA).  \n\n\nEDIT: I know that might be a pretty ambiguous answer, but I've done a few analyses and reports on AMD, so if you have any other questions regarding their financials/future outlook, feel free to reach out!",

Even Qualcomm I stay away from AT&amp;T though period well good luck with your investment you can always buy Tesla. I just bought Amazon and the price went down even though earnings were through the roof. The stock market is just not stable right now it's almost as if Trump is running that also as well as the country period both are in very sad state. Put your money in the bank and leave it there for a while you're better off period again this is only my opinion or is everyone says the mad ravings of a madman Good luck Chuck. Cheers",

With the acquisition of Xilinx, AMD becomes more of a threat to its rivals (Intel &amp; NVIDIA) in the data center sector. Unlike your average consumer (AMD vs Intel vs NVIDIA), data centers will always prefer price:performance rather than simple branding. If this merge works in AMD\u2019s favor, in time data centers will begin to adopt AMD architecture over NVIDIA (if price:performance is reasonable) thus increasing overall profit.",

Remember due to Intel process woes they will continue to lag behind certainly till 2023. AMD has 10% of data center market share and around 20% in desktop and we are no way near to saturation. AMD will continue to market share at Intel expense.\n\nComing to GPUs. LOL what can I say? It just took one attempt to match or surpass NVIDIA and people were very pessimistic about GPU prospects. AMD has &lt;10% of dedicated laptop market and around 25-30% of desktop market. Coming to data center (growing rapidly) I think its fair to say its below 5% if you compare against NVIDIA. \n\nNVIDIA is going to feel the pain now. Jensen is already sweating in his leather jackets. News of NVIDIA testing and cancelling of various Ampere SKUs is all over Twitter. First 3080 20GB, then 3070 16GB then 3070Ti. NVIDIA is poised to lose big chunk of market share especially in the notebook market as Ampere perf/watt is worse than RDNA2 and with superior efficiency of Ryzen 4000 and upcoming 5000 APU, AMD Ryzen+Radeon combo will sell like hot cakes in comparison to power hog Intel Skylake and Ampere.\n\nComing to Xilinx deal, shorts have no clue. If the deal closes, AMD will become a computing powerhouse with presence in 5G, automotive, AI, IOT, networking. Coming to dilution as they always bring, this dilution will bring $3b in annual revenue and $1b in profit\n\nPessimistic can sale and shorts can short. AMD has long term growth prospects.

Give me a break.\n\n&gt; ie: valuation of $25B then becomes $35B but the tether was based on 10/8.\n\nThis isn't a Wendy's where you're buying a hamburger for the price on the menu. There's a **stiff** premium to be paid for acquiring a company that wasn't looking to be acquired. Many of those executives will lose their jobs, they need a golden parachute. Shareholders need to be compensated for their loss of control. It's **really** **fucking** **expensive**.\n\n&gt; analysts upgraded amd to $120... but then (after the deal) downgraded xlnx to $130. (ie: not ~200)\n\nAnalysts are a bunch of dum-dums. I don't care about their \"upgrades\" and \"downgrades\" Go look at Enron's \"grade\". Look at Tesla's \"grade\". It's all bullshit.\n\n &gt; the math does not add up. this is off by such an absurd margin. far beyond arbitrage.\n\nYeah, because this wasn't a hamburger at Wendy's and shouldn't be analyzed as if it were.\n\n&gt; you also omit amd going from 88 to 74 on the rumour/news, despite their best er in history and 2 other major catalysts.\n\nAcquiring a company isn't a short term cash grab, it's a long term synergistic value proposition. If you were in AMD for short term gains it made sense to exit. If you were in AMD long term, it's a reason to hold or increase your position. That played out exactly how I expected it would.",

        "body": "&gt;When something like snap or zoom happens and you happen to be on the winning side of that ... it\u2019s luck.\n\nI've been doing this for a little longer than this year and nothing I've said doesn't apply to other years. M&amp;A plays and such are all the same every year with the same results and rewards and sometimes even greater ones.\n\nI called Zoom 3 months before it happened based entirely on the Corona Virus Pandemic and it's use in my workplace going up ridiculous amounts. It wasn't luck. In fact that's the problem here; Zoom was not luck. The uncertainty didn't lie in whether it was being used but instead by how much it would profit from it's use during the pandemic. Apparently everyone was blown away with massive increase in value because in this environment it really is just that useful. \n\nThe part I am trying to get across is that it isn't luck at all. At least not in this case. If something has a strong correlation with the SP500 for instance and that is tanking it is very unlikely that any news is going to outrun the beta on the stock so it isn't really as shocking as it might seem that earnings in the past week, even on things we already knew would go up from a comparative view, were still not producing strong calls or positive prices. They simply fell with the market as a whole at the time. The same had to be true of the things that fell with their earnings in Feb / Mar into April. \n\n&gt;It is a relatively new phenom with know real rhyme or reason behind it.\n\nThis is not new. You can go back to any bubble, any bust and any memetic behavior and see the same thing over and over. This is incredibly profitable hence all the sentiment concepts and scraping of forums and such; the data is profitable for certain. If it were new and no one knew what was happening there'd be no money in it.\n\n&gt;You could argue that currently,the possibility of newbie traders stumbling upon massive gains from meme stock culture is elevated .. Id argue that the probability is still low.\n\nYou don't \"stumble\" across companies you know. That's my point. No one \"stumbles across\" Snapchat. We all know what Snapchat is. You \"stumble across\" Regeneron. You \"stumble across\" Xilinx. You don't stumble across AMD.\n\n&gt;Is it possible to hit a 5k lotto ticket .. sure But in all probability it will be a while before you have a trade that successful.\n\nAgain this strongly depends on what your cost basis is. To get a trade that hits 5k from 2.5k is ... actually really common. Very. It was before this. It will be after. It even happens on just the stocks and not even the derivatives; a lot of people think that these market moves are rare but they aren't, and instead, they are heavily spaced out and complex to track so making 100% across 9 months in a year isn't what anyone is looking for but that is exactly how it tends to work out.\n\nI personally think that your first 20k is the hardest because it's easy to get the 1 that takes you to even 10k buy 20+ in one go is very rare so you do have to actually string together trades and that lowers the probability of success substantially. This is especially true because capital sensitivity worsens as you get wealthier; the same amount of money you need to achieve a return is not the absolute value of a cashflow anymore so when you worked at Wendy's (whose earnings are this week ;) ) your making 30k was huge but if you work at your own firm or a bank or something like that your making 30k is sometimes a pittance.\n\n&gt;I think it\u2019s dangerous to spread a narrative that suggests Snap like plays happen so consistently that all you have to do is be familiar with these types of cult companies to secure large profits.\n\nI cannot stress enough that this stuff happens all the time. It is so common in fact that there is no one talking about it. I mean the Fastly puts thing with a 392x value? *That* is rare. From 2 ~ 18 based on the contract within a year is not astronomically rare because remember it's all leverage so the bet itself doesn't move linearly like the base might presuming the basis isn't an option itself. Heh. Options on options are freaking crazy.",

But they're also spending a hell of a lot of money to get all this other crap done. I have January calls it'll probably expire worthless. I've come to accept that unless Microsoft or the government or somebody buys a company which unfortunately is not for sale. But then again everything has its price. Including me because I've been giving $5 blow jobs behind the Wendy's dumpster near my house just to make ends meet.\nI've already lost my half my portfolio which is about $80,000 thank you AMD for moving your earnings date without telling anyone and buying xilinx. And now dunkin' donuts is going private and I knew about it and I didn't buy any calls or puts or any goddamn thing.\nThe only advice I can give you is stay out of this for a while or buy leaps for 2022. Nokia doesn't move enough to day trade you're better off investing in Erickson or Comcast or T-Mobile. Even Qualcomm I stay away from AT&amp;T though period well good luck with your investment you can always buy Tesla.

Remember due to Intel process woes they will continue to lag behind certainly till 2023. AMD has 10% of data center market share and around 20% in desktop and we are no way near to saturation. AMD will continue to market share at Intel expense.\n\nComing to GPUs. LOL what can I say? It just took one attempt to match or surpass NVIDIA and people were very pessimistic about GPU prospects. AMD has &lt;10% of dedicated laptop market and around 25-30% of desktop market. Coming to data center (growing rapidly) I think its fair to say its below 5% if you compare against NVIDIA. \n\nNVIDIA is going to feel the pain now. Jensen is already sweating in his leather jackets. News of NVIDIA testing and cancelling of various Ampere SKUs is all over Twitter. First 3080 20GB, then 3070 16GB then 3070Ti. NVIDIA is poised to lose big chunk of market share especially in the notebook market as Ampere perf/watt is worse than RDNA2 and with superior efficiency of Ryzen 4000 and upcoming 5000 APU, AMD Ryzen+Radeon combo will sell like hot cakes in comparison to power hog Intel Skylake and Ampere.\n\nComing to Xilinx deal, shorts have no clue. If the deal closes, AMD will become a computing powerhouse with presence in 5G, automotive, AI, IOT, networking. Coming to dilution as they always bring, this dilution will bring $3b in annual revenue and $1b in profit\n\nPessimistic can sale and shorts can short. AMD has long term growth prospects.

Give me a break.\n\n&gt; ie: valuation of $25B then becomes $35B but the tether was based on 10/8.\n\nThis isn't a Wendy's where you're buying a hamburger for the price on the menu. There's a **stiff** premium to be paid for acquiring a company that wasn't looking to be acquired. Many of those executives will lose their jobs, they need a golden parachute. Shareholders need to be compensated for their loss of control. It's **really** **fucking** **expensive**.\n\n&gt; analysts upgraded amd to $120... but then (after the deal) downgraded xlnx to $130. (ie: not ~200)\n\nAnalysts are a bunch of dum-dums. I don't care about their \"upgrades\" and \"downgrades\" Go look at Enron's \"grade\". Look at Tesla's \"grade\". It's all bullshit.\n\n &gt; the math does not add up. this is off by such an absurd margin. far beyond arbitrage.\n\nYeah, because this wasn't a hamburger at Wendy's and shouldn't be analyzed as if it were.\n\n&gt; you also omit amd going from 88 to 74 on the rumour/news, despite their best er in history and 2 other major catalysts.\n\nAcquiring a company isn't a short term cash grab, it's a long term synergistic value proposition.

        "body": "&gt;When something like snap or zoom happens and you happen to be on the winning side of that ... it\u2019s luck.\n\nI've been doing this for a little longer than this year and nothing I've said doesn't apply to other years. M&amp;A plays and such are all the same every year with the same results and rewards and sometimes even greater ones.\n\nI called Zoom 3 months before it happened based entirely on the Corona Virus Pandemic and it's use in my workplace going up ridiculous amounts. It wasn't luck. In fact that's the problem here; Zoom was not luck. The uncertainty didn't lie in whether it was being used but instead by how much it would profit from it's use during the pandemic. Apparently everyone was blown away with massive increase in value because in this environment it really is just that useful. \n\nThe part I am trying to get across is that it isn't luck at all. At least not in this case. If something has a strong correlation with the SP500 for instance and that is tanking it is very unlikely that any news is going to outrun the beta on the stock so it isn't really as shocking as it might seem that earnings in the past week, even on things we already knew would go up from a comparative view, were still not producing strong calls or positive prices. They simply fell with the market as a whole at the time. The same had to be true of the things that fell with their earnings in Feb / Mar into April. \n\n&gt;It is a relatively new phenom with know real rhyme or reason behind it.\n\nThis is not new. You can go back to any bubble, any bust and any memetic behavior and see the same thing over and over. This is incredibly profitable hence all the sentiment concepts and scraping of forums and such; the data is profitable for certain. If it were new and no one knew what was happening there'd be no money in it.\n\n&gt;You could argue that currently,the possibility of newbie traders stumbling upon massive gains from meme stock culture is elevated .. Id argue that the probability is still low.\n\nYou don't \"stumble\" across companies you know. That's my point. No one \"stumbles across\" Snapchat. We all know what Snapchat is. You \"stumble across\" Regeneron. You \"stumble across\" Xilinx. You don't stumble across AMD.\n\n&gt;Is it possible to hit a 5k lotto ticket .. sure But in all probability it will be a while before you have a trade that successful.\n\nAgain this strongly depends on what your cost basis is. To get a trade that hits 5k from 2.5k is ... actually really common. Very. It was before this. It will be after. It even happens on just the stocks and not even the derivatives; a lot of people think that these market moves are rare but they aren't, and instead, they are heavily spaced out and complex to track so making 100% across 9 months in a year isn't what anyone is looking for but that is exactly how it tends to work out.\n\nI personally think that your first 20k is the hardest because it's easy to get the 1 that takes you to even 10k buy 20+ in one go is very rare so you do have to actually string together trades and that lowers the probability of success substantially. This is especially true because capital sensitivity worsens as you get wealthier; the same amount of money you need to achieve a return is not the absolute value of a cashflow anymore so when you worked at Wendy's (whose earnings are this week ;) ) your making 30k was huge but if you work at your own firm or a bank or something like that your making 30k is sometimes a pittance.\n\n&gt;I think it\u2019s dangerous to spread a narrative that suggests Snap like plays happen so consistently that all you have to do is be familiar with these types of cult companies to secure large profits.\n\nI cannot stress enough that this stuff happens all the time. It is so common in fact that there is no one talking about it. I mean the Fastly puts thing with a 392x value? *That* is rare. From 2 ~ 18 based on the contract within a year is not astronomically rare because remember it's all leverage so the bet itself doesn't move linearly like the base might presuming the basis isn't an option itself. Heh. Options on options are freaking crazy.",
