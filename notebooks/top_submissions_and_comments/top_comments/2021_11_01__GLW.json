Still surviving but struggled for many years despite being so popular in its heyday. \n\nI'll go with mine. Corning, 3M, J&amp;J, P&amp;G. All of these companies have stood the test of time and we are using their products in everyday life whether we know it or not. They are well diversified and would still do fine even if any one of their product has issues. E.g. J&amp;J and their baby powder",

        "body": "You are a value investor it sounds like.  Remember always:\n\n**There is never value in the absence of fear. There is never fear in the absence of justification.**\n\nFigure out what risk the market is scared of (what is creating the discount to intrinsic value) and decide if this is a risk you are willing to hold a lot of.  When you answer yes then understand most other people don't want to take on that risk.  Your willingness is what is getting you paid.  \n\nWhat Zacks hated about Corning was:\n\n* Severe supply chain problems both at Corning and it auto customers are going to be very bad for earnings short term.\n\n* 60% of revenues are in e Display and Optical segments.  China is a big customer and Chinese producers are coming on line.  Threat to earnings in the longer term.  Additionally they felt sapphire substrates are a superior product to gorilla glass. \n\n* debt to equity is high.  With a drop in earnings a dividend cut is likely which will pummel GLW.\n\nIt is trading at twice sales and 17x earnings for what is best case in Zack's opinion.  \n\nSo do you think Zacks are wrong or right?  If right or you don't know:  Do you have exposure to Chinese panel makers or sapphire substrates so Corning diversifies you?  Corning obviously benefits from demand inflation and gets hurt by almost anything else.  Are you in a position where demand inflation hurts you so you can take on this risk?  \n\nIf you think they are right and are likely to be harmed by those risks.... then you don't have an advantage.",
