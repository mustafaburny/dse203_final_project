        "body": "I did know exactly when the bottom was down to the hour. Everything was beyond panic and into bewilderment and \"the world is ending\" in a financial sense. For the 2 hours before the very bottom I was looking at valuations and was entirely confused. Everything I was looking at was trading at levels lower than should be possible, even considering the circumstances. At the time I was looking at Capri Holdings and transfixed by its 5 dollar share price. I was also looking at REITs like Welltower and VTR. That's just what I happened to be looking at during the very market bottom. I got a phone call with a \"is the world ending\" question and it just snapped that it was now or never.  A little bit of volume and stability was returning, market makers were finally posting some bids with size in the option level 2, prices started to rise, and I slammed into VTR, Welltower, and CPRI LEAPS. I grabbed shares of Apple near 200, ASML at 193, KLAC, and LRCX as well as before the crash I wanted these companies. Also got Nokia at 2.43 for 5G exposure.\n\nYou won't see how bad it really was on that final day unless you really zoom in on the chart and look at the prices I just typed. For reference, my buy-in to CPRI was 5.97. Unless you're zoomed in you won't even see more than a single candle shadow that low, and it's half the price of what the bottom seems like at first glance. Things were trading for nothing. It was undeniably the bottom for anyone who wasn't in a complete state of shock.\n\nI did see the Fed pump the first trillion live. That was of course the turning point. I actually traded it immediately - I think I was in AAPL at the time, and the Fed pump saved a long I had open. The market actually faded the Fed after an initial pop, because it was confirmation of how bad things must be (the bond market was indeed blowing up).\n\nEvery day after the crash there would be little stories like the birth of the COVID stocks (facemask producers, etc), the start of the stay-at-home trend, etc, so there was always something to do. It felt like running with the pack and was very satisfying to stay on the pulse and understand why everything was doing what it was and where things would rotate next. After a day or two it would be outdated though and you'd have to re-analyze the entire situation, but it was possible to stay ahead of the twists and turns, it wasn't just pure unpredictable chaos.\n\nI do remember the blowoff top before the crash too. I was trading Virgin Galactic on the short side, and going through that was just the final straw. I would drive in my car and listen to this specific part of a song that made me think about the market crashing over and over and over. Every day in my mind when I was trading I called it \"dancing on top of the world\". It was a very odd feeling. Very euphoric, and I had a bear conviction that kept building. It felt like slowly rising up the hill of a roller coaster rather than the parabolic blowoff you see in some stay-at-home tech stocks now. More like the extreme leverage and suppressed volatility (which as we know was a nuclear bomb waiting to go off) was inevitably marching everyone off of a cliff, which it was. As things got more extreme and vol stayed crushed, things got tighter and tighter so that any perturbation would cause increasingly forceful feedback loops just waiting to be broken out of the boundaries. Granted, I was exclusively trading right in the thick of the craziness before the crash so that's what I saw every day for the month before.\n\nEvery morning felt like strapping up to go to WW1 or something. You'd just log in and say \"let's get killed\". Every day traders in the wrong place at the wrong time could just get ripped apart by a mortar out of nowhere. Correlations went to 0 so there was no good way to hide unless you were in cash. I'm probably still coming down from that.",

This is absolutely awesome and with those tools anyone can achieve their desired wealth and dreams. My opinion anyway.\n\nThe problem with that is it's completely unrealistic. To be a _good_ investor _consistently_ over _long periods of time_ is damn near a full time job. It's not for everyone. In fact, it's not for the vast majority of people. They're better off in an index fund. \n\nI imagine we'd agree that general financial literacy would be a great thing to teach early. Most people don't have the first clue and it's a shame.",

        "body": "Eh, I hear you, but this isn't an honest accounting of it.\n\nTesla's pulling some strings with accounting, but it's not like they can't pull the strings the other way, and they have plenty of time to do so. They're going through rapid, rapid expansion right now, and the potential for them from pivots is very real.\n\n\\- Their battery tech is way ahead. Right now they're supply constrained, but ramping up quickly. I would fully expect them to make an almost 1:1 switch from revenue from green credits to being a battery *supplier* as other car manufacturers get into EVs.\n\n\\- They already operate the largest public charging network in the world. This actually *benefits* them as other manufacturers move into EV.\n\n\\- They also benefit from [the Starbucks effect](https://aipcommercialrealestate.com/the-starbucks-effect) as other companies move into the EV market and drive EV acceptance.\n\n\\- They're making a heavy, heavy bet on autonomous driving. Right now, I put them behind Waymo, but ahead of most other players in the market. And they're absolutely 100% ahead when it comes to eventually building fleet-scale autonomous, and financially way, way ahead as they pursue doing it with lease returns. (Waymo will get to an autonomous fleet quicker, but Tesla will do it cheaper.)\n\nAll of this means you can't evaluate Tesla as if it's an automaker running in the red. It's an automaker, *plus* a battery supplier, *plus* a fueling station operator, *plus* a potential rideshare operator. Plus like five other things.\n\nMeanwhile, car revenue for them is constrained from the supply side, not the demand side. They have **four** factories under construction at this very moment\u2014 Nevada, Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin \u2014 with yet another one on the way. \n\nAnd those green credits? Cadillac isn't even coming out with the Lyriq until 2022. Volkswagen is having production issues and hasn't delivered a single ID3 yet, despite promising 100,000 this year. That's how far behind everyone else is.\n\nYes, everything you've said is completely valid. But it's an incomplete picture.\n\nThat said, are they still overvalued? Yes, absolutely.",

But if you can just dig deep down now and keep that in (I know it hurts and it stings losing your job right now) but this is the ultimate test you're going through. You use that as long as you can to last out until you get a 30k, 50k, 70k or more paying job. \n\nI believe in you. \n\n2 years from now when you're on your feet and in a better position, you will pass this forward to someone else.",

The CCP doesn't specifically target any American companies.\n\n&gt;We should reciprocate.\n\nShould we copy their Great Firewall as well and ban any apps that doesn't allow government backdoor for data access? Winnie the Pooh can unilaterally ban any site/app he doesn't like, and that's what makes their government terrible, do we really want our President to have *exactly* the same type of power?\n\nIf there are privacy/national security concerns, then legislate through Congress and punish all apps/software that doesn't abide by the law, be it Facebook or WeChat. \n\nHowever I feel extremely uncomfortable that \"national security concern\" is now just the magic keyword that gives the President unlimited power to do whatever he wants. What's next, banning CNN and MSNBC because the FBI \"uncovered\" some connection between the networks and some foreign government?\n\nFurthermore speaking from personal experience, WeChat is used by millions of Chinese Americans as a chat app, very often with friends/relatives back in China. It's very similar to Line and WhatsApp in that regard. Using this logic Trump can ban all phone calls or emails or texts to China because there is a risk of the CCP government monitoring on their side.",

I bought a lot in March/April/May, bought a lot in November 2018, bought a lot in 2015, same with January 2009, 20-04, when things are going good I\u2019ll just DCA into indexes, or build into undervalued stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t sell unless the company drastically changes..  main positions are\n\nAmazon\n\nMsft\n\nApple\n\nBaba\n\nPayPal \n\nDisney\n\nJpm\n\nCat\n\nBAC\n\nO\n\nStag\n\nBam\n\nCqqq\n\nSchd\n\nVig \n\nVigi\n\nMy Roth is filled with Amazon, msft, dis, plus a bunch of reits like O, Stag, BPYU, MPW\n\n\n\nRight now I think schwab is severely undervalued long term and building a position. Also adding to all my REIT positions except stag. Eyeing baba and tencent if China gets a big pullback. Adding some to JPM when it was mid 90s\n\n\nKey is price you pay, valuation, that ultimately determines gains.  I love tech, but I ain\u2019t buying any of this right now, and haven\u2019t bought any since late 2018, just enjoying my gains and piling into undervalued stocks like reits and schwab.\n\nBe patient, the market is going to be there everyday for the rest of your life and recessions gonna happen, don\u2019t rush your buys and don\u2019t panic when shit hits the fan..\n\nI\u2019ve held thru tech bubble, 2008, covid.

I usually wake up about 2:30am.\n\nThere is a section called Top Gainers. You can choose categories such as Pre Market, After hours, 5 Minutes, 1 Day, 5 Days, 1 Month, 3 Months, 52 Weeks.\n\nWhen i wake up i go through the Pre Market and 1 Day category. The 1 Day lets you know what was running the day before and the Pre Market will let you know whats starting to run that day after WB hours start up. If i see the same stock on the 1 day and the PM slots i write it down and pull up the chart on WB. You can choose to include PM and After hours on the charts. The same stock on the 1 day and the PM chart is a strong indicator that this stock still has some gas in it. Sometimes just the top 3-4 on the PM movers are good targets to follow.\n\nI'll pick 2-4 of the stocks that i like for the day and in the first 5-10 minutes after WB opens you can see which ones are starting to run. If i feel good about i will buy about 5 of it and watch it for a few more minutes to see if it keeps climbing while i watch the charts. \n\nIf it keeps trending up ill buy more and then set a stop loss about 7% below my entry. If it bombs out right away i walk away. You have to learn to let it go if it drops. If it keeps climbing i adjust my stop loss along with it.\n\nThis strategy has served me pretty well so far. I know that the motto is \"dont chase.\" and while i normally agree with it the condition of the market right now is that we have multiple +50% daily runners so getting a piece of that action is totally doable. You dont need to catch the entire ride up but you can easily 10-20% of a run. A few months from now it wont be the same... but for now the getting is good so why not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this information helps some people out. I started out with 3k back in June and have more than tripled that. I know its not lambo money but hey im still new and learning haha",

Some undervalued tech wont be as affected and will continue upward movement(see INTC) and some relative strength will remain in the sector. But expect more bleeding from the ones that had yuge run ups (ZM)\n\nNext leg up will be fueled by recovery plays to build on top of the already strong tech sector.  The vaccine is coming whether you like it or not. Put your political b.s. aside.  This is going to be a green light for getting covid impacted businesses going again at almost 100%. Again, just because you dont like Trump isnt a good counter argument.  Get over it.  Position yourselves accordingly; things like (good)airlines, cruise lines, retail, restaurants, DIS...  might even add in financials\n\nPersonally, I'll be leaving a little bit of reserves to savagely go balls deep into Palantir when they do their ipo later this month.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk",
