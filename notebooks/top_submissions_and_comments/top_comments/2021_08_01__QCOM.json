        "body": "They didn't. When I spoke to an Intel product lead around 2012 he told me flat out that Intel, as a company didn't even consider AMD competition. He said that the only focus on the company was fighting companies like Qualcomm. This was obvious with their push of things like Atom. They didn't care about HPC because they didn't see any competition in it. Almost all of the money and research was poured elsewhere because everybody went to them for HPC anyway. Once Ryzen was released, which had obvious buy signals about it at the time, they still didn't give a shit, because first gen wasn't as good as Intels established product. \n\nThen it got better.\n\nThen it got even better.\n\nThen it got even better.\n\nAnd at that point it was too late, because Intel had focused all of it's energy trying to make atom processors and things of the like nobody wanted, they could no longer trivially keep up in HPC.",

But I guess they picked their words just right.\n\nStill doesn\u2019t justify the QCOM statement. At best, it was misleading IMO. that\u2019s one thing that was frustrating about Intel in the previous regime. Always putting a spin on things with carefully crafted words.",
