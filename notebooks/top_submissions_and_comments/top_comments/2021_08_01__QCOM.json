        "body": "I think it\u2019s a failure to adapt. Intel chips work on x86 architecture. They are capable of producing a ton of processing power, but also draw a ton of electricity in the process. This isn\u2019t that big an issue when electricity is cheap and if you\u2019re on a desktop computer. \n\nThe market seems to be shifting more and more to mobile and laptop devices which demand both power and energy efficiency. ARM architecture has advantages in power efficiency. The mobile industry has been headed that way for years. \n\nIntel solution has been to stay with their old architecture rather than redesigning, and developing more power efficient x86 chips. This is the case with their Core2Duo Mobile line. These however come at the expense of processing power. The advantage is that there is a lot more native compatibility for apps in operating systems that does not require software emulation. Software emulation eats up processing power, but Apple\u2019s new Rosetta 2 software emulation looks extremely promising. \n\nCompetitors such as Apple/TSMC and Qualcomm have been optimizing this energy use/processor power curve for years. If I recall correctly TSMC latest process uses 3 nm transistors, while Intel is locked on 5 or 6 nm process. Smaller transistors essentially means more processor power/clock speed in the same size package. \n\nIf Moore\u2019s Law holds true, then the number of transistors on a given circuit will double every two years, essentially doubling processing power. It\u2019s a more complicated concept, but you get the idea. Short of Intel having a secret project in their pocket, I think the train has left without them. \n\nTL;DR: Even if their fundamentals and technicals look alright, Intel is peddling an outdated product that is quickly being passed by competitors. \n\nLook up ARM vs x86 on Wikipedia and look at the dates introduced for the original standards and then the current 64 bit version. ARM is almost a decade newer in both instances. \n\nCaveat: I\u2019m a hobbyist that reads a lot, but am by no means a financial expert or engineer. Please correct me if there\u2019s any errors.",

        "body": "They have an arguably better manufacturing process 5 nanometers vs Intel's (rebranded) 7 nm. How much this difference translates into chip performance is arguable but the main reason it has a higher market cap is that they make chips for almost everyone, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Apple, etc as opposed to Intel who makes chips for themselves. \n\nFurthermore while Intel is making strides to catch up to TSMC they were stuck at their 14nm process for the entire time that TSMC iterated from 14 to 12 to 10 to 7. They did finally develop a successful 10nm process that they controversially rebranded to 7nm. Again it is important to note that while many people equate smaller number=better this does directly impact performance.\n\nOne thing to research more into would be President Biden's passed proposal to increase domestic chip manufacturing and as TSMC is a Taiwanese company. This could favour Intel more, them being a US company, but I would be interested if someone has any more insight. I do know TSMC has plans to expand manufacturing to Japan and the US and I am unsure if these will be subsidized.",

I've bought some in March @ 218 with intention to hold for many years to come. I just threw all at once as the sale was crazy, If I'd be to start position anew I'd probably buy in weekly-biweekly tranches to DCA.

But what if they got control of the Android space to even half the extent that AAPL has of the IOS marketplace. Globally, Android dominates AAPL in terms of market share but GOOG makes barely anything on the hardware. What if they were able to wrangle more profits with optimized hardware and less reliance on third party manufacturers? Yes, they have some contracts with Samsung, Qualcomm, and others but what if this is a major signal of them bringing the hardware in house?\n\nThe Nexus/Pixel lines have been mostly outsourced with wildly different levels of success. Could optimizing software and hardware from the silicon level be the thing that makes pure Android profitable for papa GOOG? I really hope so because stock Android is glorious.\n\nJust thinking out loud here. But if GOOG is successful at manufacturing good phone and general mobile hardware, then another trillion in market cap is not too crazy. It's a big if based on how GOOG has botched so many other promising projects/acquisitions. But this Tensor chip could be a massive disruptor. Thoughts?",
