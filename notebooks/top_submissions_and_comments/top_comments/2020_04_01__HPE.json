But i bet the latter do not show up in the report do they?\n\nMost cloud providers also buy their boxes from these two ODMs AFAIK. They provide the designs to the ODMs, and the ODMs do the rest. Or they completely outsource the whole thing.\n\nSmallish enterprises (few hundreds of servers) will buy from Dell / HPE (which in turn buy from the ODMs).\n\nLarger enterprises (private cloud consitsting of a few 1000s of boxes at least) buy directly from the ODMs. FB buys from both quanta &amp; compal if I am not mistaken.",
