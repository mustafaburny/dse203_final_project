        "body": "For long term investment, time in market generally beats timing the market. ICLN gained $1.45 today, up 6.5% to close at something like $21.45. It could lose all of those gains tomorrow. But if you\u2019re planning to hold for 3-5 years (or longer) and the price goes to, say, $400, do you really think you\u2019ll be kicking yourself about losing out on $1.45? Probably not. Better to jump in now and add a set amount on a monthly basis than miss out on potential gains. \n\nETFs or Stonks? I buy both \u2018non-diversified\u2019 ETFs and pure-play stonks. The former are lower risk but also lower (potential) reward than the latter. I buy the pure play if I know the company, it has a good track record, wide moat, and is currently pushing the field. I go with ETFs to diversify within fields that I think will take off in the future, but where a pure play is a bit too risky or I don\u2019t know much about the field. The more I know about the industry, the more comfortable I am going pure play. \n\nI have about 10-15% of my portfolio on \u201cgreen revolution\u201d stuff like ICLN, QCLN, PBW, and TSLA. I think green energy and EVs are definitely going to be huge, but the big question is when. Batteries are a major hurdle for intermittent solar and wind, efficient and cheap purification/generation for hydrogen. Once those are solved (and batteries probably sooner than H2), this field will skyrocket. We could be in a dotcom-like bubble with these guys right now (is TSLA the next Yahoo?), but maybe not. Who knows. Time in market, diversify. \n\nI have another 10% or so in ARKs. ARKK is well comparatively diversified and pretty much consists of the Crown Jewels of all of the other ARKs. That said, ARKG has provided better returns. I\u2019m a biologist, and biotech is moving at an incredible pace. It\u2019s a much surer thing in the short (2-5yr) term than clean energy. I\u2019ve also bought a number of the stocks in the ARKG portfolio independently. TXG has been skyrocketing recently, and for good reason. They\u2019ve already had a huge impact on the field and show tremendous promise for future gains. They\u2019re basically a household name in my field, which is saying something for a company that went public just over a year ago. CRSP is another promising company. The founder just won the Nobel yesterday (up 16% today on the news), and CRSPR offers the potential to cure diseases, not just treat them. The people at ARK are really doing their research, and I have no problem piggy-backing on \u2018em. \n\nAnother field you might want to consider is semiconductors. AI, gaming, VR, data analysis/mining gaming, fintech, internet-of-things, you name it, the tech is based on computer chips. My bet is a lot of the processing that\u2019s currently done on a device is going to shift to the cloud as software demands begin to outpace hardware capabilities. That means server farms, which are simply massive numbers of GPUs, CPUs, SSDs, memory, etc. Company-wise, AMD, NVDA, TSM, and AMAT are all at the forefront, and their stocks have all killed in the last few months/years. SMH and SOXX are good semiconductor-focused ETFs. I have about 15% of my portfolio here. \n\nI also have some in COVID darling stuff like ZM, MRNA, BNTX that I got in on early and will probably be selling in the 3-6 months. Wouldn\u2019t suggest any of these at this point, especially given your goals here. \n\nThe rest is safer play blue-chip stuff like MSFT, APPL, TMO, ADBE, etc. - these guys all have massive war chests, which means they\u2019ll probably be expanding in the coming downturn, whereas other, more indebted companies will be contracting or going belly up.\n\nThat\u2019s my 10 cents. That\u2019ll be 10 cents...",

(you might have better luck at a casino...) There\u2019s plenty of information out there on selling credit spreads. \n\nIf multi leg strategies seem too complicated, what may benefit you the most right now would be to find companies you believe will do especially well in the future (e.g. AI/chip designers/manufacturers (nvda, intc, qcom, amd, amat, mu), home delivery (Amazon, chewy, Walmart)). After you find what you believe to be a few solid companies, trade shares (buy low, sell high) to get a general feel for each stock\u2019s price movement. This will help you immensely in understanding position sizing and will train you to spot opportunities to open/close options positions. \n\nOnce you\u2019re totally confident on an options strategy I\u2019d only risk at most 5%-10% of your capital. Even with what appears to be a completely winning options strategy, you must be prepared to lose it all. Things will happen in the market that will totally catch you off guard. Limiting your risk exposure is the best way to protect against this, especially during this election time.",
