These other tech companies are priced way higher than they were a year ago. IBM did not have the insane run-up as many of the tech companies pushing all time highs. There is no way those companies are worth their valuations, and this honestly proves it. Expect disappointing earnings all around for tech. The difference is IBM has a much lower price than it did when the recession started and some of these other companies are up over 30% from that point.\n\nTo me, very bearish news. No way these other tech companies can out-perform last year's earnings and yet their price suggests they'll way surpass them.

If they need to look outside their company for innovative ideas and growth that isn't a great sign. Not all purchase and mergers are bad, but when it becomes the only source of growth, its a problem. \n\nWhen smaller newer companies start beating them in specific a what seems like small or specialized areas. It's important to remember all these companies started out based on a small speciality and then grew and expanded. Amazon sold books, Apple made home computers, Microsoft made windows. Almost all of them are unrecognizable from their original business. But their overwhelming success in that one area got their foot in the door and allowed them to grow and expand. \n\nI see this with Zoom beating all these major tech companies with video conference. It's all zoom does, right now. Same with Spotify dominating music and podcast. It's all they do right now. But Apple offered both and lost. Google offered both and lost. Microsoft offered both and lost. Amazon offered both and lost. \n\nNow unlike in the past where when they lose in an area they just buy the competitor that beat them, Zoom and Spotify may have grown to large to just buy up. \n\nSo when you start losing to your competition so bad you can't buy them out anymore, that's troubling. \n\nNow Spotify and Zoom need to expand magnitudes to be on the same level, and they may never get there. But they are taking away pieces of these larger companies even if they remain specialized. If other companies come along and do the same like Netflix in video streaming. Then eventually growth starts to decline. \n\nGE and IBM are still in business and IBM is still a solid company. So I'm not saying any of these companies are going to go bankrupt or disappear. Just that they may be closer to a peak than some investor realize. The days of 10-30% a year returns may be coming to an end. Followed by a multiple contraction. And then a period of low growth returns similar to IBM.",

Not only did all positions end up closing positive, every *contract* ended up closing positive.\n\nThis makes 11/13 positive weeks, with 1 loss and 1 wash. Every week I am up, I skim profits to do fun things like pay bills and reset my account back to base. I am getting closer and closer to only having \"house money\" in my account.\n\nSpecial thanks to IBM, LOGI, LLNW, SYF, COF, UAL, IRBT, SNAP, AAL, LUV, TWTR, MTB, SKX, and AXP.\n\nHonorable mention to INTC. I almost sold a strangle Thursday, but I weighed against it due to low IV. That would have made the week a whole lot different.\n\nFWIW, I thought about playing TSLA, but the stock is just too expensive. Same always goes with AMZN. I would enter if I had more collateral.",

These other tech companies are priced way higher than they were a year ago. IBM did not have the insane run-up as many of the tech companies pushing all time highs. There is no way those companies are worth their valuations, and this honestly proves it. Expect disappointing earnings all around for tech. The difference is IBM has a much lower price than it did when the recession started and some of these other companies are up over 30% from that point.\n\nTo me, very bearish news. No way these other tech companies can out-perform last year's earnings and yet their price suggests they'll way surpass them",

Nobodythought they'd have the guts to do what was right and under Balmer they wouldn't have. Here are some of the unthinkable things MSFT has done.\n\n1. Came to terms with not everything in the world is going to be around Windows. This includes migrating .net core, making Windows 10 upgrade free\n2. Spending crazy amounts of money on Azure to catch up to AWS\n3. Copying Google Docs, Slack, and well all other tools that posed a challenge to them.\n\nIt definitely wasn't a freebie that Microsoft would have made it through. There was a high likelihood they could have become an IBM. When you tak into consideration how much MSFT struggled to get the right leadership in place, the concern was real.",

They're quite a ways from their pre covid price still,  I started buying at 115 and kept buying as it was slowly ticking up. They barely beat earnings and popped hard so I sold everything at the peak and am slowly buying back in now. Anyways they're a boomer company as far as tech goes and they've been on the decline but they're IMO doing good things to retool for the future, new CEO looks great, 5.5% divvie is nothing to scoff at, and even if all it does is bounce back to the pre covid high over a year that's still a 30% gain including the divvy.
