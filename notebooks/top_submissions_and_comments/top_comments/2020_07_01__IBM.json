If they need to look outside their company for innovative ideas and growth that isn't a great sign. Not all purchase and mergers are bad, but when it becomes the only source of growth, its a problem. \n\nWhen smaller newer companies start beating them in specific a what seems like small or specialized areas. It's important to remember all these companies started out based on a small speciality and then grew and expanded. Amazon sold books, Apple made home computers, Microsoft made windows. Almost all of them are unrecognizable from their original business. But their overwhelming success in that one area got their foot in the door and allowed them to grow and expand. \n\nI see this with Zoom beating all these major tech companies with video conference. It's all zoom does, right now. Same with Spotify dominating music and podcast. It's all they do right now. But Apple offered both and lost. Google offered both and lost. Microsoft offered both and lost. Amazon offered both and lost. \n\nNow unlike in the past where when they lose in an area they just buy the competitor that beat them, Zoom and Spotify may have grown to large to just buy up. \n\nSo when you start losing to your competition so bad you can't buy them out anymore, that's troubling. \n\nNow Spotify and Zoom need to expand magnitudes to be on the same level, and they may never get there. But they are taking away pieces of these larger companies even if they remain specialized. If other companies come along and do the same like Netflix in video streaming. Then eventually growth starts to decline. \n\nGE and IBM are still in business and IBM is still a solid company. So I'm not saying any of these companies are going to go bankrupt or disappear. Just that they may be closer to a peak than some investor realize. The days of 10-30% a year returns may be coming to an end. Followed by a multiple contraction. And then a period of low growth returns similar to IBM.",

Walmart and IBM wouldn't have bankrupted anybody.

Came to terms with not everything in the world is going to be around Windows. This includes migrating .net core, making Windows 10 upgrade free\n2. Spending crazy amounts of money on Azure to catch up to AWS\n3. Copying Google Docs, Slack, and well all other tools that posed a challenge to them.\n\nIt definitely wasn't a freebie that Microsoft would have made it through. There was a high likelihood they could have become an IBM. When you tak into consideration how much MSFT struggled to get the right leadership in place, the concern was real.",

Share price has been in an orderly decline for half a decade and promptly got completely obliterated in March. People in their 20's do not need to focus on income to the degree that people are doing on here, and it's often at least some degree of a  reach for yield: it's not often dividend growth, it's either risky high yield (mREITs) or ultra conservative plays that would appeal to their parents (T, JNJ)  At least OP has *some* growth in their portfolio.\n\n\"HTZ - 0.25%\"\n\nWhy?\n\n\"IBM - 10.5%\"\n\nUnless you have a thesis on why they can improve very significantly very quickly after Rometty's \"Immelt-like\" tenure, then no.\n\n\"AT&amp;T - 2.7%\"\n\nNo thanks. People on here want yield so bad for some reason and would rather a company that hasn't been very well run and that hasn't provided great shareholder returns that yields 6.9% versus something like AMT which has been very well run and has continually grown the dividend but only yields 1.7%.\n\n\"DAL - 4.8% AAL - 1%\"\n\nNo. There's been so much talk of airlines on here this year when you would have been better off in growth. Delta yesterday said the recovery would take at least two years. \n\n\"EBAY - 10.5%\"\n\nI wouldn't put anywhere near 10% in it, but Ebay is somewhat interesting as a potential turnaround.\n\n\"MCD - 16.5%\"\n\nWhy so much? In terms of a conservative play that provides a value to the consumer I'd rather WMT (but wouldn't have 16.5% in it.)",

Higher stock price also means greater return for tesla investors who're then willing to invest more into the company to increase it's assets. Companies can pay for assets in stocks. Like for example when IBM was struggling Warren Buffet gave IBM like $10billion or something in exchange for a stake in the company with a number of shares and the ability to buy IBM shares for a fixed price for a number of years. This way IBM gets a bunch of much needed cash and Buffet gets a shit ton of IBM shares at dirt cheap price. \n\nIf Tesla is strapped for cash, it can issue more shares (the shareholders will need to agree to this as this will potentially dilute individual shareholder's stake in the company) and sell them at the higher valuation to the public to get more cash it can do whatever with.",
