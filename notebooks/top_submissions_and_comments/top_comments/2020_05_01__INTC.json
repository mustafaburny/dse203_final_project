Decrease is only in the short term with possible recession and people being more money concious.\n\n&gt;Intel will catch up to AMD use on 7nm by end of 2020 and yes 7nm = 10nm. If use density metrics, Intel\u2019s 10 nm is superior to AMD\u2019s 7 nm. If you use TSMC\u2019s marketing lingo, their process will be small as an atom in 5 years, then what???\n\nIntel will not be on 7nm by the end of this year. Ice Lake JUST came out and it's only 10nm. They can't even make desktop/server 10nm yet; check out the new 10th gen desktop procs (Comet Lake is still 14nm). AMD Zen 3 is probably going to come out right ask Intel get their 10nm desktop/server chips going.\n\nRegarding TSMCs 5nm (or 7nm EVU, however you want to call it), they've been working with Apple to use it on the next iPhone since January. That tech is pretty much confirmed and good to go, unlike anything on Intel's side.\n\n&gt;AMD\u2019s margin is a lot smaller than Intel and contrary to people\u2019s belief that Intel is discounting to be competitive with AMD, their financial and especially their gross margin does not reflect that.\n\nAMD's margins are HUGE now, since they've moved everything to 7nm chiplet with a 12nm I/O die. They have a product stack that utilizes every single \"waste\" product to maximize production yield. They don't have to manufacture these huge dies with a bunch of cores anymore, since everything is based around dual, 4-core CCXs. All TSMC does is make tons of the same chip.\n\nActual yields are AMD at around 70% and Intel at around 35% (for their server stuff), and obviously not good enough to use on their consumer products.",

Intel is still behind in the actual roll out to the consumer, but the gap is not as wide as what you would assume. \n\nIntel also has advantages in how they manufacture their chips, and they should be able to squeeze more performance out of their chips over time than what and/tsmc will be able to do.\n\nI would not recommend shorting a technology company without doing proper research into their technology.",

I think this is a risky move as Intel are working on a new big/little architecture which *could* push them forward without significant process shrink. This is similar to many ARM processors and hasn't been implemented yet with x86. Impossible to say what the impact of this could be, in the datacenter - probably nil. On desktop and mobile x86, potentially big. Depends on how well they pull it off and how well / quickly Windows can make use of the change (assuming the scheduler has to be adapted for this).\n\nAMD is leading Intel on price and performance it virtually every segment now. With the 4000 series on mobile, that lead isn't apparent yet as OEMs are very cautious regarding a switch to AMD chipsets (and the substantial investment / R&amp;D required for new platforms) after decades of success with Intel. I have seen entrenched purchasing habits pushing Intel servers over better priced, better performing AMD EPYC systems for the past few years now (much to my frustration). I have no doubt this will change with time, however both mobile and datacenter are still Intel's market's to lose as of today. \n\nIn the next 1-2 years, if Intel pulls off the new big/little architecture they could get a performance and efficiency boost versus AMD's chiplet design. Whether or not that is enough to beat AMD after 5nm at TSMC is anyone's guess. So the outlook is very murky in the mid to long term. In the short term, entrenched (stupid) buying habits for enterprise customers and cautious adoption from mobile OEM's buys Intel time to get it's products competitive again before AMD swallows too much market share.",

The layoffs were part of a re-org, and weren't most/all of them contractors spread across different contracting firms as they moved most of their contracting to a single firm?\n\n&gt;I'll be honest in saying that I'm probably somewhat biased here in that I don't trust business CEOs to know how to run a tech company properly\n\nYeah, I'm an engineer too, and a lot of engineers think this way. I think it's mostly nonsense. The skills required for management are more often than not absent in an engineer. I see it all of the time; engineer does well as an individual contributor, wants to move up, gets a lead/director/whatever role, fails spectacularly.\n\nThey're just very different skill sets. I've seen MBA types fail too during my career, but I'm not convinced being technically inclined gives you much of an advantage in operations and capital allocations. You can be good at both, but it's rare. Writing someone off just because they came from a CFO background is just lazy. Do you have any specific issues with his track record, or is it just a tech bias?\n\nI see you also posted this: https://www.eetimes.com/intels-2020-forecast-is-grim/\n\nThat's a very interesting use of the word \"grim\". Revenue up, EPS up, margin down. Did you listen to the conference? Margins will be down because they intend to implement a new manufacturing process. Margins _always_ go down in the near term when you replace a process that has had years of optimization baked in.\n\nJudging from your other posts, you're a massive AMD fan. That's fine, they have been kicking ass for some time. They still make far less money than Intel, trade at a ridiculous multiple, and Intel's growth doesn't seem to be slowing down.\n\nYour analysis seems very lazy to me.",

        "body": "Which is more or less my point... if the \"P/E is low because the potential for growth is low\" then everyone is already assuming Intel's not doing a great job. And if that's the case shorting it now may lead nowhere.\n\nWe're not talking about NVDA with a P/E of 60+ or AMD with a P/E of 100+. Those are priced for perfection. We're talking about a company that had a great lead for a long time and is now selling at 11 times earnings. Sure, the earnings may drop, but will the price drop accordingly? Or will it just adjust to a slightly higher P/E? Look at JNJ, for instance, it has a P/E of 23 right now.\n\nI think we all agree that Intel is not going to disappear (as a company). Their prices will have to come down given their current position with respect to competitors, but they will adjust and survive. And if the price drops some 20 or 30% (which would give you a decent gain if you're shorting it) it just starts making sense to buy it for the dividend and the low P/E for a decent blue chip.\n\nSo, I'm by no means telling you you shouldn't short it. Go ahead, I'll be happy to be proven wrong. I just think it's not as clear cut a case for shorting than say ZM.",

There's nothing in the near term that would force a collapse or downsizing of that business. People got burned hard on Tesla even with the looming possibility of bankruptcy, which doesn't exist here.\n\nManufacturing their own products is the only way forward for them. Intel has been the #1 or #2 semiconductor manufacturer since 1995, no other company could handle that demand and they've generally been rewarded with a very high gross margin relative to competitors. Their biggest risk moving forward is having to adjust their margins down to meet competitors which is a quick adjustment to make and isn't going to collapse a business.\n\n**tl;dr - If you think they're set for a decline for this reason I would just avoid investing in them, but going short is maybe one of the dumbest things I've read today and I regularly surf WSB.**",
