Pretty much every country's military runs windows.\n\nJust listened to the q3 earnings call. Cloud demand is up like crazy right now. So, money is being shifted away from local resources into cloud computing resources. So many of AWS and Azure customers are shifting money into these tech companies. Smaller firms like NetApp, Atlassian, or Slack are seeing sales raise with this new demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, there are entirely new markets for tech that weren't viable pre covid. Consider the NFL, NBA....I can't remember the sport, but they now use MSTeams. Companies are seeing the cost benefits of remote work. Virtual Formula 1 is another example. Things are going to be interesting. To stay competitive, you will need to piviot into this new economic situation. Red Robin is an interesting case study. They cut costs like crazy and embraced off site orders. Or look at Trupanion's 10K. They cut costs and increased cash on hand to a point where they can operate for an entire year w/o income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to remember that there are millions of dollars worth of human intelligence driving the decisions behind each of these Tickers. Boards are made up of people with way way way way more industry knowledge than anyone on reddit. Yes, Tesla exists, and a tweet can swing billions of dollars around the moon, but for the most part, companies are ran by intelligent folks trying their best to make money. That's it. Even if the world is on fire, these people will find a way to sell you insurance on credit. The economy has existed since before the old testament. Exodus 30:11-16  is just ancient hebrew tax law. Even if it's not money, people will find something to trade to create value. The wheel keeps on turning.\n\nEDIT: Totally forgot, look at MSFT 10K. B2B OEM sales are the bread and butter. So you will need to see large retailers (including amazon) collapse before companies like intel and MSFT will feel the big hits.",

In fact, I would say that NVDA and AMD are far more analogous to each other than even AMD -&gt; AAPL, and certainly to MSFT. The  way that I see it, NVDA/AMD are fundamentally companies that are concerned with producing a *physical good* \\- literal chipsets and dies. AAPL seems to waver on the hardware side of things (they have been known to go proprietary in that arena, but have also loaned out work to INTC on more than one occasion). I most certainly see MSFT as a true software/PaaS/SaaS company - suffice to say that they are producing very little in the way of physical goods.\n\nI think the *soft/hardware* direction is important to mention, because that fundamentally plays into the way that these companies deal in the market. Developing hardware is a mind-bendingly expensive process (relatively speaking). It takes years of R&amp;D and cash on hand to fund something that is truly great. An example of this would be the move AMD made to Zen (which is based on the concept of 'chiplets'; highly-scalable many-core designs that are fundamentally different from their monolithic predecessors).\n\nIn terms of growth, I would have to say that I see two viable options here: *NVDA and MSFT*. MSFT is pretty easy to explain; they create a product that fundamentally has lower upstart costs (software development's most expensive attribute is the cost of human labor) and lower maintenance costs (I would think). There is some movement towards a more data-center driven profit scheme (which would require boots on ground hardware en masse), and Azure is certainly an AWS competitor, but I think we've yet to see them really go full throttle on that (I think it could be big if they did).\n\nNVDA is a leader from a technological perspective. GPU compute-cores are very specialized devices that are good at doing only a few things, but very, *very well.* NVDA has been hammering away at this technology for years - they know the game, and they know where the money is. Autonomous cars, drones...the computer viz recogition software for postal, for literally anything, runs on a platform that is fundamentally a GPU (very high level view here). Machine learning applications in this field at the data-center level (think machine learning on AWS) are absolutely dominated by NVDA; In fact I would go as far as to say there aren't really a lot of competitors out there that are bringing to the table what NVDA does (Honestly AMD has severely gimped even their consumer dies at this point).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can elaborate more, but I'd go with MSFT and NVDA on this one.",

Decrease is only in the short term with possible recession and people being more money concious.\n\n&gt;Intel will catch up to AMD use on 7nm by end of 2020 and yes 7nm = 10nm. If use density metrics, Intel\u2019s 10 nm is superior to AMD\u2019s 7 nm. If you use TSMC\u2019s marketing lingo, their process will be small as an atom in 5 years, then what???\n\nIntel will not be on 7nm by the end of this year. Ice Lake JUST came out and it's only 10nm. They can't even make desktop/server 10nm yet; check out the new 10th gen desktop procs (Comet Lake is still 14nm). AMD Zen 3 is probably going to come out right ask Intel get their 10nm desktop/server chips going.\n\nRegarding TSMCs 5nm (or 7nm EVU, however you want to call it), they've been working with Apple to use it on the next iPhone since January. That tech is pretty much confirmed and good to go, unlike anything on Intel's side.\n\n&gt;AMD\u2019s margin is a lot smaller than Intel and contrary to people\u2019s belief that Intel is discounting to be competitive with AMD, their financial and especially their gross margin does not reflect that.\n\nAMD's margins are HUGE now, since they've moved everything to 7nm chiplet with a 12nm I/O die. They have a product stack that utilizes every single \"waste\" product to maximize production yield. They don't have to manufacture these huge dies with a bunch of cores anymore, since everything is based around dual, 4-core CCXs. All TSMC does is make tons of the same chip.\n\nActual yields are AMD at around 70% and Intel at around 35% (for their server stuff), and obviously not good enough to use on their consumer products.",

I  can replace my ryzen 5 2900 with a much newer ryzen 5 CPU and not have to change out my motherboard. \n\nA good friend of mine orders servers for a large data center \"DOD centered but has a small consumer facing g side\" and would typically order 200-300k worth of servers every year all with intel cpus. As of last year he is ordering amd. The cloud sector is key because they spend money not even batting a eye at it. \n\nMy guess is amd $100 by 2023.
