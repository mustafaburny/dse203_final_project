        "body": "SoftBank Nears $40 Billion Deal to Sell Arm Holdings to Nvidia\n\nUnion of Arm, Nvidia would create a powerhouse in the chip industry\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank recently has been involved in a series of big asset sales after being under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. 9984 1.03% is nearing a deal to sell British chip designer Arm Holdings to Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said \u2014 assuming it isn\u2019t derailed at the last minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world\u2019s smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics\u2014and play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year\u2019s biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm\u2019s customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals. Most or all of that is already under way or completed and its shares are up more than 20% this year. Among the sales: big chunks of its holdings in China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and T-Mobile US Inc. following the wireless provider\u2019s merger with Sprint Corp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank has also purchased options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks this year. The sheer size of the bet has had an outsize effect on the overall stock market, driving prices higher, the Journal has reported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt SoftBank, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been working with a small team to negotiate the Arm deal including the chief executive of the chip company, Simon Segars, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, as well as Rajeev Misra, CEO of the firm\u2019s giant Vision Fund, and Akshay Naheta, another executive at the fund.",

This is pretty evident given the fact that once Intel sort out their process they'll abandon TSMC and go back to in house manufacturing only, meaning TSMC's long term interests are aligned with ensuring AMD sees long term growth over Intel. From the comments TSMC management has made over the past few years and the execution of their business plans, I believe that TSMC management is focused more on long term value generation than short term profit, meaning your scenario wouldn't be likely to occur.",

I myself am bullish on FDX staying propped up by institutional money to balance out all the gamblers, but not \u201c20%-run-within 10-days bullish\u201d and considering the frenzy at open, this far otm isn\u2019t gonna qualify as an IV play either. \n\nPlus I\u2019d probably be actually more bullish on the intc calls you already have that are close to the money anyway. \n\nBut then again all my information comes from like 8 minutes of a YouTube video I watched last week so whatever man...\n\nYOLO.",

Some undervalued tech wont be as affected and will continue upward movement(see INTC) and some relative strength will remain in the sector. But expect more bleeding from the ones that had yuge run ups (ZM)\n\nNext leg up will be fueled by recovery plays to build on top of the already strong tech sector.  The vaccine is coming whether you like it or not. Put your political b.s. aside.  This is going to be a green light for getting covid impacted businesses going again at almost 100%. Again, just because you dont like Trump isnt a good counter argument.  Get over it.  Position yourselves accordingly; things like (good)airlines, cruise lines, retail, restaurants, DIS...  might even add in financials\n\nPersonally, I'll be leaving a little bit of reserves to savagely go balls deep into Palantir when they do their ipo later this month.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk",

They stand to gain the most of anyone on earth.   \n\n\nSuddenly if you want their datacenter grade GPUS (they limit industry use GPUS and APUS) you have to use ARM as they only make drivers for ARM for those GPU.\n\n  \nThen suddenly, just maybe, they plan to stop supporting x86\\_64 completely, and develop something not unlike risc-v with the previous ARM team behind it. They now have a proprietary chip with none of the backwards compatability slow downs that come with Intel based chips. (they hold backwards compatible registers going back to the 1970s, taking up valuable die space).   \n\n\nSuddenly RISC might be able to leverage it's benefits to become CRISC-V with that kind of backing, and since RISC is always clock cycle fast, x86 will literally die when CRISC-V comes (multiple RISC executions per clock cycle, a complex reduced instruction set computer).   \n\n\nThat's it. That's game over. One architecture ecosystem",

So per core they are doing better and also more gpu speed / cores.   They sacrificed cores for that, hence the lower multithreaded.  I'd guess intel figures most people using thin and light notebooks don't really need 8 cores and would rather have more GPU., probably a good tradeoff for most people\n\nThere will eventually be a tigerlake - H is rumored to actually have less GPU onboard than tigerlake-u since I guess its assumed those will use discrete graphics anyway.  So Intel probably will sell a lot of tigerlake.  It shouldn't really lose much ground on laptops if any in the next year or 2.  I do own a lot of intel shares, and fully expect it to get back to $60 ish in the next 3-6 months.  There is actually a shortage of laptops / chromebooks right now because of the wfh / school from home thing even for the older cpus so Intel should do allright",
