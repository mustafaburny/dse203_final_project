Haven't you seen (as I have countless times) when mediocre software either wins the market, or wins on the stock market?  I won't even bother to list all the examples where the junkier option took over.  \n\nEverything you say about Palantir's offering could be technically correct, but then not matter when customers flock to it anyway.  Salesforce is rudimentary and mediocre.  And they also do $10 billion per quarter and rising.  \n\nYou mention that Palantir hasn't electrified the whole world in 20 years, so why would they now?  That's flawed (and not accurate in terms of years).   For their 17 years, broad market appeal wasn't the mission, so the fact it didn't happen doesn't necessarily mean much.\n\nNow that is beginning to be the mission, you can start the timer and break out the measuring stick.  What we've seen so far is some fairly strong interest from all kinds of private and public organizations.  What remains to be seen if it continues to ramp, of if this is just some initial fascination that goes away.",

It got me thinking about the CRM market and the HubSpot vs. Salesforce dynamic, and I don't think DigitalOcean's position is dissimilar to that of HubSpot's. \n\nAt face value, the CRM market is dominated by a few heavy hitters and is intimidating to enter, but even SFDC only has &lt;25% market share, and HubSpot -- despite a significant disadvantage in resources and experience -- has been able to consistently out-execute SFDC in the SMB space over the past few years due -- in my opinion -- to 1) strong community / brand loyalty, 2) simplifying what has traditionally been a complex type of software, and 3) a significantly lower total cost of ownership than 'enterprise-grade' competitors. \n\nAlso -- on an anecdotal level -- I work in the iPaaS space, which gives me a lot of exposure to enterprise software trends (which is why I'm very bullish on Snowflake, despite analysts claiming it is still overvalued), and there's a lot of folks at SMBs that are salty about AWS's complexity and unpredictable TCO. Certainly coming across a lot of Azure, but that's more so due to Microsoft's ability to sell the 'side of fries' with the Office/Dynamics, than it being a superior to AWS. \n\nFrom an addressable market standpoint, many companies -- regardless of industry/size -- are 'tech companies'... they just don't know it yet. They need to embrace technology in order to compete / differentiate / scale effectively, or they won't be in business ten years from now. I firmly believe we're only scraping the tip of the iceberg with SMBs today.\n\nThat's all to say, I think there's a massive opportunity here for DigitalOcean to carve-out a sizable niche in SMB.",

Permanent workflows are forming around this trend.\n\nA case can be made in favor of a large productivity increase from work @ home + by polling data workers enjoy it more (obviously).\n\nAll of this makes me believe Salesforce will receive a vastly quicker return on investment on Slack than the market assumes. On top of this, Salesforce is combining their other cloud tools (including Tableau, leading data analytics tool) into Slack.\n\nSalesforce is trading at a lower valuation gap compared to it's competition, despite being better positioned in the wider long-term economy due to Slack.\n\nSalesforce has unrecognized blue-chip potential over the long term, and is building an undervalued economic moat by building a cloud platform on top of Slack to leverage into the \"new normal\" of work-from-home.\n\nPosition: Shares and Nov. 19th call options @$310",

        "body": "So my general rule of thumb wrt individual tickers: if reddit is saying buy, sell (and vice versa). \n\nGenerally this is because the reddit-version of analyzing companies is largely based on positive anecdotal experience, the userbase is a big fan of said product (and routinely shits on the direct competitor - e.g. AMD vs Intel), and Streisand-effect of seeing said ticker mentioned all over reddit, reinforcing the buy decision (everybody is saying \"buy\"...how could they be wrong?)\n\nSo, that all being said, I suspect the $HOOD sentiments of it being a shit investment are based on (1) bitter stonktards trying to attach their plucky underdog narrative to a new strawman instead of (b) the underlying go forward cash flow and risk fundamentals, and viewing $HOOD's valuation as a function of it's current cash flow profile and forecasted growth profile (rather than trying overlay some \"US vs Them\" narrative that is insulated within reddit and isn't a material worry or even acknowledged within the professional investing and markets community)\n\n**Investment Case for $HOOD** *(Objective Investor with No Axe to Grind Version)*\n\n* [CFOps for 2019A and 2020A of $1.3bn and $1.9bn, respectively](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021013318/1?cik=1783879&amp;hl=1029792:1029853&amp;hl_id=4y1ue2mjo) - hm for a company that is so shittily run, they sure have been generating a fuck ton of cash flow organically. Imagine that this has the added bonus of dividends to investors, despite being publicly traded for less than a month.\n* [Modest capex spend in their S-1; immediate FCF generation](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021013318/1?cik=1783879&amp;hl=1029918:1029933&amp;hl_id=4yjqwnqyi) - capital light business that is shitting free cash flow L2Y. Help me understand why RH is such a shit investment again?\n\n* Cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, and other logical fallacies that /r/investing and /r/stocks are ***ridiculously*** susceptible to (me speculating here) - most $HOOD bears arrive at their thesis from extrapolating personal experience over RH's entire user base\n * e.g. - reddit incorrectly assumes the RH the user base consists of day traders looking to profit off of short term price movements that are based off of what the billions of other public capital market participants are going to do in the immediate term.....rather than making buy/sell decisions based off of firm-specific and macro fundamentals. \n * The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of investors see brokerages as offering a commoditized service where you're offering the same service at the lowest cost. **The smart money** sees RH for what it is: a brokerage that charges me $0 in fees and is awarding me free yield. Why tf would I trade away additional return in the form of lower fees relative to what another brokerage would charge me? \n\nSo, again, I'm open to hearing a rational bear case on RH or any sort of pervasive, idiosyncratic risk associated with the ticker that isn't being properly reflect in the current share price.",

It's in a pretty similar boat as Intel. Both of them are quite legacy but up until a decade ago people would have said similar about MSFT. \n\nI'm not invested in it outside of indexes, but I'd still feel more comfortable with it over a moonshot like PLTR or whatever meme stock people are pumping lately.",

        "body": "I have mixed feeling on selling prior to earnings. Beucase of exactly what happened. If youre buying weekly options then yeah, youre playing with fire holding options through earnings. But if you have options contracts that has a lot of time left after the earnings call then you have time to recover. If your options contracts has months left until expiration then holding through earnings is not going to hurt you too bad. I bought calls on AMD at the end of June and they were down 50-80% leading up to earnings. I have been slowly (maybe prematurely) selling my calls all for profits of 150-300%. My calls expired in September, November, and December. I like to stagger mine. \n\nWith that being said, I think people grossly missunderstood the position AMD is in. The signs were all there. Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely.",

The biggest thing TSMC did to get the upper hand over Intel was order a shit ton of ASML EUV photolithography tools early on. ASML took years to fill those contracts due to how complex their production is (these tools cost ~$100M each). I didn't directly work on the EUV tool, but saw the effects first hand of how Intel's first EUV tool streamlined several difficult manufacturing steps in our 7nm technology. But we couldn't get enough of them in time. Before this the companies were close on process technology; Intel was maybe even slightly ahead. Whether this persists once Intel's orders with ASML can be filled remains to be seen.\n\nAn interesting development is the Japanese semiconductor manufacturing tool companies (e.g., Nikon, Canon, TEL) have EUV tools coming soon. If only I knew which of these might follow an ASML like trajectory  in the markets.",
