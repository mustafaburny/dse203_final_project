Their products are made to scale with massive infrastructure services, and trump many other players in the game.  They don't have overwhelming market share because of their cost.\n\nGartner is a research firm, and while they are not the end all say in things, here is a good example of where technologies lie for the Network Firewall category. (note, linked from Fortinet site because gartner charges for this info directly from their site)\n\n2019 - \n\n[https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/gartner-network-firewalls](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/gartner-network-firewalls) \n\nI'm certain that both companies are winners, as they are both towards the top of their market.\n\nFrom purely a technology standpoint, I would vote Palo right now, the massive players in the game are more likely to use their products over Fortinet, and with everything that has been going on this year, technology is on top and expanding exponentially - though I can't speculate from a financial standpoint.",

Having these 4 large entries on their side should help them grow even further for many years. \nCrowdStrike like you mentioned is the youngest company for all 3 but disrupting the industry. I don\u2019t know a lot about this company but I keep hearing more and more about it (especially from Jim Cramer). Virgin, Mercedes, Goldman Sachs, Sony, ADP are among their clients which is very impressive considering how long they have been around. \nAll 3 companies have its own strengths and weaknesses and room to grow.

Crowdstrike will likely end up the same, but I suppose some money could be made if you hold shares when they get acquired.  Hopefully before some other hot new endpoint solution comes along and passes them up.\n\nI think Zscaler is better.  It's true \"cloud security\" which is what you are looking for.  But I personally would just invest in Palo Alto Networks or Fortinet.  While not traditionally \"cloud security\", they are buying up all the good cloud solutions and will be the strongest cybersecurity plays for years to come.",

The fact that Palo Alto provides advanced protection for consistent security across all major clouds (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud) makes me believe they know what they doing. Are you personally invested in any of the cybersecurity stocks? What is your opinion on CrowdStrike as a long term play?

Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.\n\nDivesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP\u2019s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom &amp; will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.\n\nMain downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this &amp; the sky didn't fall.\n\nTLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP",

Look at who their CTO is if you're looking for technical competence.\n\nAMD isn't doing well because Lisu Su somehow engineered a better processor on her own and by far her personal contributions to really improving the company's fundamentals were in pushing the company into the game console market, amending the wafer supply agreement and putting a much needed axe in the Bulldozer line of processors in favor of a new architecture.  I'm sure she's a great engineer too, but that's not the job she was hired for when she was appointed CEO.  She's made great decisions as a CEO, but this whole idea there's any kind of 'wizard' out there is just wrong.\n\nIntel's problem is their fabs and no 'wizard' is going to fix that.  These are extremely complex and expensive processes that take years to set up and are not easily changed or fixed.  That's a big part of why Intel has basically given up on their 10nm process at this point and is focused on their 7nm node.  If you build something that involved and complex that's fundamentally flawed you can't just turn it around and make it work.  Intel's literally been trying for years here and that more than anything else is what's contributed to AMD's meteoric rise.",
