Truly revolutionized the world as we know it today. \n\nYour consultant is right. Who know's whats going to happen short term. They are getting a lot of competition now in the EC market and it could make the share price drop like a stone once an affordable solution is presented. \n\nThat doesn't really matter though. Wait until one of Tesla's engineers invent something like Nylon, Gorilla Glass, or MRI machine. Those are going to be the life blood of the company. It will happen. They just reinvented the battery. Think of all the uses for that technology outside of a vehicle. \n\nJust my thoughts on it.",

By looking at the overall profitability? Sure, AWS has a much higher profit margin but that doesn't say anything about whether or not they are subsidizing products on retail. Amazon e-commerce, by design, is reinvesting all the cash back into the business for top-line growth. E-commerce divison itself has so many other businesses within it - profits from TV could be subsidizing shoes or phone cables. We only see the overall profits of the _entire_ e-commerce divison.  Also, the marketplace division is significant chunk of the e-commerce revenue (Amazon only counts the fees they charge 3rd parties as revenue). Profit margins for those will be a lot better than that of the first-party retail business as Amazon doesn't have to carry inventory at all. Also, advertising is another fast growing segment with higher profit-margins.I am not sure if we have enough data to make any comment regarding who is subsidizing what.\n\nAlso, AWS itself faces very serious competition from Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle etc They are releasing a tonne of new features every year. Why will they not want use the cash from AWS for growing AWS but subsidize toilet-paper? Seems odd to me.\n\nFrom what I understand the profitability of AWS is providing a cover for Amazon from a Wall Street standpoint - \"Here have some profits, let us concentrate on growth.\"\n\nI also don't see how breaking up Amazon into AWS and E-commerce creates room for additional innovation. There is very serious competition for both the businesses.",

        "body": "Absolutely brilliant write up. Tech equities became really expensive and I was looking for some value alternatives in tech sector as well. HPE definitely stood out but initially I was quite skeptical as I thought this would be company that sells servers or networking equipment. Upon investigating it I'm super intrigued and will open position next week.  \n\nI love that they detached from legacy PC and printers business, I love that early on they spun off their services &amp; consulting business, I love that they offloaded their legacy software business to Micro Focus (poor guys are struggling to sell it now) and I love that they are not competing with Azure or AWS but instead specialise in their own niche. I think that HPE's hybrid cloud solution is probably the best offering in industry right now. IBM, AWS and Google Cloud offer hybrid solutions but it looks like they are very nascent offerings compared to HPE's.\n\nI also love acquisitions they been making. Like you mentioned Silver Peak and Cray (which were very smart acquisitions) but also BlueData (AI &amp; big data analysis), Plexxi (hybrid networking) and others.\n\nAlso, their focus on the edge and hybrid seems to be very well timed. Edge computing is still in its early stages but will undoubtedly expand in the future. A lot of people talk about hybrid as stepping stone for legacy infrastructures which is true. However, with data privacy and data security regulations becoming stricter hybrid will become way more than just stepping stone to full cloud. In Europe it already matters great deal where are you servers located and who can access them.\n\nFinally, HPE feels like it could be story similar to Microsoft. That is, Microsoft was perceived as this legacy, stagnant organization and it was trading at price reflecting that sentiment. Until their cloud offering changed everything. If all goes well with HPE it could be very similar story and brilliant entry point right now.\n\nP.S.\n\nSpeaking of undervalued tech equities. Do you have any thoughts on Seagate? They are trading at quite low multiples and with growing cloud, data storage will have to grow too. On the  other hand HDDs are legacy hardware and they are not very strong at making SSDs yet.",

I made a DD for myself and made a brief summary around April. Most of it is based on their 10-K last year and their first 10-Q of the year. The key here is that this has been seen as a dinosaur for the past decade, due to lack of innovation, terrible management decisions (crazy high EPS and a buyback program that should have been cut long ago), and recruiting issues. A new CEO (Arvind Krishna) and a switch to the cloud (and quantum computing for the 2030s at least) are the key changes that could drive change. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit messy, was not meant to be posted when I wrote it : \n\nIBM : New CEO Arvid Krishna has my trust, hope he will change top and mid tier management (which did weird accounting tricks like the pseudo Lenovo \u00ab\u00a0sale/buy\u00a0\u00bb, laid off workforce for no reason, did not R&amp;D enough, focused on business services and consulting too much, had the crazy 20$ EPS goal, etc\u2026). Krishna pushed Red Hat acquisition (open source enterprise software, will allow them to become hybrid cloud providers, hybrid cloud is interoperable (BFF example), scalable (ERP switch to 3rd parties), portable, and secure (user data still in private cloud)). Krishna was senior VP for cloud and cognitive software. \nIBM has switched industries several times throughout its life : time clocks, then tabulating machine, then typewriter, then mainframe (good changes), then personal computers (good initially but then poor because used competitors\u2019 chips), etc\u2026 Cloud/AI could be their next successful switch (1/3rd of revenue in 2019, still increasing). Quantum Computing too, as they\u2019ve strongly positioned themselves as industry leaders, but that\u2019s in the very, very long run.\nWhile not the most important aspect, company is a dividend aristocrat (increasing div payout for 25 years), but what matters is that div payment was never removed, even though I think it should have been decreased during the struggles of the 2010s and instead reinvested in R&amp;D, they should have also paused their share buyback program. Financials : P/E around 10 (very good for a tech company), P/BV is 5.5 (good for a tech company, especially one transitioning to less tangible assets), net income slowly increasing, current ratio of nearly 1 at end of 03/31 which is decent given Red Hat acquisition and coronavirus, D/E is 2.62 (that one is indeed bad, but they got cash I guess, still not great).",

        "body": "Bit of a personal anecdote here:\n\nSo I have a degree in IT with a focus on Computer Networking.\n\nI once interviewed for IBM because they had positions open for Network Admins.  Unfortunately, when I sat down and looked over their list of jobs I discovered that they were only looking for senior level positions (something they did not mention in the email they sent to my university).\n\nI decided to interview anyway because I was already there in suit and tie so I wasn't about to get all dressed up for nothing.\n\nThe interview went well, but the guy told me he just didn't have anything for me at the time.\n\nI decided to walk around afterwards and saw a guy interviewing for entry level programmers.  My campus did not offer a Software degree (they offered it at a different campus), but I did have to take 9 credits in basic programming which was Java, C++, and HTML.  I had already taken the Java and C++ classes.\n\nI sit down with the guy and we get to talking.\n\nHe asks my background in coding.  I tell him one intro in Java and C++ so far.\n\nHe asks why am I interviewing if my degree is not focused on coding.  I tell him because those two classes opened my eyes to something that I didn't even know I wanted before.  I love creating stuff with code, I find it cathartic to sit and stare at code, getting lost in it while trying to figure out where my errors are, the absolute joy of finally getting it to compile and run.  I even started to make some basic programs at home in my free time.\n\nHe asks me if I have any of my work to show him.  I did not bring any copies of my code because I wasn't even thinking about the possibility of interviewing for any other positions (let this be a lesson to anyone who's still getting their degree, bring everything!).\n\nI tell him I did have it on a thumb drive that I carry around in my briefcase, but of course he waves his hand and says that's a security issue (totally agreed).\n\nHe asks me what a function is.  I draw a blank.  I ended up stammering out something like, \"it's the part of the code that does stuff\".  Not necessarily wrong, but more of an ELI5 definition.\n\nHe shows me some code and asks what I can decipher from it.  It's a function that takes a variable, runs it through a formula, returns a variable, and then loops 4 more times using the new return variable each time, and finally shows a set of the return variables at the print out.  He confirmed that I was right.\n\nHe asks me what that sets of numbers is called.  Obviously it's an array, and I had heard the term before, but again I did not know at the time.  He frowns and says something along the lines of, \"You really don't know basic terminology.  You should work on that.\"\n\nWe shook hands and parted ways, never got a call back.  Now, I know I messed up by not having some of my work printed out, and not being up on the terminology.  But it really rubbed me raw that this guy was so hung up on terminology, knowing that coding was like 5% of my entire degree, and yet I still had a basic working knowledge of programming to at least be able to read and understand what was going on, and that I was passionate enough about it to go home and write some basic programs of my own.\n\nNow I don't know that the lack of terminology was the ultimate reason I was turned down.  I do know that they were looking to start up a class that would take about 3 years to go through, and they were going to teach a proprietary language that was similar to Java.  Obviously, the terminology would have been brought up again multiple times in that 3 year program.  The only clue I had for why I was turned down was the lack of lingo.\n\nI am now a manager at a FinTech company, and I don't ask \"lingo\" questions of interviewees.  I want to know if they understand the meat and potatoes of what the job entails because, to me, that means so much more.  Lingo will happen over time as they do the job.\n\nI'm not saying that is all the OP was concerned about in their interviews, but they certainly seem to think it's a flaw in an interviewee that makes them unsuitable for hiring.",

Raytracing will probably become industry standard sooner or later and supported across either platform. DLSS is something AMD or any other company with a bunch of ML engineers and money can replicate given some time. \n\nIt's not impossible for other companies to replicate or immitate or substitute some of those technologies / products. AMD is certainly catching up and will carve off some fractions of the market in the AI/ML &amp; datacenter businesses.\n\nThe ARM acquisition, if it happens, will confer a competitive advantage like no other. As an NVDA stockholder I wish this happens. As a Brit working in and loving tech, I am slowly dying on the inside... \n\nSomething to remember is that this is a fast expanding market and not a saturated one, there's room for multiple players to grow and win at the same time. \n\nThat being said, I still think Intel will likely be the next IBM. Is it gonna tank overnight? No, and there will probably be plenty of rallies to make money off, but long term I wouldn't look to hold.",

By looking at the overall profitability? Sure, AWS has a much higher profit margin but that doesn't say anything about whether or not they are subsidizing products on retail. Amazon e-commerce, by design, is reinvesting all the cash back into the business for top-line growth. E-commerce divison itself has so many other businesses within it - profits from TV could be subsidizing shoes or phone cables. We only see the overall profits of the _entire_ e-commerce divison.  Also, the marketplace division is significant chunk of the e-commerce revenue (Amazon only counts the fees they charge 3rd parties as revenue). Profit margins for those will be a lot better than that of the first-party retail business as Amazon doesn't have to carry inventory at all. Also, advertising is another fast growing segment with higher profit-margins.I am not sure if we have enough data to make any comment regarding who is subsidizing what.\n\nAlso, AWS itself faces very serious competition from Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle etc They are releasing a tonne of new features every year. Why will they not want use the cash from AWS for growing AWS but subsidize toilet-paper? Seems odd to me.\n\nFrom what I understand the profitability of AWS is providing a cover for Amazon from a Wall Street standpoint - \"Here have some profits, let us concentrate on growth.\"\n\nI also don't see how breaking up Amazon into AWS and E-commerce creates room for additional innovation. There is very serious competition for both the businesses.",

        "body": "Absolutely brilliant write up. Tech equities became really expensive and I was looking for some value alternatives in tech sector as well. HPE definitely stood out but initially I was quite skeptical as I thought this would be company that sells servers or networking equipment. Upon investigating it I'm super intrigued and will open position next week.  \n\nI love that they detached from legacy PC and printers business, I love that early on they spun off their services &amp; consulting business, I love that they offloaded their legacy software business to Micro Focus (poor guys are struggling to sell it now) and I love that they are not competing with Azure or AWS but instead specialise in their own niche. I think that HPE's hybrid cloud solution is probably the best offering in industry right now. IBM, AWS and Google Cloud offer hybrid solutions but it looks like they are very nascent offerings compared to HPE's.\n\nI also love acquisitions they been making. Like you mentioned Silver Peak and Cray (which were very smart acquisitions) but also BlueData (AI &amp; big data analysis), Plexxi (hybrid networking) and others.\n\nAlso, their focus on the edge and hybrid seems to be very well timed. Edge computing is still in its early stages but will undoubtedly expand in the future. A lot of people talk about hybrid as stepping stone for legacy infrastructures which is true. However, with data privacy and data security regulations becoming stricter hybrid will become way more than just stepping stone to full cloud. In Europe it already matters great deal where are you servers located and who can access them.\n\nFinally, HPE feels like it could be story similar to Microsoft. That is, Microsoft was perceived as this legacy, stagnant organization and it was trading at price reflecting that sentiment. Until their cloud offering changed everything. If all goes well with HPE it could be very similar story and brilliant entry point right now.\n\nP.S.\n\nSpeaking of undervalued tech equities. Do you have any thoughts on Seagate? They are trading at quite low multiples and with growing cloud, data storage will have to grow too. On the  other hand HDDs are legacy hardware and they are not very strong at making SSDs yet.",

        "body": "I bought some stock on June 1st, not the best day price wise but it\u2019s the stock I plan to hold the longest out of my whole portfolio, except for MSFT maybe. I made a DD for myself and made a brief summary around April. Most of it is based on their 10-K last year and their first 10-Q of the year. The key here is that this has been seen as a dinosaur for the past decade, due to lack of innovation, terrible management decisions (crazy high EPS and a buyback program that should have been cut long ago), and recruiting issues. A new CEO (Arvind Krishna) and a switch to the cloud (and quantum computing for the 2030s at least) are the key changes that could drive change. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit messy, was not meant to be posted when I wrote it : \n\nIBM : New CEO Arvid Krishna has my trust, hope he will change top and mid tier management (which did weird accounting tricks like the pseudo Lenovo \u00ab\u00a0sale/buy\u00a0\u00bb, laid off workforce for no reason, did not R&amp;D enough, focused on business services and consulting too much, had the crazy 20$ EPS goal, etc\u2026). Krishna pushed Red Hat acquisition (open source enterprise software, will allow them to become hybrid cloud providers, hybrid cloud is interoperable (BFF example), scalable (ERP switch to 3rd parties), portable, and secure (user data still in private cloud)). Krishna was senior VP for cloud and cognitive software. \nIBM has switched industries several times throughout its life : time clocks, then tabulating machine, then typewriter, then mainframe (good changes), then personal computers (good initially but then poor because used competitors\u2019 chips), etc\u2026 Cloud/AI could be their next successful switch (1/3rd of revenue in 2019, still increasing). Quantum Computing too, as they\u2019ve strongly positioned themselves as industry leaders, but that\u2019s in the very, very long run.\nWhile not the most important aspect, company is a dividend aristocrat (increasing div payout for 25 years), but what matters is that div payment was never removed, even though I think it should have been decreased during the struggles of the 2010s and instead reinvested in R&amp;D, they should have also paused their share buyback program. Financials : P/E around 10 (very good for a tech company), P/BV is 5.5 (good for a tech company, especially one transitioning to less tangible assets), net income slowly increasing, current ratio of nearly 1 at end of 03/31 which is decent given Red Hat acquisition and coronavirus, D/E is 2.62 (that one is indeed bad, but they got cash I guess, still not great).",

        "body": "Bit of a personal anecdote here:\n\nSo I have a degree in IT with a focus on Computer Networking.\n\nI once interviewed for IBM because they had positions open for Network Admins.  Unfortunately, when I sat down and looked over their list of jobs I discovered that they were only looking for senior level positions (something they did not mention in the email they sent to my university).\n\nI decided to interview anyway because I was already there in suit and tie so I wasn't about to get all dressed up for nothing.\n\nThe interview went well, but the guy told me he just didn't have anything for me at the time.\n\nI decided to walk around afterwards and saw a guy interviewing for entry level programmers.  My campus did not offer a Software degree (they offered it at a different campus), but I did have to take 9 credits in basic programming which was Java, C++, and HTML.  I had already taken the Java and C++ classes.\n\nI sit down with the guy and we get to talking.\n\nHe asks my background in coding.  I tell him one intro in Java and C++ so far.\n\nHe asks why am I interviewing if my degree is not focused on coding.  I tell him because those two classes opened my eyes to something that I didn't even know I wanted before.  I love creating stuff with code, I find it cathartic to sit and stare at code, getting lost in it while trying to figure out where my errors are, the absolute joy of finally getting it to compile and run.  I even started to make some basic programs at home in my free time.\n\nHe asks me if I have any of my work to show him.  I did not bring any copies of my code because I wasn't even thinking about the possibility of interviewing for any other positions (let this be a lesson to anyone who's still getting their degree, bring everything!).\n\nI tell him I did have it on a thumb drive that I carry around in my briefcase, but of course he waves his hand and says that's a security issue (totally agreed).\n\nHe asks me what a function is.  I draw a blank.  I ended up stammering out something like, \"it's the part of the code that does stuff\".  Not necessarily wrong, but more of an ELI5 definition.\n\nHe shows me some code and asks what I can decipher from it.  It's a function that takes a variable, runs it through a formula, returns a variable, and then loops 4 more times using the new return variable each time, and finally shows a set of the return variables at the print out.  He confirmed that I was right.\n\nHe asks me what that sets of numbers is called.  Obviously it's an array, and I had heard the term before, but again I did not know at the time.  He frowns and says something along the lines of, \"You really don't know basic terminology.  You should work on that.\"\n\nWe shook hands and parted ways, never got a call back.  Now, I know I messed up by not having some of my work printed out, and not being up on the terminology.  But it really rubbed me raw that this guy was so hung up on terminology, knowing that coding was like 5% of my entire degree, and yet I still had a basic working knowledge of programming to at least be able to read and understand what was going on, and that I was passionate enough about it to go home and write some basic programs of my own.\n\nNow I don't know that the lack of terminology was the ultimate reason I was turned down.  I do know that they were looking to start up a class that would take about 3 years to go through, and they were going to teach a proprietary language that was similar to Java.  Obviously, the terminology would have been brought up again multiple times in that 3 year program.  The only clue I had for why I was turned down was the lack of lingo.\n\nI am now a manager at a FinTech company, and I don't ask \"lingo\" questions of interviewees.  I want to know if they understand the meat and potatoes of what the job entails because, to me, that means so much more.  Lingo will happen over time as they do the job.\n\nI'm not saying that is all the OP was concerned about in their interviews, but they certainly seem to think it's a flaw in an interviewee that makes them unsuitable for hiring.",

AMD is certainly catching up and will carve off some fractions of the market in the AI/ML &amp; datacenter businesses.\n\nThe ARM acquisition, if it happens, will confer a competitive advantage like no other.

I know a lot of people who work there. They\u2019re not going to go under overnight and they don\u2019t ONLY sell chips. They\u2019ll pivot and react accordingly.
