These particular mutations are of a major concern because they likely (A) increase the virus's ability to evade vaccine and (B) increase transmissibiliy.\r  \n\r  \nThe belief is that these mutations ALL HAPPENED IN ONE HOST (which is nuts and scary but fucking Zoonotic diseases mutate faster than rabbits fuck so this shit is gonna happen). Covid in the past has shown strange mutogenic acceleration in AIDS patients, and they're thinking this Nu variant attained all of its mutations at once in an undiagnosed AIDS patient (which btw if there was any doubt left about Covid being a blood-borne illness....).\r  \n\r  \nDelta has been saving our asses for awhile but Nu may be an actual competitor. Delta spread from India to the entire planet in 2 weeks. The delta variant of covid is likely the most transmissible illness ever.\r  \n\r  \nIt is so transmissible that variant Mu and Lambda (for example) which had elevated mortality couldn't out-compete Delta to be the dominant strain. If you're vaxxed, Delta is pretty survivable. So its been keeping some of these other variants at bay for awhile.\r  \n\r  \nGiven the immediate market/medical community/travel responses to Nu, I'd say this variant has the best chance of overcoming delta in the coming weeks. The number of mutations are truly scary.\r  \n\r  \nThings to watch for to know if we're pretty fucked:\r  \n\r  \nHow fast is it? If three weeks go by and Nu doesn't yet have large numbers in the US and Europe, we may be good because Delta can still more easily find hosts. Given the number of mutations to the spike protein alone, I this might be a long shot at this point. But if 3 weeks go by and you haven't heard much about this, we may be gtg.\r  \n\r  \nHow are vaxxed people affected? If the spike proteins are different enough, Nu could bypass vaccination and infect vaccinated (and maybe even boosted people).\r  \n\r  \nIf neither of these things look ominous, terrific. But if the Nu variant is fast and bypasses immune responses coached by vaccines, the worst days of the pandemic may be coming this winter.\r  \n\r  \nI should probably put some cites on this shit but I'm lazy. Just google it, everything I wrote is correct.",

But I already had cash spread out in too many positions so I halved it and sold 50 calls. I sold the 50 calls first thing in the morning when MU was at 80 when I saw the 200%. If I held all 100 to closing on Friday, it would have been 5000 to 30,000 gain.\n\nThen there's SHOP, I also sold this during the morning pump. If I stayed for this one, I would have lost in the end as SHOP sank towards the end of the day. \n\nSo even with missed gains, it's always better to book profit because you really never know what will happen!",

You tell me how probable it is that they're undervalued.\n\nIt's much more likely to find mispriced companies if you look where fewer people are looking, e.g. in small/micro caps, foreign markets etc. Why do you think Mohnish Pabrai, one of the most relevant current value investors, isn't invested in any of these, but instead has the vast majority of his holdings (aside from Micron) in obscure foreign small caps?",

        "body": "Eh. Fine.\n\n1. Pat Gelsinger. Finally a hungry engineer is at the helm of Intel. A CEO that invests in the company's future rather than focus on stock price with dividends and buybacks.\n2. Bottleneck. Nvidia and AMD have the same bottleneck. Both have TSMC manufacture the chips for them. Any issue with TSMC and both of them will suffer.\n3. Apple and Intel are only two of the companies that have joined in as TSMC customers. This reduces the amount of chips TSMC can produce others, AKA Nvidia and AMD. Intel does not have this limitation as they produce only chips for the GPU at TSMC. Nvidia's crap GPU supply vs demand is just an example. What use is quality product if you fail to produce enough of it?\n4. Intel is making its first ever gaming GPU. Completely new market. Whether it is top tier GPU or an okay GPU, it doesn't matter. It is a brand new market and it will be taking market share from AMD and Nvidia. I don't have high expectations for this GPU even though I plan to buy it, but I am excited about Intel doing it.\n5. Intel is releasing Alder Lake now, AMD is due to release Ryzen 6000 in the second half of 2022 (maybe first  half, based on rumors). But right afterwards Intel is rumored to release Raptor Lake (rumored Q3). Intel is pushing full force to 5 CPUs in 4 years.\n6. EVs. Pat Gelsinger's view of the automotive market of the future is such that most of the vehicle cost would be the cost of the chips and as such he is maneuvering the giant to set foot into chip manufacturing for vehicles (part of the Irish plant will start producing car chips for other companies). I honestly can't even estimate how much money they can make from getting into\n7. Massive investments into fabs as chips demand will not go down but will only go up. Other than $20bil in the US, Intel also invests $95bil in fabs in Europe (With Germany, Italy and Spain trying to attract Intel).\n8. Yes, Intel is losing data center market share to AMD. But it also recently started cooperating with Google to produce data center chips that will become an industry standard.\n9. The biggest complaint about Intel's CPUs is their power consumption. Intel has a patent since 2020 to reduce the power consumption of their CPUs. It isn't used in Alder Lake, but rumored to perhaps be in Raptor Lake (gen 13) and reduce the CPU's power consumption by 25%.\n10. Raptor Lake will still support DDR4 so upgrading from Alder Lake will not require upgrading the motherboard as well. To me it is a symbol of change in Intel's mindset that what ever they throw the consumers will buy.\n11. Intel has been taking VPs and senior directors from AMD as well as other companies to to push further into gaming support and not just throw out a  GPU. Their goal is to support developers as much as possible.\n12. Mobileye. Mobileye already has robotaxis going around in different cities in the world (they have a driver just in case). In 2022 they are planned to add them in Berlin and Tel-Aviv as well.\n13. Insider activity. In the past 3 months 46k shares were bought more than sold, in the past 12 months the number is already at 201k more bought than sold. For Nvidia? 0 bought in the last 3 months and 314k sold. 1.272mil more sold in the last 12 months. AMD? 0 bought in the last 12 months. Not a single insider wanted to buy AMD shares in the last 12 months. 1mil shares were sold in the last 3 months alone, 2.97mil were sold in the last 12 months.\n14. To go up, Intel doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to not mess up. To go up AMD and Nvidia need to execute perfectly. One misstep by Nvidia and AMD and they will shed quite a of their value. I invested in Intel before Alder Lake was released, and I didn't have high hopes for it. I only hoped it will match Ryzen, was far from expecting it to bear Ryzen in Windows 10 as well. Imagine what will happen if Raptor Lake is released and it beats AMD's brand new CPU? Now imagine what happens if Raptor Lake doesn't beat it but isn't too far off from it while being cheaper (let's face it, Intel will always be cheaper)? Intel won't lose a lot if it doesn't beat the next AMD CPU, but AMD will lose massively if Intel does.\n\nPretty sure I could come up with more if I really try to.",

Not many of the basic electronic components everything else is built from are made in the US. American companies like Vishay, Microchip, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx either operate factories in China or contract foundries in China or Taiwan. Other large supplies of ours are not even American such as Yageo and TE Connectivity aren't even headquartered in the US and manufacturer the bulk of their product in their home country. It's been a big issue for my portion of the defense industry the past couple of years because these factories in China are also sourcing a large portion of counterfeit electronic components on the market.\n\nI know we're not the only defense manufacturer using Chinese components because I've seen several news articles and reports from the DOD claiming this is a problem.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/10/us-military-reliance-china-foreign-suppliers-expos/\n\nPanasonic and Murata (Japanese) used to produce critical components of our products, but have since stopped selling to us because they don't want their products used in munitions. When that happened the government fronted a lot of money to a couple American companies to produce an alternative since none existed.",
