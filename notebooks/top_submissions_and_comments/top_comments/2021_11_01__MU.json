These particular mutations are of a major concern because they likely (A) increase the virus's ability to evade vaccine and (B) increase transmissibiliy.\r  \n\r  \nThe belief is that these mutations ALL HAPPENED IN ONE HOST (which is nuts and scary but fucking Zoonotic diseases mutate faster than rabbits fuck so this shit is gonna happen). Covid in the past has shown strange mutogenic acceleration in AIDS patients, and they're thinking this Nu variant attained all of its mutations at once in an undiagnosed AIDS patient (which btw if there was any doubt left about Covid being a blood-borne illness....).\r  \n\r  \nDelta has been saving our asses for awhile but Nu may be an actual competitor. Delta spread from India to the entire planet in 2 weeks. The delta variant of covid is likely the most transmissible illness ever.\r  \n\r  \nIt is so transmissible that variant Mu and Lambda (for example) which had elevated mortality couldn't out-compete Delta to be the dominant strain. If you're vaxxed, Delta is pretty survivable. So its been keeping some of these other variants at bay for awhile.\r  \n\r  \nGiven the immediate market/medical community/travel responses to Nu, I'd say this variant has the best chance of overcoming delta in the coming weeks. The number of mutations are truly scary.\r  \n\r  \nThings to watch for to know if we're pretty fucked:\r  \n\r  \nHow fast is it? If three weeks go by and Nu doesn't yet have large numbers in the US and Europe, we may be good because Delta can still more easily find hosts. Given the number of mutations to the spike protein alone, I this might be a long shot at this point. But if 3 weeks go by and you haven't heard much about this, we may be gtg.\r  \n\r  \nHow are vaxxed people affected? If the spike proteins are different enough, Nu could bypass vaccination and infect vaccinated (and maybe even boosted people).\r  \n\r  \nIf neither of these things look ominous, terrific. But if the Nu variant is fast and bypasses immune responses coached by vaccines, the worst days of the pandemic may be coming this winter.\r  \n\r  \nI should probably put some cites on this shit but I'm lazy. Just google it, everything I wrote is correct.",

        "body": "Great article! Nvidia's sales have shown the sector to be far more resilient to rising costs and prices than anticipated, I think even surprising management themselves if the 10% hike in share price was anything to go off of. \n\nFull disclosure: I have the entirety of my retirement portfolio vested in ASML &amp; SOXX. \n\nA huge concern is government investment which has been put into consideration greatly by many of the giants such as ASML and TSMC, who would both benefit greatly from the supposed $50 Billion investment from Uncle Sam. Other nations around the world are looking to achieve tech sovereignty and are putting forth big bucks to make this happen, all of which will help offset the cost of production and manufacturing. ASML has a few slides about this in their investor presentation, but a really in-depth macro report was done by the Boston Consulting Group with the Semiconductor Industry Association - [you can read it all here](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BCG-x-SIA-Strengthening-the-Global-Semiconductor-Value-Chain-April-2021_1.pdf). \n\nAnother driver that will lower the impact of the rising costs is the semiconductor space race going on between all the massive names. There are record levels of private sector investments from the likes of Intel, Micron, Texas Instruments, etc in an effort to grab market share and secure deals as the consumer facing conglomerates such as Apple begin to consolidate their supply chain. Nvidia is wrangling with the ARM deal, and TSMC has been tasked with supplying Apple's next generation of chips, which is an insane feat given what was showed off in the new series of Macbooks. Intel is under new management and is fighting tooth and nail to get back in the race and into Apple's good graces. All of these events fit into the broader picture of the race to 3nm - 2nm chips as we close in on the twilight years of Moore's Law. \n\nPerhaps I am overly optimistic right now, but there is a great deal to look forward to in the coming years from the semiconductor space. Maybe it won't be all sunshine and flowers, but overall the industry is certainly in an upward trajectory with more attention than ever before. I look forward to seeing how the market reacts to these developments as they mature.",

But I already had cash spread out in too many positions so I halved it and sold 50 calls. I sold the 50 calls first thing in the morning when MU was at 80 when I saw the 200%. If I held all 100 to closing on Friday, it would have been 5000 to 30,000 gain.\n\nThen there's SHOP, I also sold this during the morning pump. If I stayed for this one, I would have lost in the end as SHOP sank towards the end of the day. \n\nSo even with missed gains, it's always better to book profit because you really never know what will happen!",
