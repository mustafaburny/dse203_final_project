That said, Intel is still a household name, and they have a very aggressive marketing and licensing strategy.

        "body": "For 8 years, I worked at Intel as an electrical engineer designing circuits for the future manufacturing processes that Intel would be releasing 2-4 years into the future. There are literally thousands of MS and PhD engineers working on the myriad of challenges involved in making better computer chips. All the way from the design of the manufacturing tools, the amount of NAND gates in a library, the modeling and forecasting of dozens of transistor parameters, writing and supporting the simulation tools, to what I was doing designing and testing: analog circuits in a not yet stable manufacturing process. And hundreds of other challenges that each had teams from a few to a few dozen engineers trying to solve them. It's an insanely complex task. Most engineers working on any of these tasks are so specialized that they don't have any idea how to do the job of the engineers sitting a few aisles over. These engineers are 5-9 management layers below the CEO. Other companies operate the same way, it's just how chip design is done. \n\nIntel's main advantage over the last few decades was that it continuously had the most advanced manufacturing process, maintaining a 1-2 year lead over its closest competitors. However over the last ten years, TSMC has caught up and now overtaken Intel. This is mostly due to Intel's engineering struggles with it's last few manufacturing processes. These things spend half a decade in planning and development. Decisions were made years ago that they are now stuck with. \n\nYour points are all about top level management and I'm sure there's some truth to how important the CEO's decisions are, but I think Intel's current problems are primarily engineering problems with the manufacturing process. I sincerely doubt it's for lack of investment by CEOs. I think it's more likely that TSMC had better engineering talent and was able to do things more creatively that ended up wildly successful.  And surely some luck there too.\n\nAMD has been doing well with their architectures recently and they should get credit for that, but their architectures were always quite good, the thing holding them back was their process and what had been a disadvantage, with TSMC, is now a huge advantage. They are poised to take market share, but they mostly have TSMC to thank for that.",

It's honestly sort of amazing how many mistakes Intel has made in the past year or so, and they are legitimately at risk of becoming completely uncompetitive.\n\nThey basically lost 100% of the enthusiast/custom PC market overnight, and most of their revenue now comes from contracts with Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc for desktop and notebook CPUs (and a few other random components, like wifi and Bluetooth cards). And, these companies will almost definitely be looking to AMD, as Intel's 7nm chips aren't expected to be available until *at least* 2022, and AMD is already mass-producing. Depending on how hard these companies ditch Intel, it could be an actual death blow. \n\nAnd that doesn't even bring up the issue that things are shifting more and more to mobile platforms, where Intel completely failed. Companies like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm absolutely dominate in the mobile SoC sector and managed to castrate a titan when Intel attempted to enter that market and failed miserably. \n\nIt's bad news all around. \n\nDoes that mean they can't come back? No. Of course they can. But the concerns are real.\n\nWhat other major stocks have you seen recently crash 13% on earnings then just... Stay there? Flat? We are in the most legendary dip-buying market of all time, where almost any dip will be bought without any logic, and yet no one would touch INTC, which is one of the biggest tech companies in the world.\n\nIt's a bit concerning.\n\nYour DD is basically \"bruh, it's Intel. And they made a lot of money in 2019.\" But that's frankly just not very good DD my friend.",

Their management either laid off too many important, expensive engineers in an effort to save money. Or they were far too aggressive which led to the massive failure they had today. Or a combination of both. There are definitely fields where you can layoff staff and outsource costs to save money. But semiconductor manufacturing definitely isn't one of them.\n\nI've said in other posts that shareholders are tolerating this now, but they won't do so forever.

We are getting to a point with processors where the failure and error rate are almost matching that of the successful output rate for some of the processor processes (this is true for the industry as a whole). The difference is, intel has in house fabs. Amd outsources their fab work to partnered companies. The reason this matters is as you have more failures and complexities arise, if your in housing your own stuff, you eat the cost of failure directly. If you contract it out, you frankly don\u2019t give a shit what happens. You either get your product or the partnered company hasn\u2019t held up their agreed contract and things get legal. \n\nAs a result amd has been able to move forward with newer nanometer processes without any fear or concern of if it\u2019s even feasible or not. \n\nI will end with this though. Intel wouldn\u2019t be dropping 8 billion dollars in to a new fab space (d1x in Oregon) if they didn\u2019t feel they had a solid road map. Mark my words now, in 5-10 years, intel will be the leading manufacturer of FPGA\u2019s and FPGA\u2019s as a whole, will begin to replace the standard processor market as we know it.",

        "body": "It is hard to tell what tech stocks and the NASDAQ will do but a bit of history is worth studying.\n\nIn 2000 Cisco was the giant of the internet and the internet was the giant of tech stocks. Every employee at Cisco was rich because they all got stock options (yes, including the janitors in those days) and the stock price had climbed from $10 in 98 to $33 in 99 and $79/sh in 2000. They did then sell and still do sell routers that were the backbone of the internet and CSCO was everyone's tech darling. I can't tell you how many Cisco employees had told me in spring of 2000 that they were not going to diversify until CSCO hit $100/sh. In Sept of 2001, their share price had dropped to $12/share. They still were the backbone of the internet but the internet and tech were no longer the darling of the Market. In Feb of 2009 they were at $14/sh and are today at $48/sh. So they today as an ongoing company still doing what it did and with a strong balance sheet are trading at roughly 2/3rds the price they were 20 years ago. That is what can happen to a really good tech company.\n\nBTW, CSCO is not the only one. Intel was at $74.88 in the fall of 2000 and is at $60/sh now and was running around in the $20's for most of the past 20 years. Still a great tech company doing great things.   And yes Intel employees also got rich on options.  I met with a Intel employee, a janitor, single, living in a trailer that was about to exercise $3 mm in net in the money INTC options and needed help with estate planning.   Those were the days.  A short edit:  In 2000 the estate tax began with only $675,000 of assets at death and it started just below 50% and quickly grew to 55%.   So you didn't need to be very wealthy to need estate tax planning.\n\nMicrosoft, one of today's tech darlings, was $50/sh in early 2000. It wandered around $25/share for 15 years until it again hit $50/sh in fall of 2015, fifteen long years later. The last 5 years have been good for it but will it stay at $200/sh?",

        "body": "I was surprised Intel hovered around 60 as long as it had. They're selling server chips with two year old processor form factors for twice the price of AMD's Rome procs. For every company looking to do a refresher on hardware, the choice was a no-brainer. The Rome 2 procs were something we waited to August 2019 to order, and there was such a backlog from orders, that delivery occurred in May of 2020.\n\nI don't think Intel is going to do well. I am surprised they remained $60 until they lost $9 premarket.\n\nYes, Intel does have other revenue streams: network chipsets, motherboards, storage SSD fab, ~~video cards~~, etc. Still, I can't help but think that Intel's lack of R&amp;D into another processor architecture informs me as to their company modus operandi: they rode astride the chip manufacturing world for too long, and a more innovative company is now eating their lunch. They were content to imagine that single-NUMA architecture was going to continue to dominate, while AMD focused on multiple NUMA nodes.\n\nThe disadvantage of single NUMA architecture is the complexity of assembling a die with 24 or 28 cores as a single unit. A lot of their production is thrown away or put into a lower bin when a manufacturing defect takes place. This effectively increases the cost or manufacturing, and Intel processor prices as a whole.\n\nAMD on the other hand, has been developing the Zepplin architecture since the Bulldozer chips in 2011. Their goal was to make production easy by assembling NUMA node modules in batches, and then later integrating them on the  CPU die with a separate processor responsible for intra-node communication. This decreases the points of failure from the entire die, down to single cpu components. This decreases their rate of rejection, which gives them the upper hand on price.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for Intel is their inability to close the architecture process size below 10nm. When I'd heard that AMD was producing 7nm processors, I was intrigued what Intel's response was going to be. When it came out that they were going to be producing only mobile processors at 10nm, I knew they were in trouble.\nIntel has become second-class, and if they don't invest in some serious R&amp;D on their process and architecture, their processor division will soon become redundant.\n\nI am ultra-bearish on Intel in the long run. I cannot understand anybody claiming otherwise, and they are going to suffer immensely. Their R&amp;D teams are definitely being whipped in the back rooms.",

I suppose the only exception is people buying gaming pcs, but can't see that having a huge impact on Intel?",

I was thinking on Thursday that I should go for AMD 1dte calls because of Intel\u2019s earnings. \n\n I figured, if Intel beat bigly, AMD would go up by association. If Intel shit the bed, then AMD would still go up because their Intel\u2019s competitor. I was only going to throw 1k into some 69cs as a lotto ticket. Literally had my cursor over the buy button, but I decided against it at the last second because I have taken a beating the last couple weeks and I made a commitment to only make safe plays. So I backed out.\n\nHad I bought those calls for 1k, had I just clicked that purchase button, it would\u2019ve netted me over $300,000. \n\n$300,000.\n\nFuck man. Fuck.",
