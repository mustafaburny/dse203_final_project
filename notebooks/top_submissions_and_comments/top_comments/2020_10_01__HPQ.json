        "body": "Strategy*:  I trade 0.5% of portfolio value on a company.  Sell with 5% gain.\n\nWatchlist: I have watchlist where I add blue chips and popular holdings (per news and other sites on buig movers).  I also use my broker's stock evaluation tool (Fidelity) or simplywall.st site and then add the company's competitors that look good fundamentally.\n\nScan**:  Technical indicators scan of the watchlist looking at these 3 indicators:\n\n* Wm%R (length:  10) on 4 Hour chart: Below -80%\n* Wm%R (length:  260) on 4 Hour chart: Below -80%\n* RSI (length: 14) on 4 Hour chart:  Wilders Below 30%\n\nEntry:  Only if stock and price is considered undervalued per Fidelity, simplywall.st, and/or TDAmeritrade site analysis (e.g., JNJ, HPQ, GILD, NVAX).  If the stock is overvalued on any of these sites, I pass (e.g., SPOT, FSLY, NFE, VRSN, AXP, V, MC). You can decide for yourself if there is a discrepancy whether to buy or not.\n\nEntry price:  Look at current price and determine on 1 hr candle chart the closest breakup candle price.  Basically, draw a price level of today's low and extend LEFT.  Then, scan eyes left.  Key markers are also recent gaps; price may float down and fill before bouncing higher.  Price is attracted to these levels of support.  CAVEAT:  This is individual.  If you like the stock, and it's falling like a rock, then you can just buy at market price.  \n\nExit price:  Entry price x 1.05 to the nearest 0.25 above calculation (e.g., 22.23 x 1.05 = 23.34.  exit price limit order at 23.50).  You can then plot price level and look on candle chart again.  Scan left to find breakdown candle high and maybe choose this.  Price is attracted to these levels of resistance.\n\n*Scan will show oversold price situation short and longer term.  Oversold does not mean price cannot go lower.  Especially with RSI indicator; many times price goes lower a few days past, but RSI is higher (divergence).  This is why buying undervalued is important.  Price will likely bounce to 5% target to sell. With major selloff like yesterday, target gain could be 10% depending on how.much the company sold off.  The scan is set up in TDAmeritrade's ThinkOrSwim platform.  I get a bell every time something hits all three scan criteria.  Usually, these oversold equities have dropped so far and fast that a bounce is coming.  I usually get in 2%-10% early with this signal, so take that for what it is worth.  Experiment.\n\n**0.5% portfolio value keeps it real folks.  No all in, big payday, slow and steady wins.  When you are (-), a 10% loss is only $50 or a $100 when buying only $500 to $1000 worth of a company.  You can go higher in $ amount held (higher %), but losses are magnified.  This allows one to sleep well at night; I am not worrying about $50-$100 and I know it will come back.  Undervalued company that has good fundamentals.\n\n***You can do 1-5 equities either up to 5% stake or hold long-term or both.  Example, crypto and TSLA and AAPL.",

It hits 2K, your ready to pull out but then it happens... it dips... Slowly you watch that 2k shrink. 2k to 1k , 1k to 700. . You cant sell now, it has to go back up right?

        "body": "I have multiple brokerage accounts and I do have on for just investing in ETFs.  Keeping it simple is a pretty solid approach.  However, I'm not thrilled with your choices.  **VOO** and **QQQ** will have a lot of overlap, so you aren't diversifying as much as you might think. **QQQ** is a great ETF, but the underlying index it uses as a benchmark contains 100 stocks.  (The NASDAQ 100).  **VOO** uses the S&amp;P 500, so it obviously contains 500 stocks. Many of the top holdings are going to be the same in both of those ETFs: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. There are, of course, differences, as well.\n\nI also don't like your choice of **VYM** because of its poor return. It has a 10 year return on investment of just 115%, while VOO is double that and **QQQ** has a return of more than 4 times that of **VYM**. **VYM** will also hold many of the companies you are already investing in with **VOO**.\n\n**QQQ** has one of the highest returns of any ETF, but it is Tech-heavy, so there may be a bit more risk than **VOO**.  \n\nYou don't tell us your age, your financial goals and how averse you are to risk, but assuming you are reasonably young (more than 20 years away from retirement) and don't mind some risk, I might suggest a strategy more along the lines of:\n\n**QQQ**: 25%\n\n**VOO**: 25%   (with the understanding that there is some overlap. The blue chip stocks in VOO will help your portfolio to be a little less volatile than putting 50% into QQQ.)\n\n**SOXX:**  10% - iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF - this is a sector ETF that invests in companies that produce semi-conductors (and related companies). The top holdings of this ETF include Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Taiwan Semiconductor, Analog Devices and NXP Semiconductors.  The might be a little overlap with this one and QQQ, but there shouldn't be much.\n\n**ICLN:**  20% - ICLN is an ETF that invests in green/renewable energy. It is a passively managed index fund that uses the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index as its benchmark. Many of its holdings are outside the US.  (If you prefer a more US focused ETF that invests in renewable energy, consider QCLN instead, but be aware that its top holding is NIO, an electric vehicle maker based in China). \n\n**ARKK:**  10% - The ARK funds are actively managed and they invest in \"disruptive,\" innovative companies, many of which are in the tech sector.  Tesla is the top holding of this fund.\n\n**VXUS**: 10% - This is an investment that tracks the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the US. The fund tracks the FTSE all Cap ex US Index fund. Top holdings include Alibaba, Tencent Holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor (a little overlap with SOXX) Nestle, Roche Holding, SAP SE, Novartis, Toyota and ASML.  While the long term track record of this fund isn't great, the recent addition of Alibaba, Tencent and other companies signal a likely more profitable future.\n\nI think an approach like this will give you the additional diversity you are looking for and a more aggressive return than the choices you've made in your post. \n\n*I'm not a professional Financial advisor and I didn't sleep in a Holiday Inn Express last night. I do own shares in many of the funds I've listed above.*",

I might put a couple on, if it moves in my favor, great. If not, I can average down as long as my assumption on the trade has not changed.",

This severely reduces his election chances. He won't be able to campaign effectively. His whole schtick of not wearing masks now looks very bad for him. And Biden was already ahead before all this. Biden/Kamala's platform is not good for corporations, with them wanting to raise the corporate tax rate and all.\n\nI don't think this is something you sleep off in a day or two.\n\nHow I could be wrong:\n\nIf Trump recovers quickly and no one else in his inner circle contracts it (Pence, McConnell), then this will evaporate like smoke. Given his age and condition, I don't think this is likely. If you want a comparable, look at what Boris Johnson went through in the UK, and he's a lot younger and healthier than Trump.",

        "body": "Palantir has only *recently* shown the signs that it'll be cash positive in BIG ways in the coming year. Their shift has also moved bigly from service-based, to software-based. This is exactly what is needed for them to increase their margins, likely by 3x easily.\n\nHopefully they will continue to develop easier-to-implement software solutions that they can sell major subscriptions for and spend less time setting things up (boots on ground).\n\nI'm also banking on them having a simpler and publicly available product that smaller-size consumers can benefit from.\n\nPersonally I also like their mix of commercial and govt contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir future growth potential is absolutely nuts. We've all heard about Target's crazy monitoring software that can tell you when a customer is pregnant before they even know. Imagine ANY company being able to have that capability (and more), without having to build it in-house. How much would you be willing to pay Palantir to 1.2-1.5x your revenue in a single year? \n\nCompanies know that building these types of tools and data analytic programs are HARD. A company like Palantir could really become the goto source for the most advanced type of data analysis. And they will only get better... Why?...\n\nBecause once you solve tough problems for one vertical you can solve it for others in the same vertical for cheaper. So initial cost of setting up data strategy for Nike might be ($10M, loss). But now Adidas wants the same fancy tech and data. The problem space has already been solved! So cost is now +$10M (profit).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSame shit can apply to any vertical industry. Automotive, manufacturing, services, help centers, IT, healthcare, etc... Solve the problem for one company (make less money), then apply solution to other companies (major moolas).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm bullish because I *need* to be.",

The only positions that have done well for me are leaps on blue chips (holding aapl 1/15/22  $110c, $115c, and $120c)\n\n https://imgur.com/5aEeEvy.jpg",

        "body": "That is when factors that Nikola can't control come into effect. Their positioning on everything I think is to prop stock price until then, which used to include the now canceled Nikola World. \n\nThings that happen in Dec.\n\n1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. \n2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.\n\nQuarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. \n\nRest is storytime:\n\nIf this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.\nSell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. \n\nSo how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the \"new management\" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. \n\nSo the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:\n\nhttps://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98\n\nOkay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.\n\nFantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.\n\nBut there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.\n\nNow we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone. \n\nI know that was long story time. But if you believe they are fraud, then think about what you would need to do if you knew it was a fraud and had millions locked up and you wanted out with out seeing the inside of a jail cell.",
