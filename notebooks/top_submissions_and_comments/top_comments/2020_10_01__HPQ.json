I could see them doing like dating games or some shit like the batchelor since their new ceo is some tv exec ceo dude.\n\nRpm is a coating company.  That are very aggressive in buying out companies, high margins, and coatings companies really aren't going to go bust anytime soon bc they're used fucking everywhere.  And as ppl push to move away from plastics, coatings will be needed even more.\n\nPton bc why not\n\nScl because they're a large powder coating company.  Powder coatings continue to grow bc of regulations on other paints.  And i like coatings..  axlta is descent too\n\nHpq because they have some big ass printers in the works that'll give crazy throughput, customization, and kill screen printing imo\n\nRkt bc it's literally a rocket\n\n\nI've excited almost all my positions in the companies above and am selling puts to get back in to some positions if they dip in the next few months.\n\nIf FDs, I've been playing nnox, rkt, hpq, and hpe",

        "body": "Strategy*:  I trade 0.5% of portfolio value on a company.  Sell with 5% gain.\n\nWatchlist: I have watchlist where I add blue chips and popular holdings (per news and other sites on buig movers).  I also use my broker's stock evaluation tool (Fidelity) or simplywall.st site and then add the company's competitors that look good fundamentally.\n\nScan**:  Technical indicators scan of the watchlist looking at these 3 indicators:\n\n* Wm%R (length:  10) on 4 Hour chart: Below -80%\n* Wm%R (length:  260) on 4 Hour chart: Below -80%\n* RSI (length: 14) on 4 Hour chart:  Wilders Below 30%\n\nEntry:  Only if stock and price is considered undervalued per Fidelity, simplywall.st, and/or TDAmeritrade site analysis (e.g., JNJ, HPQ, GILD, NVAX).  If the stock is overvalued on any of these sites, I pass (e.g., SPOT, FSLY, NFE, VRSN, AXP, V, MC). You can decide for yourself if there is a discrepancy whether to buy or not.\n\nEntry price:  Look at current price and determine on 1 hr candle chart the closest breakup candle price.  Basically, draw a price level of today's low and extend LEFT.  Then, scan eyes left.  Key markers are also recent gaps; price may float down and fill before bouncing higher.  Price is attracted to these levels of support.  CAVEAT:  This is individual.  If you like the stock, and it's falling like a rock, then you can just buy at market price.  \n\nExit price:  Entry price x 1.05 to the nearest 0.25 above calculation (e.g., 22.23 x 1.05 = 23.34.  exit price limit order at 23.50).  You can then plot price level and look on candle chart again.  Scan left to find breakdown candle high and maybe choose this.  Price is attracted to these levels of resistance.\n\n*Scan will show oversold price situation short and longer term.  Oversold does not mean price cannot go lower.  Especially with RSI indicator; many times price goes lower a few days past, but RSI is higher (divergence).  This is why buying undervalued is important.  Price will likely bounce to 5% target to sell. With major selloff like yesterday, target gain could be 10% depending on how.much the company sold off.  The scan is set up in TDAmeritrade's ThinkOrSwim platform.  I get a bell every time something hits all three scan criteria.  Usually, these oversold equities have dropped so far and fast that a bounce is coming.  I usually get in 2%-10% early with this signal, so take that for what it is worth.  Experiment.\n\n**0.5% portfolio value keeps it real folks.  No all in, big payday, slow and steady wins.  When you are (-), a 10% loss is only $50 or a $100 when buying only $500 to $1000 worth of a company.  You can go higher in $ amount held (higher %), but losses are magnified.  This allows one to sleep well at night; I am not worrying about $50-$100 and I know it will come back.  Undervalued company that has good fundamentals.\n\n***You can do 1-5 equities either up to 5% stake or hold long-term or both.  Example, crypto and TSLA and AAPL.",

        "body": "DD: I talked to a veteran of the semiconductor/microchip industry yesterday about the current state of play. Here\u2019s the background. Please chime in if anything seems incorrect or misleading. \n\nAs many know, INTC used to be king and AMD was a hobbled minor competitor. NVDA were the graphics guys. \n\nThere are 3 major manufacturers: INTC (mostly for Intel chips, they do manufacture for others but not significant amounts), TSMC, and Samsung. NVDA uses TSMC, as does AMD. Samsung is mostly memory chips, whereas TSMC and INTC are doing processor chips, so not always direct competitors. \n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is that INTC is losing a ton of market share that has been locked up for decades, causing all other stocks to rise as a reflection of the increased growth potential as they gobble that up. This has been a trend for many years and is now accelerating as INTC continues to shit the bed. \n\nThe other big piece is ARM. INTC wrote the instruction set for PC chips, called x86. All PCs run on x86, so INTC has a big advantage there because they control the instruction set. However, mobile devices, tablets and IOT devices do NOT use x86, they use ARM. So if NVDA buys arm they get that same advantage INTC has for PCs and the mobile side (which is the growing segment ofc)\n\nAMD buying Xilinx is less of a big deal, paying a bunch of money to take out a competitor and fill some gaps in AMD\u2019s product capabilities. \n\nBottom line is that all non-INTC companies are doing well bc computing is growing and INTC is losing market share. Long term, NVDA is poised to be the new intel and AMD\u2019s growth will be more short-lived, unless Bae makes some different moves and changes the trajectory. TSMC kinda wins no matter what, as long as INTC keeps losing. \n\nBears r fuk",

The real question of their growth comes from their Foundry platform which caters toward the commercial sector. The investor day video mentioned that they are slowly decreasing the time it takes to integrate their software into a new company. This is promising because it's been said that each new application of the software into a new company is somewhat a new build in itself.\n\nI think that those who've actually worked with the software have the most credibility since they can speak to its effectiveness. I've never worked with the software, but I like the idea of being able to run a business around it. I don't think it'll ever be as ubiquitous as Microsoft Office since the price and effort to start is pretty damn high.\n\nTheir real obstacle is trying to get more companies to hop onboard. With the controversy behind the history of the company, that remains to be seen. Since Palantir is the subject of frequent controversy, the \"bad\" press could serve as catalysts for the stock. I could give a fuck what the software is used for, I just see that it works and has potential to grow.\n\nIMO, I don't think either bear or bull can predict this one.

Firstly we do not know if their IP will be exclusive to Xbox. Secondly, the mainline games are far from being complete. They will likely release in 3-4 years. This matters because Microsoft needs to win consumers over this November. The last generation of Xbox had poor quality exclusive games which led to Sony acquiring the lion's share of consumers for their PS4 due to their strong exclusive games. This will roll over onto the next generation this fall with Sony showing strong exclusives and backwards compatibility. Thirdly, Bethesda games have taken a hit in quality with the drivvle they've been putting out.",

That's why I'm not sure this is really bearish or just human nature and not sure how this compares to other IPOs.  I'm considering writing a small program to maybe do some comparisons using the data available through the SEC API, maybe then I'll have a clearer picture.  I wonder how many insiders sold Microsoft after IPO for comparison.",

I made the following post about it, which mods removed after it gained significant traffic:\n\nPeople have been complaining that this sub has gone to shit in the last several months. There was a post earlier today arguing this, citing a lack of quality DD being posted here since March.\n\nIt is not that there has been a lack of DD posted, but nearly all quality DD gets deleted by the mods. DD on CVNA was posted yesterday only to be removed by mods, while CVNA shot up 30% today. I have seen users post similar comments in the daily threads over the past few months, saying they posted DD that was removed by mods, only for their predictions to have been right. Some of these users posted their DD in the daily thread instead, some didn\u2019t, but I remember many of these comments ended up ringing true.\n\nNow now now, OP, you might say, mods just want quality DD with charts and fundamentals and \u201cInsider Information.\u201d This is why they let fucking VALE and PRPL guys post pump and dumps, leaving such as the few DD that doesn\u2019t get removed. Even though PRPL guy posted numbers that were undeniably false and proven false by the Earnings Call. Mods let these pump and dumps happen.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the real fucking kicker. On the surface those seemed like fine DD to those who didn\u2019t know better. HOWEVER, I, too, posted \u201cDD\u201d on PRPL: /r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3k4lf/ive_had_a_vision_from_god_and_he_showed_the/\n\nMods let me keep my PRPL \u201cDD\u201d up, where I cited \u201cvisions from god\u201d as the reason to buy calls. This got 137 upvotes and nearly 100 comments. It got legitimate traction and attention. So mods definitely saw it. And they let my post tagged as \u201cDD\u201d remain. This completely disrupts the argument that mods want a certain standard of quality DD when my post with 0 fundamentals, analysis, or any legitimate indication or information to stay up.\n\nYou could say that posts like mine are part of the problem. I wouldn\u2019t dispute you. I will say though, that based on how many people have been getting their DD posts deleted, I was sure my post would be deleted, or at least have the flair changed to Shitpost or Satire. I flaired it as DD cuz I thought it was funny, which it was, while fully expecting it to be removed. This proves that the mods left it up to fuel the Purple pump and dump, instead of suppressing what was truly low quality DD. Instead they surppressed DD like CVNA that would have captured many of us with 10 baggers today had they left that DD up instead.\n\nMods here want you to lose and are entirely to blame for the deterioration of this subs quality as a forum to spread useful information to help us make money. I would go as far to argue that, in my eyes, I am becoming convinced that this sub might be being moderated with those with nefarious intentions to leave everyone here holding heavy bags, though we would need more evidence.\n\nTLDR: if mods delete this post you will know they don\u2019t want you to know the truth.",

All because you would admit that you fucked up. Your boss has insurance to pay for your fuck ups. My insurance won\u2019t cover your fuck ups. You have personally fucked me. \n\nSorry guys. I know that absolutely none of you give a flying fuck what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m having a hard enough time and didn\u2019t need this shit on top of everything else. Had to get it off of my chest. Sorry for waisting your time.",

Donald, being a retard, likely ordered his military doctors to hit him with everything they had right out of the gate, thus he's on the dexamethasone far too early. It is making him feel manic and euphoric as it suppresses his immune system while he most needs it to be responding to the virus. This makes him feel much, much better in the short term (best in \"20 years\") before a possibly devastating crash when the reality of the situation hits.\n\nDo you know what we call that? It's called a bull trap\n\nThis is a confluence of events that could have biblical repercussions.

Two of many things.  They also aren't doing this in one country or region: they are doing it globally.\n\nNow keep in mind their products can also be reprogrammed to tap into other industries via software updates at any time.  That's crazy powerful.\n\nYour oven breaks, you'll replace it in the near future. Your phone breaks, odds are unless it's the middle of the night you're canceling your plans to go replace it right away.\n\nSo the future value of AAPL is pretty insane when you really think about it.

And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted. I just wish he would back away from financial markets, because that is not going to be about real economy and employers and employee.
