We do know that valuations are crazy and will take phenomenal growth to justify just the current stock prices.   I think your analysis that tech is the future is spot on.  But will that provide enough growth to justify the current prices over the next 10-20 years?   I am not so certain.",

If Snowflake sat around and didn't improve the product at all them maybe two years with all the user testing the cloud guys do? They really do not want to break their existing product at all because they stress resiliency. Either way that's not how it would go down.\n\nLook at Twilio for example. They have SO many competitors that all do the same shit on the surface: cloud based communications. But Vonage/Nexmo, Plivo, Avaya, Cisco, etc have not been able to catch up Twilio because Twilio keeps on expanding and innovating. Now Twilio has the biggest breadth of services from any of them and is straight up way easier to use.\n\nMaybe Snowflake keeps making their UI better. Maybe they integrate with more data sources before everybody else. Maybe they keep providing better analysis than the other guys. The innovation can keep them ahead even if the cloud guys make their product better.\n\nI think analyzing the catchup for a company like Fastly is more direct in that AWS CloudFront would just need to get even closer to the edge locations to decrease latency under Fastly's 35 millisecond one and be more competitive. You can see them doing this with the new Wavelength product.\n\nedit: one last thing I want to note is that there is plenty of room for both of them to grow! The cloud market is still not close to fully being penetrated so even if the cloud guys create a good product, it doesn't mean doom and gloom for all these other companies",

Cisco has done well over the past 10 years but their stock price only made it up to 70% of the dot com high. \n\nIf we imagine that Tesla follows the same kind of story it is possible that they do incredibly well over the next 10 years but the price of the stock might still be lower than it is today by the end of the next market cycle. Do the people spamming 'if you believe in the stock then why does it matter' actually consider the price of the stock could stagnate for quite some time? I think Tesla will do well but I'm not buying at these prices. It's price action is sentiment driven so when sentiment changes price will travel very fast in opposite direction. The best time to buy is when people are on here complaining about Tesla and Elon, not when they believe that Tesla will power everything from their toothbrushes to their hyperloops to work within the next 6 months.",

When something is running on hype and everyone thinks it has a bright future, people buy into it initially seeing it as a long term inbestment but as the price goes up and the investors becoming cockier people follow them and chase the trend seeing the gains those investors got. The problem, is that you are buying a piece of a business and for a business to justify being valued so high it needs to make a significant amount of money and when that doesn't happen at maximum expectations, the stock price collapses. \n\nCheck out this article from 2002 when Cisco became the world's largest publicly traded company briefly: https://www.cnet.com/news/cisco-ascends-to-most-valuable-company/\n\nCisco is a valuable company and makes a lot of money, but people's expectations severely overpriced what people were paying for it. If you bought near the top and held all this time, you have not got your money back not factoring in dividends. \n\nThe bears aren't saying Tesla doesn't have a bright future, what they are saying is the talk that \"Tesla is not a car company\" is speculation. Until Tesla actually makes money in this area it may never be worth 300 billion dollars, but thats what its trading for. When Apple released the iPhone in 2007, the market cap did not immediately shoot up to 1 trillion dollars. So you are basically taking a huge gamble on a stock that is making far less income than any other stock trading at that level to pull through on technology that may or may not be revolutionary at an unforseen time in the future. That is why it is crashing and why it will likely continue to crash. \n\nTL;DR Tesla is way ahead of itself on valuation and will likely continue to go down",

        "body": "As a brand it has definitely blown up.  People use \u201cZoom\u201d as a synonym for video conference, and there is definitely value in being a leader in a market to that extent.  People say \u201cI\u2019m going to Zoom with them later\u201d even if it is a video chat on another platform because of the name recognition.  You look at a company like Google who\u2019s name became synonymous with searching and you can see where that kind of brand recognition can lead.\n\nBut that brand name will only get them so far if they don\u2019t find some new revenue streams.  They are the biggest fish in the pond by a good margin but they don\u2019t even have half the market and it is a crowded pond.  Not to mention they are swimming with some really big fish like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Cisco.\n\nThey have a lot of users but until they either control a very dominant market share or make more money on those users it is obvious that their valuation is way out of line.  Most of their users don\u2019t pay anything and they have a payment model for 1000 users at $200 a month.  That\u2019s 20 cents per month per user.  At that rate you could sign up all 7 billion people on the planet and still only be making 140 million a month.  Doesn\u2019t exactly show a high profit ceiling for this company as-is and you can see why so many are baffled by their valuation.",
