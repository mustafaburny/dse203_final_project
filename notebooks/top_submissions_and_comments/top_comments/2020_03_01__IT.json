Made 20 grand long on Tesla shares and then Tesla puts end of day today on some quick whatever trades. \n\n And then one of my covid patients died. It was expected, but sad. Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day. It has for 5 years and still does now. Love you guys. Stay safe.",

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.",

I have appreciated your insight because you are finding correlations between major themes from many areas of market analysis. Most finance professionals specialize in one area and are often blinded to other analysis because of their bias. You are a very intelligent individual and even more impressive due to the fact you have a better understanding of various financial instruments than many within the industry.\n\nEven though you might not have a lifetime of experience, many on WSB are benefiting from your insight. You have spent more time supporting your positions than 99% of those in this sub. Even your basic TA principals help to provide important price ranges for these autists to make slightly better trades.\n\nThere are always losers in this industry and they will always blame others for their own doing. Keep it up. Great insight during the Live Q&amp;A today.\n\nTo u/all don't make your investing decisions off of one person and blame them if you get burned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't doubt your vibe \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

Still, if there\u2019s any time gold should see its price increase, it would be now - when global interest rates are low and economic outlook is poor.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases\u2014and test them faster\u2014have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests.\u201d",

What people don't realize is that oil fields need to be constantly invested in to maintain production because stuff breaks, needs to be replaced and so on. Shale wells have a high decline rate and need to be re-fracked every so often.\n\nWith oil prices dropping, it might no longer make sense to keep investing capital into oil production. It could also be possible there simply isn't enough oil storage to hold all the excess production.\n\nWith supply now dropping all it takes is for demand to immediately return that will spike the price up. There will now not be enough oil supply to meet demand which will cause prices to skyrocket. Then oil companies will start investing back into their fields to turn them back on. \n\nBuy now and then sell on the next price spike to $70+/bbl.",

Notify county and state health officials.\n\nNow, the student health center is setting up a similar planning session.\n\n\nThere have been no suspected cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, at the University of Rochester. But the school, with more than 12,000 students in western New York state, knows it might not stay that way.\n\n\u201cWe need to really get on top of things early,\u201d said Dr. Ralph Manchester, vice provost and director of University Health Service, the student health center.\n\nColleges and universities across the U.S. are updating pandemic protocols in anticipation of potential widespread outbreaks of the fast-moving virus. They have a unique challenge that can\u2019t be addressed by setting work-from-home policies, the way companies can. On campuses, thousands of students live in close quarters, with communal bathrooms and dining facilities.\n\nSchools look far different than they did during the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. The college student population has grown more diverse and mobile in the past decade, and faculty have more research relationships with counterparts in far-flung regions. That means plenty of people with recent travel to, or other connections with, China, South Korea, Europe and elsewhere.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nWhat is the conversation on your college campus like around the topic of coronavirus? Join the conversation below.\n\nColleges say they are following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including recommending 14-day self-isolation for individuals who may have been exposed.\n\nFour students at three schools in the Los Rios Community College District around Sacramento are in isolation, after being exposed to an individual who tested positive in northern California. The University of California, Davis, said Saturday evening it had released three students\u2014one being tested, and that person\u2019s roommates\u2014from isolation after the results came back negative for the virus.\n\n\nThe American College Health Association, an organization of campus health programs at more than 1,100 institutions, created a task force on the virus 10 days ago. \u201cAnd it is as if we have been shot out of a cannon since then,\u201d said Dr. Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia who is chairing the new group.\n\nThe team is reviewing guidelines from the CDC, World Health Organization, the U.S. State Department and other authorities, distilling medical literature into digestible advisories for campus communities and establishing guidelines to help members prepare for the disease.\n\nThe University of Rochester established a Coronavirus University Response Team in February, looking at everything from emergency response and public health to addressing possible xenophobia, monitoring international travel and planning for the potential impact on applications and enrollment.\n\nThe University of Colorado Boulder created a pandemic section for its emergency operations plan in 2015, and one for infectious disease a year later. The guidelines lay out things like how to coordinate with local health officials and various containment measures once a threat has been identified. The campus has roughly 35,500 students.\n\nDecisions such as halting campus operations would depend on how many cases were confirmed and where the affected people live, said Dan Jones, Boulder\u2019s associate vice chancellor for integrity, safety and compliance.\n\n\nSome schools don\u2019t have to dust off their doomsday guides because they have recently battled contagious diseases. Syracuse University had dozens of confirmed cases of mumps in late 2017 and had to coordinate closely with the CDC and county and state health departments.\n\nA few years ago, Rochester had roughly 200 reported cases of norovirus, whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Manchester said there were likely closer to 1,000 people affected.\n\nThe last six weeks of spring semester that year, the university was in \u201call-out \u2018control-this-outbreak\u2019 mode,\u201d Dr. Manchester said. The school stepped up regular cleaning services, switched to packaged-food distribution rather than open buffets like salad bars, and even swapped out buckets of coffee stirrers for individually wrapped ones.\n\nSchools see coronavirus preparation as a good opportunity to remind students and others to maintain proper hygiene, including covering coughs with arms and not hands, staying home when sick and washing hands regularly. To get the message out, they are sending emails, issuing flashing alerts on central websites and posting signs around campus.",

Equal weight to each.\n\n17% Bonds/Treasury ETFs: EDV\n\n50% Individual Stocks:  I play long term dividend stocks, 5G, Autonomous and Electric Vehicles, and AI/Robotics atm with a portion that goes to the five ARK ETFs and some leveraged ETFs like TMF and SSO.\n\nI harvest dividend stocks for cash and keep it in a separate HYSA.  I like dividend stocks for this purpose only.  With each one I intend to invest just enough to get one share a quarter through DRIP.  First year you sell 2 shares and keep 2 shares.  This provides you income and growth and you never have to invest in the stock again.  Eventually you will be able to sell 3 shares a year while keeping 3 and so on.  You usually have to pick stocks that will be around for at least 10 years to see a full return of your investment if the yield is around 5%.  I currently have T stocks set up this way and am now working on VZ.  Both are good 5G plays in my opinion as well so I expect they will see 100%+ ROI.\n\nYou may want to increase your exposure to bonds.  They are nice to sell off during a downturn like right now to provide you with some additional dry powder to buy stocks with.  With my 17% allocation, I sold a quarter of my shares last week.

Mind you, Air Freight is not a viable way to transport some things, but for a lot of industries Air Fright is allowing them to \"patch\" their supply line disruptions by rushing parts from China to the USA.\n\nAnything that shortens that time and makes it easier to get in parts and material from China and alternate suppliers will help.  Tariff reductions are pissing in the ocean compared to the consequences of a production line not working at full capacity or stopping, or business not being able to get things like tooling and machine parts that are needed to keep the lines going.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

Mind you, Air Freight is not a viable way to transport some things, but for a lot of industries Air Fright is allowing them to \"patch\" their supply line disruptions by rushing parts from China to the USA.\n\nAnything that shortens that time and makes it easier to get in parts and material from China and alternate suppliers will help.

(STZ), a leading beverage alcohol company, today provided a response including fact-based consumer trends to address unfounded concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 virus on its business and consumer sentiment related to the company\u2019s Corona beer brand.\n\nBased on recent IRI retail trends, sales of Corona Extra remain strong, with dollar sales up 5% in the U.S. per the latest 4-week period ended Feb. 16, nearly doubling the 52-week trend for the brand. Similarly, depletion trends for Corona Extra for the first two months of this calendar year through Feb. 26, as well as the month of February, have also outpaced their 52-week trend. In addition, IRI dollar sales trends for the entire Corona brand family are also outpacing their 52-week trend in the latest 4-week and 12-week periods. Furthermore, all business units supporting our beer business are seeing positive sales trends for the brand thus far this calendar year.\"",

Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down.

Get it done in federal - disability money garnished at 25% for 10 years, then debt forgiven and IRS taxes the forgiven amount. Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle. Gonna need a super lawyer to keep it in state as I stayed in CA the entire time, opened the account in CA, and TDA has state presence by having physical retail buildings so are bound to state creditor laws. \n\n# TL;DR\nMay be paying a lawyer 100k-1m to not owe 1m to keep it in state court, lol. I need the best here as they'll bring the best.",

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",
