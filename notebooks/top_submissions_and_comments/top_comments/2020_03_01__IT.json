Made 20 grand long on Tesla shares and then Tesla puts end of day today on some quick whatever trades. \n\n And then one of my covid patients died. It was expected, but sad. Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day. It has for 5 years and still does now. Love you guys. Stay safe.",

It was probably 6 months after the initial infections in Wuhan when New York City started to crumble. \n\nWith riots everywhere, going outside was almost suicide. But who cares? North Korea had launched a nuke. It would be here in a few minutes. I went outside and stood in the middle of the street.\n\nJust for shits, I decided to take out my phone, and give Robinhood one more look over. I look at my puts. All of them up 100,000%. At least I could die rich. Then there was rumbling and the sound of whistling. The nuke was here. Not much time left. Hastily, I hit sell on my put with a smile. I can die rich. \n\nAnd as the wall of fire hit me, Robinhood responds with, \"Cannot place order at this time.\"",

I have appreciated your insight because you are finding correlations between major themes from many areas of market analysis. Most finance professionals specialize in one area and are often blinded to other analysis because of their bias. You are a very intelligent individual and even more impressive due to the fact you have a better understanding of various financial instruments than many within the industry.\n\nEven though you might not have a lifetime of experience, many on WSB are benefiting from your insight. You have spent more time supporting your positions than 99% of those in this sub. Even your basic TA principals help to provide important price ranges for these autists to make slightly better trades.\n\nThere are always losers in this industry and they will always blame others for their own doing. Keep it up.

Get it done in federal - disability money garnished at 25% for 10 years, then debt forgiven and IRS taxes the forgiven amount. Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle. Gonna need a super lawyer to keep it in state as I stayed in CA the entire time, opened the account in CA, and TDA has state presence by having physical retail buildings so are bound to state creditor laws. \n\n# TL;DR\nMay be paying a lawyer 100k-1m to not owe 1m to keep it in state court, lol.

Something with date far enough out to not get screwed.\n\nWith that you can buy something cheap, example my 0.25 contract and watch it grow like crazy if a trend continues. So I was up to 450% return before the bulls came out at the end of Friday. That\u2019s how people post stupid 12000% gains sometimes. My two other contracts I bought a little closer to the money to see if the gains would be proportional. They are not as of yet, we will see what Monday brings.\n\nAgain, I could be way off but that seems to be working as of now for me. Of course if the market goes up I\u2019m so far OTM that nothing will bring it back, if I was ITM or ATM I could still recover.",

March 15th, we'll also produce surgical masks) in China (Zaozhuang, Shandong specifically). We have a 500,000sq ft facility with a dedicated ISO class 5 Cleanroom for our 300,000 daily n95 production capabilities (and 1MM masks a day for surgical masks once it's at full operation) and we are taking bulk orders (10,000 pc minimum) for shipment within China, our clients are usually in charge of export as there simply isn't enough time for our limited employees to deal with exports. We supply to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in China called XiuZheng pharmaceutical group \u4fee\u6b63\u96c6\u56e2 and have sold millions of our n95 respirators to them. We also supply millions of n95 respirators to Xiaomi \u5c0f\u7c73, the phone company. We've had clients export to Russia, HK and US, though I'm not quite sure the exact logistics they went through. Some clients use freight forwarding companies.\n\nThe material costs have tripled in the last month alone so our masks are currently more expensive than usual, but people are nonstop purchasing due to the shortages. Hopefully we can help you get what you're looking for.  \n\nOur current pricing for n95 mask is 14rmb ($2 USD equivalent) for smaller orders of 10,000pcs+, 13 rmb ($1.86) for 50,000+, 12 rmb ($1.72) for 100,000pcs+, 11rmb ($1.57) for 1,000,000+ and 10rmb for 10,000,000+. This does not include shipping cost by SF Express which will be Cash on Delivery. It also does not include 10% taxes if applicable. Please keep in mind that material prices are constantly shifting so this may be out of date when you see this. Just two weeks ago (2/12/2020) our price per N95 mask was 18rmb while our prices in January was 4rmb! Once materials run out we cannot purchase them unless we pay a crazy amount for example, one ton of raw material used to cost 20,000 rmb, now for the same ton of n95 material costs 380,000-800,000 rmb, which is literally up to 40 times the cost for the same exact material. There is a global shortage of n95 grade materials.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me on Wechat or Whatsapp if you want to place orders. \n\nMy Wechat ID is: franktsaur and my WhatsApp ID is +16269916596. I am based in Los Angeles, but I work with the Asia team remotely. \n\nSincerely, \nFrank T.",

March 15th, we'll also produce surgical masks) in China (Zaozhuang, Shandong specifically). We have a 500,000sq ft facility with a dedicated ISO class 5 Cleanroom for our 300,000 daily n95 production capabilities (and 1MM masks a day for surgical masks once it's at full operation) and we are taking bulk orders (10,000 pc minimum) for shipment within China, our clients are usually in charge of export as there simply isn't enough time for our limited employees to deal with exports. We supply to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in China called XiuZheng pharmaceutical group \u4fee\u6b63\u96c6\u56e2 and have sold millions of our n95 respirators to them. We also supply millions of n95 respirators to Xiaomi \u5c0f\u7c73, the phone company. We've had clients export to Russia, HK and US, though I'm not quite sure the exact logistics they went through. Some clients use freight forwarding companies.\n\nThe material costs have tripled in the last month alone so our masks are currently more expensive than usual, but people are nonstop purchasing due to the shortages. Hopefully we can help you get what you're looking for.  \n\nOur current pricing for n95 mask is 14rmb ($2 USD equivalent) for smaller orders of 10,000pcs+, 13 rmb ($1.86) for 50,000+, 12 rmb ($1.72) for 100,000pcs+, 11rmb ($1.57) for 1,000,000+ and 10rmb for 10,000,000+. This does not include shipping cost by SF Express which will be Cash on Delivery. It also does not include 10% taxes if applicable. Please keep in mind that material prices are constantly shifting so this may be out of date when you see this. Just two weeks ago (2/12/2020) our price per N95 mask was 18rmb while our prices in January was 4rmb! Once materials run out we cannot purchase them unless we pay a crazy amount for example, one ton of raw material used to cost 20,000 rmb, now for the same ton of n95 material costs 380,000-800,000 rmb, which is literally up to 40 times the cost for the same exact material. There is a global shortage of n95 grade materials.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me on Wechat or Whatsapp if you want to place orders. \n\nMy Wechat ID is: franktsaur and my WhatsApp ID is +16269916596. I am based in Los Angeles, but I work with the Asia team remotely. \n\nSincerely, \nFrank T.",

However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit.

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

Now their CPUs are king and their GPUs are competitive, even lacking a flagship as powerful as the 2080 or 2080ti. \n\nThey have rapidly transitioned from a sustained underdog position to a real tooth and nail competitor. If we assume that this trend will continue does it not stand to reason that their share price should also continue to perform as they seize a greater market share?\n\nThis of course says nothing about server and console hardware, which im less familiar with but i hear they're doing well in those sectors as well.",

        "body": "It's not video processors where AMD's growth potential greatest -- it's in the server market, where they are currently dominating Intel in terms of performance per watt. Now, Intel is a behemoth when it comes to the server market, and they're not going to give up market share easily, but AMD is better placed to gain a substantial share of the server market from Intel now than they have ever been, and that's not hyperbole.\n\nVideo is a much tougher market position for them, with nVidia still leading substantially at the high end, and poised to release their next generation cards. AMD's limited research budget has been mostly focused on their CPU technology, as it should be, so it's going to take longer for them to catch up with nVidia, if they can at all.",

Many took profits, not wanting to hold the bag if the ER was tepid.\n\nTurns out they reported a spectacular ER and incredibly positive guidance.  In any other times, it would have vaulted into the 300's with chatter about $400.  It started, but immediately corona news and Asia gloom was the talk and instead of receiving credit for the excellent ER, NVDA has been down and down.  That may not have been fair.",
