Law didn't include any penalties or payback provisions if they failed to do it, so the telecom companies just took the money, pocketed it, and did absolutely nothing.  Obama's stimulus program included some money for broadband projects too.  I don't know how that worked out on the nationwide stage, but I know in my state of West Virginia the scam that masquerades as a company named Frontier wired up the entire city of Philippi with fiber, turned it on on Christmas Eve (the deadline to qualify for stimulus funds), collected their check.... and to this day has not connected a single customer to it.  If these laws do not spell out in excruciating detail exactly what the companies have to do to qualify, including offering the service to customers at a reasonable price, with required payback of funds if they fail to complete on time or with steep penalties if they fail in their obligations, they simply won't do it.  They'll do the bare minimum to get a check from their DC daddy and rely on the poor rising up to protect them if anyone complains.",

My account was breached these past few weeks and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nThe hacker logged into my account and loaded up on 7/16 SPY $415 puts starting 6/18 and averaged down all the way to today.\n\nThis person knew my password, had access to my phone and my finger prints. The sick bastard even knew my mother\u2019s maiden name. I know I couldn\u2019t believe it either. He needs to be stopped.\n\nSPY is now trading at $433.72 and each of those contracts is worth $57 now from almost $513. Rent is coming up so I\u2019m going to need my money back.\n\nThanks again,\n\n/r/wallstreetbets bear",
