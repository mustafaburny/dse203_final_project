So finding anything new is difficult. Imho, that's intentional tactic to hide the lack of content.\n3) My native language is Russian, but I live in Poland. Netflix thinks that it knows their customer better and doesn't offer me the selection of Russian subtitles even though those exist in Russia. I can select only Polish or English.\n\nThe only reason I still use Netflix is cause it's free for me due to a certain promotion.

They aren\u2019t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.\n\nOnline shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.\n\nOverall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren\u2019t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",

They get advanced access to everything msft is doing with Azure and SharePoint, 365 etc so they can work ahead of time to create products and solutions that help Microsoft and their customers. They do what Microsoft doesn't have time,  or energy to do. I think of it with a bad analogy, Walter white wasn't selling dime bags... other people were doing that. He created the product and sold to other people who sold those dime bags. Microsoft needs avepoint and avepoint needs Microsoft. I'm really looking forward to earnings in a few weeks to see where they are at and where they are headed. \n\nTons of companies have also either adopted a complete WFH model or a hybrid model,  they know how much money they can save not paying leases or commercial property taxes.. with data security and secure backup (ransom attacks)  being more important than ever I can see them easily surpassing the mid case. It's just going to take time to shake the spac label.  Of all the companies that have chosen to spac over the last year and a half this has to be a top 2 or 3 in quality, they would have smoked in an IPO.\n\nEveryone cries they can't buy good IPOs and then they cry when they can cause no overnight 100% gain. Gotta start thinking like an institutional investor and less like a pump and dump overnight yolo trader, on this anyways.\n\nEdit:  forgot EduTech.. the need for corporate training, education compliance will also grow, especially with a remote work environment.",

It was the #1 company by marketcap in 2019 and march 2020.\n\nMoreover, It has never fallen out of the top 10 list for more than 20+ years even with failure of Ballmer, tech bubble crash, Nokia, etc. Now with the new ceo, I dont see it going out of the top 10 especially since it is so far ahead from #10 spot which is Alibaba at 600 billion market cap. (Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).\n\nBack in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.\n\nMicrosoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2012",

        "body": "So the forward PE ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is approximately 22.7x. Analysts are expecting about $192 in earnings for 2021. According to the most recent JP Morgan Guide the the Markets, the top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500 account for about 28% of the index and have an average PE of 30x. The other 490 companies have an average PE of 19x. The companies in the top 10 may be overvalued, but do you really want to bet against Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia based on a valuation call? I don't think there is anything wrong with those companies. There certainly isn't anything structurally broken within the tech industry. These companies are all leading technological productivity gains that the economy has been lacking for the last decade.  This goes beyond just the work from home trend, it's about the more productive use of time and resources.",

Tesla sells under 1% all vehicles worldwide but is somehow worth *more than all the other carmakers combined* because lots of people were buying Tesla stock and not because of any financial status of Tesla. dogecoin started LITERALLY as a joke but somehow was more valuable than companies like Ford Motors only because a ton of cash flowed into Dogecoin. this is all sheer insanity by traditional stock valuation guidelines. asset bubbles are nothing new, but Burry believes it's being exacerbated by passive investing. \n\n- Burry believes this situation of prices being based on cash flows is similar to what happened in the housing bubble, when multi-zillion Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) were being priced not by a reasonable estimate of their fair value but by cash-flows. \n\n- when flows reverse and lots of people want out of index funds, it will get ugly because so many stocks are linked/benchmarked to major stock indexes *including lower volume stocks*. consider VTI: the top holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson) might have a billion shares in total and hundreds of millions of dollars trading each day. but the smallest company stocks might have only a few million shares and a few million dollars trading each day. if too many people want to sell all at the same time, it will drive prices down sharply because these stocks are so often sold as a bundle/unit. as Burry puts it: \"The theater keeps getting more crowded, but the exit door is the same as it always was\"\n\n&gt;since the guy predicted 2007-2008 crash.\n\nhe also predicted the dot-com bubble.",

The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD. \n\nA plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and \"5G-cloudification\" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI &amp; tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM &amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China's Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.",

Now, Burry says he sees shades of 1999 and 2007 -- periods of other market frothiness. \n\n\"I don't know when meme stocks such as this will crash, but we probably do not have to wait too long, as I believe the retail crowd is fully invested in this theme, and Wall Street has jumped on the coattails,\" Burry told Barron's via email. \"We're running out of new money available to jump on the bandwagon.\" \n\nBurry, whose successful bet against the housing market ahead of the subprime mortgage collapse made him a prominent character in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" believes that meme stocks are the latest Wall Street trend that could wind up hurting regular investors. He said that in 1999, everyone making money in dot-com stocks believed it would continue. In 2007, those making money \"leveraged to the hilt in multiple homes\" thought that would continue, too. \n\n\"Momentum, social media are now part of the strategy for Wall Street, and they are in a better position than retail to participate, sniff out and start gamma squeezes in the options market,\" Burry added, the latter part referring to heightened demand for shares driven by market makers rushing to hedge call options they sold -- a phenomenon that likely juiced meme stock trading. \n\nBurry became a high-profile GameStop (ticker: GME) bull in the second half of 2019. He told Barron's in August of that year that fears about disc-less consoles were overblown. He expected free cash flow to rebound when new consoles from Sony and Microsoft were released in 2020. On the now-viral RoaringKitty YouTube channel that predicted the GameStop squeeze potential, retail investor Keith Gill touted Burry's bull thesis. Burry couldn't have foreseen the pandemic and related console shortages, but his thesis was certainly playing out, as shares began to rebound in the second half of 2020. \n\n\"For me though, if I get within years on a thesis coming true, I'm happy, \" he says. \"Most people are focused on days, weeks or months.\" \n\nIn 2020, after Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen revealed a 9% stake in the company and called for major changes, shares rallied back to double-digit territory. Burry sold what was left of his GameStop stake at a profit at some point during the fourth quarter of last year, according to regulatory filings. \n\nAsked about companies like GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) that have sold millions of shares into surging stock prices, Burry points out that is wasn't that long ago that GameStop was buying back millions of dollars in stock at his suggestion. \n\nHe thinks companies should be selling stock -- as long as they follow the laws. \n\n\"This is a Godsend for these companies,\" Burry added. \"But just having cash on hand itself does not warrant high multiples from the market, as many, many listed companies can tell you.\" \n\nWrite to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com \n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nJuly 01, 2021 04:14 ET (08:14 GMT)\nCopyright (c) 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.",

        "body": "I mostly invest in index funds largely for the reasons you gave lol and I do think markets are fairly efficient overall. I also just don't like spending significant time doing research into single stocks. It's just not that fun to me. However, I do have a sizeable amount of my portfolio in Microsoft, which is my only single stock investment. With that said, some people do okay with stock picking and some just have fun with it, so there isn't anything wrong with it IMO. \n\n\nHere are couple things you could say (not really one liners, but you could easily paraphrase):\n\n1.) It's fun and you enjoy doing research into stocks. As long as you're managing your risk, you'll still probably make money and will have fun doing it even if you underperform or just have the same performance as the market. There's also the possibility you could outperform and make more by doing proper research. \n\n2.) Even if you believe in efficient markets, that doesn't mean beating the market is impossible. It just means you likely have to take on more risk to do it. It might work, it might not. Higher risk is rewarded with higher returns, so if you're okay with the added risk, there's the possibility of making more money (ideally with at least some divetsification).\n\n3.) People often misunderstand the role of entities like hedge funds and other pro money managers. I worked at a large hedge fund (not as a trader) and we rarely beat the S&amp;P 500 in a given year in total return lol. Clients for hedge funds often are wealthy individuals or others such as pension funds who simply want a reasonable return that isn't 100% correlated with the market, so if the S&amp;P tanks they don't lose everything. Some do take on a ton of risk, but they usually blow up within a few years. The ones that stay around generally have higher Sharpe ratios than the broader market, but in total returns they often lag, yet they still have clients because the goal isn't always to just beat the market. Their strategies can also sometimes be constrained by a large AUM. With less capital, you can actually take on different strategies than the pros are able to and it's entirely possible for these strategies to do well.",

Let's look at some examples:\n\n\\- So in this case, Didi's operation got suspended because \"Didi had illegally collected users' personal data.\"\n\n\\- Alibaba got fined because of monopolistic practices.\n\n\\- Ant Group's IPO got slashed because the CCP wanted to regulate Ant Group like an actual bank.\n\nTo be honest, these sound pretty reasonable to me. Facebook was in trouble for collecting data without content too. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal? But now everyone is hot for FB stocks.\n\nMicrosoft has been fined millions by the EU for monopolistic practices as well. But everyone loves Microsoft stocks nonetheless. \n\nAnd as to Ant Group, they are a massive financial service company that can offer customers credit. How come they don't get to be regulated like a bank? My point is that these actions make sense and good regulations is beneficial for investors too in the long run.",

(Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).\n\nBack in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.\n\nMicrosoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2012",

Tesla sells under 1% all vehicles worldwide but is somehow worth *more than all the other carmakers combined* because lots of people were buying Tesla stock and not because of any financial status of Tesla. dogecoin started LITERALLY as a joke but somehow was more valuable than companies like Ford Motors only because a ton of cash flowed into Dogecoin. this is all sheer insanity by traditional stock valuation guidelines. asset bubbles are nothing new, but Burry believes it's being exacerbated by passive investing. \n\n- Burry believes this situation of prices being based on cash flows is similar to what happened in the housing bubble, when multi-zillion Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) were being priced not by a reasonable estimate of their fair value but by cash-flows. \n\n- when flows reverse and lots of people want out of index funds, it will get ugly because so many stocks are linked/benchmarked to major stock indexes *including lower volume stocks*. consider VTI: the top holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson) might have a billion shares in total and hundreds of millions of dollars trading each day. but the smallest company stocks might have only a few million shares and a few million dollars trading each day. if too many people want to sell all at the same time, it will drive prices down sharply because these stocks are so often sold as a bundle/unit. as Burry puts it: \"The theater keeps getting more crowded, but the exit door is the same as it always was\"\n\n&gt;since the guy predicted 2007-2008 crash.\n\nhe also predicted the dot-com bubble.",

The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD. \n\nA plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and \"5G-cloudification\" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI &amp; tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM &amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China's Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.",

When in doubt, zoom out. 2-5% a month is 25-60% a year. Consider the indexes historically return 10%, doubling that on your bad years and quintupling it on your good years seems like a good trade.\n\nAnother note, this past year has been a historic bull run/recovery for most of the stock market. You can't compare throwing money into microsoft or google and watching it appreciate vs selling options on the same underlying. Likewise, if you had been selling RIOT/MARA puts the first 4 months of the year, you could've been making 10% a week. \n\nEverything in the market is perspective.
