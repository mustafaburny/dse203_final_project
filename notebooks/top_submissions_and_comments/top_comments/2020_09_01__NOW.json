So in theory, if you were to exercise this call, the shares would have to be at least $39.79 for you to \"break even\" considering the premium you paid.\n\nHowever, since you've got like 4 months until expiry, the value of the contract is more than the difference between the strike and the market price. That difference is called \"extrinsic value.\"\n\nFor whatever reason, your contracts are worth more now (market forces, speculation, etc.). Someone who pays $5.03 for that call breaks even at $41.03 for the same reason as what I outlined above.\n\nHope this clarifies for you. Think of it this way - a plate of chicken wings cost $10, but you have a coupon to buy them for $8. That coupon is intrinsically worth $2. The right to buy wings at $8 when they cost $10 is worth $2 intrinsically.\n\nEdit: Holy karma and awards. Thank you, all!",

Didn't occur to me at all though. ::Shrug::\n\nRides don't usually get cancelled by the customer though unless the wait times are ridiculous, and that hasn't happened to me this year except once and I was paid regardless. What does tend to happen is you'll get sent to a restaurant that has left their app online and is taking orders but in reality is closed. You might get sent up to a few miles away for a pickup that doesn't exist. Since the pickup doesn't occur, there is no payment. Annoying but only happens maybe a couple times a week.\n\nThe real thing that has pissed me off this year is that they've lowered their rates for rides, but then added in tip estimates when presenting you a ride offer. The payments per ride look about the same as they always have, except now they're not 100% guaranteed, they include what's called an 'expected tip' even though sometimes there ends up being no tip at all and now you've just made 50% less than expected on a ride.\n\nSupport calls seem to be routed to India. They've always been able to handle any issue I've thrown at them. Occasionally the customer puts in an incorrect destination address, Uber always compensates for the extra distance/time. Haven't really had to speak to them otherwise.",

        "body": "&gt;**TL;DR** \\- My husband loves a certain sex act, I stopped doing it a year ago, he came into a windfall of money last week and wants to use a portion of this money to see prostitutes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I \\[F27\\] will try not to make this post too graphic, but be warned, it involves sex.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My husband \\[M31\\] is really into anal sex. If he could, he'd do it every time we were intimate. I never particularly liked it, but I would do it to make him happy 2-3 times a month.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After a particularly painful incident last year, I swore off anal sex for good. He's been good about respecting my boundaries and he's never pushed for it again, however the frequency in which we have sex has dropped off dramatically.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Last week, my husband somehow made $30,000 in the stock market. This is a huge sum of money for us, we've never experienced a windfall like this ever. Yesterday I asked to have a discussion about how we should allocate this money - house repair, car repair, retirement fund, etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is where things get messed up. He tells me matter-of-factly that he's setting aside $2,000 to have anal sex with prostitutes. I said are you fucking kidding me? He says he's been sexually unfulfilled for almost a year and if I want to see a dime of this money, I must approve of him doing this.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We ended up getting in a huge fight where accused me of doing a \"bait and switch\" because I stopped wanting anal sex shortly after getting married. He said if he'd have known I would do this, he never would have married me. This was such a hurtful thing to hear, I hope to God he didn't actually mean it. I basically cried myself to sleep after this while he slept in the basement.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I haven't spoken to him since our fight. I don't even know what to do or say. This is totally out-of-character for him. He is a monogamous man who has never acted this callously. I shared this with one friend whom I trust, she thinks he's just venting pent-up frustration and doesn't actually want to see prostitutes. I don't know what to think.\n\nlol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;First if all, that's not his money, that's a joint asset.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Second of all, get a lawyer. Now. This relationship is toast.\n\ngod the comments are fuckin toxic my man thought he was getting anal for the rest of his life jfc",

As it is constantly improving, I assume 0.07 now.\n\nLets assume ps5 die is similar size to xbox die. (no exact info on ps5 die online)\n\nInput all values into the wafer calculator here:\n\n[https://caly-technologies.com/die-yield-calculator/](https://caly-technologies.com/die-yield-calculator/)\n\nThis results in a yield of 80.5%. Add some partial functions dies as well, as usually console chips have  some redundant compute units to increase yield. So between 80.5 and 85% yield.\n\nEven if we make it 20% larger than xbox die, we wont even come close to 50% yield.\n\nTo drop below 50% yield, the defect density must be 0.23 which is not the case for 7nm.\n\nI see no technical reason why it should be 50% yield. The article also provides no explaination why yield should be that horrible on a mature node with low defect density. They are not even trying.\n\nMaybe any electrical engineer can chime it, if there are other reasons why yield could be that horrible on a mature node besides defect density and die size?",

Stick to playing with money you can afford to lose rather than getting caught in pitfalls like FOMO and dragon chasing and margin trading. Learn more about the fundamentals and consider strategies that aren't as radical as the ones that autists here encourage. If you don't like the feeling of the rollercoaster ride and its periodic whipe outs, then look into how Theta gang and r/investing operate. Its less of an adrenaline rush, but you won't have to feel like how you do right now ever again.\n\nI think you'll look back one day and realize that in the scheme of things, where you are right now isn't the rock bottom that you think it is. Imagine if you got crazy lucky on your last few trades and started feeling like a genius. You'd take whatever sum of money that was, then gamble it again, eventually lose it, and feel even dumber. The worst thing that can happen at the casino is winning big on your first trip, because then rationality goes out the window and you're hooked like a sucker.

The question is:  if you pulled all your money out of Boeing, right now, and invested in the broader market (i.e. S&amp;P 500), would you make more money, or not, over your time horizon.\n\nIf you think that Boeing will outperform the market in that time horizon, hold it. If you assess that you will make more in the broader market, even if you have to sell Boeing for a loss, then do that. It may be many years before Boeing returns to its former strength (if at all), and the market as a whole may see serious gains in the meantime. You must make that decision, and it is a difficult one.\n\nUnfortunately, I was in a similar position a few years ago when GE shit a brick. I sold it at $20/share. For me, it was 15% loss overall.\n\nHowever, I made the assessment that the SP would trounce GE\u2019s returns for at least five years, maybe more. Really glad I made that decision, because last time at checked, GE was six bucks a share. But at the time, it was a very tough call, and it took a few months to become comfortable with the decision I\u2019d made.",

        "body": "Article from link:\n\n\"Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (NYSE American: ZOM) announced today that it has agreed with its development partner Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Qorvo US, Inc., to develop three new assays -- Cobalamin, cPL (canine Pancreatic Lipase), and Folate -- to target diagnosis of canine gastrointestinal issues. The new assays are in addition to the initial five assays currently under development, including panels for adrenal and thyroid testing, for TRUFORMA\u2122, Zomedica's point-of-care veterinary diagnostic platform. The agreement to pursue development of the new assays has triggered the final $2 million milestone payment under Zomedica\u2019s Development and Supply Agreement with Qorvo.\n\n\u201cOur intent for TRUFORMA\u2122 always has been to have it serve as a broad diagnostic point-of-care tool for dogs and cats and to continue to expand the diagnostic offerings available on the platform,\" said Robert Cohen, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Zomedica. \"We believe that the combination of the Cobalamin, cPL and Folate assays will enable veterinarians to use TRUFORMA to conduct a thorough testing panel to diagnose dogs in gastrointestinal distress.\"\n\nIf successfully developed, the Cobalamin, cPL, and Folate assays will represent what the Company believes is the first non-infectious gastrointestinal panel optimized for use in canines fully available at the point-of-care to facilitate rapid diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders. Evaluation of the health of different components of the gastrointestinal system is necessary to identify the cause of clinical symptoms. This panel is intended to assay the function of the pancreas, proximal small intestine, and distal small intestine. The Company believes that the ability to conduct testing at the point-of-care will facilitate real-time clinical decision-making, reduce in-patient clinic stay, promote earlier detection and treatment, and increase pet owner satisfaction.\n\nAccording to a DVM360 study*, ASPCA Pet Insurance, Embrace, Nationwide, Pets Best and Trupanion agree that \u201cGI condition\u201d is the most common insurance claim for dogs. Signs of digestive system disease can include excessive drooling, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting or regurgitation, loss of appetite, bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating, straining to defecate, shock, and dehydration. The TRUFORMA diagnostic device, which is smaller than a desktop printer, is anticipated to provide highly sensitive, species-specific assays using Qorvo\u2019s proprietary, non-optical Bulk Acoustic Wave (\"BAW\") sensor technology. The BAW sensor is a proven semiconductor technology used in telecommunications and aerospace markets. The Company believes that BAW technology has the potential to improve veterinary diagnostics by delivering reference laboratory accuracy and test performance to the veterinary clinic at the point-of-care.\"\n\nI bolded the important parts. This is a long hold regardless if r/s happens or does not. IMO the r/s ain't happening.",
