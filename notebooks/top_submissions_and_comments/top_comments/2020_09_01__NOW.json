So in theory, if you were to exercise this call, the shares would have to be at least $39.79 for you to \"break even\" considering the premium you paid.\n\nHowever, since you've got like 4 months until expiry, the value of the contract is more than the difference between the strike and the market price. That difference is called \"extrinsic value.\"\n\nFor whatever reason, your contracts are worth more now (market forces, speculation, etc.). Someone who pays $5.03 for that call breaks even at $41.03 for the same reason as what I outlined above.\n\nHope this clarifies for you. Think of it this way - a plate of chicken wings cost $10, but you have a coupon to buy them for $8. That coupon is intrinsically worth $2. The right to buy wings at $8 when they cost $10 is worth $2 intrinsically.\n\nEdit: Holy karma and awards. Thank you, all!",

Didn't occur to me at all though. ::Shrug::\n\nRides don't usually get cancelled by the customer though unless the wait times are ridiculous, and that hasn't happened to me this year except once and I was paid regardless. What does tend to happen is you'll get sent to a restaurant that has left their app online and is taking orders but in reality is closed. You might get sent up to a few miles away for a pickup that doesn't exist. Since the pickup doesn't occur, there is no payment. Annoying but only happens maybe a couple times a week.\n\nThe real thing that has pissed me off this year is that they've lowered their rates for rides, but then added in tip estimates when presenting you a ride offer. The payments per ride look about the same as they always have, except now they're not 100% guaranteed, they include what's called an 'expected tip' even though sometimes there ends up being no tip at all and now you've just made 50% less than expected on a ride.\n\nSupport calls seem to be routed to India. They've always been able to handle any issue I've thrown at them. Occasionally the customer puts in an incorrect destination address, Uber always compensates for the extra distance/time. Haven't really had to speak to them otherwise.",

If he could, he'd do it every time we were intimate. I never particularly liked it, but I would do it to make him happy 2-3 times a month.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After a particularly painful incident last year, I swore off anal sex for good. He's been good about respecting my boundaries and he's never pushed for it again, however the frequency in which we have sex has dropped off dramatically.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Last week, my husband somehow made $30,000 in the stock market. This is a huge sum of money for us, we've never experienced a windfall like this ever. Yesterday I asked to have a discussion about how we should allocate this money - house repair, car repair, retirement fund, etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is where things get messed up. He tells me matter-of-factly that he's setting aside $2,000 to have anal sex with prostitutes. I said are you fucking kidding me? He says he's been sexually unfulfilled for almost a year and if I want to see a dime of this money, I must approve of him doing this.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We ended up getting in a huge fight where accused me of doing a \"bait and switch\" because I stopped wanting anal sex shortly after getting married. He said if he'd have known I would do this, he never would have married me. This was such a hurtful thing to hear, I hope to God he didn't actually mean it. I basically cried myself to sleep after this while he slept in the basement.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I haven't spoken to him since our fight. I don't even know what to do or say. This is totally out-of-character for him. He is a monogamous man who has never acted this callously. I shared this with one friend whom I trust, she thinks he's just venting pent-up frustration and doesn't actually want to see prostitutes. I don't know what to think.\n\nlol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;First if all, that's not his money, that's a joint asset.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Second of all, get a lawyer. Now. This relationship is toast.\n\ngod the comments are fuckin toxic my man thought he was getting anal for the rest of his life jfc",

        "body": "Sounds like a rumour to increase early sales for PS5 or stock manipulation.\n\n**Why is this unlikely?**\n\nTSMC 7nm has a very good yield. Defect density was 0.09 9 month ago. As it is constantly improving, I assume 0.07 now.\n\nLets assume ps5 die is similar size to xbox die. (no exact info on ps5 die online)\n\nInput all values into the wafer calculator here:\n\n[https://caly-technologies.com/die-yield-calculator/](https://caly-technologies.com/die-yield-calculator/)\n\nThis results in a yield of 80.5%. Add some partial functions dies as well, as usually console chips have  some redundant compute units to increase yield. So between 80.5 and 85% yield.\n\nEven if we make it 20% larger than xbox die, we wont even come close to 50% yield.\n\nTo drop below 50% yield, the defect density must be 0.23 which is not the case for 7nm.\n\nI see no technical reason why it should be 50% yield. The article also provides no explaination why yield should be that horrible on a mature node with low defect density. They are not even trying.\n\nMaybe any electrical engineer can chime it, if there are other reasons why yield could be that horrible on a mature node besides defect density and die size?",

Remember that you aren't a savant trading genius. Much more experienced people than you are struggling in a wacky market like this. It's a casino for everyone. You're just the lucky guy who walked into the casino with money he could afford to lose instead of throwing your whole student loan on the roulette table.  Don't be upset, be very glad. The education you just got was a lot cheaper than what many others pay to realize they're retarded.\n\nIf you decide to get back on this mentally handicapped horse, discard any regret and pity about what happened so far and just consider it a modestly priced lesson. Stick to playing with money you can afford to lose rather than getting caught in pitfalls like FOMO and dragon chasing and margin trading. Learn more about the fundamentals and consider strategies that aren't as radical as the ones that autists here encourage. If you don't like the feeling of the rollercoaster ride and its periodic whipe outs, then look into how Theta gang and r/investing operate. Its less of an adrenaline rush, but you won't have to feel like how you do right now ever again.\n\nI think you'll look back one day and realize that in the scheme of things, where you are right now isn't the rock bottom that you think it is. Imagine if you got crazy lucky on your last few trades and started feeling like a genius. You'd take whatever sum of money that was, then gamble it again, eventually lose it, and feel even dumber. The worst thing that can happen at the casino is winning big on your first trip, because then rationality goes out the window and you're hooked like a sucker. Its better that you got a cheap reality check now so you can focus on proper fundamentals and have a real strategy instead of just emulating the worst behavoirs of the retards here.",
