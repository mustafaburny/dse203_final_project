John Chen has certainly built and sold something before. long term, maybe Chenny boy 10x's this or moar. that's what i really want. any way, the upside is huge. You have solarwinds and symantec crumbling every day. others have said it before me: this is the decade of technology leaving our computers and entering our world in full force, just look at tesla. i doubt my kids will ever own a car, it'll just be a service, like so many other things.\n\nif this story keeps evolving for the better, i'm aiming for a little over 9000 shares. mostly for vegeta, but also for kakarot. \n\n \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a",

These contracts are typically long term, and take a while to ditch an old partner like McAffee, but once they're in with the Falcon agent, there are a lot of additional upselling opportunities, as they have \"modules\" built on top of their standard offering.  \nI don't see exponential growth, don't get me wrong, but the product is good, and I expect them to be a major player in endpoint security.",

Their annual sales is $1 billion.  It's down 10% due to the pandemic as they own among others things  QNX the tech system for 9 out of the top 10 auto makers whose sales are surging right now and as car's become more integrated they are becoming more like ROKU than Foxconn or anything else we thought it was.  I was an idiot for not realizing this when it was $5 a share.  Long time reader recent member shout out my UGA Dawg who showed me this reddit back in 2015!
