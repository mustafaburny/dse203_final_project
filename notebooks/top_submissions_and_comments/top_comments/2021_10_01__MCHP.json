The labour involved also creates some significant compression on the device margins.  Poet technologies has the ability to manufacture all the required lenses,mirrors, lasers, detectors and such on a tiny ass microchip using standard CMOS manufacturing techniques in hundreds at a time on a silicon wafer, the chips are 1/4 the size of competing devices and have huge 40% margins. It\u2019s why the design wins mentioned above are so important. It is a validation of their core technology. They have upwards of 100 NDAs signed with companies looking to gain a competitive advantage utilizing their products. \n\nThis is just one vertical where the platform technology plays very well. As they target more verticals they will see more companies looking to apply their photonic interposer tech to analogous use cases mentioned above. If this company does it right it will be a major player in multiple multi billion dollar industries. They are also exposed to vertical manufacturing model via a JV with a 15 billion dollar company in China called Sanan IC which really is a defining element of their business at this point, they have the ability to scale and capture market share very very fast because of this.",

        "body": "Possibly Very Bullish Sectors for the Next 3-12 Months Amid Troubled Times. The examples below are certainly not buy recommendations. Just examples.\n\nBelow is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\nAnyway enjoy the dips now because these are likely to get beefed up as the supply chain &amp; worker shortages unwind\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

I got 50,000lbs of vehicles, and so did the dealer down the street. We\u2019ve been competing by selling our vehicles for less than the next guy my entire life, managing expenses and measuring ROI on marketing.\n\nToday and for the last year or so is the the only time period in history where used vehicle values are going up.  If you bought a car 2 years ago,  used it the entire 2 years it\u2019s worth more today than you paid for it.\n\nThe pandemic lead to production shortages AND strain on rental car companies because of less travel.  Hertz even went bankrupt (screwed my dealership out of 11k). Very small number.  In the process they liquidated excess inventory.  Only to have the pandemic go on, and then the global microchip shortage\n\nThe shortage is now so severe the same rental car companies are buying used cars for the first time in history to be able to provide cars for customers.\n\nUsed car prices are through the roof because new cars are a non option.  I normally carry 300 new on the ground and today I think I have 16 sellable new cars.  They aren\u2019t commodities today..if you want my new vehicle\u2026you gotta pay I literally won\u2019t have another for 4 to 6 months.\n\nWith the shortage so sever we\u2019re selling across the US as well.  People are calling dealers across the country and offering 10 or 15k over MSRP and offering to pay their own shipping.\n\nOur expenses haven\u2019t gone up - in fact I\u2019ve cancelled most marketing efforts to the tune of 50 to 75k a month\n\nWe used to make 700ish a car,  on the low end we make 7,000ish per car today..\n\nSome day a year or two from now the switch will flip back..we will be selling commodities again, and I\u2019ll go back to marketing..measuring ROI weekly and expecting 10x the volume from my sales teams to make the same money\n\nAll the while my service and parts businesses have been really hurt by parts delays and constraints or indefinite back orders\u2026as the sales grosses shrink the sales volume will grow and parts and service should be able to pick up the rest.",

The microchip shortage is because _demand_ has spiked faster than supply has _grown_, so thinking that the amount of silver being used has decreased is fucking stupid. But it was even more retarded to think that just because it's used in semis means that semis are the primary driver of the price. Its used in a bunch of shit you fucking moron",

Small periods of sideways movement or short term dips are fine, but sustained downward movements, or big moves down with a new resistance level that is made out of titanium steel is a disaster for a wheel.\n\nAs already noted in another reply, SPY isn't ideal for Wheels for pretty much the reason you already said: since SPY is well diversified, on average SPY is less risky and less risk means less reward. The risk premium on SPY is therefore relatively low.\n\nUsually the best Wheel stocks are dividend paying blue chips, like AAPL, MSFT, JNJ, BLK, XOP, etc. Most people can't afford to wheel those stocks, though, so you need to find lower cost stocks that still have solid growth potential in the short term. Not meme stocks, that's a volatility play. You want steady and predictable, not boom or bust.",

It's hard to predict what happens after 5 years but I wouldn't count out Intel and x86 architecture. x86 laptops have already a similar battery life compared to ARM laptops while having a better performance. Also, Microsoft nor other PC vendors (except for Samsung maybe) are not building their own ARM processors at the moment. Qualcomm is the only player right now and they didn't have great offerings lately, particularly for WoA. AMD is rumored to join Samsung but only for mRDNA 2 GPUs, not CPUs which would be built by Samsung, and their mobile CPUs pale compared to Qualcomm.",

I don't currently own any shares, but I'm rooting for this company longterm because he seems like such a genuinely good natured fellow.\n\nI've daytraded and swing traded the stock a few times. Buying the stock at it's price right now, (around 8 bucks), seems like a screaming steal. You can be conservative with it, and just ride it from $8 to $12. The only real problem is that I do think we're headed for a major correction which is going to see huge megacaps like AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA all down 20 to 25 percent off their all time highs, and what does that mean for a tiny company like HYLN? Could HYLN drop all the way to say 6 bucks a share if the entire market tanks?\n\nThat's really my only hesitation in loading the boat on HYLN. I will say this though, if the market does indeed tank, and HYLN drops to $6, it will be time to buy as many shares as I possibly can stomach.
