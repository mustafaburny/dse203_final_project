They really changed their tune to security this earnings call which basically shows they know that they need to start getting away from pure traffic delivery, but they don\u2019t have anywhere near the security portfolio that Akamai or Cloudflare can offer.  I work in the field and operationally the network is nothing special and they have a huge gap to make up when it comes to being able to compete in the security space.",

        "body": "Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are hardly competitors. They offer cloud infrastructure (API's, virtual boxes, web services, etc. ). Cloudflare and its main competitors, Fastly and Akamai, focus on their Content Delivery Networks (CDN).\n\nAkamai was the first and is the largest CDN, but they use old technology and are making questionable choices for management positions. They are kind of old news.\n\nFastly and Cloudlfare started around the same time, but Cloudflare focused on scale and marketing, while Fastly focused on efficiency.\nFastly has the fewest Point of Presences, but more than made up for it with their incredibly efficient and powerful design. They seem to be dominating in the edge computing world with their compute@edge project, but Cloudflare isnt far behind. Fastly's founder and CEO stepped back last year to focus on the technology. In the past they have struggled to land large contracts due to lack of exposure, but I think their new CEO, and the proven performance are turning that around. Cloudflare is used by a lot of websites, probably most, but to name a few notable contracts for Fastly there is Shopify, Spotify, A&amp;E, Vimeo, Imgur, and many more. Also, to emphasize why Amazon and Microsoft arent competitors, Fastly is used by Github, and at least the Amazon Prime website. Unfortunately, TikTok was their biggest client before politics had to end that, which is a large part of why they missed earnings in Q4. Faslty's business model is also based on usage, which obviously has its pros and cons for the users, but leads toward an unsteady income and a bit of a concern for investors.\n\nCloudflare is way better than Akamai, way larger than Fastly, and more well known than both, but I think they are already the big dog. Sure they will grow, sure they will do well, sure they have more consistent revenue, but Fastly has much more room to grow, and much more reason to. I think Cloudflare is a solid stable company. Fastly has a stronger product, but they havent quiet found the support to become stable yet, I think that is coming.\n\nFastly is my largest holding, but then again I am a noobie, what do I know.",
