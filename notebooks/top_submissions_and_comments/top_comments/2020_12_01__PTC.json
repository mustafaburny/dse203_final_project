Cali sets the precedent for the rest of the world on emissions because of that sweet sweet market share.\n\nCN was supposed to have PTC (positive train control which helps reduce accidents in railroading) equipped and functional on all its locomotives by 2019, and they still aren\u2019t there. We turn it off frequently because of bugs, and half the units crossing Canada don\u2019t have it equipped. The US makes it mandatory, but Canadian units are lagging.\n\n0 net is an extreme scenario, and the railroad is likely to be an exception. These locomotives cost 3-4million, and they are still using units that are 40+ years old. If they don\u2019t get destroyed by some trainee in the yard, they run forever.",
