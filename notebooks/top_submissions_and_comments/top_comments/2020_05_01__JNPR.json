        "body": "*a forewarning I started typing, and went on a bit of a tangent, apologies*\n\nSo I only tested it briefly, but it had pretty good results. I ended up like going mad and just started adding a bunch of different features to the program (ie some balance sheet stripping, getting macro data from the fed, getting performance of various industries via ETFs, etc.). \n\nBut back to the question: it was a bit more of a trend analysis than a stock screener, I just didnt really know how to word it. So in theory, you could use any stock, and it would be able to detect up and down trends in momentum, before typical trend line analysis would (I'm not a huge fan of technical analysis, but admit there are some times where it can be helpful).\n\nSo when I back tested, I tried to use companies I have never traded (I only back tested 2015-2016 to try and get the most similar markets to today without me having too much forward looking bias, since didn't start paying attention to markets/trading until mid 2017). Further more, I was not exposed to price action even in the trading, as the charts I read were derived from a formula to calculate and chart momentum, so it was charts of the stocks relative momentum not stock price. After I completed the year of what dates were buys and what were sells, I went in and found the prices of those days (used closing price for both buying and selling prices).\n\nSo I used the SPX for broad market (even though, I clearly know that this has since gone higher), GDX (which, full disclosure I have briefly traded as a hedge before), and had a list of independent companies, but the only two I got through before going off on my tangent of coding were JNPR, and CERN.\n\nFor the SPX\nI was able to achieve a return of 15.73% through 6 trading \"trips\", while on the year it returned -0.73%.\n\nFor GDX\nI was able to achieve a whopping 121.52% over 6 trading \"trips\" compared to -20.10% year return\n\nFor JNPR\nI was able to achieve (another whopping) 115.32% over 8 trading trips, compared to 25.88% year return.\n\nFor CERN\nI was able to achieve a 76.34% return over 5 trading \"trips\", compared to a -27.16% return on the year.\n\nSo, things to take a way, it was pretty damn successful in the brief back tests I did. However, I noticed pretty quickly it benefits most from short term and intermediate swings in price, which the in the cases of GDX, JNPR, and CERN all were pretty volatile for that year, so the results I achieved from them, I'm expecting, are way above average. Actually the thing that sparked my tangent into other parts of the program was to try and weed out stocks that have high volatility, so i wouldnt have to go through them myself, issue is I didnt stop there. I'm pegging most results to be around that SPX result. Furthermore, this strictly tested against a yearly holding of those stocks, am planning to have someone go through with a regular trendline analysis or something with the same period to get a more accurate result as its performance against some basic analysis techniques.\n\nAs for the process I picked the companies, I used a random organizer to pick 25 S&amp;P companies (made sure they were included in the S&amp;P on the date my back test started) and ran with it. I threw in a few etfs (as shown GDX, but also have TLT, TLH, XLE, XLY, etc. Just havent gotten to them).\n\nEdit: Thanks for the interest in its progress!",

With that they\u2019re able to offer various products for different use cases to a wide range of customers.  Because of their diverse offerings, they compete with quite a few companies both large and small.  For example, they have a CDN product that will compete with Akamai;  infrastructure as a service that will compete with AWS/Azure/GCP (only on storage and compute); security solutions that compete with on-prem hardware companies like Juniper Networks.\n\nThey mention in their 10-K they could potentially compete more and more with large cloud vendors (see IaaS) which could be worrisome. However, they angle themselves as an intermediary between providers in that businesses can avoid vendor lock in  by using cloudflare services to move data between AWS and Azure for example.  To me, that last bit is intriguing. \n\nWhat is worrisome, is the already diminishing returns on their spending on sales and advertising. Their revenue is growing fast, but, their losses are growing faster.  Of course, there could an inflection point where that changes, but, that seems like the biggest issue I would worry about for the time being.  I think a decent business metric to track is how fast they are growing their customer base that spends over $100k per year. \n\n \nI highly suggest reading their 10k to understand the company more.  If you don\u2019t understand the terminology, it could be hard to grasp the technological importance of their services.",

        "body": "VPN for secure communication to the private network. Identity access and authentication management + 2FA, workforce management, and endpoint detection and response for the remote endpoint. For the private network, network detection and response (likely through an mssp), and edge firewalls. Microsegmentation and microservices for the data center / servers, and... For the most part that's good.\n\nAnd as far as the push to edge computing is concerned, if we're still making terminals then it's probably marginal to just build the rest of the computer out and just do it how we have been. Then for any intensive applications use the compute resources on the private network like a render farm.\n\nAs far as who wins the VM play. VMware is expensive. 99% of IT departments don't have even half of what I just outlined above. And there's some really great alternatives that are better in many ways and much more affordable. Big switch networks(now Arista) for cloud fabrics / networking / public-hybrid cloud, Red Hat (now IBM) for open source virtualization, open stack, Fortinet for security, etc. etc \n\nI like VMware, but I just don't see them winning the cloud wars. In my opinion, it's going to be open source providers and enablers like Arista that will win, but even then there's a lot of traditional competitors that could run with it like Cisco, Nokia, Juniper, etc.\n\nBut they did have Velocloud which sold like gangbusters. Although, sdwan is going to move more towards the whitebox virtualized services route.",

You have hugely important R&amp;D work done by companies that used to be very forward moving that are now viewed as old giants like HP or whoever else. You have SRI demo the mouse.

        "body": "&gt; Possible risk factors mostly come from big IT spending being potentially put on hold due to companies having cash flow issues/supply chain issues delaying hardware production (as stated by other networking hardware markers) \u2013 biggest catalysts for a potential dump post ER. Equally could surprise to upside given all the coronavirus related catalysts and low expectations\n\n2 sides of this coin. \n\n1 side--- CapExpeniture is one of the first things cut (well, after corp travel and free coffee, but before eliminating yearly salary increases/ bonuses, and layoffs), especially IT related CapEx, which is a non-revenue generating business unit / group. Companies that were in the shitter pre-Covid wont have the cash/liquidity to spend. \n\nOther Side-- As many companies realize they can still function pretty well without people in the office, many will move to reduce their physical footprint, consolidate offices to a more \"regional\" model where you only go to office for important / customer facing meetings, maybe a project kickoff. To sustain this sort of environment, infrastructure needs to be beefed up to handle increased bandwidth, security, utilization, etc. Companies will save money by spending a little to beef up infrastructure etc compared to their current real estate spend. However, these sort of major upgrades are not a flip the switch / overnight type of implementation, and take time to do right. So companies may take 3-6 months to ramp up capacity, and move to a more remote workforce end of year and into next fiscal year while they exit lease contracts.\n\nA note on WebEx, btw, it is a subscription based service, every user (or individual who can \"host\" a meeting) is a subscription. I do expect  they made beaucoup bucks on this in March).\n\nOverall, very bullish on this industry long term (WSB long term, 6-12 months lol). But it is very competitive and there are multiple players. Cisco has a large market share but Juniper, Huawei, Dell, etc all play in this space and are very aggressive price-wise. \n\nMy position is 6/19 47.5c, will see how much it ramps into earnings, may dump pre-announce if I hit my targeted gain (see the other DD noted, it notoriously dumps post earnings). Longer term, I may buy shares at a lower entry price point.",
