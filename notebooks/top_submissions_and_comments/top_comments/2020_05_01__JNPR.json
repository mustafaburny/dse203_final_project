        "body": "*a forewarning I started typing, and went on a bit of a tangent, apologies*\n\nSo I only tested it briefly, but it had pretty good results. I ended up like going mad and just started adding a bunch of different features to the program (ie some balance sheet stripping, getting macro data from the fed, getting performance of various industries via ETFs, etc.). \n\nBut back to the question: it was a bit more of a trend analysis than a stock screener, I just didnt really know how to word it. So in theory, you could use any stock, and it would be able to detect up and down trends in momentum, before typical trend line analysis would (I'm not a huge fan of technical analysis, but admit there are some times where it can be helpful).\n\nSo when I back tested, I tried to use companies I have never traded (I only back tested 2015-2016 to try and get the most similar markets to today without me having too much forward looking bias, since didn't start paying attention to markets/trading until mid 2017). Further more, I was not exposed to price action even in the trading, as the charts I read were derived from a formula to calculate and chart momentum, so it was charts of the stocks relative momentum not stock price. After I completed the year of what dates were buys and what were sells, I went in and found the prices of those days (used closing price for both buying and selling prices).\n\nSo I used the SPX for broad market (even though, I clearly know that this has since gone higher), GDX (which, full disclosure I have briefly traded as a hedge before), and had a list of independent companies, but the only two I got through before going off on my tangent of coding were JNPR, and CERN.\n\nFor the SPX\nI was able to achieve a return of 15.73% through 6 trading \"trips\", while on the year it returned -0.73%.\n\nFor GDX\nI was able to achieve a whopping 121.52% over 6 trading \"trips\" compared to -20.10% year return\n\nFor JNPR\nI was able to achieve (another whopping) 115.32% over 8 trading trips, compared to 25.88% year return.\n\nFor CERN\nI was able to achieve a 76.34% return over 5 trading \"trips\", compared to a -27.16% return on the year.\n\nSo, things to take a way, it was pretty damn successful in the brief back tests I did. However, I noticed pretty quickly it benefits most from short term and intermediate swings in price, which the in the cases of GDX, JNPR, and CERN all were pretty volatile for that year, so the results I achieved from them, I'm expecting, are way above average. Actually the thing that sparked my tangent into other parts of the program was to try and weed out stocks that have high volatility, so i wouldnt have to go through them myself, issue is I didnt stop there. I'm pegging most results to be around that SPX result. Furthermore, this strictly tested against a yearly holding of those stocks, am planning to have someone go through with a regular trendline analysis or something with the same period to get a more accurate result as its performance against some basic analysis techniques.\n\nAs for the process I picked the companies, I used a random organizer to pick 25 S&amp;P companies (made sure they were included in the S&amp;P on the date my back test started) and ran with it. I threw in a few etfs (as shown GDX, but also have TLT, TLH, XLE, XLY, etc. Just havent gotten to them).\n\nEdit: Thanks for the interest in its progress!",

Identity access and authentication management + 2FA, workforce management, and endpoint detection and response for the remote endpoint. For the private network, network detection and response (likely through an mssp), and edge firewalls. Microsegmentation and microservices for the data center / servers, and... For the most part that's good.\n\nAnd as far as the push to edge computing is concerned, if we're still making terminals then it's probably marginal to just build the rest of the computer out and just do it how we have been. Then for any intensive applications use the compute resources on the private network like a render farm.\n\nAs far as who wins the VM play. VMware is expensive. 99% of IT departments don't have even half of what I just outlined above. And there's some really great alternatives that are better in many ways and much more affordable. Big switch networks(now Arista) for cloud fabrics / networking / public-hybrid cloud, Red Hat (now IBM) for open source virtualization, open stack, Fortinet for security, etc. etc \n\nI like VMware, but I just don't see them winning the cloud wars. In my opinion, it's going to be open source providers and enablers like Arista that will win, but even then there's a lot of traditional competitors that could run with it like Cisco, Nokia, Juniper, etc.\n\nBut they did have Velocloud which sold like gangbusters. Although, sdwan is going to move more towards the whitebox virtualized services route.",

Equally could surprise to upside given all the coronavirus related catalysts and low expectations\n\n2 sides of this coin. \n\n1 side--- CapExpeniture is one of the first things cut (well, after corp travel and free coffee, but before eliminating yearly salary increases/ bonuses, and layoffs), especially IT related CapEx, which is a non-revenue generating business unit / group. Companies that were in the shitter pre-Covid wont have the cash/liquidity to spend. \n\nOther Side-- As many companies realize they can still function pretty well without people in the office, many will move to reduce their physical footprint, consolidate offices to a more \"regional\" model where you only go to office for important / customer facing meetings, maybe a project kickoff. To sustain this sort of environment, infrastructure needs to be beefed up to handle increased bandwidth, security, utilization, etc. Companies will save money by spending a little to beef up infrastructure etc compared to their current real estate spend. However, these sort of major upgrades are not a flip the switch / overnight type of implementation, and take time to do right. So companies may take 3-6 months to ramp up capacity, and move to a more remote workforce end of year and into next fiscal year while they exit lease contracts.\n\nA note on WebEx, btw, it is a subscription based service, every user (or individual who can \"host\" a meeting) is a subscription. I do expect  they made beaucoup bucks on this in March).\n\nOverall, very bullish on this industry long term (WSB long term, 6-12 months lol). But it is very competitive and there are multiple players. Cisco has a large market share but Juniper, Huawei, Dell, etc all play in this space and are very aggressive price-wise. \n\nMy position is 6/19 47.5c, will see how much it ramps into earnings, may dump pre-announce if I hit my targeted gain (see the other DD noted, it notoriously dumps post earnings). Longer term, I may buy shares at a lower entry price point.",

        "body": "My mom looks at her account, and she thinks she has $200K to spend.\n\nShe is CONfident that the balance shown reflects actual currency, even though what she owns is microscopic parts of various companies. She has no idea which, no idea what they do, no idea who is earning real, actual, money off this scam.\n\nOn some levels she grasps that she owns parts of companies, and she assures herself that owning a lot of different stocks protect against wild swings, and instead provide one long, steady 5-10% increase in the number she sees on her screen.\n\nI can explain to her, that there is no safety in diversification if everyone is doing it, and thus the sausage factory is highly correlated with the microchip fab and the company that makes plastic dogshit. I can explain to her that the forward P/E ratio is now (once again) at a record high, so \"buying the dip\" may be a bad move.\n\nShe pays zero attention to it.\n\nAnd it was the right move. Her balance shows $230K now, and in her world she has \"made money\". Never mind that she actually owns the EXACT same basket of companies as before, only these companies are now - in many cases - totally fucked. Loaded to the hilt in debt - debt they accrued before the dip, and debt they have taken on now.\n\nHer, and millions of others, are highly conditioned to believe that a) diversification is magic, and b) if it isn't \"they\" will help us. And this has been proven over and over again.\n\nThe problem is this. Because they have no fucking clue, if that $230K becomes $200K again, and then $180K, and then $160K they WILL pull the trigger. The ONLY reason they have to stay long is that stocks go up.\n\nIf you're 70, and the stock portfolio is falling, you are literally watching your life-quality erode. You have no way of improving the situation, and once the panic spreads I don't think the Federales will be able to stem the tsunami of selling.\n\nMost of these people would prefer seeing 5-10% increase every year, while having the cost of living rise at 10-15%. Than to see 0% increase and having c-o-l stay low.\n\nSo, yeah, it's a con.\n\nBut, never forget, con can run for much longer than you expect. People can act very irrational for a very, very long time. You may never see a return to \"rational\" in your lifetime.",

And thus subject to rules agreed on by the public.\n\nYeah but if I have a business with a storefront. That's my private property and I can do what I want with it. \n\nIf the government wants to shut down court rooms and the DMV, whatever I don't care but the issue is they're telling me I cannot open my hypothetical business which is how I afford to live but they won't do anything about mortgage regulations or banks and credit card companies. The people that are protesting have bills to pay, children to feed, and monetary obligations that aren't going away just because of the Coof. \n\nThe fed reserve printed $3 trillion dollars in a day and Americans got a check for $1200? You realize how fucking stupid that is right? Like do you understand the sheer magnitude of stupidity that it is to print $3 trillion dollars to bail out businesses that don't need the money while the middle class suffers and will eventually have to foot the bill for that when it comes due in a generation or 5?\n\n&gt;restrictive measures against you should be lifted.\n\nThey won't be lifted. \n\nThis is the critical thing that people of your mindset do not seem to understand. Once a government is granted a power, it never rescinds that power back to the people. It literally has never once happened in history. That's why people are pissed, that's why people are protesting and that's why you have armed protesters standing outside of the governor's office. \n\nTemporary restrictions means permanent changes to how the government is allowed to control the population. \n\nWhat's going to happen the next time we have a new and exciting disease? Are we going to have to get mandatory vaccinations that may or may not work? Am I going to have to get a microchip with my ID and medical records so I can get into public buildings? Where does the \"interest of public safety\" stop? The short answer is that it doesn't. \n\nAll I'm going to leave you with is this. Just stop pretending to care about the health and safety of the general population. You probably just got on that train 20 minutes ago and you're going to go right back to not caring as soon as the talking heads tell you it's cool to do so.",

Pretty much every country's military runs windows.\n\nJust listened to the q3 earnings call. Cloud demand is up like crazy right now. So, money is being shifted away from local resources into cloud computing resources. So many of AWS and Azure customers are shifting money into these tech companies. Smaller firms like NetApp, Atlassian, or Slack are seeing sales raise with this new demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, there are entirely new markets for tech that weren't viable pre covid. Consider the NFL, NBA....I can't remember the sport, but they now use MSTeams. Companies are seeing the cost benefits of remote work. Virtual Formula 1 is another example. Things are going to be interesting. To stay competitive, you will need to piviot into this new economic situation. Red Robin is an interesting case study. They cut costs like crazy and embraced off site orders. Or look at Trupanion's 10K. They cut costs and increased cash on hand to a point where they can operate for an entire year w/o income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to remember that there are millions of dollars worth of human intelligence driving the decisions behind each of these Tickers. Boards are made up of people with way way way way more industry knowledge than anyone on reddit. Yes, Tesla exists, and a tweet can swing billions of dollars around the moon, but for the most part, companies are ran by intelligent folks trying their best to make money. That's it. Even if the world is on fire, these people will find a way to sell you insurance on credit. The economy has existed since before the old testament. Exodus 30:11-16  is just ancient hebrew tax law. Even if it's not money, people will find something to trade to create value. The wheel keeps on turning.\n\nEDIT: Totally forgot, look at MSFT 10K. B2B OEM sales are the bread and butter. So you will need to see large retailers (including amazon) collapse before companies like intel and MSFT will feel the big hits.",

        "body": "\nAn update for today: \nFirstly, sorry about planning a stream this evening and not being able to, I got sick. I think the pizza i ate for late lunch may have something to do with it lol. Dumb ass decision by me. So instead I\u2019d at least like to give you an update on my trades this week here and what I\u2019m expecting. I bought TTI at $0.50 last week and sold at $0.40 today for a loss. MVIS SMASHED through my price target of $0.62. I was planning on TTI moving higher today and then moving into MVIS. TTI went totally soft on me and no amount of foreplay could get it up again.  Risked 5% into MVIS at $0.90, saw continued higher movement, risked another 5% at around $0.94, saw MORE movement into $1.00 and bought more at $1.05. My average price is $0.98 with 15% of my account at  risk (way too high but yolo sometimes ya know?) now onto the chart: this is called a pennant continuation pattern, and taking the arrow (initial move up) and using it as a target for our next move up puts us at $1.62 next target. It\u2019s already broken out of that pattern to the upside. $1.62 is also perfectly at monthly resistance (black line). $1.27 was original Fibonacci extension target, but it\u2019s already smashed through that after hours. So who the hell really knows at this point. The fact that mvis had 200,000,000 volume today and was the highest volume in all of the stock market today makes me think that my targets are still too conservative. But I\u2019ve already profited 48.3% on this one trade so I\u2019m going to start locking in profits as we move into Thursday. If you\u2019re looking at getting into this trade, I would suggest buying on dips after you see a bullish reversal candle on the one hour chart, and set your price target to where your reward is higher than your risk. Not financial advice though, I\u2019m not buying any more shares of this. Thursday evening I\u2019m thinking we can do a weekly recap stream and everyone is invited to come chill and bask in all our new tendies. Cheers!",

We must also acknowledge that wages even for salaried folk have stagnated, and it totally fueled the gig economy and all its obnoxious startups because people commonly need a side gig now just to help save for a home or retirement. Not to mention there's no such thing as job security even when the economy was doing well, so people need to diversify their income. I really don't think people with stable jobs that truly pay cost of living to the standards of their parents and grandparents would be interested in hosting on Airbnb otherwise.

CHGG and W calls should have been obvious plays, but like black swans they were completely invisible to me.\n\nI spent more time watching +- 0.1% movements on futures than I did thinking about general trends and plays that seem obvious 100 baggers in hindsight. Nevertheless, the last 2 months were very entertaining thanks to WSB and I made money while having fun.\n\nMy short break from trading is helping me recognize plays that typically fly under the radar. I have been reading the Black Swan, Fooled by Randomness, the Box, and AnitFragile, they have helped me systemize my thought process and bring more clarity to my life and to my trading.\n\nAs always, thanks for the laughs kind autists. See you soon. Watch out for my DDs :)",

In addition the vaccine news seems disappointing thus far. An 8-person study on the Moderna vaccine is meaningless when so many hurdles lie between that and eventually administering billions of doses to the general population. It\u2019s like the difference between a baby taking his first steps and Usain Bolt running the 100m. \n\nAnother issue is vaccine safety. Medications that take years to develop and look great in phase 3 can turn out to be quite horrible once distributed. Take Fen-Phen and Vioxx for example. There\u2019s going to be a lot of caution about administering a vaccine that only has months of safety data. I\u2019m a proponent of vaccination. But I would be nervous about receiving something in December that was conceived in January. This is assuming a vaccine can even be made.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about how this virus will evolve either. I trust the experts who say it will persist. So I take the persistence of the virus, the lack of a clear treatment/vaccine potential, and most of all, our government\u2019s poor response as reasons to be in cash for a while.

But honestly a lot of it was just built on old traditions and wasn't/isn't necessary.  I am seeing early signs that the younger generation (40-50 y/o) of execs is using coronavirus as a way to make 80% WFH and virtual meetings permanent.  It's becoming much easier to measure performance and impact quantitatively now whereas before it was largely based on travel schedule and face time (both of which involved so much wasted time/time lost).  If the top banks, consulting companies, and tech companies adopt a 2-3 day/week WFH policy as standard then the rest of the corporate world has to follow.  It will be interesting to watch.",
