Made 20 grand long on Tesla shares and then Tesla puts end of day today on some quick whatever trades. \n\n And then one of my covid patients died. It was expected, but sad. Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day. It has for 5 years and still does now. Love you guys. Stay safe.",

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",

        "body": "A) I think you underestimate the impact this virus had on the \\*global\\* supply chain. Saying it is priced in is retarded because we don't even know what the exact impact is yet. We know it's very bad; we just don't know if it's bad or horrible yet. But consider this. Stock market is down around 25% now. Almost an entire quarter (so far) has seen, based on current estimates, somewhere between a 60-80% reduction in supply chain. Since we don't know what the future holds, I think 25% down is pretty accurate. If this continues even more and further disrupts the supply chain, well then the market will fall even more.\n\nB) You are forgetting that the market was already **waaaaaaaay** overvalued. I cannot stress the word \"waaaaaaaay\" enough. Even for the best performing stonks which can't go tits up both short and long term (MA for example) was severely overpriced. And even after their 20% reduction in price, they are still overvalued by **a lot**. Maybe you are right and the market goes up on Monday but over the next 1-2 months the probability of it continuing its overall downtrend is pretty high (fuck off **\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b**s).\n\nC) Black swan event as another Redditor mentioned already. We can't predict these things but when they happen, falls tend to be much more than your usual \"correction.\" Add in the fact this is not only an economic problem (supply chain) but a medical one as well with no vaccine/shot as of yet (and still no understanding of how to combat it), and it's not a pretty situation.\n\nDonald Pump and the medical community are trying to downplay this by comparing it to the regular flu, where roughly 80K people/year die from it. However, beervirus has a 2-3% death rate while the regular flu has a 0.1% death rate. Additionally and more importantly, the flu doesn't spread like this new one. When have you EVER heard of someone in California getting the flu and people in bumblefuck Latvia are worried about that person in Cali? Never. This IS something different than the regular flu. Again, you may be right about Monday specifically, but I don't see how the market recovers over the next 1-2 months (at least).",

And I doubt even 5% of those with symptoms are self quarantining.\n\nThe hype is overdone and the hysteria of COVID is more damaging to the population as a whole than the virus itself.\n\nIf you are a boomer, elderly or immunocompromised you could suffer physically but the rest of us won\u2019t. \n\nIn 28 days the virus will have run its course globally and 90% of those who could have died from it will have.\n\nThe hysteria is because of media clickbait and attention grabbing.\nOld people all die of something.

If its a new strain of a common virus it gets blasted everywhere.\n\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nGives some base rate statistics of how many fatalities this new strain causes vs the flu. You can also see the mortality is all clustered in the elderly.\n\nBy the way only the N95 masks provides any viable air filtration of the virus and that only lasts for 30 min of use, after which the filter is spent. Any other mask is a placebo.

        "body": "Hey guys, \n\nI don't know if this is the right place, but we own a facility that manufactures n95 masks (and on approx. March 15th, we'll also produce surgical masks) in China (Zaozhuang, Shandong specifically). We have a 500,000sq ft facility with a dedicated ISO class 5 Cleanroom for our 300,000 daily n95 production capabilities (and 1MM masks a day for surgical masks once it's at full operation) and we are taking bulk orders (10,000 pc minimum) for shipment within China, our clients are usually in charge of export as there simply isn't enough time for our limited employees to deal with exports. We supply to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in China called XiuZheng pharmaceutical group \u4fee\u6b63\u96c6\u56e2 and have sold millions of our n95 respirators to them. We also supply millions of n95 respirators to Xiaomi \u5c0f\u7c73, the phone company. We've had clients export to Russia, HK and US, though I'm not quite sure the exact logistics they went through. Some clients use freight forwarding companies.\n\nThe material costs have tripled in the last month alone so our masks are currently more expensive than usual, but people are nonstop purchasing due to the shortages. Hopefully we can help you get what you're looking for.  \n\nOur current pricing for n95 mask is 14rmb ($2 USD equivalent) for smaller orders of 10,000pcs+, 13 rmb ($1.86) for 50,000+, 12 rmb ($1.72) for 100,000pcs+, 11rmb ($1.57) for 1,000,000+ and 10rmb for 10,000,000+. This does not include shipping cost by SF Express which will be Cash on Delivery. It also does not include 10% taxes if applicable. Please keep in mind that material prices are constantly shifting so this may be out of date when you see this. Just two weeks ago (2/12/2020) our price per N95 mask was 18rmb while our prices in January was 4rmb! Once materials run out we cannot purchase them unless we pay a crazy amount for example, one ton of raw material used to cost 20,000 rmb, now for the same ton of n95 material costs 380,000-800,000 rmb, which is literally up to 40 times the cost for the same exact material. There is a global shortage of n95 grade materials.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me on Wechat or Whatsapp if you want to place orders. \n\nMy Wechat ID is: franktsaur and my WhatsApp ID is +16269916596. I am based in Los Angeles, but I work with the Asia team remotely. \n\nSincerely, \nFrank T.",

I've never done puts before, just did a couple hours of research on them so I feel comfortable now to try it out even if I lose a few hundred dollars.",

Get it done in federal - disability money garnished at 25% for 10 years, then debt forgiven and IRS taxes the forgiven amount. Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle. Gonna need a super lawyer to keep it in state as I stayed in CA the entire time, opened the account in CA, and TDA has state presence by having physical retail buildings so are bound to state creditor laws. \n\n# TL;DR\nMay be paying a lawyer 100k-1m to not owe 1m to keep it in state court, lol.

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",
