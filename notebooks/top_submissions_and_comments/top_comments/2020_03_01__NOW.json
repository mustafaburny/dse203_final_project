Behind the scenes, the online brokerage was already bracing for financial strains.\n\n&gt;\tRobinhood drew its entire $200 million credit facility from Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., according to people familiar with the matter. It made the move just as fears of the coronavirus set off more than two weeks of violent market swings and heavy volume, during which Robinhood\u2019s trading platform suffered three significant outages.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cOur capital position remains strong,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based firm said in an emailed statement, saying the decision to borrow predated and was entirely unrelated to the outages. \u201cWe determined it was prudent to draw on our credit line during the week of Feb. 24 in light of market volatility. That capital was returned in full last week.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tIt said it\u2019s not unusual for companies to take precautionary measures during such market conditions.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cCompanies don\u2019t tap their credit line unless they need to,\u201d said David Ritter, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who spoke generally about the issue without commenting directly on Robinhood. When companies do, it\u2019s \u201cperhaps not a good signal with regard to their cash burn, which could make creditors nervous.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tRepeated Outages\n\n&gt;\tIn the days since it tapped the line of credit, Robinhood\u2019s platform has repeatedly gone dark for more than an hour at a time, including an outage March 2 that spanned an entire U.S. trading session, in which the S&amp;P 500 surged 4.6%.\n\n&gt;\tRobinhood said last week that a confluence of factors -- record account sign-ups along with highly volatile and historic market conditions -- led to unprecedented stress on the firm\u2019s infrastructure.\n\n&gt;\tThat heavy load caused the so-called Domain Name System, or DNS, to fail. The system is essentially the phone book that computers use to turn a domain name into an IP address, and it\u2019s how users access websites around the world.\n\n&gt;\tOn Monday, Robinhood faced a fresh breakdown as U.S. stocks plunged. Stocks tumbled so hard they set off a market-wide trading halt minutes after the open. And by day\u2019s end, the S&amp;P 500 was down 7.6%, the worst performance since the depths of 2008\u2019s financial crisis.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cWe know this interruption was frustrating for our customers -- especially after last week and on a day that trading was halted,\u201d the company said in the statement. \u201cOur platform is now fully operational and we\u2019re working hard to improve our service during these historic and volatile market conditions.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tThe firm declined to comment further on what sparked Monday\u2019s disruption.\n\n&gt;\tEngineering Focus\n\n&gt;\tRobinhood, founded in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, pioneered commission-free trading, a move that\u2019s since been copied by larger online brokers including Charles Schwab Corp. The startup has attracted 10 million users and is now backed by venture capital firms including Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia, garnering a valuation of $7.6 billion.\n\n&gt;\tThe company has been increasingly focused on improving the reliability of its service in recent years, and in mid-2018 hired Adam Wolff from Facebook Inc. to lead its squad of engineers.\n\n&gt;\tWhen Wolff joined, Robinhood\u2019s entire engineering workforce was the size of the group of specialists he\u2019d led at Facebook, he previously said. He has been focused on adding staff and last month hired former Facebook colleague Paul Tarjan.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cAn area where we plan to focus is one we continue to invest in heavily as a company -- compliance,\u201d Wolff said in a blog post announcing the hiring. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to our focus on our customers and our ability to safely and confidently move forward as a firm.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tShaken Confidence\n\n&gt;\tSoftware mishaps have rocked Robinhood before. In late 2018, the company\u2019s options trading service had an outage that locked consumers out of their accounts and stopped them from closing positions. Employees had to call affected clients to apologize, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n&gt;\tFor its latest outages, Robinhood has created a dedicated customer service team to work directly with customers, the company said in a statement. The impact among customers \u201cvaries significantly due to the nature of our business,\u201d it said.\n\n&gt;\tThe latest technology problems have drawn the attention of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which has been in touch with Robinhood on the matter, according to a spokeswoman for the brokerage regulator. The firm previously agreed to pay $1.25 million to the watchdog for allegedly failing to ensure customers received best prices for securities orders. It didn\u2019tadmit or deny the allegations when settling the complaint.\n\n&gt;\tFinancial technology startups can risk eroding customer trust with outages, said John Bartleman, president of TradeStationGroup Inc., a rival online trading firm.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller fintech startup, your reputation is everything,\u201d he said \u201cIf you can\u2019t get in, you lose all trust in a brand.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tA growing number of Robinhood users on social media have been reporting trouble with closing their accounts. They\u2019re also criticizing the $75 fee associated with the transferring to another platform.\n\n&gt;\tPankaj Sharma, a New Jersey IT professional with a $70,000 Robinhood account, said he sent an email to the company when he realized the site was down March 2, but didn\u2019t receive a response until after the market closed. He\u2019s now considering moving his money to a different brokerage.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cIt\u2019s really shaken my confidence,\u201d he said by phone.",

Now that the virus is just ramping up in the US and parts of Europe, the demand side of the economy is going to suffer.Any companies or industries that were struggling, slowing, or on the verge of being insolvent are going to crash.\n\nThe virus' impact could be much greater in the US too. Americans suffer from an over-sized sense of independence/self-reliance which will result in a less unified response and likely allow the virus to spread further because the citizens won't allow their liberties to be infringed. Add to that a working class that has tons of debt and cant afford to take days off work and you've got yourself a nice recipe for disaster.\n\nFactor in all the other economic data and it's hard to see how this isn't headed for a cliff.\n\nTL;DR SPY 290P 5/15",

Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

A year ago they had no viable offerings for a good CPU (fx was dated af and not a contender, dont tell me about the fx series as an offering) and their best GPUs were weaker and not as cost effective as nVidias. The best they had was low to medium performance options for both markets. This has been their position with respect of Intel and nVidia for a long time. Now their CPUs are king and their GPUs are competitive, even lacking a flagship as powerful as the 2080 or 2080ti. \n\nThey have rapidly transitioned from a sustained underdog position to a real tooth and nail competitor. If we assume that this trend will continue does it not stand to reason that their share price should also continue to perform as they seize a greater market share?\n\nThis of course says nothing about server and console hardware, which im less familiar with but i hear they're doing well in those sectors as well.",
