The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase. Why can't we have it globally?",

Other licensees can only sell reference CPU designs with little changes.\n\nThe M1 is a great design but it's nothing that AMD and Intel can't do in the PC market on their own. AMD already does this for game consoles. they don't even need to go to ARM to get most of the M1's performance gains. the PS5 and Xbox Series X are perfect proof.",

KO has been consistently growing the past years and it as a bit higher dividend\n3. The main reason is because I am a broke college student and I am already invested in two other stocks (JNJ &amp; QCOM) that are around $150.00 for a share. I can\u2019t to afford to have 3 stocks all around $150.00 in my portfolio. KO is only a little over $50.00 rn so its cheap and reliable.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about your portfolio or what kind of investing you do and I am also not a financial advisor.

        "body": "My reserve unit is in the bay area, and my unit is cyber. So.. most of my colleagues are either working in non-cleared tech in the bay area, or in defense contracting in a cleared position. Those utilizing their clearance overwhelmingly make more money than those working at big tech companies in the bay, and like I said, it doesn't matter whether you're talking about with or without a degree, it matters that you're comparing apples to apples. The fact that I know three people, two at google, one at salesforce, all with bachelors degrees making less than six figs and working their asses of in the Bay Area tells me a lot. Half the reason I joined is because my transfer was accepted to a university in the bay and saw a lot of my older classmates graduating and celebrating their new job making 60k.. in silicon valley.. that was over 5 years ago now, but not a lot has changed thanks to an incredible amount of people getting into coding and tons of H1B visa workers keeping wages down. It's very competitive, and I see some of my reservist buddies working their asses off in big tech to make about half what I make..  and my job is pretty gravy. There is a higher cap when it comes to tech, but those people making 300-500k a year are not very common, they are the top of their game and you're talking 10+ years experience with grad school and they are working their asses off. 800k.. that is entirely unrealistic and probably less than .01% of people working in tech in the bay area. I think people are a little out of touch with the reality here and watch a lot of movies. A cursory search of average salaries in San Jose, SF, and Santa Clara will tell you that the median salary for a computer programmer is about 78k even in these areas. I'm not super familiar with the DC area, but I have a few people working cyber as their civilian job as contractors and a few in government  agencies making around 300k once you factor in COL allowances, but they usually have 12+ years experience and a grad degree.. but far less competition in the workplace. For my contracting job, I'm more sysad than I am cyber, which is kind of funny since my only 'experience' for getting this job was my 6 month A school.. which was just cyber. Anyway, the guys who have been here for 10+ years max out around 300k a year. Not 500k a year, but you can buy a lakeside 2,500sqft house out here in the high 300k range so I would say it evens out at least. One complaint I also hear a lot about working in big tech in silicon valley from some of my reservist colleagues is the office politics.. especially at Salesforce and Google.. apparently it's cutthroat and they hate how much backstabbing goes on. I don't really have to deal with any of that at my location.. just super chill vets and reservists here and people look out for each other, but I have no idea what it's like at other locations, especially east coast. I'm always on the search of course and if some day I can make the same amount with the same qualifications and not have to maintain this clearance the rest of my life, then I would probably jump on that opportunity, but I don't see that as the reality. It seems like tech wages will continue to be suppressed outside of the cleared domain. I think going forward this issue will only become worse and having a clearance will become more valuable. I was offered a job at Amazon DoD services, but they wanted a Full Scope Poly in addition to a TS, and I, having only a CI poly didn't want to deal with that.. but the pay is lucrative for someone with very little experience just because the pool of people they can pull from is so limited. Scarcity creates value. I would seriously not be so quick to advise someone with a clearance to just throw it away.. it could ruin them financially.",

India, east Asia, and many places in europe still. The CEO, Brian Foote, is on record saying that we wanted to go the OTC route in order to give the average investor a chance to build wealth, not just the institutions. The whole idea of this operation to help wealth find its way into everybody's hands. Being able to pay and recieve money via borderless transactions and microscopic fees helps keep money,in the hands of the buyers and sellers, not the middle man like visa. \n\nDo your own DD. Just want to put this on your radar. Its a hold. Anything around .18 or .19 is a great spot. My dip a tad lower but one more PR and its gone again. Its holding its support though, which should tell you something. People are trying to short it but can't. If it was a garbage stock it would be back below 5 cents already. Remember TLSS? Went from nothing to 22 cents and then took a nosedive right back. This isn't that. That's all. I've made my nut. Just trying to spread the wealth.",

        "body": "&gt; Second, the majority of exchanges these days aren\u2019t sketchy. They are regulated \n\nFor real?  I understood Bitcoin is still unregulated.  Are you absolutely sure about that?\n\n&gt; Is PayPal sketchy?\n\n\nWell, from my experiencing using it to sell things, hell yes, PayPal is sketchy.  They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it\u2019s easy from there; what task isn\u2019t tough at first?It\u2019s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it\u2019s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",
