Small number of clients still and lower contract value vs PLTR but not government and not consulting business. i.e actual fucking growth potential.\nThey not only operate in same space but also face some of the same challenges, namely scaling down their product offering so it can address a broader market.\n\nInitial investors include MSFT and Blackrock at IPO. Underwritten by Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan/BofA. Founder is Tom Siebel of Seibel fame (yes, that POS Oracle software but whatever).\n\nIPO price if it actually lists at that will be about an 11x multiple of sales which is very reasonably priced.\n\nMake no mistake this is a better buy than PLTR ever was.",

IHL also reported that the number of chains adding stores in 2019 has increased 56%, while the number of closing stores has decreased by 66% in the last year.\"\n\nit should be noted that GME is closing between 400 and 450 stores though:\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/09/10/investing/gamestop-store-closures/index.html\n\ni've also looked at several stores that are within the \"specialty retail\" group:\n\nhttps://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_specialtyretail&amp;o=pc\n\nsorted by price-to-cash (P/C). a lot of them had great earnings in the last quarter, and many went up after. GME is the cheapest in the group in terms of P/C ratio, perhaps indicating a degree of upside\n\nfurther, MIK and BBW have earnings on dec. 3rd\n\nmaybe, *maybe*, completely guessing: their earnings might provide an indication of what will happen with GME on dec. 8, ah\n\nalthough, that should be combined with the fact that it's a console-release year, along with the fact that gaming is a massive and growing industry",

They belong in your retirement account and you check on them a few times per year.\n\nIf your source of income comes from working, you should be dedicating a portion of your paycheck to your retirement account - and a portion to your YOLO account.\n\nAs money shows up in your YOLO account, you light that fuse and pray for it to be a bottle rocket. If it explodes in your face, you wait until next payday. If it's a bottle rocket - you send 75% of those profits off to pasture (i.e. lock it up in a retirement account). The other 25% is a bonus bet you get to make, instead of having to wait for another paycheck.\n\nYou want to be playing with underlyings that are just stupid, volatile and wild. Super high IV when it's not earnings time. The ones that just make no sense, and they're swinging up and down violently every day. The more drama, the better. If you were betting on a horse, you don't want the big stud horse that everyone is betting on because the payout sucks. You want the horse that stopped in the middle of the last race to eat the shit on the ground from the horses in front of it. The one that has tourette syndrome. You want... the [Becky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFs9jLN4siQ&amp;ab_channel=dnasewell) version of a horse. You will have no damn clue where it's going, but it's going somewhere - and fast. It's the unexpected move.\n\nWhen you buy that cheap OTM, and Becky happens to pop off while she's carrying you in Geralds bucket - you're turning that $100 into $10k. Risk $100 to make $10k? Fuck yes, all day long. Except, you can't do it with just any stock. It needs to be a Becky stock. (Can someone make me a meme of this, please?) How do you find Becky stocks?

My guess would be the next buy in could be double last week\u2019s (7%) upping his totally ownership to 20%.\n\nThis is just such a perfect timing technically (cup and handle forming since Dec. 1), sales numbers coming up (I suspect it\u2019ll come next week), and then the conference. \n\nThey also probably don\u2019t want each news to overshadow each other - they would want to jump off each other to build the momentum. I suspect 13D filing early next week to jump start the momentum, sales numbers mid-late next week to sustain the momentum, and the the conference the week after that for a complete explosion.",

Safe to touch by hand and very flexible installation and remodelling. With the expected beating CRE and retail will take, flexibility is gonna become top priority. Also, constuction can be done by dummies instead of certified$$$ electicians. Copper isn't gettin any cheaper either so costs might not be too crazy over time.\n\nSetting a Google alert for any news on this one. Any IPO or acquisition is gonna do bonkers numbers.",

He held  1200~ or some shares with like a $1~ average per cost. When we checked his history man legit opened the account a month or two before the IPO and bought 100 shares and diamond handed(or forgot??).
