It seems you were just riding momentum.\n\nI own CRWD, and I still believe in it. Right now, it has a polarizing view. The stock tanked because JP lowered the PT to $250 and marked it as underperform. But similarly, Mizuho has a PT of $360 with a buy rating.\n\nCRWD won't release Q3 numbers until December 1. Their last 10Q was on September 1: https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/9601/html\n\nTheir revenue is up 70% from the same quarter a year ago comparing 2021 and 2020. They're on target for 1.1Bn in revenue for 2021 with a P/S of 50. They have margins of 70%. Compare that to NET which has revenue targets for 2021 of $660M with margins of 79% with a P/S of 100.\n\nBoth are highly valued, but if you believe that security is a secular tailwind and CRWD's cloud security offering is competitive you should stick with it.\n\nHere is CRWD's investor presentation: https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/547e5c92-3594-4eef-9dfc-9eca37b635f4\n\nHere is ZS: https://ir.zscaler.com/static-files/9ced1dd4-29b7-4892-80e1-bcb2fe0169da\n\nHere is PANW: https://s22.q4cdn.com/606234439/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Q4'21-Earnings-Presentation-vF-(1).pdf\n\nAgain, not to be a jerk, but if you read those presentations and you can't tell the difference in the offerings between those companies I would consider getting out of the space. Only invest in industries you understand, so you can pivot and adapt appropriately.",

For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",
