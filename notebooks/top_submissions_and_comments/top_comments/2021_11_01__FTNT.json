        "body": "Why did you buy CRWD if you don't know the difference between them and ZS, FTNT, PANW, NET, etc?\n\nI'm not trying to shame, but I would do more research on understanding why you're owning a stock. It seems you were just riding momentum.\n\nI own CRWD, and I still believe in it. Right now, it has a polarizing view. The stock tanked because JP lowered the PT to $250 and marked it as underperform. But similarly, Mizuho has a PT of $360 with a buy rating.\n\nCRWD won't release Q3 numbers until December 1. Their last 10Q was on September 1: https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/9601/html\n\nTheir revenue is up 70% from the same quarter a year ago comparing 2021 and 2020. They're on target for 1.1Bn in revenue for 2021 with a P/S of 50. They have margins of 70%. Compare that to NET which has revenue targets for 2021 of $660M with margins of 79% with a P/S of 100.\n\nBoth are highly valued, but if you believe that security is a secular tailwind and CRWD's cloud security offering is competitive you should stick with it.\n\nHere is CRWD's investor presentation: https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/547e5c92-3594-4eef-9dfc-9eca37b635f4\n\nHere is ZS: https://ir.zscaler.com/static-files/9ced1dd4-29b7-4892-80e1-bcb2fe0169da\n\nHere is PANW: https://s22.q4cdn.com/606234439/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Q4'21-Earnings-Presentation-vF-(1).pdf\n\nAgain, not to be a jerk, but if you read those presentations and you can't tell the difference in the offerings between those companies I would consider getting out of the space. Only invest in industries you understand, so you can pivot and adapt appropriately.",

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

Switched to spreads and thought of doing PUt credit spreads and iron condors. Took positions in GPN, CAR thinking they were the safest play ( what could go wrong with AVIS). Oh well ran up 300% the day after earnings. Last week took apple bear credit spread and guess what , ALL TIME HIGH :) so not sure if anything wrong with my trading or just bad luck ! \n\nAre you still doing spreads ?",

I was blown away that Zuck did not even once mention it. they are basically making a more modern version of this, and they are going to try to shove their oculus to everyone's face. \n\nThe value proposition is valid, it is that 3d gaming is the future of social chatter. \n\nThe VR push  however is going  to be a major flop. No amount of high tech is going to change the fact that a blindfold is not something you want to wear for long. Also, Facebook sells attention, and AR is the opposite of attention, it's distraction. \n\nUnity will benefit enormously from this,  but mobile gaming will lose a lot of momentum for a long time. \n\nHere is what people buy in second life: Avatars, avatar skins, avatar clothes, penises, vaginas, sexy clothes, even more sexy clothes. Basically take the most superficial and vain doll-dressing app and pump it up by 10 times or so, that's the future. No, it won't be the hub for tech and work and education and research, it will be as vapid and vain as facebook and instagram are now. \n\nFacebook will probably push its own, controlled and censored \"crypto\" to people. This will be their most controversial move,  but maybe their lobbyists are already in agreement with US govt. This is about ensuring that the next global payments system is controlled by the US govt.",

Never say never, Intel is going to have to take on massive debt, in addition to the 30B they carry at present, to fund IDM2.0. If the CFO is looking for cash the dividend is easy pickings.\n\nTheir new weird CEO has stated intc is aiming for leadership in 2025, 3-4 years away. One thing to remember is this super cycle aside, the semiconductor biz is cyclical, boom and bust.
