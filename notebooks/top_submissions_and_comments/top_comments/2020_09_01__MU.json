Qualcomm has made me a lot recently. \n\nAs for how how ATVI will perform under a correction, I think it will fare better than most. The minor pullback today didn't phase atvi and it feels almost impervious* (I know it's not). It is at ATH levels so that is a risk, but it's fundamentals make it not crazy overvalued going into its best holiday season. Santa comes recession or not. If trump is reelected tech stocks should stay afloat into the winter (not an economist) and if biden wins, he'll give everyone enough money to buy a console and blow a wad on microtransactions.\n\nNot quite sure what you mean by selling covered puts. \n\nI do see a long play in chevron and I'll look that up, thanks.",
