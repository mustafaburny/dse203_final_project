I'm long on Microsoft. I think Nadella has worked wonders, I'm totally into their entire game plan. They have a diversified product line and a great balance sheet. They are right up their with JNJ in terms of credit rating and reliability right now.\n\nBut this is one of those times where I think the charts speak for themselves. Everybody is thinking the same thing. And when everybody is thinking and buying the same things, they get overbought fast. Does that make it a BAD bet? No. Is it an inefficient investment dollar for dollar at the moment? I think so. There were a couple buys for me over the last few weeks. Even into last week I was buying EA, ATVI, and CSCO. \n\nI think if somebody were twisting my arm to buy something this week it would be CSCO but honestly, I stopped buying last week. At this point I'm hedging bets with puts. The greed and bullish sentiment in the market, the speed of that sentiment turn around has me spooked. Good things happen, but not that fast they don't. There's possibly still some value buys out there, but they won't be in any of the common names, you're going to really have to be digging around in the dirt for them. I think better buys are in the near future so I'm mostly in a holding position. I'm not necessarily offloading overbought shares because I'm not strapped for cash, but I'm feeling pretty risk averse at the moment.",

I think MS and WFC are great buys as well and lower price per share that also have dividends. WFC is under 27$ and pays you .51cents a share.. that's 7.5% annual interest on your money! Quite a deal.\n\nI'd personally avoid DIS, price per share is too high and their main revenue streams won't be back for awhile.\n\nCan't go wrong with Microsoft. Expensive though. Since Zooms security issues and Microsoft Teams becoming the main software for professional video conferences recently helps too.\n\nMy father is a professional trader, he loves TWTR. He always says even the president is on it constantly. However, I have my reservations. It kind of bothers me they dont offer any kind of dividend.\n\nI think you should take a look at adding one of the big oil companies like XOM. My theory is, the problem with crude oil the country is facing is going to bankrupt a lot of the small oil companies. XOM is a giant and can easily absorb all of their assets and get even bigger. (Same with CVX, but the price per share is double.)\n\nThis is the best time to start investing! Don't sit on the sidelines too long! We might see a small retracement towards the lows that happened on March 23rd, but I dont think it will get all the way back down there. This pandemic has created amazing buying opportunities for us younger people.

Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

Had TRTX, TWO, RC, RWT, and AHH. When the market topped on those guys a little over a week ago (EDIT: holy hell, time is distorted, that was two weeks ago!!), I exited RWT and RC, cut down on AHH.\n\nDid the same thing with tech stocks. Still holding all my CSCO, but sold off my T and WDC entirely.\n\nI don't like to be too far into any one sector. When i trim down my positions in a sector, I try to identify the weakest companies and trim them the hardest.\n\nIt's the same logic, just applied to the tankers. I've always lerved NAT because they're my kinda people when it comes to dividends so they get a free pass. Stayed in TNP because I got them dirt cheap. The only one I really regret parting with is TNK after it hit its previous peak, which was a downright stupid move.\n\nIn other words, it was part of a larger strategy rather than a condemnation of any specific tanker play.\n\nFTR, I took a flyer on TOPS at $0.26.

IT departments everywhere will just add it on their Office subscriptions.\n\nI'm not short based on the security problem. Look at a 5 year graph of EFX (Equifax). You can see the cliff where they announced their loss. But anyone shorting after that announcement never made money. Target and Marriott have also had multiple large breaches and customers and investors didn't run away from those companies over those issues.\n\nI don't care about P/E ratio either. Of course E is minuscule when the company is hyper-growing. But I do care about price/revenue. $30 billion (now $40 billion) for revenue of $0.8 billion per year is just too much.\n\nAcquisitions: Microsoft, Google, and Cisco are all gunning for this market. Two of those companies have the consumer platform and business platform to reach everyone with a computer or a phone. They are competing with Zoom, not seeking to acquire it (not any more, that is. Story is that Microsoft tried before the IPO but Yuan preferred not to sell. Looks like that is working out well for him.) Facebook or Apple might want to buy into this market. But I don't think these companies like to pay tens of billions for anything, except for Whatsapp. If Zoom is the next Whatsapp, well, I'm cooked.\n\nMeanwhile, that competition from Microsoft and Google puts a lid on the price that Zoom can charge.",

I like the simplicity of focusing on the overall market or sector.\n\nRight now I'm looking into JETS, it tracks the airline industry. Buying into the index helps reduce the risk of any bankruptcies.",

The US real estate bubble of 2006 only cost like 25% of the GDP.\n- Horrible demographics: Japan is projected to lose another 30 million people, or 30% of its population, over next several decades.

However, I do believe that CSOD will see better in growth in this arena than others (not necessarily Citrix, whatabeast, long after earnings again). \n\nI do agree this is a short term play, I am intending on jumping out when my risk tolerance hits. Hopefully this play is smart and makes a fair percentage, and I believe it will. It's nice to catch a stock before it's bull-run and I really think this has potential to do that. I am likely going to split my investment into stocks (2.5k) and slowly ease into more calls (5k total, 1.5k now) if the trend is correct. For what it is worth, this following research has given me more belief that a solid recovery is about to occur.\n\n&gt; Saba acquisition has provided additional insights on improving operational efficiency, which is driving further operating margin improvement. \n\n&gt; Saba acqusition will not be a full tax-payer until 2023\n\n&gt; They believe that the Saba acquisition will cause their standalone unlevered free cash flow to be meaningfully higher than current estimations ($150M)\n\n&gt; AWS credits that were modeled as expenses\n\n&gt; Certain 2019 Capital expenditures will not be present in 2020\n\n&gt; \"And we did see some signs of good momentum going into 2020 for Japan. But I'd say APJ was mixed because of Japan's performance.\"\n\n&gt; \"we do have a plan to hit the rule of 40 in 2020 on a standalone basis and we expect to significantly exceed our original cash flow target, which was $150 million. If you recall a couple of years ago, we laid that out we expect to be meaningfully above that\"\n\n&gt; Literally they hired, AlixPartners, a world-class consulting firm with particular expertise in performance improvement and cost optimization.\n\n&gt; its Q1 subscription revenue guidance calls for 10.5% y/y growth, which means that Cornerstone is planning for roughly 30% margins in 2020 (was 10% or something)\n\n&gt; most of Cornerstone's annual revenue is already locked in\n\n&gt; consolidated 2019 results suggest Saba will net roughly $250 million in annual subscription revenue for the company. Saba is also expected to \"substantially increase unlevered free cash flow\".\n\n&gt; Saba will at least increase market share in their respective markets.\n\nWell I at least should be critical, and these are some concerns:\n\n&gt; They are taking on a huge $985 million term loan to finance the deal.\n\n&gt;layoffs that are happening across the U.S. will lower Cornerstone's billings, which could lead to a lower subscription rate given their pricing schema\n\nHowever, I really believe that investors will take note when they see the free-cash flow they are generating, their improved operational margins combined with an un-modeled acquisition that represents 33% of their current revenue.\n\nMy prediction until earnings is this: $CSOD will retest $32.50 sometime by May 1. I think it lingers around $31.50-$32.50 until just before earnings where it breaks to the upside at $33.50. If earnings are a hit, maybe we see upward of $35-$37.",

Winners will win but overall it\u2019ll drop.\n\nA few reasons why: \n\nPre covid19- big vendors like Microsoft and AWS were already doing great adding security tooling to their enterprise IT offerings.\n\nTraditional AV... what consumer would buy that in a world of smartphones, tablets, and PCs that come with Defender?\n\nNetwork security gear is threatened by cloud vendors.\n\nMany security tools aren\u2019t made for modern development and IT management practices. A lot of old crap was made in the days where security teams could and would just say \u201cno you can\u2019t do that\u201d.\n\nA lot of old companies in cyber ETF fit that bill.\n\n**During** covid-19, I think a lot of companies will spend on remote work (Citrix, VPNs, Zoom, cloud services) - some of which actually benefits traditional security vendors.\n\n**Post** covid-19, I think many will try to have a GOOD remote work environment, and favor cloud based solutions, zero-trust setups with reverse proxies instead of VPNs, etc. Cisco did a good job buying Duo there, it bridges their gap between old and new. ZScaler has a huge valuation because it fit the description for that kind of modern tool to investors.\n\nThe next year will be interesting. I expect more consolidations l, acquisitions, and tamer VC funding and hopefully valuations that are more logical.\n\nTL;DR I wouldn\u2019t touch ETFs because I don\u2019t much of a lot of companies in them but there\u2019s going to be some change that\u2019ll open up the market to those innovating for real (few of which are publicly traded - but there\u2019s some).",

Also, recessions are NECESSARY for a healthy market. JPow could very well go\\* down as the worst Fed Chair is history (no easy feat, many of them have failed). We aren't bearish b/c we want to see carnage, but it is downright fucked up how strong the market is with all the credit bubbles at play, severe inflation potentially just around the corner (that all you GenZennial fucks know nothing about), 30m in joblessness is leading to discretionary spending being way down, \\~1/3 of the country didn't pay car payments, rent or mortgages for April, anxiety &amp; fear will forever alter travel/mass gatherings for a chunk of society..

I also read many articles, some books and YouTube (i'll come to this later). \n\nThan I bought some ETF' and still was virtually trading. Once I got the feeling and experience I needed I started to invest and convert from ETF to stocks. \n\nIt was all OK, I was doing ok. Had like 5-6 stock's, gaining some one digit greens. \n\nAnd then I went full retard mode. I watched some daytrading YouTubers, I almost felt the thousand of dollars waiting for me to pick them up. I thought I know some tech analysis strategies, I thought I can time the market and I thought speculating is the way to go. \n\nIt wasn't. I lost 30%. Sort of depressing. I withdrew my money and waited until the feeling I need to get this back quickly is gone. \n\nWithout being emotional I went back to the market and started my initial process. And stayed there. And making money again. Not much, but making it. \n\nThe thing is once you have a strategy and even if it does work out in some cases- you can make a root cause analysis. And see what was wrong. When you gamble - there is no process behind this. Noting to review. You can't review bad luck... \n\nMy portoflio now looks as follows:\n\nLow risk: MSFT /JNJ / PHG\nMid risk: Netflix / Roku / Citrix / SAP / 3M / Biogen\nHigh risk: Tesla / Inseego\n\nI'm not very active, but also I cut loses quickly not wishing for a recovery. Sometimes good choice , sometimes bad. I stopped thinking though about the money I have not gained, I'm rather happy about the money I haven't possibly lost. \n\nAs you see with my portofilio im picking rather safe stocks, even if they are in my mid risk strategy part - they aren't really so risky.",

Its a very rare thing on WSB\n\nI dont totally agree with the prediction of last Friday being the high, but we are nearing a correction. \n\nI think we will ride next week on the hopes of re-opening economy (which will fail - ill come to this pater) and we have some major ER coming in next two weeks. \n\nI think the market will still react more to general than economical data, but we see the conversion already. \n\nThe re-opening economy expectations are very high and this wont work out as people think. Its not a light switch. First bankruptcies after this event and people start realizing there is no magic. \n\nThere is still ink in FED printers also. \n\nI also think it won't be a rollercoaster downsides now, but rather a slower, but longer and heavier downfall. \n\nTL;DR - not a week to buy calls or puts. Maybe a moment to buy some stocks for really short term gains. And if you owe some - consider selling if the downtrend  begins. \n\nAlso for a solid downfall we'd need a couple of days VIX being over 60 in my opinion. \n\nIm sitting on 12 stocks now and i might slowly move to cash gang and wait for the downfall.

I would prefer going out to June, but there is no volume.\n\nI think I'll wait and see how Citrix behaves to decide if I want to jump in long term.",

This could be a run-up play, or it could continue going up past earnings. $CSOD is barely above its lows from the crash and is in a pretty good position to start its bull run. I think one of the biggest things investors are looking for in $CSOD is free cash flow, and according to the CEO:\n\n&gt; we now believe our standalone unlevered free cash flow will be meaningfully higher than that.\n\nI even think this \"meaningfully higher\" comment, is even higher. This quote comes from before March where we learned that their activity stats are through the roof. Their subscriptions have likely gone up, which means their free cash flow has probably grown significantly. This signals to investors a place to safely park investments.",
