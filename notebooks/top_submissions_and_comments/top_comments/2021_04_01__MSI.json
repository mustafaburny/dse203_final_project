It seems crazy now but I think only because it\u2019s not widely adopted.  The more autonomous cars there are on the road, the better autonomous driving becomes.  More human drivers = more variables and unpredictability for computer to take into account.  If all or most cars are autonomous and talking to each other in real-time though, it\u2019s a lot easier to react to road conditions and adapt accordingly.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that cars nowadays are analog, but the perception is that they are.  The first iPhone technically didn\u2019t do anything technologically revolutionary, but it did bundle all these existing digital technologies into one UI (tablets, MP3 players, GPS, etc), and off of that Apple was able to leverage their software capabilities.  I think saying Tesla = Ford = GM is like saying Apple = Nokia = Motorola.

Giant, and I mean giant, patent moat that they are sitting on, as it\u2019s gaining value, in billions (think Motorola being bought by Google for their patent moat)\n3. The $22 billion dollar (just the initial leg of this contract, probably hundreds of billions when all said and done, once other branches and UN follows suit, like they\u2019ve done in the past) with MSFT for the IVAS (augmented reality unmanned drone control goggles, or simply - remote digits vision goggles)\n\nThe last point happened just two days ago, and will be officially confirmed only next week, while the other 2 points are having announcements in Mid April.\n\nSo why a hit piece based on \u201chistorical averages\u201d? Why now?\n\nThis is a 5x bagger if you play straight stocks, and possible breakout 500x bagger if you know what you are doing with debit call spreads.\n\nPrice now is $15\nPrice target is $75 (with buyout announcement possibly taking it to $150-$200)\n\nRead the hit piece\nInverse the hit piece",

In fact these are the types of posts that I hope get on the top of r/options (I gave you an award - hopefully it pushes it up). Your post is a great post for people who are actually looking to learn more about options than just buying calls/puts. Half of the time I see posts that are just like \u201cyolo into calls on stock xyz\u201d or \u201cshould I get out of my position now or wait it out\u201d etc. get to the top, which is sort of disappointing to me. I don\u2019t have any issues with those posts, but they don\u2019t offer the insight your post offers. \n\nWhat you described is a rough sketch of dispersion trading. You probably won\u2019t be able to find much about it online but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a few articles and research papers that you can find on Google (just type dispersion trading into Google). There\u2019s also this on YouTube that gives you a brief intro: https://youtube.com/watch?v=32bVTQw7XDg. It\u2019s a *true options* strategy and much more sophisticated than the ones you generally see here on Reddit of just buying calls or puts. I would guess it\u2019s one of the core strategies almost all option trading firms make to generate profit. It\u2019s almost impossible to do as a retail trader (your set-up you described in your post will be very costly and almost impossible to manage), but if you have like some complex system of algorithms + a bunch of quants helping you out, there is a way to pull off this trade so that you can *have a positive profit no matter how the stock market moves*. \n\nThink about it this way with a super simplistic example in SPY. SPY is a function of its 500 stocks. So there must be a relationship between these 500 stocks (or sector of stocks) and SPY. If this relationship gets off in either direction, you can take advantage. If Stock X and Stock Y have IVs of a and b, then the basket that is some weighted combination of Stock X and Y *must* have an IV of f(a, b) where it\u2019s a *solvable function*. This means anytime it gets off, no matter how Stocks X and Y move, you can make money. \n\nAnyways that didn\u2019t really answer your question in your post directly, but I\u2019m giving some basic insight on the type of thinking you described in your post. As I said, I don\u2019t think most people have the resources to pull it off, but given you can even think of this idea, that\u2019s pretty impressive! And as I said, it\u2019s a great post for people to learn more about more advanced option strategies than just buying calls/puts.",

As we draw closer to the delivery days, the number of open interest contracts should almost always fall as most players in the COMEX are speculators and do not have the silver nor have the interest to demand delivery so they would rather just close off and roll their contracts over to future months.\n\nThose contacts that remains are more likely serious participants who want delivery and are not just speculating. So if that total number of open interest contracts remains high when we hit the delivery day, that means more likely for more silver will be demanded from the COMEX and as it stands now, the COMEX stock is only at 24,000 contracts. If more than 24000 contracts demands delivery, they'll be out of stock.\n\nThe COMEX may have ways to increase their stock in the meantime. But silver is a limited commodity and if this keeps up month after month eventually something would have to break.",

I adore all the degenerates here. I like the positions or ban requirement. Wsb was my intro to options. It told me about the jpow brrrr and the v-shaped recovery last year. I learned that TA is the best way to sound smart but be actually retarded. Wsb showed me that dividends and boomer stocks was for nerds. And it taught me how to lose money really fast and that I should always inverse myself. But in The last 3 months I\u2019ve literally learned 5x what I knew from the past 3 years. Gme is the most interesting story of the year. This megathread was going to eventually and naturally be replaced as apes learn new plays and the gme story unfolds. It doesn\u2019t make sense to make an executive unilateral decision to kill the thread and it just makes mods look sus af. Killing the thread only feeds the conspiracy/cultish mindset. Just like all the CNBC/motley fool/S3/etc... FUD proved to me that gme was a real threat. MODS: get a grip and use this growth as an opportunity to integrate a lot of beautiful minds so that we can collectively share the best ideas and the best gains and losses. Why shoot yourselves in the foot?",

Its close geographical proximity allows the company to benefit from strong manufacturing activity. It has maintained a strategic alliance with TSMC since 1997, the largest dedicated foundry with a market share of 56% of the foundry market revenues. The alliance has made ASE the preferred provider of packaging and testing services for TSMC clients. This allows ASE to benefit by leveraging TSMC's clients of leading companies including Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, Nvidia (NVDA), MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTKF), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as clients who account for nearly half of ASE's revenues. Apple, Qualcomm and MediaTek are major players in the smartphone processor market and are developing 5G chipsets that require advanced packaging capabilities which ASE can provide. Given the long-standing relationship between TSMC and ASE, we expect the alliance between both companies to continue as it enables them to provide a total semiconductor manufacturing solution and the close geographic advantage between both market leaders. This means that ASE should be able to continue counting on TSMC's clients of leading chipmakers.\u201d",

Looking at working probably another 5-10 years and starting to get a lot more active in my portfolio. Nothing crazy and I'm fundamentally a conservative+ investor, but I do not subscribe to moving 100% into ultra safe right before retirement. Portfolio size is low 7 figure for reference.\n\nOver the past few months I subscribed to a couple of authors on Seeking Alpha and have tried out a few strategies with minimal exposure and have a good idea of how to use some of the approaches in my portfolio. I want to develop my own screens because at least on Seeking Alpha, the authors I've found charge a small monthly fee for their updates. It's nothing huge, and for me at least has been worth seeing their approaches, but nothing I want to pay for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm going to put together a dividend screen/strategy and a \"better than cash\" parking lot strategy. Pretty basic and straightforward. I also just got started on putting together a screen to identify a more hi growth strategy - thought being on a monthly basis invest in the top 4 stocks that fall out of the screen. Would love some feedback on the screen (I'm stock knowledgeable, but certainly not an expert). When looking at the screen and giving feedback keep in mind my objective: not looking for the perfect approach or for mega returns, I'm an 80/20 kinda guy so looking for a decent, simple to execute strategy to reliably give back a growth-class return. (And using the Fidelity screener as that's where my portfolio is).\n\nScreen as it stand currently:\n\n* Tagging Energy, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Industrials sectors\n* Market cap down to Medium (as defined by Fidelity: 6-33B)\n* 13 week price performance down to 13%\n* 3 yr annualized Beta of 1.1 and up (conflicted on whether this really helps the screen)\n* Very Bullish or Bullish analyst recommendations (Summary score from StarMine)\n* Forward EPS 3-5 yrs high to very high (16.5% and up)\n* EPS growth Projected year versus last year high to very high (40% and up)\n\nAs an example, running that screen today resulted in a list of 7 stocks (sorry not allowed to link image or would give you a shot of the fundamentals):\n\n1. AMAT - Applied materials\n2. FANG - Diamondback Energy\n3. EOG - EOG Resources\n4. NXPI - NXP SemiConductor\n5. KKR - KKR &amp; Co\n6. LRCX - LAM Research Corp\n7. MU - Micron Technology\n\nSo the thought would be to run this first day of every month and put a set amount in the top 4 stocks in the filter. I would guess some stocks might stay in for months, some might rotate in and out quickly.\n\nMy question is basically around how to rank. So do I just pick a screening metric (or some other metric) and do a simple rank on that metric to determine top 4, or do I create a formula to weight and aggregate multiple metrics into an overall score and rank on that?\n\nSorry for the long post - thank you to those who stuck with it and are willing to share your thoughts.",
