        "body": "Aircraft autopilot is different though, there\u2019s a lot less aircraft in the sky than cars.  The average pilot has more training than the average driver, and (hopefully) none of them are intoxicated.\n\nI think autonomous driving is a serious technology.  It seems crazy now but I think only because it\u2019s not widely adopted.  The more autonomous cars there are on the road, the better autonomous driving becomes.  More human drivers = more variables and unpredictability for computer to take into account.  If all or most cars are autonomous and talking to each other in real-time though, it\u2019s a lot easier to react to road conditions and adapt accordingly.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that cars nowadays are analog, but the perception is that they are.  The first iPhone technically didn\u2019t do anything technologically revolutionary, but it did bundle all these existing digital technologies into one UI (tablets, MP3 players, GPS, etc), and off of that Apple was able to leverage their software capabilities.  I think saying Tesla = Ford = GM is like saying Apple = Nokia = Motorola.  No technology is new and we all stand on the shoulders of giants, but we need to look at how these existing technologies are being utilized or sold in new ways.",

LiDAR + EV cooperation with either MSFT/AAPL/or WVAGY\n2. Giant, and I mean giant, patent moat that they are sitting on, as it\u2019s gaining value, in billions (think Motorola being bought by Google for their patent moat)\n3. The $22 billion dollar (just the initial leg of this contract, probably hundreds of billions when all said and done, once other branches and UN follows suit, like they\u2019ve done in the past) with MSFT for the IVAS (augmented reality unmanned drone control goggles, or simply - remote digits vision goggles)\n\nThe last point happened just two days ago, and will be officially confirmed only next week, while the other 2 points are having announcements in Mid April.\n\nSo why a hit piece based on \u201chistorical averages\u201d? Why now?\n\nThis is a 5x bagger if you play straight stocks, and possible breakout 500x bagger if you know what you are doing with debit call spreads.\n\nPrice now is $15\nPrice target is $75 (with buyout announcement possibly taking it to $150-$200)\n\nRead the hit piece\nInverse the hit piece",
