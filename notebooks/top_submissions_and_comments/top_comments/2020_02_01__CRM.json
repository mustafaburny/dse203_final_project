        "body": "It might be somewhat clarifying to do this with a handful of other meme stocks and maybe a couple of more standard market favorites (e.g. Microsoft, TTD, Salesforce, etc) so we can compare them against each other. Might be a little easier to see whether this just correlates with increased popularity of reddit + WSB, or whether it could potentially be nefarious in nature. Also, we have to keep in mind that the longer the market goes up, the more people pay attention cause of FOMO + ATHs + positive news stories. Plus I'm sure the number of investors has exploded in recent years due to trading being more accessible/cheaper than it ever has been. Just some things to consider.",

Finding amazing companies that are growing their earnings power equates to superior returns. \n\nIt blows my mind every time I see a value investor lamenting how \"easy\" it has been for tech investors to make money. Yes buying and holding amazon or apple or salesforce has been an amazing strategy for the last 10 years and its been \"easy\" vs scouring through the filings and identifying a cigar butt.. no doubt. But the genius has been in identifying that the Amazons, Apple's, Salesforce's of the world have FAR superior business models compared to brick and mortar traditional businesses. \n\nTL;DR Hard work is important, but it doesn't guarantee returns. Finding great companies and holding on to them guarantees returns.",

Finding amazing companies that are growing their earnings power equates to superior returns. \n\nIt blows my mind every time I see a value investor lamenting how \"easy\" it has been for tech investors to make money. Yes buying and holding amazon or apple or salesforce has been an amazing strategy for the last 10 years and its been \"easy\" vs scouring through the filings and identifying a cigar butt.. no doubt. But the genius has been in identifying that the Amazons, Apple's, Salesforce's of the world have FAR superior business models compared to brick and mortar traditional businesses. \n\nTL;DR Hard work is important, but it doesn't guarantee returns.

The question for me is whether these names deserve to have extreme multiples relative to companies that look just like them historically. \n\nThe answer for me is no. These companies trade at 3-5x higher multiples than companies who were consistently growing  +40% annually. I track software names and have been doing so for personal and professional reasons for 20 years. A high growth name like SHOP could consistently get a 8-12x trailing revenue multiple. Today its 30-40x. \n\nThere is no justification for the multiples we are seeing today. You cannot model out a scenario where these companies grow into their multiples and feel good about betting on that business case. I say this because there are only a handful of precedents who have managed to grow at a high rate and generate cash flow over long (5-7years or more) periods of time. \n\nYou cant hold out hope that a big strategic will take them out at these levels because the price point is too dilutive. Plus there is practically been no strategic M&amp;A for these faster growers in the last year or so. I think the best case you find is Salesforce acquiring Tableau. And DATA in that situation had slowed but CRM didn\u2019t pay 30-40x revenue for it either. Another one could be IBM buying Red Hat but then again IBM paid alot for the business but no where near 25x revenue. \n\nSHOP and others are trading at outrageous multiples but beware these are not sustainable and they leave no room for error.",
