I got in on AMD at $55 cause they\u2019re making the chips for PS5 and Xbox X.\n\nI\u2019ll trade some Roku stock here and there because they range from 140s to 170s.\n\nMaybe I buy a little of recovery stocks that are hit really hard now or on downward days but that should recover like Coty which is at $3 and they\u2019re a big makeup company that should do better when woman aren\u2019t all wearing masks outside.\n\nAGS makes gaming machines for casinos, they\u2019re at $4, if they hit $3.8 or less that\u2019s a buying opportunity cause they usually go back up to $4.4 and if they survive to post Covid they might be $10+ stock again.\n\nI\u2019m not an expert so please do your research and always diversify.",

        "body": "I don't know anything about ILMN. I sold a put on Intel following their drop post earnings and am bagholding them waiting for the stock to rise, so I know you pain about sudden drops.\n\nI would say only sell the call if you want to hold and chance a rebound, and mitigate losses if you're wrong. That's all it will accomplish - reduce your losses if the stock continues to fall, and you're trading that for limiting upside should it shoot way back up, but that's less likely. At this point you're selling a lottery ticket covered by the call you already bought, so it isn't naked.\n\n&gt;if the price rises in a months time but not enough, and I decide to close the whole position, my sold call would further the losses?\n\nIf the price goes back up, the hedge you sell will gain in value, which isn't good as it's now worth more than what you sold it for. But, since the original call you bought is closer to the strike price than your hedge, it should go up in value even more. That's what makes spreads net positive. So if I bought a $10C and sold a $15C, and a stock rose from $5 to $8, both calls are closer to the money, so both are worth more. But the $10C is always worth more than the $15C because it's closer to the money.\n\n&gt;in general I get the idea that its always better to buy spreads rather than simple calls/puts because of theta etc?\n\nYes, I rarely buy single leg options because stocks trade in a statistical range they rarely move out of, like a bell curve, and I don't like to pay premium for theoretically unlimited profits. If TSLA has good odds to hit $550, and terrible odds of hitting $750 in a given time period, why buy a $550 call which is going to be more expensive than the $550/$750 spread? You're paying extra money for the limited chance it goes higher. And some people get really lucky, never sell and make 1000% gains. But for most people it's a waste of money which further raises the break even point.\n\nRecently my favorite strategy is to sell puts on stock I'm long on, take the premium and buy a call spread. If I'm wrong and the stock falls, I'll sit on 100 shares and the calls expire. If I'm right and the stock takes off, the put I sold expires worthless and I get to ride free calls to tendy town. That worked great recently on WDC.\n\nThe only other time I end up with single leg options is if I buy a spread, the stock moved the wrong way, which brings the cost of the short leg hedge I sold down to nothing, and if I expect a rebound, I'll buy that hedge to close it and let the unhedged long leg ride back in the correction at a discount. But that's rare.\n\nThe only benefit of single legs is they're easier to close since you only need to sell one leg. Easy. I wouldn't trade spreads on illiquid stocks with low volume. One strike may have lots of buying and selling while the other doesn't, and your broker can't close both until they get a buy and sell on both legs, at whatever price you set. So closing spreads can be more difficult. Generally you don't need to worry on anything like AAPL.",
