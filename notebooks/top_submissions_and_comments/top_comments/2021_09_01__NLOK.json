The CEO, Keith Alexander, has an extensive resume working in the NSA, DOD and Army Intelligence.\n\nAnyone think they have a chance to compete with say, Fortinet, Sophos, Symantec, Kaspersky, Crowdstrike, Zscaler, and other majors??\n\n\"Founded in 2014 by GEN (Ret.) Keith Alexander, IronNet Cybersecurity is a global cybersecurity leader that is transforming how organizations secure their networks by delivering the first-ever Collective Defense platform operating at scale. Employing a high number of former NSA cybersecurity operators with offensive and defensive cyber experience, IronNet integrates deep tradecraft knowledge into its industry-leading products to solve the most challenging cyber problems facing the world today.\"",

All of the talented sales folks at the legacy companies have long ago departed for CRWD and others that are moving in the right direction so there is little headwind from the installed base of legacy solutions like McAfee, Symantec, etc.  That's why they've grown as large as they are so quickly.\n\nIn short, good products + well-run company = quality stock\n\nThe better investment - especially for option YOLO action is $S (SentinelOne)\n\nIf $CRWD is Hertz, then $S is Avis and the market needs at least 2 major players so there is tons of room for S1 to grow quickly.  The stock has been drifting down over the last few days so I've been scaling into Dec 60 and Dec 70 calls.  Earnings are early December and a rise back to 70 is a given and I'd not be surprised to see it tickle $100 before January.\n\nPositions\n\n2000 shares\n\n10 x Dec 60 calls\n\n10 x Dec 70 calls\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot financial advice.
