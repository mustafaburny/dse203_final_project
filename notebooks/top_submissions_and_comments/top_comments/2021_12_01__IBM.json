I can't speak to them as I haven't used GCP before.\n\nAzure seems like the slightly cheaper knockoff AWS without signed cookies in its CDN which even GCP has. Not sure about this since I don't use Azure.\n\nIBM cloud is... ew... and Alibaba/Yandex clouds... we don't talk about those.

IBM cloud is way overpriced.\n\nTl;dr AWS will lose market share in the long term",

        "body": "Intel usually has the fastest CPU on the market,  they tend to be more power efficient, and more expensive.    I haven't shopped for a CPU in a couple years though, so I don't know what's going on right now.  2 years ago Intel was king of the hill with the fastest and most expensive and I suspect they will regain that title soon enough, if history is any lesson, that title has been going back and forth ever since AMD was first able to capture it 10-15 years ago.\n\nIt's probably different now that servers are commoditized and in the cloud, but it once was only Intel for if you needed Microsoft stuff or IBM for real work in the server room.  AMD was just consumer level stuff.   Linux and VMWare lets real work happen on Intels.   Intels did better with VMware initially putting the segmenting into the chip.    \n\nThat Linux on consumer chips kind of supplanted IBM might be cautionary in that IBM was bluechip, and is now becoming somewhat of an also-ran.  \n\nIntel defined the standard, the \"x86\" and AMD followed it.  There's Moore's law, but who did Moore work for?  As of March 2021 Moore is worth $12.1B.\n\nI hardly consider Intel to be an underdog, that's new.  \n\nAs a stock, it's kind of boring.   I suppose I wouldn't expect huge gains like the recent Nvida stuff, but my sense is the company is pretty solid.  It's PE is much lower than AMD.   I own some INTC  because I thought it was a value, and consider it somewhat bluechip.",

Even if switching to AMD can save a few thousand dollars on energy costs, the costs associated with bugs resulting from driver issues can be much greater.\n\n&gt;Besides, IBM/Cisco isn\u2019t a fair comparison because Lisa Su isn\u2019t exactly an incompetent ceo.\n\nI never said she was. I think she's a great CEO, one of my favorite. But the stock is overvalued, nothing she can do about that. I'd happily buy AMD stock if their price drops below $50.\n\n&gt;Intel could come back but they\u2019re seriously not that innovative as they used to be.\n\nAnd I'd argue that even if they don't innovate and just continue on autopilot for the next decade, they'll still outperform Nvidia and AMD, because AMD and Nvidia still have an insane amount of growth priced into their stock already.",

You won't know how you'll feel until it happens, and you won't be in the right frame of mind to make decisions after it has. This could very easily turn into a trade where you lose 100%. Pick a point, say 50% or whatever you're comfortable with so you can live to die another day.\n\n-Determine where you're going to take profits. This can go the other way too. You wake up to check on your option and it's up 100% just a couple weeks after opening the position. You're once again in a position where you aren't able to make unbiased decisions, and it can just as well go to zero still.
