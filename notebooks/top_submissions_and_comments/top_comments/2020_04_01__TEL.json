Of course I\u2019m greedy and hold. It goes back to the negatives and goes back to break even. I decided to get the hell out and take my $3 profit because I was scared. Anyways the next day the fucking stock goes up to $99 dollars. If I did my math right I would\u2019ve been up a SHITLOAD. I thought I knew about options since I researched for like 2 weeks but nope",
