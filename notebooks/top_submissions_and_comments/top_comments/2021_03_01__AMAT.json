I\u2019m keeping tabs on AMAT, TSM, LRCX, NXPI, FORM, UMC).\n\nThen finally the rare earth metals.. companies like MP, AMAT, VALE (I was long on these guys then they got a fucking $7B fine for killing 300 people in a dam explosion.... oops).\n\nLook into Biden\u2019s recent executive order, not only does he address the global semiconductor shortage, but plans to bring jobs back to the states and invest in American companies. MP Materials is the only US based company REM company. \n\nThis all looks so obvious as a long term play. I forget where I read it, but the global semiconductor usage is going to 10x or something insane like that in the next 10 years.\n\nI don\u2019t know why all of these companies are down recently, I haven\u2019t looked into it. I bought $10 worth of every stock listed above so I could keep tabs on them. All of them have followed the same negative trajectory the last month or so. If you zoom out to 5 year though, almost every single company shows insane growth. I imagine that growth will only compound long term. Do you have any thoughts on the reason for this recent downward trend? \n\nI\u2019m considering making a pretty massive 5-10 year long play on semiconductors.",

Basically, with 5g phones, smart cars, smart tv's, etc... everything needs more advanced chips and covid plus international trade, etc... has made it so the manufacturers simply can't get their hands on the chips for their products.  \n\nI've started looking into this myself...and haven't dived into SOXL yet because after reading up on this stuff the last couple of days, realized the semi conductor space will likely take a hit for a little bit (also Soxl went from 100s to 636 in a year, so it was stupid high).  I also learned (and it DID scare me a bit) that with a 3x etf, if the underlying index loses 33.3% of it's value, and it recalibrates daily, you lose your money.  It's not a long term strategy (which my ignorant ass thought \"oh etf, buy and hold\"). \n\nOn another note, this comment from /u/ruffetrade1 caught my eye: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/livu52/trying_to_understand_how_the_semiconductor/gn60fzu/ \n\n&gt;Instead of trying to figure out the semiconductor industry and which one of the 50 players will either win the government contracts to produce them, why don\u2019t you focus on the few capable material suppliers to the chip makers that will win out regardless of which company can ramp up chip production. When demand for products is high and supply is low, commodities control the market. If you want to profit on semiconductors, invest in their suppliers. \n\nSo now I am trying to look up companies that produce the materials the chip makers need during a time of high demand and a shortage.  I looked at AMAT (but don't know necessarily if that is the one I should be eyeballing or not yet).",

But itll treat you right. \n\nAMD= slightly more risky (due to the plethora or semiconductor out there) but has the potential to return a higher x then Disney because of the semi shortage. \n\nI went for Disney as my reopening play and long term \"safe\" play. I went for SMH due to no matter how much DD i did i couldn't seem to find a reason to buy one semi over another. If i had to choose one i probs woulda done AMAT or perhaps MU tho based of my DD. (I honestly now couldn't tell you why specifically since its been so long and ive moved on but those two were what i narrowed to)",

Paid something stupid like $10 for a GME $50C when GME was trading at $35.  And bought some AMC and BB.  Then GME hit $300 something.  Not knowing what I was doing I exercised and then sold off at like $300, $290 and $270.\n\nEnded up with 30 grand and decided to make it my options play money.  Lost a good chunk on NVDA when it shit but stayed about even overall cause I was playing MU LRCX AMAT DKNG and AMC.  Because you know like silicone chips and shortages.  Figured buy the guys that make silicone chip equipment.  Atleast I think some of those stocks do that shit.  And DKNG because like sin stocks are a good hedge for market down turns or some shit.\n\nSo I didn't make money for a while.  And I also learned how those stocks move.  I also learned if when the dip comes if you don't have any cash well then you are fucked.\n\nSo I waited for most of my calls to go back green and took barely any profit but got back to my original 30k.\n\nThen I did some ground breaking shit.  I didn't buy anything until the shit dipped for a few days.  And when it did I just bought a little and kept buying all the way down.  I also started buying calls 90 to 60 days out with strikes around the most recent high.\n\nSo when MU tanked I bought it all the way down to $82.  Same thing with AMAT and LRCX.  Also KLAC which doesn't run like those.  DKNG is hella cheap now, so is UWMC, and some of the cruise stocks.\n\nSo I did that and now Friday happened.\n\nAnd now I think I'm smarter than Warren Buffet.\n\nSo now I'm going to hold this shit for way to long until it goes red and expires.\n\nAnd then I'll listen to my wife banging her boyfriend while I figure out if I have anything of value to pawn other than my mouth.",

A few days later, AMAT proceeded to blow up, and laughed at my 121c on the way by. When AMAT got to $128, the value of my total position was about $900-$1000 (I forget), including how much I was down on the short. I swapped the 121c for a Apr-09-21 125c, for about a wash, and hoped that AMAT would come back to earth and let me get out of the short without losing anything. That did happen today, at which time I bought back the short for a tiny bit of profit, and by then, the LEAPS was at \\~20% profit, so I sold that as well. \n\nI could just as easily have waited a couple of weeks to see what happened with the short, but I decided that chasing a tiny bit of profit on the short call isn't worth it; if I believe in the underlying (just not enough to want to pay full price for it), I'll probably stick to LEAPS or some other call expiration that doesn't have a ton of theta issues. PMCCs, and covered calls in general, in my experience with them, simply aren't worth the hassle. For a stock that *just doesn't move* over time, they are great; for anything with any level (or even chance) of upwards trends, they are not worth it. \n\n$0.02.",
