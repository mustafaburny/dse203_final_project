You do not touch the higher levels of investing until you have a firm understanding and success at the lower. \nThe lowest level is ETF investing, easy to learn easy to toss money at and make returns. Also builds a strong base to work from\n\n The 2nd is individual stock, once you really learned to analyze investment data. You can also work on the emotional side of your investments in this area like not panicking during a selloff or becoming to elated in your gains not to sell.\n\nThe 3rd level is learning the various trading options such as limits, stop losses and margins. Really it can be bundled into the 2nd BUT these things are generally more important for traders rather Investors.\n\nFinally we get to options, if you don't have a firm grasp and decent experience with the above then you need to stay the hell away from options. They are the ultimate trap to newbie investors who see dipshits on WSB gambling away there entire savings. HOWEVER, a reasonable experienced investor whom can make sound decisions in there investments in the previous level can  infact benefit from limited option trading (can never recommend an all in). \n\nI for one am sitting on some delicious AMD 87.5 leap calls that don't expire til next June. I felt they were a reasonable investment as the XLNX merger was already know.",

If you get assigned then 1 you are entering in on the trade at a discount and 2 you're getting a small premium. \n\nIt's actually kind of cool because you get paid for entering a long trade. Ideally, if you're a long term investor and you're going to hold for many years, then entering trades with secured puts is a good idea because you'll always enter your positions below highs and you'll take a premium for doing so that you can use to buy more of the shares. You'll only get enough premium to get maybe 1 extra share if you sell a weekly CC, but if it's a stock like AMD that 1 share can do a lot of work.\n\nAnother thing is a lot of people will do the wheel by entering with CSP, but I'm not really a fan of that. You have to enter and exit every once in a while, and I feel like just holding for the long term is the best play.",

It would be hard for me to pay attention at work and school since my mind would just be focused on trying to chase gains and praying that my portfolio wouldn't be red. Then, I eventually lost like $4k in total. It was initially hard to stomach the loss but I had to just accept it as a learning lesson. \n\nI also just wanted to say I fully agree with you on the LEAPS in safe companies. 80% of my portfolio is stocks and 20% LEAPS. LEAPS are great ways to control more of a stock with less money and I make sure to only buy LEAPS on great fundamental companies (NVDA and AMD) but am planning to buy some SPY GOOGL and MSFT LEAPS that you mentioned as well.\n\nI just want to say that I actually sleep better now and my quality of life is MUCH better. I realized I just couldn't handle the stress of 90%+ swings in my portfolio without being glued to it or worrying \"IS IT TIME TO SELL?\" LEAPS and shares remove all of that because they don't really have an \"expiration.\" Shares are unlimited and LEAPS are like 2-3 years out so there's no rush to feel like: THE STOCK HAS TO RALLY 20% in a day, all you have to do is choose companies you have high conviction in and let them naturally make their way up.",

This can be fixed by spending a bigger share of the profits on capex and buying a lot of these advanced EUV machines themselves and that is exactly what they are going to do and what pissed of some investors. Intel announced they will be the first to receive the next iteration of even more advanced EUV machines soon.\n\nBy being a foundry Intel can use all their IP for their customers. This will give them an advantage over TSMC and Samson for a sizable chunk of the market. Simply because they can throw in this IP so customers can design product only intel can make. Their packaging techniques are not the same as those of TSMC and at least a sizable share of the market will benefit from these. I'm not going to claim they will steamroll TSMC but they will be able to take market share. It's a new market. It will be the same as AMD doubling their data center business by taking a few percentages of market share from Intel. In the foundry business TSMC will be like Intel and Intel will be like AMD.\n\nAs a foundry you can make whatever the client designs. Intel clearly stated they will go for a mix and match strategy where clients can combine external IP like ARM with Intel IP like packaging or networking. X86 will always have a place but Intel clearly accepted that it's not only x86 anymore and they are adapting.",

Always stick to what you know and research the shit out of anything new you want to get into.\nALSO the beauty of options is that you can always profit no matter whats happening to a stock. Up, down, flat, sharp price increase, slow burn down, any moves a stock is making there is always an effective strategy to provide th best chance of profit. NEVER lock yourself into a single option strategy otherwise you will severely diminish the companies and the timeframes you can trade.

Unstable and unreliable app, RH became completely unusable, multiple times during the Covid March 2020 crash. When other brokers stayed operational\n\n4.) Payment for order flow. RH makes money buy selling your buy orders to high frequency trade hedge funds, who are then able to \"frontrun\" the stock, meaning they can buy the stock a milisecond before you do, thus raising the price your market orders get filled. So you're actually paying more for stocks on RH than if you used another broker.\n\n5.) Conflict of interest, RH primary customer, Citadel was caught illegally naked shorting meme stock. During the meme stock frenzy, RH users weren't allowed to buy shares of certain companies, whereas with other brokers you could.\n\n6.) RH has history of being fined by the SEC, and countless lawsuits regarding not having the best user's interest in mind.\n\n7.) Glitchy Options display. RH falsely displayed losses for a young options trader who was actually in the green. He ended up committing suicide because of it.\n\n8.) If you care about margin %, Interactive Brokers and M1 Finance both have cheaper margin %\n\n9.) Not good for buying Crypto. You don't have access to your wallet keys, and you're not allowed to transfer your crypto to anew wallet, so you're forced to liquidate it if you want to move it elsewhere, which creates a taxable event. Also questions have raised if RH really holds the crypto that you \"own\" on their app.\n\nAlso it's not 2019 anymore, it's 2021. Countless apps have clean simple UI.

Management doesn't want hedge funds grilling them every quarter over why the margin isn't 20bp higher or activists threatening to fire them. They want investors who trust them to run the business well over the long-term. There's a reason why Charter Communications is bullet proof. It has the highest institutional ownership on the Street and spends zero time courting investors or investment banks.",

Meanwhile, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have great back end infrastructure, but terrible, outdated UIs. I used to think what those companies did was the hard part, and Robinhood just put some paint on a pig. I joked it was a race to see who could fix themselves up faster. But it's been almost a year, and those old school websites are as bad as ever.\n\nVanguard's bad UI is somewhat on purpose, and Schwab bought TDA and Thinkorswim. But Fidelity is an embarrassment. Active Trader Pro is the single oldest and worst performing piece of software I've had the misfortune of interacting with in the past decade. Their mobile app is terrible as well, though I commend them for trying to introduce a nicer looking, but still barely functional Robinhood knockoff beta.\n\nBasically, good design is priceless. But since an investor's job is to put a price on things, I'll just say it's very valuable. Haters always said that Steve Jobs was just the pretty boy frontman, but there are a lot of computer companies and only one is the largest corporation on the planet by simply coasting on Jobs's designs. It's hard to write good code or build a brokerage, but it's almost impossible to create good design.\n\nBasically, leaps on $MLKN",

For OTC you have to trade with settled funds, a GFV is a trade made without settled funds, so how can that be....after an hour back and forth with the lackey i finally got transferred to a senior broker and was told to look at my cash available to withdraw to gauge if a GFV is possible.  no further problems.",
