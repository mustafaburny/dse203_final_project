She sucked at eBay: made shitty M&amp;A deals, let Amazon run all over the company, and needed John Donahue to come in to clean up the culture to turn it into a silicon valley type company.\n\nThen she completely underachieved at HP and essentially forced a company split with consumer and enterprise, that didn unlock any value.\n\nThen at HPE she was canned in 3 months after the split lol\n\nI have no idea why they picked her considering she didn't have any entertainment experience, and no stubhub (part of eBay Inc) doesn't count.\n\nAlso didn't help to actually launch a platform that was meant for commuting...during covid when nobody could use it because they didn't commute.",

That are very aggressive in buying out companies, high margins, and coatings companies really aren't going to go bust anytime soon bc they're used fucking everywhere.  And as ppl push to move away from plastics, coatings will be needed even more.\n\nPton bc why not\n\nScl because they're a large powder coating company.  Powder coatings continue to grow bc of regulations on other paints.  And i like coatings..  axlta is descent too\n\nHpq because they have some big ass printers in the works that'll give crazy throughput, customization, and kill screen printing imo\n\nRkt bc it's literally a rocket\n\n\nI've excited almost all my positions in the companies above and am selling puts to get back in to some positions if they dip in the next few months.\n\nIf FDs, I've been playing nnox, rkt, hpq, and hpe",

I definitely don't think that their drop is permanent and that they'll be up and going again once we find vaccine.\n\nAs for TMR, I had money left over on WealthSimple and wanted to diversify some more.\n\nYou can downvote me if you want, but I would appreciate it if you told me where I'm fucking up.",

Rowe Price &amp; Wellington Associates) owning about 28% of the **entire** SPAC. That's why the share price has been suppressed, to allow them to create their longs.   \n\n\nI think retail investors are miserably wrong about this company. Annual revenue and EBITDA growth of 8-9% and 13%, respectively, are nothing to scoff at.   \n\n\nChurchill management team has also said they're not actually taking a cut until there's a minimum 25% ROI **after** the first year of trading as MultiPlan. So yeah they're not just here to pump it and run away. Their lock-up period is 18 months, and the PIPE lockup period is 6 months in the shortest instance I believe.   \n\n\nAlso if you look at the people they're bringing on board, one used to run enterprise payments for Citigroup, and the other is a former COO from HPE (HP Enterprise), with an additional 2 decades at Microsoft. They're planning on beefing up the payment processing and software aspect, which will increase their already ridiculous margins and increase LFCF.   \n\n\nThis company is undervalued by at least 50%. Just because Nikola &amp; Shell mooned doesn't mean every SPAC will end up at $50 pre-merger, but people are going to regret passing on this when it's trading at $30 within a couple of years\\* and is paying out dividends to shareholders.   \n\n\nDisclosure: Long CCXX/MultiPlan (full DD coming soon!)  \n\n\n^(\\*Barring a market melt-down prior to 2023, when interest rate hikes are projected to kick in)",

In the meantime as a new investor I\u2019d recommend picking up AIG, GE, CCL, AMC, BAC, XLE, XLF, HPE, NOK... these are all stocks that are almost guaranteed to double if not triple over the next 3-5 years. A great place to park some long term cash... especially GE as they restructure. Energy sectors and oil will double as well as demand rises as we break out of the pandemic. Same for airlines... I see Alaska Airlines as the best value play. If I were you I\u2019d invest in all of these industries that are down 50-70% and wait to reap your rewards. Value investing is better than chasing momentum in my opinion. Buy low sell high, easy enough. There are a couple momentum stocks I\u2019d buy right now as in ASAP! Apple, Verizon, TMobile, Skyworks, Bloom Energy, Qualcomm, WiFi (boingo), these companies are set to reap the rewards and huge cash flow into 5g. SPY is a great diversified etc to park some cash too. It\u2019s the ultimate set it and forget it stock. I would definitely recommend you check out some great etfs as a new investor.",
