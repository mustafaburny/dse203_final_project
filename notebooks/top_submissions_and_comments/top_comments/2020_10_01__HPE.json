For every company I have thesis of why I invest in them and so if I think that my thesis is correct I just hold. So for example, I've invested in HPE, because I'm a developer and I have good understanding of their products and they are I think very good products. Last quarter they did very well but they keep going down since, but I'm not too worried because I think their good products will be converted into good cashflow and eventually market  will recognise it but in-between there will be ups and downs. Having that said, it's very important to be self critical and reanalyse your thesis every so often. Like I bought a chunk of DAL in April because I thought that at the end of the day people will still need to fly. And I was like 5% up on that and I kept hearing that flights will take years to bounce back, and that even when they bounce back it will not be to the same levels and that there are many much better opportunities to deploy that capital. I looked at the facts, I reanalysed what I believed in and determined that actually I was wrong so I sold DAL while it was up and another airline while it was down. Anyways, that's just how I try to deal with market volatility. Also, I might sound very calm about it but that's because I'm not leveraged and even if all my equities go to 0, that would be very painful, but thats not the money I need to pay my bills so I would be ok.",

Rowe Price &amp; Wellington Associates) owning about 28% of the **entire** SPAC. That's why the share price has been suppressed, to allow them to create their longs.   \n\n\nI think retail investors are miserably wrong about this company. Annual revenue and EBITDA growth of 8-9% and 13%, respectively, are nothing to scoff at.   \n\n\nChurchill management team has also said they're not actually taking a cut until there's a minimum 25% ROI **after** the first year of trading as MultiPlan. So yeah they're not just here to pump it and run away. Their lock-up period is 18 months, and the PIPE lockup period is 6 months in the shortest instance I believe.   \n\n\nAlso if you look at the people they're bringing on board, one used to run enterprise payments for Citigroup, and the other is a former COO from HPE (HP Enterprise), with an additional 2 decades at Microsoft. They're planning on beefing up the payment processing and software aspect, which will increase their already ridiculous margins and increase LFCF.   \n\n\nThis company is undervalued by at least 50%. Just because Nikola &amp; Shell mooned doesn't mean every SPAC will end up at $50 pre-merger, but people are going to regret passing on this when it's trading at $30 within a couple of years\\* and is paying out dividends to shareholders.   \n\n\nDisclosure: Long CCXX/MultiPlan (full DD coming soon!)  \n\n\n^(\\*Barring a market melt-down prior to 2023, when interest rate hikes are projected to kick in)",

I see Alaska Airlines as the best value play. If I were you I\u2019d invest in all of these industries that are down 50-70% and wait to reap your rewards. Value investing is better than chasing momentum in my opinion. Buy low sell high, easy enough. There are a couple momentum stocks I\u2019d buy right now as in ASAP! Apple, Verizon, TMobile, Skyworks, Bloom Energy, Qualcomm, WiFi (boingo), these companies are set to reap the rewards and huge cash flow into 5g. SPY is a great diversified etc to park some cash too.
