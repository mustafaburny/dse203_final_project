For example, did you know that options gains on spy are entirely short term and taxed out the ass, but if you are making a slightly bigger bet then use options on spx, which are taxed at 60% long term, 40% short term that\u2019s a big diff. little things make a big diff in your gains and over time can be the diff of 6 figures\n\nAlso, prob obvious but make your riskiest bets in tax sheltered accounts like a Roth, again the compounders over that time frame will save you a mind blowing amt on taxes. Think the hyper growth long term buys like shop, or Tsla over the last few years. These gains woulda been entirely tax sheltered\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget to build a solid long term portfolio and forget about it so you can retire early\u2026 Ma, Amzn, nvda, msft, v, now, unh, jpm, sq, pypl, hd, shop, tmo, adbe, pins\u2026 is the entirety of the fund I manage and I\u2019m comfortable holding each for minimum 2-5 years, many I\u2019ve owned for 5-10 years\u2026 Godspeed gents",

Adobe is noted to be the de-facto toolkit for creatives, TAM-expansive digital tailwinds tied to experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"While shares have steadily compounded (+31% YTD, 38% TTM vs. NASDAQ +19%/38%), we see a path for 20%+ EPS expansion far into the future which, alongside multiples we still view as palatable relative to other premium assets in software (currently trading at 40x P/E, 35x EV/FCF on our FY23e), leads us to recommend Adobe as a long-term core holding in any large-cap tech portfolio.\"",

        "body": "TSLA is breaking out it seems. It\u2019s expensive though to get the lower strikes. \n\n\nOne approach is to use call spreads to gain access to the lower strikes without paying $6k a piece or whatever. \n\n\nI went with 800 strike for Dec and Jan. I am looking at some $1000-1200ish ones for Dec 2022. \n\n\nNext is spy. Daily calls. Just pure gambling basically but the daily opens low typically and spikes up. Just sell. Or at least sell most. Don\u2019t go for a banger. You see it on wsb but for every guy who gets 400% spy daily there has to be 50,000+ losers. So if you get 50%, just fucking sell. 50% in a single day is godly. \n\n\nI keenin mind that if you roll 50k at 30% 12x is $1m. I recently started doing this a couple weeks ago with a separate account. Didn\u2019t work once. Didn\u2019t do every day. Has worked about 5-7 days or so. Started with 50k and it\u2019s at about 200k now. Gets scarier putting all 200k into spy though. So I\u2019ve been timid. Trying to hit 10m by end of year. \n\n\nOther thing is called in my head tech 30 day earnings ramp. Lots of good co not just tech rise 30d pre earnings. You buy about that time and target just barely OTM. Not trying to hit home runs just the solid 50% range. \n\n\nAs earnings approach the stock usually ramps up. Sell before earnings. Don\u2019t hold for earnings. If you like the stock for whatever reason. Sell. Take your money. Wait for earnings. Then buy shares. You might miss a rise but it\u2019s unpredictable. \n\n\nI have 235 visa calls as well. Same thing. Ramp to earnings. \n\n\nWhere IV has exploded and the stock has been going up quite a bit from where it was, consider iron condors. IC\u2019s with high IV have the unique gift of making the spread (of profitability) much larger. This improves your return % dramatically. I did it on a few. Most notably on OSTK. IV gave me a huge spread of break even profit. I bet pretty heavily. It is stressful because the pricing isn\u2019t perfectly logical but as the day comes to a  close it evens out. Don\u2019t hold to expiry. Just get out. Factor this in when you choose your entering strikes. This is the only time I hold for earnings. \n\n\nLove iron condors quite a bit. Just used a lot of collateral. \n\n\nIf I don\u2019t know what to do and don\u2019t see anything I love I don\u2019t do any calls. Instead I\u2019ll just find solid names and if they\u2019re down for no good reason buy shares with max leverage. The other week for example \n\n\nAdobe msft fb all down for no reason at one point or another. \n\nWith leverage margin you get a decent return for the day. I usually sell end of day. But if I can snap up one of those and buy 10,000 shares or something, goes up $1-3, that\u2019s $30 fucking thousand. Hell ya.",

        "body": "This idea is creative but terrible. Lots of large companies engage in R&amp;D and pursue business lines that have potential to be profitable as part of a larger integrated business plan. They need the leeway to make decisions without constant intervention in each line of business separately.\n\nThis idea also doesn't take into account that you can't just take a business apart. Tsla is building AI as part of its Auto lineup. As far as I know they have no plans to sell it to other Auto manufacturers and it is a differentiator to help sell their cars and bring in additional money. The only reason FSD makes money is as a product that requires you own a Tsla. If FSD comes to fruition and replaces taxis/Uber etc it would be part of Tsla's plan to sell more of its cars. \n\nIf the AI/FSD was a Sub-stock the focus would be on maximizing the revenue of that business by selling their product to Audi, Ford, VW etc at the expense of the larger plan of Tsla to expand their car sales.\n\nThe sum is greater than the parts. Vertical integration is necessary. How would you account for shared expenses like HR, facilities, Accountants etc.  It would create a completely unnecessary headache for no net gain for the company. There is a reason that large companies like Amzn, Goog, Adbe continue to acquire companies and integrate it into their business model.",
