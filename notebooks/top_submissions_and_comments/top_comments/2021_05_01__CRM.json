        "body": "I work in data and analytics at a Media company and use Snowflake every day in my work.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Snowflake because it is BY FAR, the best data warehousing product on the market by a mile. \n\nMost other data warehousing products out there cost a TON to use (look up teradata - they\u2019ve struggled to grow revenue the past few years) - by cost a ton I\u2019m meaning implementation fees alone can range in the millions of dollars, effectively locking anyone but the biggest of companies out from using their product.\n\nSnowflake on the other hand is cheap. It\u2019s not a SAAS product, you don\u2019t pay subscription fees to use it. Instead, you purchase credits from snowflake (this is the $1.4B in future revenue that they already have booked), and consume these credits to run queries, import data etc into Snowflake. \n\nUsing credits to do our day to day work explains why Snowflakes revenue retention rate is so high. Customers, like us, are constantly querying the data in our data warehouse to update business dashboards, pull reports etc. This data normally needs to be refreshed at least daily, if not multiple times a day. Every time a query is refreshed Snowflake makes money.\n\nGiven how easy it is to import data from a variety of sources, the number of business intelligence developers that we\u2019ve employed has increased 5x because the business sees such value in a platform. No longer does it takes days or weeks to import data into Snowflake, you can have clean, transformed and ready to use data, pushing that into your business dashboards, in a matter of hours. As we move more reports away from being manual and done in excel to being automated and powered by Snowflake, our cost to use the product naturally increases over time.\n\nThe reason why I am bullish on Snowdlake is because there target market is SO LARGE. They have under 5000 customers WORLDWIDE, who use their product. For reference, the media company I work for is SMALL (i\u2019m based in New Zealand), and we probably spend roughly 30k per year on Snowflake for all our data warehousing needs.\n\nThink of mega cap companies, like Coca Cola, Walmart, Home Depot etc and think about the VOLUME of data that they have! Billions of rows of operational data that is ONLY INCREASING OVER TIME. Think of the number of disparate systems - CRM, accounting, billing, procurement etc, and think about the need for having this data in a place where analysts across a business can query one place for the business source of truth.\n\nThink also about how the amount of data over time is only going to increase as become more of an interconnected world - IOT, more data being consumed over the internet, automated cars, robots - all are going to require that data to be stored somewhere and used at a later date - that\u2019s what Snowflake does.\n\nLiterally, they could stop growing their customer numbers and their revenue would still grow 60%+ per year as their existing customers become more integrated with the warehouse and query it more and more.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, sure they\u2019re competing against the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google, but these products are SHIT compared to the godliness of Snowflake. Literally, the ability to query 320million rows of data in a query in Snowflake that takes 6 minutes to run vs 6 HOURS in Azure.\n\nAs a professional in the industry, I will not promote any product other than Snowflake to a future business that I work for if they don\u2019t yet have a data warehouse. This is only going to amplify over time as the people using the product become the spokespeople for it - because Snowflake is THAT GOOD.\n\nSo yes, from an investment perspective, Snowflake is HELLA expensive. 60x TTM sales is ridiculous, regardless of the growth rate of the company. However, if you begin to consider the total number of customers that can use them (because their revenue is usage rather than subscription based, both large and small customers can easily use them -  no other product allows for this), the fact that data levels are only going to increase over time, and the fact that their product is clearly superior to everything else on the market, you can see why they are valued so richly.\n\nTLDR: Snowflake user. Snowflake is dope asf. They have so many more people they can sell to and will see revenue growth rates for a long time to come. BUY",

        "body": "sorry to keep replying to all your posts lol. you want to keep an eye on the DMAs, particularly the 50 DMA and 200 DMA as factors on top of the short term trend chart. \n\nand yeah actually that could be a situation where its worth it, more or less. If you didn't buy salesforce before it entered the Nasdaq, saw it jump 30% and then watched it bleed out all the gains over the next couple months, that could be a great stock to jump in because it may have been oversold into a correction by profit takers. \n\ni love salesforce but i took the profits as soon as it entered the NASDAQ for no other reason than 'wow it jumped 30% in one day im just taking my cash off the table and pocketing this' and never really looked back. that can create an inefficiency in the stock price",

I doubled down... but this market is cah-ray-zee.\n\nI'd be careful of course with strategies that might be chasing the market's behavior.  Now that everything has dropped so much, we might actually see stocks go up on good earnings.  Look at Salesforce CRM, battered badly since it's recent high and it's still weeks away from reporting.  There are lots of macro concerns, but a lot of the sell off has been because we were at all time highs and there was sector rotation.  Well things have sold off, and the things rotated into have been pumped up...  Although if you're not crypto or a commodity or closely associated then no one cares about you.",

In this segment, you get low prices and you compete with tons of students, freelancers and local small businesses, all of which are perfectly capable of getting the job done. Being at a social occasion and hearing \"I have an idea for an app\" is a meme among programmers, and there are many who have built apps for local businesses. It does not scale up well.\n\nWith larger projects, most companies that have critical exposure to their customers via their apps either have de facto body leasing agreements with their preferred software consultancy or a standing in-house development team.\n\nYou may be able to find a software consultancy that does a lot of app development, but a pure play is unlikely. Often, mobile development is just a side show for them, and the real money is in ERP, CRM or custom enterprise development.",

I sold every single position that I was still profitable in such as Apple, Salesforce, ect. I then used the money to purchase as many deep ITM NIO leaps as I could in order to bring my breakeven and average strike down. I snagged a 15c, 17c, and two 25c all expiring the same date as my original bleeding leaps (Jan 2023). \n\nI now have 90% of my portfolio in NIO which is absolutely insane but I was able to bring my breakeven price from $74 to under $55 which allows me to sleep a bit better lol.",

If you didn't buy salesforce before it entered the Nasdaq, saw it jump 30% and then watched it bleed out all the gains over the next couple months, that could be a great stock to jump in because it may have been oversold into a correction by profit takers. \n\ni love salesforce but i took the profits as soon as it entered the NASDAQ for no other reason than 'wow it jumped 30% in one day im just taking my cash off the table and pocketing this' and never really looked back. that can create an inefficiency in the stock price",

Now that everything has dropped so much, we might actually see stocks go up on good earnings.  Look at Salesforce CRM, battered badly since it's recent high and it's still weeks away from reporting.  There are lots of macro concerns, but a lot of the sell off has been because we were at all time highs and there was sector rotation.

In this segment, you get low prices and you compete with tons of students, freelancers and local small businesses, all of which are perfectly capable of getting the job done. Being at a social occasion and hearing \"I have an idea for an app\" is a meme among programmers, and there are many who have built apps for local businesses. It does not scale up well.\n\nWith larger projects, most companies that have critical exposure to their customers via their apps either have de facto body leasing agreements with their preferred software consultancy or a standing in-house development team.\n\nYou may be able to find a software consultancy that does a lot of app development, but a pure play is unlikely. Often, mobile development is just a side show for them, and the real money is in ERP, CRM or custom enterprise development.",

I'm down over 75% on those right now lol. \n\nLast week, I decided to just sell everything i was still in the green with (apple, salesforce, etc) and just doubled-down on my Nio leaps by buying them mostly deep ITM. I did this so that I can bring my original breakeven price down. I bought two $25 calls, one $17 call, one $15 call, and two $55 calls. Before purchasing these, my breakeven was around $72. Now my breakeven is below 55 and I could certainly sleep better at night \ud83d\ude02. Still a bit risky but better than before. \n\nI can't speak for any of your other positions. But if you're in a similar spot as I was and you're starting to get nervous, then the approach I took is something to consider at least. For me, it was the obvious choice rather than selling for over 75% loss haha.\n\nBefore NIO's recent correction, $80 leaps expiring Jan 2023 seemed like a decent bet. Now, I feel like we will be extremely lucky to see $75 a share by that date. Obviously just my opinion though.\n\nGood luck and stay strong, brotha !",

        "body": "Sorry if I wasn't clear, there are other companies that provide different tools that are seemingly similarly dominant in their industry (not data analysis).\n\nA really good example would be Autodesk (ADSK). They make the AutoCad family, REVIT and other tools, all for construction design. They are very dominant in this field and it would be very difficult for competitors to break in for a variety of reasons. ADSK trades at a 52 P/E ratio and about 20 P/R ratio. I think they are a bit overvalued and Yahoo seems to agree with me. I wouldn't stay they are a bad buy though. This company is only valued at ~2 times PLTR but looks way better. Another example would be ANSYS (ANSS) that makes FEA software. \n\nPLTR provides what one would hope is a dominant data analysis suite/tools. That's great but I am just not sure that they will find enough customers that sit in the 'goldilocks zone' of having enough data to analyze and not having the resources to create the tools themselves. I am also not entirely certain that companies that run systems like CRM services can't provide similar tools with other items. Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft all advertise data analytics. How would a customer know if the Palantir tools are better or worse than those produced by other larger companies that the customer may already have a relationship with (CRM, Microsoft suite, G-suite, etc.)?",
