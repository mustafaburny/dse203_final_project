Should anyone have the time and inclination would appreciate comments on portfolio makeup controlled by two trustees who have farmed out the trust to AllianceBernstein (asset management). Trust seems to be primarily made up of about 100 stocks. I just choose alphabetically the first 10 to illustrate:\n\n2 ADOBE INC\n2 ALPHABET INC \n10 ALTRIA GROUP INC \n18 AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO INC \n5 ANTHEM INC \n16 APPLE INC \n5 AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING INC \n98 BANK OF AMERICA CORP \n8 BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC DEL \n1 BOEING CO \n\nand Under U.S. Equity Strategic Equities - 3 Funds or Portfolios\n\n274    AB DISCOVERY VALUE FUND CL ADVISOR\n\n511    AB DISCOVERY GROWTH FUND CL ADVISOR\n\n560    AB SMALL CAP CORE PORTFOLIO CL ADVISOR\n\nand under:\n\nInternational Equity\nTax Managed International Portfolio\n\n2700    BERNSTEIN TAX-MANAGED INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO\n\nEmerging Market\nEmerging Markets Fund\n\n268    BERNSTEIN EMERGING MARKETS PORTFOLIO\n\nRight now it seems like the trust is cash rich and I am guessing (hoping) that the cash will be soon invested and attribute the trust to being cash rich because the trust is new. I will be speaking with the one of the trustees next week and while I have at this point very little if any influence (at this time) per the terms of how the trust was set up or managed in the future nonetheless I would like to be on solid ground when speaking should I choose to attempt to converse intelligently. 70 year old male.",
