However since you mentioned about liking tech, why don't you read about something that you're passionate about.\n\nPick out a niche in the sector that you like, preferably a small business that's not covered by a hundred analysts already. Researching a business can be aa but tedious and fun process if you're into it.\n\nLook for a bit old and stable businesses as these are easy to work on. Probably something like INTU or ANSS. \n\nBut most importantly if you're not having fun while picking stocks you should be picking ETFs.",
