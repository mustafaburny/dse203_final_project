I\u2019ve started with an initial \u00a31,000 but I\u2019m unsure of how to split it at the moment. I see most people on this sub seem to advise beginners to look into ETF\u2019s as a start. I looked into the Vanguard FTSE 250 however I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a good move in the current market or not. Also it\u2019s probably good to mention I\u2019ve already invested in a few tech companies such as RTX, NVDA (again not sure if that was smart) I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get loads of stick from more experienced traders but i guess I gotta start somewhere :).\n\nAny advice would be incredible",
