        "body": "Well this is /r/investing, so buy quality and hold, diversify (beyond just bonds which may or may not have a good future in a zero rate world), and have worldwide exposure/don't arbitrarily lock yourself to your own country.\n\nI actively trade, but in all likelihood in 2040 the investors at the top will likely have stories like \"As Waymo got bigger, my ETF kept buying more, and now Waymo is 10 trillion dollars. And as that Chinese electric car company grew and took 1/3 of the 1 billion person Chinese market, my ETF kept buying more on the way up.\"\n\nAlthough in that same vein, getting ahead of the tech curve might be one of the few ways for someone outside of the professional investor/institutional world to realistically get ahead. The trick is having the fortitude to hold for 1-2 decades. The financial crisis in '08 blew me out of so many hilariously good positions, like SBAC because the iPhone was just invented and 3G means more cell phone towers... It's not always rocket science. Anyone with some specialized insight into the future, whatever it may be, should consider putting a small well thought out speculative position on and leave it be. Small enough to not hurt if it goes nowhere, but big enough to care enough to check up and manage every few months.\n\nWow, just looked up an email from over 10 years ago. These names are probably in the mainstream investing language now, but wow... 10-100x if they were held. And it wasn't complex quant investing or anything, just looking ahead, positioning, and waiting.\n\nQuotes from the email circa 10 years ago: \"NVDA... They are also making a leap into scientific computing, where there's a lot of money to be made. They're the first major player to enter that arena to fight Intel and AMD in a long time, and their architecture is much more suited to scientific computing than the traditional CPUs that currently rule the top 100 supercomputer list. I think I'll see how that works out before selling NVDA\"\n\n\"I might want to put some money in AMD as well. They're here to stay and may still be undervalued...\"\n\n\"Universal Display Corp and LG Display (PANL/LPL) are also the leaders and partners in OLED screen development, which is bound to catch on eventually. Lower power use and much better image quality mean that it's just a matter of time before more devices adopt this new display technology and it becomes a new standard. I actually expect Apple to eventually partner up with LG (I think LG is their main LCD supplier) and use and use an OLED display on either a new product or a new Iphone version, which will kick OLED production into overdrive.\"\n\nFood for thought... MicroLED is likely going to grow 1000x over the coming decades. AR and LIDAR sensors for AR will probably not just be used for face unlock and will get some killer apps, the next Snapchat or TikTok might be AR based. Self-Driving is going to be powered by thousands of companies, not just NVIDIA and Waymo. Quantum computing? AI providers in the military contracting space? Clean cargo ship tech to get in front of green regulations? It's endless, and so many people know about these little niches of information that very few others do. Even mundane spaces see world changing innovation every day. Getting in front of a curve is inherently speculative but it is also entertaining, educational to follow through development, and can be extremely profitable.\n\nThat's my appeal for pulling a few pennies out of the ETF pile and doing some a little different, especially if you have a \"wheelhouse\" that you know a little bit more about.",

        "body": "MCD is a good dividend play, good yield and growth. V has a low yield but high growth. I own both. \n\nI own dividend stocks because it makes it easier to hold things like SHOP, AMZN, PAYC, NFLX, GOOGL, NVDA (negligible dividend but I\u2019ll take it). The dividends pay my living expense and the non-payers just sit in my portfolio and get bigger. All my stocks have a job, though not the same exact function. \n\nWould I have been better off with a portfolio of 100% SHOP calls? YOLO FTW? That would have done even better than QQQ, VUG, MCD or V, right? Well yeah, but I want to preserve my wealth as well as grow it. I also want to preserve my sanity. I want to sleep well at night, most nights. If I doubled my  net worth tomorrow it would not have a dramatic effect on my life, but if I lost it all I\u2019d be ruined. I\u2019m too old for that shit. \n\nSo it all depends on your goals and life circumstances too. If you\u2019re young and in accumulation mode, go for capital gains. Dividends literally do not matter to you; total return is all. If you\u2019re old and in withdrawal mode, dividends have a place (so do bonds). Chasing yield rarely ends well though.",
