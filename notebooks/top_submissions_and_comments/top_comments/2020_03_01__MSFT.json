March 15th, we'll also produce surgical masks) in China (Zaozhuang, Shandong specifically). We have a 500,000sq ft facility with a dedicated ISO class 5 Cleanroom for our 300,000 daily n95 production capabilities (and 1MM masks a day for surgical masks once it's at full operation) and we are taking bulk orders (10,000 pc minimum) for shipment within China, our clients are usually in charge of export as there simply isn't enough time for our limited employees to deal with exports. We supply to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in China called XiuZheng pharmaceutical group \u4fee\u6b63\u96c6\u56e2 and have sold millions of our n95 respirators to them. We also supply millions of n95 respirators to Xiaomi \u5c0f\u7c73, the phone company. We've had clients export to Russia, HK and US, though I'm not quite sure the exact logistics they went through. Some clients use freight forwarding companies.\n\nThe material costs have tripled in the last month alone so our masks are currently more expensive than usual, but people are nonstop purchasing due to the shortages. Hopefully we can help you get what you're looking for.  \n\nOur current pricing for n95 mask is 14rmb ($2 USD equivalent) for smaller orders of 10,000pcs+, 13 rmb ($1.86) for 50,000+, 12 rmb ($1.72) for 100,000pcs+, 11rmb ($1.57) for 1,000,000+ and 10rmb for 10,000,000+. This does not include shipping cost by SF Express which will be Cash on Delivery. It also does not include 10% taxes if applicable. Please keep in mind that material prices are constantly shifting so this may be out of date when you see this. Just two weeks ago (2/12/2020) our price per N95 mask was 18rmb while our prices in January was 4rmb! Once materials run out we cannot purchase them unless we pay a crazy amount for example, one ton of raw material used to cost 20,000 rmb, now for the same ton of n95 material costs 380,000-800,000 rmb, which is literally up to 40 times the cost for the same exact material. There is a global shortage of n95 grade materials.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me on Wechat or Whatsapp if you want to place orders. \n\nMy Wechat ID is: franktsaur and my WhatsApp ID is +16269916596. I am based in Los Angeles, but I work with the Asia team remotely. \n\nSincerely, \nFrank T.",

Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",
