I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

No I'd call him smart for actually taking action but I'm sure it wasn't his idea. He's just the face you all leech on to. I like how you deleted your post as if you were deleting evidence of your ignorance. Another classic from Trump's playbook, eh?",

Notify county and state health officials.\n\nNow, the student health center is setting up a similar planning session.\n\n\nThere have been no suspected cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, at the University of Rochester. But the school, with more than 12,000 students in western New York state, knows it might not stay that way.\n\n\u201cWe need to really get on top of things early,\u201d said Dr. Ralph Manchester, vice provost and director of University Health Service, the student health center.\n\nColleges and universities across the U.S. are updating pandemic protocols in anticipation of potential widespread outbreaks of the fast-moving virus. They have a unique challenge that can\u2019t be addressed by setting work-from-home policies, the way companies can. On campuses, thousands of students live in close quarters, with communal bathrooms and dining facilities.\n\nSchools look far different than they did during the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. The college student population has grown more diverse and mobile in the past decade, and faculty have more research relationships with counterparts in far-flung regions. That means plenty of people with recent travel to, or other connections with, China, South Korea, Europe and elsewhere.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nWhat is the conversation on your college campus like around the topic of coronavirus? Join the conversation below.\n\nColleges say they are following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including recommending 14-day self-isolation for individuals who may have been exposed.\n\nFour students at three schools in the Los Rios Community College District around Sacramento are in isolation, after being exposed to an individual who tested positive in northern California. The University of California, Davis, said Saturday evening it had released three students\u2014one being tested, and that person\u2019s roommates\u2014from isolation after the results came back negative for the virus.\n\n\nThe American College Health Association, an organization of campus health programs at more than 1,100 institutions, created a task force on the virus 10 days ago. \u201cAnd it is as if we have been shot out of a cannon since then,\u201d said Dr. Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia who is chairing the new group.\n\nThe team is reviewing guidelines from the CDC, World Health Organization, the U.S. State Department and other authorities, distilling medical literature into digestible advisories for campus communities and establishing guidelines to help members prepare for the disease.\n\nThe University of Rochester established a Coronavirus University Response Team in February, looking at everything from emergency response and public health to addressing possible xenophobia, monitoring international travel and planning for the potential impact on applications and enrollment.\n\nThe University of Colorado Boulder created a pandemic section for its emergency operations plan in 2015, and one for infectious disease a year later. The guidelines lay out things like how to coordinate with local health officials and various containment measures once a threat has been identified. The campus has roughly 35,500 students.\n\nDecisions such as halting campus operations would depend on how many cases were confirmed and where the affected people live, said Dan Jones, Boulder\u2019s associate vice chancellor for integrity, safety and compliance.\n\n\nSome schools don\u2019t have to dust off their doomsday guides because they have recently battled contagious diseases. Syracuse University had dozens of confirmed cases of mumps in late 2017 and had to coordinate closely with the CDC and county and state health departments.\n\nA few years ago, Rochester had roughly 200 reported cases of norovirus, whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Manchester said there were likely closer to 1,000 people affected.\n\nThe last six weeks of spring semester that year, the university was in \u201call-out \u2018control-this-outbreak\u2019 mode,\u201d Dr. Manchester said. The school stepped up regular cleaning services, switched to packaged-food distribution rather than open buffets like salad bars, and even swapped out buckets of coffee stirrers for individually wrapped ones.\n\nSchools see coronavirus preparation as a good opportunity to remind students and others to maintain proper hygiene, including covering coughs with arms and not hands, staying home when sick and washing hands regularly. To get the message out, they are sending emails, issuing flashing alerts on central websites and posting signs around campus.",

Equal weight to each.\n\n17% Bonds/Treasury ETFs: EDV\n\n50% Individual Stocks:  I play long term dividend stocks, 5G, Autonomous and Electric Vehicles, and AI/Robotics atm with a portion that goes to the five ARK ETFs and some leveraged ETFs like TMF and SSO.\n\nI harvest dividend stocks for cash and keep it in a separate HYSA.  I like dividend stocks for this purpose only.  With each one I intend to invest just enough to get one share a quarter through DRIP.  First year you sell 2 shares and keep 2 shares.  This provides you income and growth and you never have to invest in the stock again.  Eventually you will be able to sell 3 shares a year while keeping 3 and so on.  You usually have to pick stocks that will be around for at least 10 years to see a full return of your investment if the yield is around 5%.  I currently have T stocks set up this way and am now working on VZ.  Both are good 5G plays in my opinion as well so I expect they will see 100%+ ROI.\n\nYou may want to increase your exposure to bonds.  They are nice to sell off during a downturn like right now to provide you with some additional dry powder to buy stocks with.  With my 17% allocation, I sold a quarter of my shares last week.  If the overall market sees another 10% drop, I will sell another quarter.",

Mind you, Air Freight is not a viable way to transport some things, but for a lot of industries Air Fright is allowing them to \"patch\" their supply line disruptions by rushing parts from China to the USA.\n\nAnything that shortens that time and makes it easier to get in parts and material from China and alternate suppliers will help.  Tariff reductions are pissing in the ocean compared to the consequences of a production line not working at full capacity or stopping, or business not being able to get things like tooling and machine parts that are needed to keep the lines going.",

        "body": "Disagree.  As OP stated, Trump is brazenly corrupt and reckless and dishonest, so once you lift the restrictions that any sane or reasonable or honest person would respect, it's easy to see what could happen.\n\nRate cuts: he and his unqualified minions have already successfully manipulated Powell and the Fed into a wholly unnecessary rate cutting mindset.  Over 70% of analysts now *expect* more cuts.  He's been crying like a baby for negative interest rate policy for a year.\n\nSecond, you don't need actual tax cuts, you just need *announcements* of tax cuts.  He can't pass any legislation, and the one and only big piece he did pass during his whole term was a huge cut for billionaires/corporations. So he doesn't have to actually *pass* legislation, he just needs to *promise* it.  And guess what he just started doing again: promising some mysterious \"middle class\" tax cut.   The cuts can be as fraudulent as the last ones.  His followers ar paying more but claiming they're not.  Reality has no meaning.\n\nBut then you say there's nothing else he can do.  So wrong.  He can declare fake victory in his fake trade war against China.  Like everything he says, it can be a lie.  Look at what his fake and bizarre \"phase one deal\" announcement did to supercharge stock prices.  Him declaring \"the war is over\" (again) will elevate stocks.  He'll know that following the election he can just declare a new fake war if he feels like it or if his age-related paranoia kicks in.\n\nNext, he can make fraudulent \"infrastructure\" promises.  This is why I really wish the idiot Democrats would claim \"Infrastructure bill\" as one of their main platforms, like how reasonable health care or new green deal or student loan relief are indelibly associated with the Dems.\n\nWhichever party *credibly* owns the promise to create millions of jobs to repair our decaying infrastructure, that party will win. (If the Dems weren't so dumb they would have made New Green Deal a job stimulus concept instead of an ecological one.).  And just the announcement of such an infrastructure initiative is guaranteed to pump some of the most beaten down sectors and names.",

I shared my strategy a couple times and got roasted both times even though I was posting 66% growth in a few weeks on straight stock growth (no options), and my strategy is probably not nearly as sophisticated as yours.\n\nLike you, I'm humble in that I definitely don't know it all and I know my strategy is not perfect, which is part of my reason for posting it in the past -- it would be much more useful for everyone if people offered constructive criticism and ideas for improving strategies rather than just trying to tear them down.\n\nIf we help each other's ideas we can all benefit from seeing the results of those tweaks (good or bad). If we tear each other down then those people won't share again and then only that one person potentially benefits. That's basically where we both are now.\n\nI don't know if it's jealousy or what, but most people seem to focus on why something won't work at some point in the future rather than why it is working now, how to scale it, repeat it, or how to protect the gains that it is accumulating.\n\nI am curious about your lawsuit though... if it's not related to stock trading, how come it affects your willingness to share your stock strategy?\n\nEither way, keep up the great work!",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

It could also be possible there simply isn't enough oil storage to hold all the excess production.\n\nWith supply now dropping all it takes is for demand to immediately return that will spike the price up. There will now not be enough oil supply to meet demand which will cause prices to skyrocket. Then oil companies will start investing back into their fields to turn them back on. \n\nBuy now and then sell on the next price spike to $70+/bbl.",

Join the conversation below.\n\nColleges say they are following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including recommending 14-day self-isolation for individuals who may have been exposed.\n\nFour students at three schools in the Los Rios Community College District around Sacramento are in isolation, after being exposed to an individual who tested positive in northern California. The University of California, Davis, said Saturday evening it had released three students\u2014one being tested, and that person\u2019s roommates\u2014from isolation after the results came back negative for the virus.\n\n\nThe American College Health Association, an organization of campus health programs at more than 1,100 institutions, created a task force on the virus 10 days ago. \u201cAnd it is as if we have been shot out of a cannon since then,\u201d said Dr. Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia who is chairing the new group.\n\nThe team is reviewing guidelines from the CDC, World Health Organization, the U.S. State Department and other authorities, distilling medical literature into digestible advisories for campus communities and establishing guidelines to help members prepare for the disease.\n\nThe University of Rochester established a Coronavirus University Response Team in February, looking at everything from emergency response and public health to addressing possible xenophobia, monitoring international travel and planning for the potential impact on applications and enrollment.\n\nThe University of Colorado Boulder created a pandemic section for its emergency operations plan in 2015, and one for infectious disease a year later. The guidelines lay out things like how to coordinate with local health officials and various containment measures once a threat has been identified. The campus has roughly 35,500 students.\n\nDecisions such as halting campus operations would depend on how many cases were confirmed and where the affected people live, said Dan Jones, Boulder\u2019s associate vice chancellor for integrity, safety and compliance.\n\n\nSome schools don\u2019t have to dust off their doomsday guides because they have recently battled contagious diseases. Syracuse University had dozens of confirmed cases of mumps in late 2017 and had to coordinate closely with the CDC and county and state health departments.\n\nA few years ago, Rochester had roughly 200 reported cases of norovirus, whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Manchester said there were likely closer to 1,000 people affected.\n\nThe last six weeks of spring semester that year, the university was in \u201call-out \u2018control-this-outbreak\u2019 mode,\u201d Dr. Manchester said. The school stepped up regular cleaning services, switched to packaged-food distribution rather than open buffets like salad bars, and even swapped out buckets of coffee stirrers for individually wrapped ones.\n\nSchools see coronavirus preparation as a good opportunity to remind students and others to maintain proper hygiene, including covering coughs with arms and not hands, staying home when sick and washing hands regularly. To get the message out, they are sending emails, issuing flashing alerts on central websites and posting signs around campus.",

Equal weight to each.\n\n17% Bonds/Treasury ETFs: EDV\n\n50% Individual Stocks:  I play long term dividend stocks, 5G, Autonomous and Electric Vehicles, and AI/Robotics atm with a portion that goes to the five ARK ETFs and some leveraged ETFs like TMF and SSO.\n\nI harvest dividend stocks for cash and keep it in a separate HYSA.  I like dividend stocks for this purpose only.  With each one I intend to invest just enough to get one share a quarter through DRIP.  First year you sell 2 shares and keep 2 shares.  This provides you income and growth and you never have to invest in the stock again.  Eventually you will be able to sell 3 shares a year while keeping 3 and so on.  You usually have to pick stocks that will be around for at least 10 years to see a full return of your investment if the yield is around 5%.  I currently have T stocks set up this way and am now working on VZ.  Both are good 5G plays in my opinion as well so I expect they will see 100%+ ROI.\n\nYou may want to increase your exposure to bonds.  They are nice to sell off during a downturn like right now to provide you with some additional dry powder to buy stocks with.  With my 17% allocation, I sold a quarter of my shares last week.  If the overall market sees another 10% drop, I will sell another quarter.",

Mind you, Air Freight is not a viable way to transport some things, but for a lot of industries Air Fright is allowing them to \"patch\" their supply line disruptions by rushing parts from China to the USA.\n\nAnything that shortens that time and makes it easier to get in parts and material from China and alternate suppliers will help.

As OP stated, Trump is brazenly corrupt and reckless and dishonest, so once you lift the restrictions that any sane or reasonable or honest person would respect, it's easy to see what could happen.\n\nRate cuts: he and his unqualified minions have already successfully manipulated Powell and the Fed into a wholly unnecessary rate cutting mindset.  Over 70% of analysts now *expect* more cuts.  He's been crying like a baby for negative interest rate policy for a year.\n\nSecond, you don't need actual tax cuts, you just need *announcements* of tax cuts.  He can't pass any legislation, and the one and only big piece he did pass during his whole term was a huge cut for billionaires/corporations. So he doesn't have to actually *pass* legislation, he just needs to *promise* it.  And guess what he just started doing again: promising some mysterious \"middle class\" tax cut.   The cuts can be as fraudulent as the last ones.  His followers ar paying more but claiming they're not.  Reality has no meaning.\n\nBut then you say there's nothing else he can do.  So wrong.  He can declare fake victory in his fake trade war against China.  Like everything he says, it can be a lie.  Look at what his fake and bizarre \"phase one deal\" announcement did to supercharge stock prices.  Him declaring \"the war is over\" (again) will elevate stocks.  He'll know that following the election he can just declare a new fake war if he feels like it or if his age-related paranoia kicks in.\n\nNext, he can make fraudulent \"infrastructure\" promises.  This is why I really wish the idiot Democrats would claim \"Infrastructure bill\" as one of their main platforms, like how reasonable health care or new green deal or student loan relief are indelibly associated with the Dems.\n\nWhichever party *credibly* owns the promise to create millions of jobs to repair our decaying infrastructure, that party will win. (If the Dems weren't so dumb they would have made New Green Deal a job stimulus concept instead of an ecological one.).  And just the announcement of such an infrastructure initiative is guaranteed to pump some of the most beaten down sectors and names.",

Made 20 grand long on Tesla shares and then Tesla puts end of day today on some quick whatever trades. \n\n And then one of my covid patients died. It was expected, but sad. Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day. It has for 5 years and still does now. Love you guys. Stay safe.",

Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",
