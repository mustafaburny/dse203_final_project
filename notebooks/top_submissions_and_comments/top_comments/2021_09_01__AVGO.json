That's a lot to play with. They have positions in some really powerful companies. They are boring but that's fine as long as they keep wining. \n\nASML has no real competition and will continue to dominate their sector of the market.

Then I launched my own consulting company - quickly figured out that services work doesn't scale well - pivoted the business to a product startup and used the consulting to finance it.  All told, it took 20 years to get a really big exit - like net of over $200M.  \nThere is no shortcut that I know of - education, skills, experience,  lots of hard work for years and then luck.\nNow I get to do whatever I like, I am typing this from a private jet on the wifi coming back from vacation... I know, wtf. I pinch myself too.\n\n\n2) How can I invest like you?\n\nWell. I have a lot of money so I can make risky bets.  I don't do options though, only stocks. I put $50k into GME on a whim at $65 and sold when it hit $350.  That was a laugh.  \n\nBut seriously, I invest in stocks that I feel like I know. I use HUBS - they are in a great space and really appealing to SMB. I see them as the most viable competitor to Salesforce - go look at Salesforce's market cap. Classic Clayton Christensen - you will be eaten from below.\n\nI am not really much of an investor - just see things that make sense. I bought Amazon at $350 - should have put in more...\n\nI typically invest in tech stocks because I feel like I understand the business.\n\nMy stock account is just my plaything. My real investing is much more structured and done with my wealth advisor at a large brokerage.",
