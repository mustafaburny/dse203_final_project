I usually look for a huge Margin of Safety too so even if assets aren\u2019t discounted\u2026 I\u2019m set.\n\nI have a question as you are an accountant, how are companies like LMT and VRSN great buys with negative equity (tangible book value for LMT)? Please help me understand companies with negative tangible book value. Via DCF LMT is fucking amazing and I analyzed it back at 320 figured it would go to 500 or so and already to 390.",

        "body": "I looked (quickly) at LMT, I have to say it is very complicated to assess. Also, I am not very familiar with the activity (I think it is the key point, if you know the activity, you can properly assess your future cahs flows).\n\nI really summed up and highlighted the annoying items to me because your question need a good hour talking to explain the basics.\n\nSo, they generate a 6bn net income from 10bn assets....they do not have R&amp;D expenses.... these are 2 very strange factors (although the second one could be due to the lack of details of my source).\n\nThe Long term debt is higher than the net assets.\n\nYou are not anymore on value investing. You are on a Growth investing.\n\nLet's say they keep growing steadily, they will reach easily the 500. \n\nThat's where it becomes tricky: you now have to evaluate the target market.\n\nIs the income really steady ? Because if it is not, you have a liquidation value looking at 6bn (at its best based on net assets). It is not a great buy to me, the risks are high and the reward not enough high.\n\nVRSN is also growth investing, yes net asset is negative but your profits are easily covering it and the company is backed up by the stock market. \n\nFor me, it is a goldmine, the current price is not overvalued/undervalued, but you don't know when you will be out of gold. they are investing in developping their activity.\n\nThis market is growing incredibly but the competition is also fierce. The good news is that this company has more opportunities (compared to LMT) for its strategy. \n\nA good prospect for growth potential. Assessing the management team would be key here, I think a DCF will not be relevant (too much unpredictable).\n\nTo come back to the tangible assets, do not forget two elements of the two examples you gave me: the age of the Company is important, a young Company 5 to 10 years old, should have a poor BS because they should focus on growing and reinvest. An old Company should have an healthy BS.\n\nTechnology companies DO NOT have a good balance sheet because the intangibles are not valued ! It is a big debate among accountants worldwide because companies fully focused on software do not have tangibles and therefore a lower Equity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to look at tangibles assets, always look for growth in net tangibles assets (if the Company use tangible assets....)!",
