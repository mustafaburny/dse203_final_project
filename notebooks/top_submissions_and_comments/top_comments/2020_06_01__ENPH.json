Much safer to just play stocks. \n\nBut, I do occasionally play options, cautiously, in my IRA. Like this morning, I bought ENPH puts in my IRA.\n\nThere is literally nothing more satisfying in the options game than making a big play in your IRA. 100% tax free, and you feel like you cheated the system by basically forcing several years of contributions in your tax-advantaged account. And you feel like you actually did something useful (retirement) vs. just making fat stacks to blow on a car or computer or some shit.\n\nFeels fucking goodman",

I exited my positions, so I have no skin in the game, but the report is pretty convincing.\n\nBasically they studied ENPH for two years, then went to India and spoke to a bunch of employees handling their books, and found tons of evidence of cooked books.\n\nAfter they went to India and did this private investigation, ENPH executives and board members sold $120.9 million worth of ENPH shares in the span of just fifteen days from June 1st to June 15th, and ENPH's previous largest shareholder sold its entire ~11% stake in just one day on May 20th.\n\nThen they release this report, and the stock plummets.\n\nThen last night, someone from JPMorgan was like \"nah I don't think so, they seem legit to me,\" and now everyone just completely accepted that the original report was a scam, and the stock rallied today.\n\nTo me, it seems like if anyone is being sketchy, it's this JPMorgan analyst. There's no way he really could've done the DD in one day and investigate the claims to properly release a public statement against the initial report, and it seems super obvious he was just trying to prevent a continued sell-off.\n\nAnyway, that's my retarded 2 cents.",

        "body": "Airlines and cruises are a gamble from now until the foreseeable future. Some obviously will make it out and provide a solid profit. I would say consolidate to the few you believe in and have a solid balance sheet to weather this virus and other events. The fed announced they won\u2019t increase rates until late 2021 or 2022 (can\u2019t remember) so this means they\u2019re expecting a long recovery. A lot of cruises operate mostly out of Florida and they are seeing a resurgence of cases since re-opening. Also, airlines will have to re-evaluate how they pack people on, can\u2019t have 200 people in 200 sq.ft. anymore. They will likely be operating at a significantly reduced capacity for a while. Not to mention people are saying a reemergence of covid come fall. It will likely hurt airlines/cruises again. Airlines may be bailed out by government due to the necessary travel for business. Cruises will not, they are flagged in a different nation for taxes, employ people from (mostly) developing countries, and don\u2019t provide any benefit to the government here. Cruises are already not sailing until late August/early October so that paints a bad Q2/3. \n\nI\u2019m not saying cruises and airlines aren\u2019t a good investment, some of them may provide a good return. Just pick a handful that have good balance sheets and can handle the weather of the coming months. ALSO, diversify your portfolio. You have some diversity now but go further. Maybe close some of your redundant positions on the next green day. If airlines go up, all of them will, but if airlines go down, you can have a diverse portfolio to counteract that as some of your stocks will go up. \n\nPersonally, I like green energy like ENPH or 5G like NOK, smaller players would be PLUG, or BLNK. That\u2019s just my portfolio though and it\u2019s risky. If you\u2019re looking for confident returns, go with ETFs like real estate or a index. Other stock options would be Microsoft, baba, JD, amazon, Facebook, google, those kinds of stock that will be relatively consistent over the years. Good luck man!",

        "body": "Okta is going to start getting the Microsoft treatment real bad in the years to come.  Okta's products are significantly better, but Microsoft is bundling theirs into existing license agreements.\n\nSailpoint is likely the big play for security identity in the near future, with their focus more on the governance aspects.  Microsoft will eventually bundle them out as well, but not for a few years at least.\n\nPANW has acquired some good cloud-based security solutions.  It really depends on how well they integrate, which today is not at all.  They do have a SASE solution, which is likely to be a big wave in \"cloud security\" over the next few years.\n\nI think CRWD is basically Carbon Black of a few years ago.  Endpoint solutions come and go all the time in the security industry.\n\nHonestly, I think maybe the best security stock is Fortinet, but that's not really a cloud play specifically.",

        "body": "I work in Cyber and these guys are not the key players anymore.  The core areas that FEYE focuses (Threat Detection, Threat Intel and Incident Response) is highly dependent on talented people.  In the Cyber-biz , the most talented players usually end up at the best companies (i.e., sexy pre-IPO companies, and public companies that are executing well and rising stock price) and when a company's stock spends an extended amount of time bouncing between $10-$15 (like FEYE), the talent departs for places where they will make more money.  There are exceptions of course, but this is generally true in tech and cyber even more so.  Talent drain creates a death-spiral from which recovery is difficult and rare.\n\nSure they might get bought for their installed base which would pop the stock, but failing that, there is no catalyst for this company to benefit from the current situation.\n\nThe hot public companies (PFPT, PANW, FTNT,CRWD) will stay hot until they are not cool any more.  For now those are the cool ones.",
