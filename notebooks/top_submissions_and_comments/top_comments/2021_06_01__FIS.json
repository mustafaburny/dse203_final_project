You don't have to watch the market every day, you don't have to actively trade, just enjoy your life and collect your cash. Also many dividend stocks struggle to go up in value, but also don't tend to drop dramatically for no reason. Dividends are an end-game feature, and a pretty nice one, but the average redditor that has 40k in a fidelity account isn't going to see much use out of them.",

It does not require proportional weighting. This index is developed mid-cap and large-cap only, limiting the fund exposure to mid and large-cap funds for the majority of investment. The fund does not maintain a small-cap allocation.\n\n\r  \nGeode is permitted to utilize statistical sampling techniques to match investment characteristics of a variety of factors between the index and the fund. \n\n\r  \nFiling 485BPOS filed 2021-02-24 discusses the proprietary weighting strategy of \u201cFidelity Value Factor Index\u201d. The section goes on to explain the index\u2019s weighting and composite scoring methodology. Composite measures: High FCF yield, low enterprise value to EBITDA, low price to tangible book value, and low price to future earnings. Size-bias is removed, and the highest composite scores are utilized. The country-weights of the index are intended to match the developed international market. Each stock group category is market-cap weighted internally, plus a group weighting adjustment is applied, then each sector is equal-weighted against the international market portfolio. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing is semi-annual in February and August\n\n\r  \nOpinion: \n\n\r  \nThe management structure warrants additional investigation, as the senior manager covers many funds, and there has been a senior-management change. Next step would be to analyze the overlap of non-senior portfolio managers to ensure at least some competent member of management treats this as a primary fund. Due to the low management fee and small capitalization this is unlikely. Additionally research must be completed as to the compensation agreements between Geode and its managers, as well as Fidelity and Geode. \n\n\r  \nThe underlying indexing strategy is uninspired and vulnerable to value traps. The low adherence required to the underlying index poses ethical conflict to primary managers of the fund dependent upon compensation agreements. This is compounded by the ability of Geode to allocate per their statistical sampling techniques. \n\n\r  \nWhile their mandate permits small and mid-cap securities, a large majority of the fund is large-cap. Size tilt should be accounted for when determining any allocation. Additionally, they have deviated from the global allocation with a Euro-centric tilt against their mandate. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing periods align with that of the MSCI ACWI Ex US index, which is quarterly rebalanced. Semi-annual rebalancing will result in drift away from MSCI on the underlying fund index. \n\n\r  \nCurrency risk of this fund may require portfolio-level currency management upon purchase. \n\n\r  \nInvestability is low due to low ADV and wide spreads, among other market impact concerns. This fund may be a target for creation-unit arbitrage given the large liquid underlying securities and relatively high premium available for the underlying securities. It should be noted total fund value equals only \\~11 creation units.",

Fidelity has been great for me. While I'm not a huge fan of the 60 cent commission on every option contract and their app could use an upgrade the rest of their service is amazing. Customer service is responsive, research notes are great, they provide analyst reports on most companies, free seminars that teach you more about investing/options, allow you to trade on foreign exchanges, etc. If I had to summarize - RH is for newbies and Fidelity or TDA are big boy brokers",

        "body": "Thanks for your question. There are a number of ways in which we are very different, and the differences are really significant. First and foremost, Payoneer was custom-built for business to business transactions, while Paypal focuses primarily on consumer to business payments.   This means our infrastructure and pricing are targeted at bigger transactions at lower price points while Paypal is essentially built around consumer credit card infrastructure and pricing, which is too high for B2B.  Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",
