You don't have to watch the market every day, you don't have to actively trade, just enjoy your life and collect your cash. Also many dividend stocks struggle to go up in value, but also don't tend to drop dramatically for no reason. Dividends are an end-game feature, and a pretty nice one, but the average redditor that has 40k in a fidelity account isn't going to see much use out of them.",

It does not require proportional weighting. This index is developed mid-cap and large-cap only, limiting the fund exposure to mid and large-cap funds for the majority of investment. The fund does not maintain a small-cap allocation.\n\n\r  \nGeode is permitted to utilize statistical sampling techniques to match investment characteristics of a variety of factors between the index and the fund. \n\n\r  \nFiling 485BPOS filed 2021-02-24 discusses the proprietary weighting strategy of \u201cFidelity Value Factor Index\u201d. The section goes on to explain the index\u2019s weighting and composite scoring methodology. Composite measures: High FCF yield, low enterprise value to EBITDA, low price to tangible book value, and low price to future earnings. Size-bias is removed, and the highest composite scores are utilized. The country-weights of the index are intended to match the developed international market. Each stock group category is market-cap weighted internally, plus a group weighting adjustment is applied, then each sector is equal-weighted against the international market portfolio. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing is semi-annual in February and August\n\n\r  \nOpinion: \n\n\r  \nThe management structure warrants additional investigation, as the senior manager covers many funds, and there has been a senior-management change. Next step would be to analyze the overlap of non-senior portfolio managers to ensure at least some competent member of management treats this as a primary fund. Due to the low management fee and small capitalization this is unlikely. Additionally research must be completed as to the compensation agreements between Geode and its managers, as well as Fidelity and Geode. \n\n\r  \nThe underlying indexing strategy is uninspired and vulnerable to value traps. The low adherence required to the underlying index poses ethical conflict to primary managers of the fund dependent upon compensation agreements. This is compounded by the ability of Geode to allocate per their statistical sampling techniques. \n\n\r  \nWhile their mandate permits small and mid-cap securities, a large majority of the fund is large-cap. Size tilt should be accounted for when determining any allocation. Additionally, they have deviated from the global allocation with a Euro-centric tilt against their mandate. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing periods align with that of the MSCI ACWI Ex US index, which is quarterly rebalanced. Semi-annual rebalancing will result in drift away from MSCI on the underlying fund index. \n\n\r  \nCurrency risk of this fund may require portfolio-level currency management upon purchase. \n\n\r  \nInvestability is low due to low ADV and wide spreads, among other market impact concerns. This fund may be a target for creation-unit arbitrage given the large liquid underlying securities and relatively high premium available for the underlying securities. It should be noted total fund value equals only \\~11 creation units.",

They don\u2019t have a lot of the bureaucratic overhead that the major institutions have grown over the years, and (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) RH doesn\u2019t have numerous different types of accounts (401k, IRAs, college savings accounts, etc) all having different infrastructures all synchronizing into a mobile app. I imagine if you looked at diagrams detailing the systems designs between RH and the big guys (Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, TD, etc) you\u2019d see that they\u2019re way more complex and also old.\n\nNot that it\u2019s an excuse, just my best guess.

        "body": "You are correct this is not a full due-diligence report, and I think you misunderstand what I was trying to do. The purpose of this is to give a high level summary of some key features of the fund, and to determine whether it is investable from a portfolio management perspective. Based on the ADV/spreads it is not realistically investable for me, so much of the remainder of the information listed is moot for my purposes. For that reason I touch on a couple high notes so that if I were to ever come back to this fund I would have some context to start from. My full documentation is about 12 pages, but I figured I would toss some summary info up here for anyone who was interested. \n\nThe info I gathered was from Morningstar reports and (primarily) their EDGAR filings, which I reviewed all of. I did not look at the Fidelity website. I also did not copy + paste anything besides the manager/advisor names\n\nI called it euro-centric because it has 134% of the euro allocation of the market index. It isn't a positive or negative, just something to be aware of. Tracking error and prospectus limitations are different issues as one is forward looking and one is backwards looking. When doing portfolio allocation of investor funds being aware of the degree of third-party discretion is important, and since it is not investable for me at this point I did not evaluate historical tracking error. There is no \"problem\" per se at present, but the structure of the fund and loose tracking requirements indicates that before investing client money additional research would need to be done as to how management is compensated, that is all. \n\nThere are several strategies to avoiding value traps in passive investments, the most common are \"quality adjusting\", or G-scoring, or F-Scoring, among many others. [Here](http://www.independance-et-expansion.com/files/upload/fondements-theoriques/Novy-Marx%20-%20Value%20Investing%202013.pdf) and [Here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2672906?seq=1) are a couple articles on the topic. You will note that the size dimension plays a role in the effects of quality-adjustment, which is why I addressed the portfolio size tilt in my opinion.",

Mutual funds trade at the end of the day. Many funds have a dual presence like VTI (total market ETF) and VTSAX (mutual fund version of VTI). I own ETFs and mutual funds.\n\nNote that Fidelity's zero fee funds are proprietary and can't ever be moved to another brokerage. For an IRA this is probably not a big problem.\n\nSome purchase questions\n\n1. What kind of fund asset class or factors do I want? (Total Market, Total non US, bonds, REITs, dividend yield, value, etc.)\n\n2. and what form of the fund do I want (ETF or mutual fund)\n\n3.

Is there a fee to buy these with my broker?",

        "body": "Thanks for your question. There are a number of ways in which we are very different, and the differences are really significant. First and foremost, Payoneer was custom-built for business to business transactions, while Paypal focuses primarily on consumer to business payments.   This means our infrastructure and pricing are targeted at bigger transactions at lower price points while Paypal is essentially built around consumer credit card infrastructure and pricing, which is too high for B2B.  Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",

No effective hedging identified. \n\n\r  \nLending permitted. Per NPORT-P filed on 2021-03-16 securities lending was conducted using all-cash collateral\n\n\r  \nListed: NYSE ARCA\n\n\r  \nPortfolio weightings range from .38% to 2.2% per NPORT-P on 2021-03-16\r  \nNotes: Fund limits 80% of investments to those held by the \u201cFidelity Value Factor Index\u201d. It does not require proportional weighting. This index is developed mid-cap and large-cap only, limiting the fund exposure to mid and large-cap funds for the majority of investment. The fund does not maintain a small-cap allocation.\n\n\r  \nGeode is permitted to utilize statistical sampling techniques to match investment characteristics of a variety of factors between the index and the fund. \n\n\r  \nFiling 485BPOS filed 2021-02-24 discusses the proprietary weighting strategy of \u201cFidelity Value Factor Index\u201d. The section goes on to explain the index\u2019s weighting and composite scoring methodology. Composite measures: High FCF yield, low enterprise value to EBITDA, low price to tangible book value, and low price to future earnings. Size-bias is removed, and the highest composite scores are utilized. The country-weights of the index are intended to match the developed international market. Each stock group category is market-cap weighted internally, plus a group weighting adjustment is applied, then each sector is equal-weighted against the international market portfolio. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing is semi-annual in February and August\n\n\r  \nOpinion: \n\n\r  \nThe management structure warrants additional investigation, as the senior manager covers many funds, and there has been a senior-management change. Next step would be to analyze the overlap of non-senior portfolio managers to ensure at least some competent member of management treats this as a primary fund. Due to the low management fee and small capitalization this is unlikely. Additionally research must be completed as to the compensation agreements between Geode and its managers, as well as Fidelity and Geode. \n\n\r  \nThe underlying indexing strategy is uninspired and vulnerable to value traps. The low adherence required to the underlying index poses ethical conflict to primary managers of the fund dependent upon compensation agreements. This is compounded by the ability of Geode to allocate per their statistical sampling techniques. \n\n\r  \nWhile their mandate permits small and mid-cap securities, a large majority of the fund is large-cap. Size tilt should be accounted for when determining any allocation. Additionally, they have deviated from the global allocation with a Euro-centric tilt against their mandate. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing periods align with that of the MSCI ACWI Ex US index, which is quarterly rebalanced. Semi-annual rebalancing will result in drift away from MSCI on the underlying fund index. \n\n\r  \nCurrency risk of this fund may require portfolio-level currency management upon purchase. \n\n\r  \nInvestability is low due to low ADV and wide spreads, among other market impact concerns. This fund may be a target for creation-unit arbitrage given the large liquid underlying securities and relatively high premium available for the underlying securities. It should be noted total fund value equals only \\~11 creation units.",

        "body": "You are correct this is not a full due-diligence report, and I think you misunderstand what I was trying to do. The purpose of this is to give a high level summary of some key features of the fund, and to determine whether it is investable from a portfolio management perspective. Based on the ADV/spreads it is not realistically investable for me, so much of the remainder of the information listed is moot for my purposes. For that reason I touch on a couple high notes so that if I were to ever come back to this fund I would have some context to start from. My full documentation is about 12 pages, but I figured I would toss some summary info up here for anyone who was interested. \n\nThe info I gathered was from Morningstar reports and (primarily) their EDGAR filings, which I reviewed all of. I did not look at the Fidelity website. I also did not copy + paste anything besides the manager/advisor names\n\nI called it euro-centric because it has 134% of the euro allocation of the market index. It isn't a positive or negative, just something to be aware of. Tracking error and prospectus limitations are different issues as one is forward looking and one is backwards looking. When doing portfolio allocation of investor funds being aware of the degree of third-party discretion is important, and since it is not investable for me at this point I did not evaluate historical tracking error. There is no \"problem\" per se at present, but the structure of the fund and loose tracking requirements indicates that before investing client money additional research would need to be done as to how management is compensated, that is all. \n\nThere are several strategies to avoiding value traps in passive investments, the most common are \"quality adjusting\", or G-scoring, or F-Scoring, among many others. [Here](http://www.independance-et-expansion.com/files/upload/fondements-theoriques/Novy-Marx%20-%20Value%20Investing%202013.pdf) and [Here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2672906?seq=1) are a couple articles on the topic. You will note that the size dimension plays a role in the effects of quality-adjustment, which is why I addressed the portfolio size tilt in my opinion.",

First and foremost, Payoneer was custom-built for business to business transactions, while Paypal focuses primarily on consumer to business payments.   This means our infrastructure and pricing are targeted at bigger transactions at lower price points while Paypal is essentially built around consumer credit card infrastructure and pricing, which is too high for B2B.  Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",

        "body": "So first of all you have to realize that when you open a credit spread, it's a contract you have to manage. You don't just open and walk away, you have to think through the whole time frame. I primarily trade in RH and Fidelity. I love RH (people will probably scream at me for that) the execution has gotten a lot better since the start of last year AND it is really easy to roll the spread if you need to and save your ass. \n\nSo looking at SPY right now. RSI is at 57 so a little oversold but its coming off its correction so I'm ok with that. MACD bounced off its low the end of last month. We're seeing some stagnation but I'm pretty confident we aren't going to see a massive correction by the end of next week. We also haven't seen it cross the 50 day moving average really since that one time in March. \n\nSo actually I just opened a 100 spread order for 6/11 405/404 @$5/spread so $10K tied up for a $500 premium. And people will scoff at this but really that's 5% return in two weeks for basically doing nothing but looking at a chart and clicking some buttons (yes not with taxes blah blah blah, but taxes wont be realized until next year so..) given market conditions this allows me to sleep too. I may open more this week depending on the market, I opened one yesterday for 6/11 as well 402.5/402.",

        "body": "\nPaysafe preps post-Spac\u00a0refi\n\u00a0\n\n02 Jun 2021\n\nFintech payments provider Paysafe has launched a refinancing of its remaining credit facilities, following its $9bn merger with a Bill Foley-controlled Spac, which closed in March. The merger and its accompanying PIPE allowed the firm to pay down debt and cut its leverage, and now it wants to lock in the benefits with a lower-cost refi.\n\nJP Morgan is sole physical bookrunner on the dollar and euro term loans, totalling $1.026bn between the currencies. This will be followed with an equal sized slug of bonds in dollar and euros, yet to be launched.\nTalk on both tranches is 300bp-325bp at 99.5, with a 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, half a turn below its present level, according to the loan marketing materials.\nLenders have successfully pushed back on proposed margin ratchet terms \u2014\u00a0including Cerba, for example \u2014 but these are generally deals which started with more aggressive terms, such as multiple step-downs for each quarter-turn of leverage. Deals with 25bp for half a turn have largely sailed through.\n\"It's a real economic term and something investors can easily rally around,\" said a leveraged finance syndicate banker. \"Some of the other docs points can be a bit of a niche interest but this is universal.\"\nPaysafe earmarked \u20ac1.25bn-equivalent of its outstanding debt for repayment as part of the merger, which closed at the end of March. The company said in\u00a0its introduction to equity market analysts\u00a0that it would have net leverage of 3.6-3.8 times on its 2021 earnings following the transaction \u2014 suggesting it intends to activate the margin step-down quickly.\nIt will, however, be going on the acquisition trail as well. Outlining the deal to analysts, Foley said: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6 times. As Paysafe continues to grow and generate cash flow, that leverage ratio will continue to come down creating even more opportunity to pursue accretive M&amp;A opportunities.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s estimated leverage at 5.2 times on March 2021 numbers, after backing out some of the company\u2019s adjustments.\nBased on its expected 2021 Ebitda, the business was 6-6.2 times levered at the end of last year, with net debt of $2.99bn, incurred when Blackstone and CVC took the firm private in 2017. The sponsors scored a huge win with the transaction, paying \u00a33bn for the company and selling it on at a valuation of $9bn.\nHowever, both firms will remain invested. They took $2.3bn off the table as part of the Spac deal, but rolled over $3.29bn, while the Spac itself put in $1.467bn.\nThe PIPE investment (private investment in public equity) closed at the same time injected a further $2bn, with cornerstones from Foley-affiliated entities Cannae Holdings and Trasimene Capital Management, and outside capital from Fidelity, Third Point, and Maplelane Asset Management.\nAlongside the term loan and bond refi, the company will have a new $305m revolver in place following the closing of the deal.\nSpac-driven M&amp;A activity is increasingly\u00a0feeding through to leveraged credit markets and to CLO portfolios, as sponsor-owned companies become targets for SPAC acquisitions. The equity raised through this route usually deleverages the company, meaning loan repayments or refinancings tighter \u2014 in some cases, helping take out loans trading at low levels at par.\nPaysafe\u2019s existing euro loan already had a margin of 325bp, the wide end of the new guidance, but it also had outstanding second lien debt of $200m and \u20ac214m in its original LBO capital structure, which paid 725bp and 700bp respectively and have now been repaid.",

I've gone from barely having enough to invest to nearly not being subject to pattern day trader restrictions in the span of eight months. At this point I'm planning on basically only holding blue chips with one or two other real plays for barely a couple hundred thousand at most after all this pans out so I can prove to myself I'm not just a lucky retard that got in on the tail end of the biggest bull run in modern history, and so that in the event I'm wrong I'll still have millions I can just leave in my fidelity account and make enough off interest from to live fat until the day I die. And that's if I'm just the laziest bastard that ever lived.  \n\nStocks will never be this fun for me again and given all the regulations that have been passed leading up to this insanity I've got a strong feeling that 8% gains per year will be a lot moving forward. At least there's plenty of squeezes to get in on atm though, and I'll be able to buy the dip on ford and apple eventually so I've got that going for me which is nice.",

First and foremost, Payoneer was custom-built for business to business transactions, while Paypal focuses primarily on consumer to business payments.   This means our infrastructure and pricing are targeted at bigger transactions at lower price points while Paypal is essentially built around consumer credit card infrastructure and pricing, which is too high for B2B.  Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",
