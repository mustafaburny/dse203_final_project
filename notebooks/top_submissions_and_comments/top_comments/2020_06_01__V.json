The speed at which it is recovering is also normal because every market participant knows the story of past US recessions and economic downturn - they know if you sell your holdings, you\u2019ll regret it down the road. So what\u2019s the point of selling right now if your actually investing for years, decades? None. Especially when it\u2019s super easy to get a loan for rock bottom rates, cash is very accessible for all the big boy investors and institutions. \n\nEveryone constantly downvoted bulls in March for even thinking that a V shape market recovery was gonna happen, for ever thinking we were gonna see ATHs again this year. Don\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten. There\u2019s a lot of remind me bot posts I got coming due soon from March . \n\nOnce again bears, hold this L . Scoreboard don\u2019t lie. You never win consistently. Keep being wrong and stay salty about this. I\u2019m sorry you missed out on the greatest 50 day rally in stock market history. That\u2019s gonna be a good story to tell your grand kids at least.",

My nutsack looked around and was like, \"yep worlds a god damn dumpster fire, calls it is.\" My brain freaked and was like \"what the fuck are you doing?!\" Then my nuts told me something that I'll never forget, \"nobody ever went broke betting on the stupidity of the average American. Those fucks want the market up regardless of the long term consequences, and by god they'll make that shit happen or die trying.

The stock opened on June 4th at 16.74 and closed on the 12th at 16.74. All of the price movement happened during early market. From the 4th to the 12th the high and low was 21.67 to 14.07.

Thursday morning, 9M shares are dumped to tank AAL in early market trading.\n3. Market opens and some(not all) retail panics and dump shares.\n4. Hedge fund spends part of the day buying shares as retail users dump them in a panic.\n5. Friday morning, someone buys 9M shares to pump the stock up to Wednesday's close of $17.\n6. Retail has been trained that when a stock is up big, it's going to close even higher. So, of course they start buying the shit out of AAL.\n7. Hedge fund sells all of Thursday's shares at a cool 13% gain (14.75-&gt;16.75)\n\nHedge funds are just flipping shares from 1 day to the next while maintaining cash positions.

My three main reasons are:\n\n1.) Today, Tesla only produces around 400.000 cars per year. I believe they do earn a lot of money for each car they sell, but still that is not enough to justify a market cap of 188 billion. Toyota produces about 9 million cars per year and has a market cap of 179 billion. So yeah, TSLA is a bit overvalued.   \n\n\n2.) Global pandemic. I don't see it \"solved\" right now. We think the worst is over. I see second wave in fall/winter. Everyone is assuring there will never be a second lockdown. I'm not so sure about that either. The quick V shaped recovery could rather be a deep W shaped slow recovery. Oh and the whole Trump-China thing, the Hong Kong-China thing, Hard Brexit and return of the Euro crisis. A lot of risks that is not priced in into the stocks thanks to the central banks printing money.   \n\n\n3.) Too much greed. My spider senses are tingeling and I have a strange dot-com boom deja-vu. I hear and read about a lot of people talking about getting into the stock market, and how easy it is to make huge profits in a few days. People who usually don't care about stocks, and are rather risk averse consider signing up on an online broker and join the party. \n\nSo yeah, my profits that I made with selling the shares (in Jan-Feb) could have been way bigger if I just would have kept them, but we will see how this turns out. If I'm wrong and we really have put the worst of 2020 behind us, I'm a happy person. I'll get back into Tesla and wait the next 10 years for how it develops",

The Fed's Money FLood Suggests Room to Run'. \"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pledged to do more, assuring investors that the central bank has more firepower and is willing to use it. To that point, the Fed on Monday said it would expand its Main Street lending program by lowering the minimum loan amount, raising the maximum loan limit, extending loan terms, and allowing businesses to defer principal payments for two years instead of one. \n\nOn the surface, [the rally over the past two weeks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-economy-is-bad-but-stocks-are-rallying-heres-one-reason-why-51590659100?mod=article_inline) appears to have been driven by an earlier-than-expected and smoother-than-feared gradual reopening of the economy and signs of consumer resilience, says Shalett. Aside from the surprise rise in payrolls, personal income grew 10.5% in April and the savings rate jumped to 33%. That\u2019s as initial jobless claims, while still high, have continued their weekly decline, manufacturing surveys beat expectations, May auto sales improved, and mortgage applications increased for the seventh straight week. \n\nDeeper down, Shalett says, Fed-driven liquidity is booming in a way that can help sustain asset prices. \u201cAll told, this strong data validates the market narrative of a V-shaped recovery,\u201d Shalett says. \" by Lisa Beilfuss",

        "body": " \n\nThe Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released the results of its stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses that the Board conducted in light of the coronavirus event.\n\n\"The banking system has been a source of strength during this crisis,\" Vice Chair Randal K. Quarles said, \"and the results of our sensitivity analyses show that our banks can remain strong in the face of even the harshest shocks.\"\n\nIn addition to its normal stress test, the Board conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the resiliency of large banks under three hypothetical recessions, or downside scenarios, which could result from the coronavirus event. The scenarios included a V-shaped recession and recovery; a slower, U-shaped recession and recovery; and a W-shaped, double-dip recession.\n\nIn the three downside scenarios, the unemployment rate peaked at between 15.6 percent and 19.5 percent, which is significantly more stringent than any of the Board's pre-coronavirus stress test scenarios. The scenarios are not predictions or forecasts of the likely path of the economy or financial markets.\n\nIn aggregate, loan losses for the 34 banks ranged from $560 billion to $700 billion in the sensitivity analysis and aggregate capital ratios declined from 12.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to between 9.5 percent and 7.7 percent under the hypothetical downside scenarios. Under the U- and W-shaped scenarios, most firms remain well capitalized but several would approach minimum capital levels. The sensitivity analysis does not incorporate the potential effects of government stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance.\n\nIn light of these results, the Board took several actions following its stress tests to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the coronavirus event. For the third quarter of this year, the Board is requiring large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The Board is also requiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans.\n\nAll large banks will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect current stresses, which will help firms re-assess their capital needs and maintain strong capital planning practices during this period of uncertainty. The Board will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if adjustments to this response are appropriate.\n\nDuring the third quarter, no share repurchases will be permitted. In recent years, share repurchases have represented approximately 70 percent of shareholder payouts from large banks. The Board is also capping dividend payments to the amount paid in the second quarter and is further limiting them to an amount based on recent earnings. As a result, a bank cannot increase its dividend and can pay dividends if it has earned sufficient income.\n\nThe Board also released the results of its full stress test designed before the coronavirus. The results from that test are comparable to the V-shaped downside scenario in the sensitivity analysis, in aggregate, and show that all large banks remain strongly capitalized. The Board will use the results of this test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which will take effect, as planned, in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Board will not be objecting to five foreign banks whose capital planning practices were evaluated as part of the stress tests.",
