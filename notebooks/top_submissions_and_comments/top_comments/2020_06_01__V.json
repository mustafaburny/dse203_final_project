The speed at which it is recovering is also normal because every market participant knows the story of past US recessions and economic downturn - they know if you sell your holdings, you\u2019ll regret it down the road. So what\u2019s the point of selling right now if your actually investing for years, decades? None. Especially when it\u2019s super easy to get a loan for rock bottom rates, cash is very accessible for all the big boy investors and institutions. \n\nEveryone constantly downvoted bulls in March for even thinking that a V shape market recovery was gonna happen, for ever thinking we were gonna see ATHs again this year. Don\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten. There\u2019s a lot of remind me bot posts I got coming due soon from March . \n\nOnce again bears, hold this L . Scoreboard don\u2019t lie. You never win consistently. Keep being wrong and stay salty about this. I\u2019m sorry you missed out on the greatest 50 day rally in stock market history. That\u2019s gonna be a good story to tell your grand kids at least.",

My three main reasons are:\n\n1.) Today, Tesla only produces around 400.000 cars per year. I believe they do earn a lot of money for each car they sell, but still that is not enough to justify a market cap of 188 billion. Toyota produces about 9 million cars per year and has a market cap of 179 billion. So yeah, TSLA is a bit overvalued.   \n\n\n2.) Global pandemic. I don't see it \"solved\" right now. We think the worst is over. I see second wave in fall/winter. Everyone is assuring there will never be a second lockdown. I'm not so sure about that either. The quick V shaped recovery could rather be a deep W shaped slow recovery. Oh and the whole Trump-China thing, the Hong Kong-China thing, Hard Brexit and return of the Euro crisis. A lot of risks that is not priced in into the stocks thanks to the central banks printing money.   \n\n\n3.) Too much greed. My spider senses are tingeling and I have a strange dot-com boom deja-vu. I hear and read about a lot of people talking about getting into the stock market, and how easy it is to make huge profits in a few days. People who usually don't care about stocks, and are rather risk averse consider signing up on an online broker and join the party. \n\nSo yeah, my profits that I made with selling the shares (in Jan-Feb) could have been way bigger if I just would have kept them, but we will see how this turns out. If I'm wrong and we really have put the worst of 2020 behind us, I'm a happy person. I'll get back into Tesla and wait the next 10 years for how it develops",

The Fed's Money FLood Suggests Room to Run'. \"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pledged to do more, assuring investors that the central bank has more firepower and is willing to use it. To that point, the Fed on Monday said it would expand its Main Street lending program by lowering the minimum loan amount, raising the maximum loan limit, extending loan terms, and allowing businesses to defer principal payments for two years instead of one. \n\nOn the surface, [the rally over the past two weeks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-economy-is-bad-but-stocks-are-rallying-heres-one-reason-why-51590659100?mod=article_inline) appears to have been driven by an earlier-than-expected and smoother-than-feared gradual reopening of the economy and signs of consumer resilience, says Shalett. Aside from the surprise rise in payrolls, personal income grew 10.5% in April and the savings rate jumped to 33%. That\u2019s as initial jobless claims, while still high, have continued their weekly decline, manufacturing surveys beat expectations, May auto sales improved, and mortgage applications increased for the seventh straight week. \n\nDeeper down, Shalett says, Fed-driven liquidity is booming in a way that can help sustain asset prices. \u201cAll told, this strong data validates the market narrative of a V-shaped recovery,\u201d Shalett says. \" by Lisa Beilfuss",

        "body": " \n\nThe Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released the results of its stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses that the Board conducted in light of the coronavirus event.\n\n\"The banking system has been a source of strength during this crisis,\" Vice Chair Randal K. Quarles said, \"and the results of our sensitivity analyses show that our banks can remain strong in the face of even the harshest shocks.\"\n\nIn addition to its normal stress test, the Board conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the resiliency of large banks under three hypothetical recessions, or downside scenarios, which could result from the coronavirus event. The scenarios included a V-shaped recession and recovery; a slower, U-shaped recession and recovery; and a W-shaped, double-dip recession.\n\nIn the three downside scenarios, the unemployment rate peaked at between 15.6 percent and 19.5 percent, which is significantly more stringent than any of the Board's pre-coronavirus stress test scenarios. The scenarios are not predictions or forecasts of the likely path of the economy or financial markets.\n\nIn aggregate, loan losses for the 34 banks ranged from $560 billion to $700 billion in the sensitivity analysis and aggregate capital ratios declined from 12.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to between 9.5 percent and 7.7 percent under the hypothetical downside scenarios. Under the U- and W-shaped scenarios, most firms remain well capitalized but several would approach minimum capital levels. The sensitivity analysis does not incorporate the potential effects of government stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance.\n\nIn light of these results, the Board took several actions following its stress tests to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the coronavirus event. For the third quarter of this year, the Board is requiring large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The Board is also requiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans.\n\nAll large banks will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect current stresses, which will help firms re-assess their capital needs and maintain strong capital planning practices during this period of uncertainty. The Board will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if adjustments to this response are appropriate.\n\nDuring the third quarter, no share repurchases will be permitted. In recent years, share repurchases have represented approximately 70 percent of shareholder payouts from large banks. The Board is also capping dividend payments to the amount paid in the second quarter and is further limiting them to an amount based on recent earnings. As a result, a bank cannot increase its dividend and can pay dividends if it has earned sufficient income.\n\nThe Board also released the results of its full stress test designed before the coronavirus. The results from that test are comparable to the V-shaped downside scenario in the sensitivity analysis, in aggregate, and show that all large banks remain strongly capitalized. The Board will use the results of this test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which will take effect, as planned, in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Board will not be objecting to five foreign banks whose capital planning practices were evaluated as part of the stress tests.",

It is only a problem if the rate of flow is high enough to overcome the shear strength of the soil that the dam rests on.  You can reduce the rate of flow by increasing the distance the water must flow to get under the dam, such as by constructing a cutoff wall.

It's cheap for them because business travel exists. But business travel is becoming increasingly non-essential. Nothing replaces face-to-face but culture is coming around to normalizing teleconferencing (it already was even before the pandemic, but the timeline moved up a lot now).\n2. The industry is regulated to an insane level. There's only so much you can do to differentiate yourself or cut costs. Meanwhile government keeps making the experience even more miserable every passing year, and maybe there will be carbon taxes in the future. \n3. There's massive political risk in the form of travel restrictions, visa restrictions, etc.\n4. There's a ton of countries with state owned carries which are subsidized to stupid levels as part of PR plays for corrupt regimes. How are you supposed to compete with an oil backed carrier on long haul flights to Asia or Europe? Nobody knows.\n5. It's a very capital intensive business. Planes are super expensive, even if you can offload some of the risk by leasing them instead of owning them.\n6. The biggest marginal cost is fuel. The price of oil can vary wildly based on the whims of despots halfway around the world. Sure you can hedge with futures, but hedging isn't free.\n\nCompare this with something like tech (near zero marginal costs, crazy profit margins) or healthcare (insanely inelastic demand) you can see why this is a shit business to invest in.",

Foriegn ETFs are experiencing a great amount of recovery, akin to ours.\n\nAs people find it less of a growing problem, all of travel and casinos will experience V shaped recovery. These are guarnateed prints the next few weeks. A second wave will be possible around the fall or winter, where the election will be up for grabs..and who knows what'll happen to the markets then.",

My three main reasons are:\n\n1.) Today, Tesla only produces around 400.000 cars per year. I believe they do earn a lot of money for each car they sell, but still that is not enough to justify a market cap of 188 billion. Toyota produces about 9 million cars per year and has a market cap of 179 billion. So yeah, TSLA is a bit overvalued.   \n\n\n2.) Global pandemic. I don't see it \"solved\" right now. We think the worst is over. I see second wave in fall/winter. Everyone is assuring there will never be a second lockdown. I'm not so sure about that either. The quick V shaped recovery could rather be a deep W shaped slow recovery. Oh and the whole Trump-China thing, the Hong Kong-China thing, Hard Brexit and return of the Euro crisis. A lot of risks that is not priced in into the stocks thanks to the central banks printing money.   \n\n\n3.) Too much greed. My spider senses are tingeling and I have a strange dot-com boom deja-vu. I hear and read about a lot of people talking about getting into the stock market, and how easy it is to make huge profits in a few days. People who usually don't care about stocks, and are rather risk averse consider signing up on an online broker and join the party. \n\nSo yeah, my profits that I made with selling the shares (in Jan-Feb) could have been way bigger if I just would have kept them, but we will see how this turns out. If I'm wrong and we really have put the worst of 2020 behind us, I'm a happy person. I'll get back into Tesla and wait the next 10 years for how it develops",

To that point, the Fed on Monday said it would expand its Main Street lending program by lowering the minimum loan amount, raising the maximum loan limit, extending loan terms, and allowing businesses to defer principal payments for two years instead of one. \n\nOn the surface, [the rally over the past two weeks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-economy-is-bad-but-stocks-are-rallying-heres-one-reason-why-51590659100?mod=article_inline) appears to have been driven by an earlier-than-expected and smoother-than-feared gradual reopening of the economy and signs of consumer resilience, says Shalett. Aside from the surprise rise in payrolls, personal income grew 10.5% in April and the savings rate jumped to 33%. That\u2019s as initial jobless claims, while still high, have continued their weekly decline, manufacturing surveys beat expectations, May auto sales improved, and mortgage applications increased for the seventh straight week. \n\nDeeper down, Shalett says, Fed-driven liquidity is booming in a way that can help sustain asset prices. \u201cAll told, this strong data validates the market narrative of a V-shaped recovery,\u201d Shalett says. \" by Lisa Beilfuss",

It's cheap for them because business travel exists. But business travel is becoming increasingly non-essential. Nothing replaces face-to-face but culture is coming around to normalizing teleconferencing (it already was even before the pandemic, but the timeline moved up a lot now).\n2. The industry is regulated to an insane level. There's only so much you can do to differentiate yourself or cut costs. Meanwhile government keeps making the experience even more miserable every passing year, and maybe there will be carbon taxes in the future. \n3. There's massive political risk in the form of travel restrictions, visa restrictions, etc.\n4. There's a ton of countries with state owned carries which are subsidized to stupid levels as part of PR plays for corrupt regimes. How are you supposed to compete with an oil backed carrier on long haul flights to Asia or Europe? Nobody knows.\n5. It's a very capital intensive business. Planes are super expensive, even if you can offload some of the risk by leasing them instead of owning them.\n6. The biggest marginal cost is fuel. The price of oil can vary wildly based on the whims of despots halfway around the world. Sure you can hedge with futures, but hedging isn't free.\n\nCompare this with something like tech (near zero marginal costs, crazy profit margins) or healthcare (insanely inelastic demand) you can see why this is a shit business to invest in.",

        "body": " \n\nSo everyone seems to be giving you  some folksy financial wisdom based on their \"gut intuition\". It's  important to keep in mind markets are reflexive in the sense that retail  traders can influence the price of equities in the short term through  their sentiment, but in the long term, prices tend to be driven by data  models adopted by large institutional investors, such as hedge funds,  pensions, sovereign wealth funds, etc. In order to get an idea of what a  person of the latter ilk might say about the current level of the  SP500, let's do a little analysis.\n\nLet's  say you are a company and you have a stream of cash flows, let's call  each it C, that occur every quarter for the rest of time. What is the  present value of that cash flow? You discount each cash flow back to the  present according to the prevailing quarterly [cost of capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp), let's call it r1.\n\nC + C/(1+r1) + C/(1+r1)\\^2 + ... forever and ever.\n\nMathematically, this is [geometric sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series)\n\n.  You can show this is equal to C/(1- 1/(1+r1)), or simplified, C (1+r1) /  r1 = C ( 1/r1 + 1). Note the present value of the cash flow is  inversely proportional to the cost of capital. As the cost of capital  goes up, the present value goes down and visa versa.\n\nIf  the cost of capital then drops to, say, r2, the present value of that  cash flow goes up to C (1/r2 +1). The percentage increase in the value  of the cash flow would then be,\n\n\\[C \\* ( 1/r2 + 1)  - C \\* ( 1/r1 + 1) \\] / C(1/r1 +1 ) =\n\n(1/r2 + 1) / (1/r1 + 1 ) - 1\n\nCool.  So we have a formula that tells us what the percentage change in a  perpetual quarterly cash flow should be in terms of the quarterly cost  of capital. Let's make so simplifying assumptions (I will comment on  these assumptions a little later on, but for now, just go with it.)\n\nLet's  assume your company earns revenue annually instead of quarterly (this  assumption doesn't really matter that much since you can just treat the  amalgamation of quarterly earnings over a year as a single entity, and  it makes the math easier). Let's assume your company can borrow at the  risk-free rate, i.e. the US treasury yield. Let's assume this is your  company's only source of financing. Let's use the 10 year yield, since  we are dealing with long term cash flows. How much did the present value  of your cash flows go up when the Fed lowered the interest rate back in  March?\n\nIn Feb, the 10 year rate  was roughly 1.6%. It is currently roughly 0.9%. US treasuries are  semi-annual, so if we concert these to annual rates, that's roughly 3.2%  and 1.8% respectively. The percentage increase in the present value of  your annual cashflow is then,\n\n(1/0.018 + 1) / (1/0.032 + 1 ) - 1 = 0.75 = 75%.\n\nThe  value of your cash flow went up a staggering 75%! If your cash flow was  worth 1 million dollars, then it's now worth 1.75 million dollars. Now,  onto some commentary and explanation.\n\nAnalysts working in institutions value companies by [making  projections for a firm's earnings and then discounting those  projections back to the present by the firm's cost of capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow)\n\n.  Which is exactly the calculation we've just gone through. In the above  example, I've made the naive assumption that a firm's cost of capital is  equivalent to the risk-free interest rate. In reality, this is not  true; it is however, a floor for the cost, in a sense, since if the cost  of capital is lower than the risk-free rate, it would make more  financial sense to invest in the risk-free asset since it's...risk-free  (there is perhaps a debate to be had if the US treasury is truly  risk-free, but the dollar is the world's reserve currency for the time  being at least, so it serves as a useful proxy)  When the Fed dropped  the interest rate in March, this is a very important input into a lot of  analysts valuation models. And since the value models are inversely  proportional to the interest rate, and the interest rate went down, the  valuations go up. The spot price of the SPY in Feb was around 320. If  nothing else had changed (i.e. the lockdowns hadn't occured and shot the  next few quarters of earnings) besides the interest rate, then the SPY  would have gone up based on this alone. Future cash flows are worth more  in the present in a low interest rate environment, it's that simply.  Now, there were lockdowns and that will undoubtedly factor in the future  earnings of companies, but for how long? A year? Two? Okay, but  valuation models are concerned with the entire lifetime of a company. At  some point, things will return to normal.\n\nIn  my simple model, I've shown how a drop in the ten year interest rate  from 1.6% to 0.9% can increase a firm's theoretical value by 75%. Some  more caveats. Earnings are not constant. It's the analyst's job to come  up with a plausible model for how these earnings fluctuate from quarter  to quarter. This can affect the valuation. The drop in March was  probably due to valuation models pricing in a few terrible quarters  worth of earnings. Now that the economy appears to be reopening, these  projections are probably being revised yet again to factor in new cash  flows in a lower interest rate environment.\n\nMost  people in this thread don't seem to grasp the basics of valuation and  how it works, blaming the level of the market on the \"Fed inflating the  money supply\" or turning it into a meme. They see a  number going higher when the economy is full-on recession and think  this is counter-intuitive without understanding how the market actually  works. The market doesn't track the economy, it tracks valuations; the  economy affects valuations, but not in the straight forward way many  people seem to think.\n\nIs the SP500  over-valued? Maybe, but not for any of the reasons cited in this  thread. There are signs institutions seem to think this might be the  case. One of my favorite indicators, the [SKEW Index](http://www.cboe.com/delayedquote/advanced-charts?ticker=^SKEW)  measures the probability distribution the market is assigning to  returns through their option purchases. A SKEW of 100 would correspond  to a return distribution that is perfectly normal, i.e. bell shaped. As  the SKEW creeps higher, the market begins to price in extreme return  probabilities, i.e. fatter tails. The SKEW has been trending up the past  few weeks, indicating that the market seems to think there is more  volatility ahead.\n\nThe [VIX future curve](http://vixcentral.com/)  recently went back into contango after a wild month, but it's only a  contango in the front months. There is a very large spike in October and  then the curve goes into backwardation again. Backwardation is usually  associated with extremely volatility times. For reference, the VIX curve  was in backwardation pretty much the entire month of March this year,  when the SP500 was whipsawing like crazy; the VIX's natural state during  an upward trend is contango, i.e. uncertainty increases with the time  horizon. The further you look into the future, the more uncertain you  are about the outcome. When things are backwardated, this means shit is  so crazy that volatility *has* to decrease. The fact that this recent rally has coincided with this strange shape in the VIX curve deserves some thought.\n\nThere  are other things I could mention, like companies not giving forward  guidance in their recent earnings reports but I've gone on long enough.  So...bye.",

I think we have another 8-12 weeks until fundamentals have to re-exert themselves in the form of unemployment reports and other data that will be able to separate what the economy looks like without all the government support like PPP.\n\nJune and July unemployment reports should look good just on the basis of workers going back to their jobs.  After that we have to see what happens as all the economic lifelines are gradually stopped or pulled.  The government tossed trillions at the economy in 2 months, it does seem like that at least gives the semblance of a V shaped recovery on face, let's see if it sticks.  I hope it does for the sake of the US public, but I have doubts.  A lot of smaller businesses will not be back to anywhere near full monthly revenue by August.",
