I've said before that there were a number of things that were in decline that could maybe have stretched that decline out maybe another few years. All the sudden, that \"few years\" got compressed into a far shorter time frame. \n\n As an example, reports yesterday that JCP is now exploring filing ch 11. Depending on how the situation continues to play out and the reluctance (or not) for people to shop (as well as what people are shopping for - the consumer may not be looking for what a Macys has to offer for a while) you could see distress in other retailers IMO (particularly department store and specialty) in the coming months. I'll be curious to see what Bed Bath has to say this afternoon.\n\nDo I think there will be tons of public companies going ch 11? No. Some companies have raised money via equity offerings or by other means (CVNA did an equity offering at $45 at the end of March, stock is now back to the $80's; it was $20's in mid March. PLAY did an equity offering.)  At this point I just think that sectors that were in gradual decline are going to see that compressed. \n\nLook at movie theaters. AMC may file. Movie theaters aren't going away, but I think there's going to be less or a lot less on the other side of this and if a REIT has a movie theater as a tenant, they should be planning now for a future where they have to re-purpose that space because if the theater goes out, as I think in many cases there won't be someone else interested in running it as a theater. Entertainment REIT EPR has probably thought a lot about the future of movie theaters and how they would eventually have to repurpose a lot of those properties. However, did they think about that and the costs of it over the next 5 years, 10 years? What if a good portion of that happened sooner and all of the sudden? Depending on how this situation plays out and how eager or not people are to return to entertainment,  EPR is going to have a very tough road.\n\nA lot of malls (particularly C/D malls) are going to be gone and some of the weakest mall REITs may go.",

Making hundreds of millions when you release a hit movie is nice. But what's better is getting tens of millions of people to subscribe to your monthly subscription streaming service, and having all those people fork over $7 to $15 a month to watch your movies (among other things). A lot of people speculated this is probably part of why Disney went so hard for Disney+.\n\nAlso, since a lot of Hollywood is so concerned about piracy hurting their profits, a shift to letting everyone buy their movies online and watch it the day it's released will also no doubt help with that problem to. There's a lot who argue that the current model of releasing movies in theaters for 6 weeks and then releasing to DVD &amp; other methods actually costs the studio's money by increasing piracy. Studies have already shown that method at the very least isn't actually helping them earn more money.\n\nI can definitely see theaters being a big loser to the shift towards digital distribution in the long run, culture (to me anyway) seems to have slowly been shifting against going to the theaters for a while. I don't think AMC's approach is going to do much to help them in the long run. If people don't like the theater experience they won't go to AMC theaters, regardless of movies being released digitally or not at the same time.",

They're raising 2x their current market cap in funding and have 5 years to repay it. Also, they are going to be back open in a month. COVID-19 is old news, people are protesting in the streets to be able to go back to work. \n\nThey are down for 2 reasons, bankruptcy rumors and an inconclusive reopening date. Both were just crushed. They'll be generating revenue again with a month. They also own their landlords by the balls because an empty theater will take years to fill. \n\nIf you want to buy puts you may want to be more patient, because their losses for the current quarter are already priced in and they are a heavily shorted penny stock. \n\nAnd yeah, AMC is practically worthless and probably wont be around for much longer. But wait until short sellers are done getting margin called before you try to go short yourself.\n\nAnyways, positions: \n\n150 April 17 $3c; feel free to talk shit if they expire worthless, this is just my input on the situation.",

Where will it premier now? Exclusively on disney plus? What is the drop in revenue going from movie ticket revenue share to free to current subscribers? Will there be a cost on companies youre currently subscribed to for \"hollywood new movies\" and then a separate \"new movies\" section?\n\nTldr: who knows mang, deep otm week enders or \ud83c\udf08",
