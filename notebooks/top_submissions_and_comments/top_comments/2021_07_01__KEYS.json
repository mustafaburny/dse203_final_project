Reports of Blackrock paying 50% above asking price might just be because their MBS offerings are bought down by the Fed.\n\nNot saying that's all of it, but the thumb is on the scale for lower rates.   \n\nThe other side, everyone is anxious about the economy, we all know it's fucked, we all hope it can make a comeback before the fed/treasury stims run out, but honestly it's an artificial market.   People aren't moving over their paranoia, inventory only in the last month coming up (and not that much).\n\nI'm not sure it's a bubble like 2008, but yes there's some fuckery going on as OP said.   I haven't seen/heard of people doing massive cash-out-refinancing, or sub-prime lending.  In 08 I had friends with 5-10 houses with 0 down and clauses that they could just \"drop the keys off\" with the lender no-fault defaults.   They left banks holding the bag on dozens of properties, they weren't insolvent had renters, but so far underwater that it wasn't worth the effort.  Idiot lenders caused that.\n\nNow...I see MBS owners might be holding a heavy bag as values come off the highs, but I don't see private equity BR getting bailed out (or needing it, when your Fed fueled MBS rate is 1.2% what worry?).",

        "body": "I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.\r  \n\r  \nUnder the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.\r  \n\r  \nThat is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.\r  \n\r  \nEdit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.\r  \n\r  \nI first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA (EZA) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.\r  \n\r  \nMy new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the South African Rand's inflation was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",

What TSLA valuation is largely based on ATM is the self driving software.  I would call them the market leader in self driving tech, and also the leader in EV design.  They probably make the best cars of today, no joke or exaggeration.  Soon there will come a time when self driving becomes safer than humans.  Not exactly sure when.  Could be another 2 years, could be 5, could be 10.  But eventually you'll literally feel safer knowing your kids have a Tesla that drives them around than giving your 16 year old the keys and hoping he's safe and responsible and don't drive intoxicated.  The value is there.  Its just a matter of the timeframe and if they can keep their lead or lose it to perhaps Brian Selesky's company or Rivian.  Perhaps their stiffest competition and its such a weird thing to pursue.  It's just lines of code that can interpret what cameras see.  You need object orientation, detection, identification.

        "body": "I think you're misunderstanding. Endoxifen doesn't really treat an unmet need. That's just marketing from ATOS. Here's some information from a previous post I made about ATOS to help explain better:\n\n&gt; I just want to start by saying you don\u2019t really make a drug that fixes cancer. Almost all of our chemotherapy regimens are multidrug, and new drugs are just added on. I don\u2019t know of many new drugs that ever become the mainstay of therapy, or the sole agent used. At a scientific level, we have a medication called tamoxifen that has been used since 1977 in breast cancer to prevent recurrence. The active metabolite of that medication is called endoxifen, meaning that this is what technically has the effect. The body turns tamoxifen into endoxifen so that endoxifen can prevent breast cancer. Atossa\u2019s premise is that they can use this active metabolite as an agent on its own to treat breast cancer. I just want to note the shift in focus. Tamoxifen has been used to prevent breast cancer recurrence, Atossa is theorizing they can treat it instead. While it may work, I just want to point that just because it can do one, doesn\u2019t mean it can do the other.\n&gt; \n&gt; So they are developing both a topical and an oral form of endoxifen. The one that has recently been in the news lately was their phase 2 oral study. They were able to show a statistically significant reduction in tumor activity in 6 out of 7 patients with an average reduction of 74%. That is pretty good, but one of the keys in reading studies is always look for the flaw. It\u2019s pretty obvious here that it is the sample size of 7, which is to expected. Also note that they saw a reduction in tumor activity, not in cure rate or anything along those lines.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second form is the topical form and I was actually able to find their phase 2 results regarding breast density reduction. Important to note that they are investigating topical endoxifen for use in gynecomastia and reduction in breast density. Anyway, this study was not very appealing to me. Yes, it was phase 2, but let me share the results of the study. \u201capproximately 72 participants [out of 90] eventually developed skin rashes and local irritation and did not complete a full six months of dosing.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you, but alarm bells are going off in my head. And from what I can tell, it looks like they are still waiting to hear whether they can proceed to phase 3.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let\u2019s talk about endoxifen and whether or not this should work. There is actually a study from 2017 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology regarding the results of the first-in-human phase 1 study of endoxifen with metastatic breast cancer. They found that it had some effect in patients in whom traditional tamoxifen would not work due to lacking the enzyme necessary to active tamoxifen. There are also some in in vitro studies that found that endoxifen worked just as well, or better, than tamoxifen. However, I was also able to find a study on rats that found that tamoxifen and high-dose endoxifen had equal efficacy in treating mammary cancer.\n&gt; \n&gt;",

She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce. The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, \"Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?\" The blond replies.....\"Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?\"",

The whole purpose of masks is so you don't transmit it to others, so what sense is there in forcing vaccinated people to wear it? You do realize this defeats the whole purpose of encouraging the population to get vaccinated, correct? And for what? For a virus that kills like maybe a dozen or so people per state? \n\nI am vaccinated jackass. I got it so I could go back to school. Took the J&amp;J one. It sucked the entire day afterwards but I dealt with it because I was informed that was what I needed to live a normal life. And now you are telling me they want to continue with this? And dude, states are already locking down and shutting down businesses (in Canada and Europe they are still closed). Give me a break. \n\nAnd yes, a business can choose to do that. But a business can also choose not to force everyone to wear masks and to let them go back to normal life like we have for the past three or four months. \"Mandate\" means businesses and people don't have an option. \n\npRoTeCt ItS cItIzEnS if you honestly truly believe this is about protecting people and following science, you probably think Jordan Belfort is an honest man or invest in Chinese stocks. \n\nConsidering how Fauci has been wrong on everything from masking to vaccines to school reopenings to where this virus came from, damn right he doesn't know the \\*actual\\* science. He is a corrupt old bureaucrat who needs to be tried and hung by the neck until dead. \n\n\"Starting a mandate early will reduce the likelihood of new variants and the persistence of existing one.\" BAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA\n\nSo again, you think a mask is more effective than a fucking vaccine? Dude, you do realize Covid droplets are smaller than the fabric holes in the mask, correct? rEdUcE tHe LiKElIhoOd and yet after a year of masking, here is another variant. Whoops. \n\nI love this inconsistent analogy here. Last I checked, having a car is something I buy and thus is a privilege I get to hold. Living my everyday life how I want is something called \"my right\" and government has done all it can to make it safer with the vaccine. I don't need health bureaucrats telling me to do what they want because they can't over their boner for control.\n\nPssst hey bud, you know that you are FAR FAR more likely to be killed in an automobile accident than die of Covid, correct? \n\n Who am I being considerate too? The corrupt politicians that don't want to lose a feeling of control? The media that beg to be told what to do? The people that willingly decided to NOT get vaccinated and thus bear the consequences of it. Lets use your car analogy, you are basically taking away everyone's keys because drunk drivers are still out there and you will not give them back until there are no more (i.e. never).\n\nSo whose boot are you chomping on?

        "body": "I think BTC is here to stay and that one takes on more risk by not having a small (1-5%) position in it from a risk-returns adjusted perspective. Personally, I think that it is one of the most asymmetric bets/investments that I have seen; therefore, I am irresponsibly long in my position. Now, here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.",

The Zillow Zestimate is literally a joke to real estate appraisers. Even if you had paid a 5% commission with a good real estate agent, you would have most definitely sold the property for more. In today's market every property goes through an absolute bidding war because of low inventory. You took the Zillow offer thinking you were getting a good deal but you most likely sold yourself short.\n\nThat's good that you're happy with the value you got but let's be real, you would have been even happier if you allowed buyers to compete and drive the sales price even higher. The last four transactions I worked on had buyers paying over the asking price and guaranteeing to pay anywhere between $5,000 and $15,000 over the appraised value.\n\nYes, I am a real estate agent and broker of my own independent company. I actually like Zillow very much and they are not out to \"kill real estate agents\". Zillow fully depends on what is called a syndication feed from the MLS. If at any moment Zillow were to try and \"kill real estate agents\", all the different MLS's in the country would turn off the feed and Zillow would lose 99% of the content on their site.\n\nIt seems that you may have had a bad experience with a real estate agent or have a very limited understanding of what goes on behind the scenes. If taking pictures and putting the property on the MLS is all a realtor does, is the equivalent of saying that all a an IT guy does is turn on a computer and press keys on the keyboard.\n\nI'm happy you enjoyed the experience with Zillow but I feel bad that you most likely sold yourself short.",

They fo\u00adcused on show\u00ading cus\u00adtomers how to op\u00ader\u00adate their new cars, and ex\u00adplained life with an elec\u00adtric ve\u00adhi\u00adcle, free\u00ading up paid staff to han\u00addle the over\u00adflow of pa\u00adper\u00adwork.

Patent trolls are usually the first thing that comes to mind in these situations but Netlist isn\u2019t some scam company, they\u2019re a real company with real innovation. \n\nA quick, rough breakdown of the Google history: \n\nNetlist that came to Google in 2006-ish trying to license their memory products to Google for their servers. Google said thanks but no thanks but then used their patented technology anyways. Netlist caught wind and sued Google in 2009. Google has been fighting this court case for 12 years now, their first defense was that the patent wasn\u2019t valid, but a USPTO PTAB recently came to the conclusion that the patent is valid. So Google should be on the hook for 12+ years of treble damages as well as court fees and possibly future royalties. Currently the judge in their case ordered both sides to try and talk it out and a joint decision was supposed to be turned into the judge just a few days ago so speculation is running rampant in the Netlist subreddit that an agreement was reach as nothing was filed on the deadline but who tf knows. Google has been fighting this tooth and nail for years and there are also cases against Micron and Samsung for similar infringement. \n\nNetlist has barely been staying above water this past decade, with most of its profits going towards fighting these legal cases and it seems like maybe the most recent win against SK Hynix may be the turning point. I can\u2019t say I know what\u2019s going to happen but things have definitely been trending in the right direction. Shareholders are basically betting that the last 12 years of missed profits from these giant tech companies will be realized very soon in triplicate with additional cash covering legal fees as well as forcing Google and others to pay royalties for future use of the technology. \n\nAs always, do your own research, I\u2019m not a patent lawyer nor an expert in computer memory technology.",
