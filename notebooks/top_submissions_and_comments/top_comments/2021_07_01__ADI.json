It\u2019s done ok last year but severely underperformed overall.  \n\nI\u2019m thinking about just throwing all of it in vanguard institutional funds (voo) basically and vanguard mid cap (vo). The American funds has a much higher fee much lower return historically and a much lower dividend yield as well.  Is there any reason to think this fund will outperform in the future to justify the extra expenses?",
