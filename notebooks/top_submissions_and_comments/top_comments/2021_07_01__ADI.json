SO derived it\u2019s monopolistic power through acquisitions of rival refineries and distributors; purely horizontal integration, followed by outright price fixing.\n\nAmazon is absolutely massive, but the growth method and diversity of markets they participate in distinguishes them from old trust oriented monopolies. I\u2019m terms of AWS, the majority of growth was organic, and would not have ran afoul of antitrust law back in its hay day, such as when US v. Aluminum Co. of America was prevailing law.\n\nAn attempt to break up Amazon by business segment would probably fail due to the shift since the 70\u2019s from Per Se Antitrust violations to the Rule of Reason. They aren\u2019t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.\n\nOnline shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.\n\nOverall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren\u2019t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",

        "body": "I personally invest heavily in Web3 crypto's and crypto projects that help run and keep these crypto's decentralised. \n\nWhat's a web3 crypto? These aren't to be confused with junk like Bitcoin that thinks it is a store of value or will become the new financial system, web3 crypto is literally creating the next stage in internet where you don't need to worry about your companies information / personal information / classified documents being stored on a server that is owned and managed by other companies. Web3 splits this up between 100's of validators that all talk to each other and keep this decentralised and secure from attacks. \n\nThere's also ones creating the future of finance. No longer do you need to get bent over by huge interest rates and banks fucking people over whenever they feel like it. DEFI is run by liquidity pools, people like you and I who store our money with the service and as a result get a percentage of the interest rates. These rates always remain low and competitive and go to the people rather than the big banks.\n\nThen you have oracles that power the decentralisation. Oracles gain info from many sources and feed it to the protocol to offer decentralised information. For easy laymans terms, if I wanted a weather oracle, it would gather weather data from 1000's weather stations and news outlets, work out the average forecast and feed that to my protocol. This means my protocol is giving the users the most accurate non-biased information. Just as a high-level. \n\nSo how do you make money from this? Well, let's look at Ethereum just as an example. Every single protect that runs on Ethereum has to pay \"gas\" fees on each transaction, this is paid in Ethereum. Ethereum already has 1000's of applications including VISA and MasterCard that constantly have a demand for Ethereum in order to operate and pay these gas fees. You as the investor holds the Ethereum they need and this creates supply and demand. Additionally, each time a company pays their gas fees, the gas is \"burnt\" (meaning Ethereum used to pay for the transaction is burnt) creating deflation. \n\nEthereum is just one project, and not one that I personally even invest in that much, but it's one that I'm sure most people have heard of.   \nIf you want to look at getting some crypto while it's currently on a low and has huge potentially to be the future of a new decentralised internet feel free to use my exchange code. Swyftx is aussie based exchange and you get 20% off fees with my code, plus I get a kick back [https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner](https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessage me if you want to know more",
