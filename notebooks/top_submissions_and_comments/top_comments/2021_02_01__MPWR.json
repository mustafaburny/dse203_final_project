Please Spread out if you think I maybe on something. ;)\n\nIf you read thanks again la! &gt;.&lt;\n\nI would like to imagine this was a multi-year project event would put GameStop on top of the world.\n\nThink about it. Gamestop looks to have reduced their float by 40million pushing the short interest to over 100%. They are the catalyst as to why this short squeeze is happening. They had 100 million share outstanding originally years ago, they aggressively focused on reducing debt and buying back equity these past years which reduced their profits during those same year which only got the shorters to double down and write articles about the potential bankruptcy of GME. Little did the shorters know.\n\nThey hired the exo Nintendo chair and executives George Sherman . Specialist in the gaming industry.\n\nMicheal Burry and DFV: Owned (MB)\\~1.75 millions shares (DFV)\\~100k shares on market. Bring attention to the short interest float to Gamestop\n\nRyan Cohen: eCommerce Founder of chewy epet store that can compete with likes of Amazon. Taken up 10% of marketable shares away from the Float and bring in expertise on creating an eCommerce business.\n\nGamestop: Has been reducing expenses (stores and management) and debt over the years and if you've notice when you go to GameStop they no longer just sell video games they have expand their product lines, to memorabilia, board games, electronics, hobby items, and expanding to computer parts.\n\nThis quarter: GameStop has had aconsiderable growth of 800% in their e-commerce sales stoking peoples attentions. Plus It is also a new game console generation supercycle so this coming quarter can expect decent revenues.\n\n[https://www.thewrap.com/gamestop-e-commerce-sales-up-800-this-quarter-as-net-losses-continue-to-climb/](https://www.thewrap.com/gamestop-e-commerce-sales-up-800-this-quarter-as-net-losses-continue-to-climb/)\n\nThey recently signed on profit sharing commission with Microsoft and Sony partnerships up to 10%.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517970/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517970/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games)\n\nMicrosoft setting up a multiple year strategy instead of buying them out to help track digital sales on their cloud servers. Maybe forming a new platform development using Microsoft servers.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/)[https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)\n\nThe squeeze Opportunity, let GameStop the ability to take new capital from issuing shares, literally taking the hedge funds money to fund this new global eCommerce project. In the meanwhile they bring a huge population wealth and stability, thus forming an occult of people who can truly be converted into diehard fans of the company brand.\n\nThe squeeze brought in many institution on the long side, such as blackrock and vanguard they actually will have a vested interest in the growth of GameStop. Notice that ETFs top the investments they generally don't sell out their positions entirely\n\n[https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&amp;subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&amp;subView=institutional)\n\nBrilliant Free Globalscale Marketing Campaign for this company because of the Squeeze. All the News articles, interviews, twitter feed from our lord Elon, and even talk of a movie all free of cost bringing even more attention to GameStop. A great marketing opportunity for a company shifting focus to online e commerce.\n\nGenerating a great comeback narrative of all time, a marvel sensationalist story across the world. From zero to hero bring wealth aside from themselves to everyone who believed in it and generating capital injection for this project from the hedging who shorted them for so many years, same capital to work on a new console platform industry equal to value steam. An new industry platform under their guide linked with their new expanded product line.\n\nIf you can imagine connecting these dots I feel there's something big coming for GameSpot. I would love to imagine if they launch a brand new online playstore platform at peak of this Squeeze. It would instantly stabilize the price and build huge expectations.\n\nStarting fresh with a brand heavily believed in by it's followers, freshly capitalized by it's shorters, a global sensations with an opportunity to present to the world it's freshly minted ecommerces.\n\nImagine you had the opportunity to invest in the PC Steam platform product of Value when it just started.\n\nJust my opinion\n\nLet hold the line brother. I'm fighting alongside you!\n\nI'm in about 500@$250. Lets go buy the dip!\n\nCan't Stop, Won't Stop GameStop.",

Between the limit on buying stocks and hedge funds trading between themselves to drive the price down, and creating a distraction (SLV) to draw attention and fill pockets, this should be throwing off a significantly larger red flag than \"ERMERGERD WSB SAYS GME WORTH $69,420 LOOL\". Who gives a shit, you're completely missing the point here. Short sellers expose themselves to basically unlimited risk. But that risk never actually materializes for them because they can just cheat the system. Meanwhile someone can go buy a stock and lose value because of *their* game OR someone can go short a stock and become insolvent while the *big boys on WallStreet* walk away.\n\nGME isn't an isolated incident. BB, NOK, AMC and a number of others are getting hammered- and have been getting hammered since last Wednesday because the people on the losing side don't want to lose at the game they created for themselves. BB basically experienced a rug pull- it didn't taper off or settle in the 20's... it looks like someone pulled a plug. Look at what happened a month ago (or more) with PLTR and Shitron. Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia... AMD have all been recent targets of this institutional wide short selling.",

        "body": "I\u2019m still maintaining that MC made a risk management error and let the short position they open up every year on GME continue. Due to their HF structure, they couldn\u2019t get the fuck out. So they spent a metric fuckton of cash shorting the shit outta GME (shorts, not puts of which they have 500k.) That\u2019s because an HF without sleeves in an SMA/UMA account has to follow certain rules for rebalancing and portfolio management. Thanks to COVID causing GME to accelerate their pivot, Melvin lost the momentum war. Read the post that one autist wrote on how Steve Cohen\u2019s favorite play is momentum stall. That\u2019s why MC doesn\u2019t hedge with long/short; they just break momentum and ride the trend down. \n\nNow what happens if they\u2019re picks are replicated across a bunch of hedgies, and everyone is leveraged to the tits? They\u2019re frontrunning retail and making your money back on earnings and momentum plays. Citadel gets some theta, Melvin gets returns, and 30% goes to every institution that bought in. Wash, rinse, repeat. \n\nWell, that\u2019s a fuckin problem now, because in their desperation at the start of the uptrend, they expended a lot of capital shorting. Shorting so much, in fact, that the shares weren\u2019t there. For every underwriter and facilitator of the MSFT/GME deal, they started accruing more shares. Value investors were doing the same. Cohen comes in and destroys available shares. Now what? \n\nWelllll, what if MC\u2019s models combined with Citadels frontrunning allowed a distributed copy cat position. All of Gabe\u2019s picks are actually very solid, *except for the one that\u2019s going to bankrupt the fucking firm*\n\nI have no doubt they have been closing when they can. However, how many time\u2019s did Cohen share these plays with peeps at idea dinners and meetings? Shit, get a big enough bank to underwrite, you could legit sell Melvin Capital\u2019s model and strat with accompanying positions as a type of short aggregate option bundle. \n\nNow everyone in their Skype favorites is leveraged to the tits and each one is in it for way too much fuckin money. Meanwhile, firms with their own clearing houses that are massively pissed off about losing commission trading are accruing shares of the counterparty\u2019s weakest link. \n\nThis shit wasn\u2019t supposed to pop off yet, but here it is, thanks to retail getting the tip from DFV and a bunch of others that took the time to do the one thing that would have saved Gabe Plotkin when he put this portfolio together earlier this year during rebalancing: reading the fucking balance sheet.",

They had 100 million share outstanding originally years ago, they aggressively focused on reducing debt and buying back equity these past years which reduced their profits during those same year which only got the shorters to double down and write articles about the potential bankruptcy of GME. Little did the shorters know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey hired the exo Nintendo chair and executives George Sherman .

Taken up 10% of marketable shares away from the Float and bring in expertise on creating an eCommerce business.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGamestop: Has been reducing expenses (stores and management) and debt over the years and if you've notice when you go to GameStop they no longer just sell video games they have expand their product lines, to memorabilia, board games, electronics, hobby items, and expanding to computer parts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis quarter: GameStop A considerable growth of 800% in their e-commerce sales stoking peoples attentions.

In the meanwhile bring huge population wealth and stability. Thus leading to an actually an occult following of people who can truly be converted into diehard fans of the company brand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe squeeze brought in many institution on the long side, such as blackrock and vanguard they actually will have a vested interest in the growth of GameStop. Notice that ETFs top the investments they generally don't sell out their positions entirely \n\n[https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&amp;subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&amp;subView=institutional)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Brilliant Free Globalscale Marketing Campaign  for this company because of the Squeeze. New articles and even talk of a movie all free of cost bring more attention to GameStop a company shifting focus to online. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGenerating a great comeback narrative of all time, a marvel sensationalist story across the world. From zero to hero bring wealth aside from themselves to everyone who believed in it and generating capital injection for this project from the hedging who shorted them for so many years, same capital to work on a new console platform industry equal to value steam. An new industry platform under their guide linked with their new expanded product line.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you can imagine connecting these dots there's something big coming for GameSpot. I would love to imagine if they launch a brand new online playstore platform at peak of this Squeeze. It would instantly stabilize the price and build huge expectations. Starting fresh with a brand heavily believed in by it's followers, freshly capitalized by it's shorters, a global sensations with an opportunity to present to the world it's freshly minted ecommerces. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you had the opportunity to invest in the PC Steam platform product of Value when it just started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust my opinion\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan't Stop, Won't Stop GameStop.

        "body": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that  Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles (with some duplicates in there).  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... with many of these senior roles sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At an 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel are a recurring revenue stream so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto. \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

But I am pretty knowledgable in tech, so figured I'd comment.\n\nI think AMD can (note, not *will*, but has the potential to) equal or exceed Nvidia within 5 years. Their rastorization performance is basically on par with Nvidia right now from what I remember, now they just need to figure out ray tracing and a DLSS equivalent (which they are going to add to current gen cards in the future, if they haven't already). If they get those down, then they're a true competitor. The big problem is if the customers will follow them. Nvidia has been so dominant for so long, I think the market will lag behind AMD's performance. Right now that doesn't matter too much, as both have major supply issues. However, more and more major companies using AMD's will definitely bolster them outside of their consumer supply. Nvidia is a bit behind in that aspect from what I can tell. Both AMD and Nividia are in good spots, it's whether or not you believe AMD can make up ground soon.\n\nI think Intel is in a rough spot. AMD is currently beating them in current programs with their CPUs. However, AMD's major advantage is core counts, and most programs aren't yet optimized to make use of all of those cores. When they start to do that, there won't be competition, the gap will increase. I read somewhere that Intel is working on phasing out their 14nm manufacturing, which should help them come back. But combine their losses to AMD with both Apple and Microsoft (allegedly, for the latter) shifting towards in-house ARM chips (who were both large Intel purchasers), and they really need to innovate if they want to get back on track.",

If you are ok with massive risk but massive potential reward, GME is an option but you need an entry and exit plan.\n\nBut a safer (but boring) option for long-term returns are ETFs or shares in the top companies in the S&amp;P500 usually. Example stocks like MSFT, apple, and amazon are high earners over time, but likely overvalued (though this has been said repeatedly the last several years and they keep going up). For ETFs you can go a mix of VTSAX, VOO, and other funds to get more safety from individual stock drops, but lower potential returns. I'd also suggest getting 4 sectors you believe in long-term for ETFs. I personally have Green energy (ICLN, PBW) and a few ARK funds (ARKG for genomic, ARKK for innovation etf).\n\nI'll see if I can find a post I personally found really useful on r/investor to link here.",
