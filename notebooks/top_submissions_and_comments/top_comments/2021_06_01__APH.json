They also offer a type of managed service known in the industry as MDR. Their customers will range across all industries and their solutions are appropriate for small to large enterprises. It's actually a pretty crowded market imo. There aren't a lot of comparables in the public market but you may be able to check out Sentinel 1 when they IPO. There are rumors of Cybereason IPO as well. \n\nFireye has an EDR solution but I imagine it's a tiny part of their business. And no one really would bring up Fireeye when talking about endpoint protection. Fireeye/Mandiant is most known for their incident response and forensic products and services. They are usually on top of most people's list to call whenever there is a security breach. \n\nBoth Palo Alto and Fortinet started off as security networking companies competing with traditional firewall companies like Netscreen and Cisco. In fact, the founders of both companies are former Netscreen execs iirc. Both companies have expanded their product and service offerings over the years to support security operations solutions. You tend to see Palo Alto and Fortinet used in larger enterprises who need holistic network security solutions. Normally, if a security team is looking at a Palo Alto solutions, they are probably also comparing it Fortinet and vice-versa. \n\nGenerally speaking - cyber-security industry is very broad. You are not likely to find a single company that would cover the entire gamut of security needs for an enterprise. So if your interest is in broad industry exposure - an ETF is probably a better solution.",

        "body": "u/theleveragedsellout  I agree with what you are saying.  I see a lot of comments from people believing that Apple can do no wrong and that their sales and share price will always go up with minimal comments about valuation.  I think Apple is overvalued at this point in time and believe that investing in the company right now is risky.  Share price could easily trade sideways for a few years (like Walmart from 2000 to 2010) to allow earnings to catch up with price or it could correct to the downside (like Cisco from 2000 to 2001).  I view any upside to be very limited and not at a favorable risk to reward ratio.",
