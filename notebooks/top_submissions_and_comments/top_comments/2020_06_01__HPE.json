Go back 2-3 years when Zoom was the first to market with many of these quality of life items, and the fast forward to thousands of organizations being forced to adopt something that would give them synchronous video within a few weeks. If all you need is video, Zoom is cheaper, and I'd argue your average non-tecchy will understand their product far better than Teams. And when compared head to head for \\*video conferencing\\*, Zoom is slightly easier, slightly more performant and has a lot of features that make it easy to adopt for newbies.\n\nFor an organization already entrenched in Teams, there's no reason to change, but for an Org that is needing to buy video conferencing only, Zoom will remain arguably the stronger option until Microsoft differentiates their product better.",

So zoom is new and techy and sexy. Let\u2019s take all of its security flaws off the table. Let\u2019s take that it\u2019s just video and not much more off the table. And let\u2019s say it\u2019s even worth not 40 multiple. Not 50. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a dumb as fuck market and let\u2019s give them 70 multiple. \n\nNow work backwards. It has roughly 268 mil shares. \n\nPrice right now is 208. 70= 208/(earnings / 268 mil).....70*(earnings /268)=208\n\n2.667=earnings /268\n\nEarnings =714\n\nSo roughly 179 mil per quarter. \n\nIf Microsoft does a 34% margin. We can relax this for this sexy new start to \ud83d\ude44 and say hey they are spending so much we can say ok 10% margin. Wait wait just looked they are 3% right now \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnyway to justify a 70p/e at this shit margin they would need to have revenues of 6 bil\n\nNow what analysts are saying is .09 EPs. Meaning 24 mil in net income 804 revenue. I\u2019d say they do what they did q1. 15 cents. Say they do that and more every quarter and get a yearly EPS of 75 cents.thats a multiple of 278. For a video conferencing stock that hasn\u2019t monetized users yet \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nAlphabet is a pE of 29. Amazon is 112.
