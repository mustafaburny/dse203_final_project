That said, Intel is still a household name, and they have a very aggressive marketing and licensing strategy. For example, Lenovo\u2019s flagship X line of laptops are Intel-only, but they\u2019re supposedly just waiting for that agreement to expire before moving on to AMD (I\u2019d kill for an ARM X1 though :)",

        "body": "IV Crush Explained:  \nBased on the state of the current market as a whole, and the state of the stock in question, the stock will have a certain % of Implied Volatility.  \nFor example, if the IV is 40%, this means that a year from today, the market expects that the current stock price will either be 40% higher than it is today, or 40% lower than it is today.\n\n  \nThat's why IV was very high for stocks during Coronavirus, because the market was volatile and nobody really knew what was gonna happen, so there was a chance for stock prices to move drastically either up or down.  \nAbout a couple of weeks or a month before the earnings of a stock, people start talking about how the company will perform on their earnings report. If everything has been chugging along normally, their Implied Volatility stays pretty low since nobody expects there to be a huge move in either direction.  \n\n\nNow in the case of Tesla, which is a meme stock (basically incredibly popular and in the news all the time), there are drastically varying opinions. Some people believe they will fail their earnings for Q2 and the stock will crash down to 1000 or less points.   \nSome people believe they will succeed and the stock price will jump to 2000 points.  \nBecause of these drastically varying opinions and controversy, the Implied Volatility goes up.   \n\n\nBecause IV goes up, more people buy into the stock thinking they could earn some nice tendies. This increases the demand for options, which in turn raises the premium fee of buying those options.  \n\n\nThe demand and premium price stays high right up until earnings, since people are expecting a huge move in the stock price. As soon as the earnings gets released, everyone knows the truth and they know if they were wrong or right. The stock price changes quickly in after earnings trading to reflect the earnings report.  \n\n\nThis instantly crushes the Implied Volatility since nobody expects the price the move drastically anymore, and this GREATLY reduces the premium price of the option you own, so you lost all of that extra value due to increased demand.   \n\n\nOn top of that, your option expires tomorrow and the extrinsic value of your option decayed over time. Tomorrow, the extrinsic value will be worthless, so all you will be left with is the difference in stock price and your strike price. If you're not above break even, you basically lost all of your money.",

Hit me for like 100k or some stupid shit when the max loss on the spread was supposed to be $500. The problem was that the assignment happens instantly, but when they go to execute the other leg of the spread to keep you covered, it takes 2-3 business days to process. So i actually only lost $500, didnt owe a margin call, and got locked out due to my account showing I owed 100k.\n\nWhen I saw the news article about that kid offing himself due to losing everything when, \"it was supposed to be a defined risk trade,\" i knew exactly what had happened. And even worse, if robinhoods customer service actually existed, the poor kid could have gotten real answers",

Had a bunch of spreads opened to try to hedge profits, but decided I wanted to just cash out, so I day traded, locked my account.\n\nOnce you lock you account, you have the remainder of the day to go nuts with day trades, went through a bunch of Tesla Spreads, Spy contracts and racked up 30+ trades in a day to cap off my robinhood journey.\n\nI\u2019d assume the spreads make it look like I traded an insane amount, so realistically I probably need to deposit $3000ish-$5000. No wonder that kid killed himself, robinhood is fucking terrible. \n\nI have accts with tasty, and tos so just gonna transfer my funds into tos for the 90 day period.\n\nUPDATE: Sarah from robinhood just email\u2019d me, I have an actual day trade call amount of $3,125.\n\nSo yeah.

        "body": "For 8 years, I worked at Intel as an electrical engineer designing circuits for the future manufacturing processes that Intel would be releasing 2-4 years into the future. There are literally thousands of MS and PhD engineers working on the myriad of challenges involved in making better computer chips. All the way from the design of the manufacturing tools, the amount of NAND gates in a library, the modeling and forecasting of dozens of transistor parameters, writing and supporting the simulation tools, to what I was doing designing and testing: analog circuits in a not yet stable manufacturing process. And hundreds of other challenges that each had teams from a few to a few dozen engineers trying to solve them. It's an insanely complex task. Most engineers working on any of these tasks are so specialized that they don't have any idea how to do the job of the engineers sitting a few aisles over. These engineers are 5-9 management layers below the CEO. Other companies operate the same way, it's just how chip design is done. \n\nIntel's main advantage over the last few decades was that it continuously had the most advanced manufacturing process, maintaining a 1-2 year lead over its closest competitors. However over the last ten years, TSMC has caught up and now overtaken Intel. This is mostly due to Intel's engineering struggles with it's last few manufacturing processes. These things spend half a decade in planning and development. Decisions were made years ago that they are now stuck with. \n\nYour points are all about top level management and I'm sure there's some truth to how important the CEO's decisions are, but I think Intel's current problems are primarily engineering problems with the manufacturing process. I sincerely doubt it's for lack of investment by CEOs. I think it's more likely that TSMC had better engineering talent and was able to do things more creatively that ended up wildly successful.  And surely some luck there too.\n\nAMD has been doing well with their architectures recently and they should get credit for that, but their architectures were always quite good, the thing holding them back was their process and what had been a disadvantage, with TSMC, is now a huge advantage. They are poised to take market share, but they mostly have TSMC to thank for that.",

It turns out that 499 of them are duds, but 1 of them is a significant improvement.\n\nHere is the problem - that formula is something that dozens of employees at least end up knowing.  It cost the company $1B to obtain that formula - not so much to obtain the formula but to figure out that this is the one worth putting in the product.\n\nNow some other company can just offer one of those dozen employees $1M as a signing bonus and they get a $1B secret.  So, pay them all $10M a year!  Well, now the company can offer $100M and STILL get a $1B secret.  \n\nAnd it wasn't like any of those dozen employees \"discovered\" that formula due to their ingenuity and deserve all the money personally.  Maybe those 500 formulas are just all random tweaks of a common formula, and it was purely trial and error that lead to the right formula.  ANYBODY who did the work would have discovered it - the company just had to assign the testing to 100 scientists testing 5 formulas each at great expense, and one got lucky, purely because they were lucky.\n\nWhile I agree that companies should pay employees well to retain them, that doesn't mean that this is a substitute for IP law.  If you make the cheapest approach to R&amp;D to let somebody else do the work and then just poach their employees for a bit more, then nobody will do R&amp;D, and all of those employees will end up unemployed.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I think that plenty of employees are underpaid or not given sufficient bonuses for their creative discoveries.  However, the person who pulls the ball out of the lottery machine shouldn't get a cut of the jackpot every time somebody wins just for being the person who drew the ball.",

Analysts don't get it because they don't see **The Big Picture**, which is that Tesla is not a car company, or even a battery company, they're a technology company. Tesla Autopilot is installed on 270,000 cars. It has driven 2,000,000,000 miles. It is already safer than a human being. How much longer until its five times safer than a human? Ten times? The telemetry data goes back to Tesla and Autopilot gets refined further and further each day.\n\nWhat's the logical endgame for a company with billions and billions of miles drive across nearly the entirety of the United States? A company that also makes semi trucks?\n\nWhy not just sell Walmart and Amazon a fleet of self-driving driverless semi trucks. They never get tired. They take a day off. They never decide to buttfuck a lot lizard and do some meth on I-10 somewhere in Arizona and then drive through a school bus of kids.\n\nAnd that's just phase 1. Why stop there?\n\nWhy not put Uber and Lyft out of business while you're at it? After all, you now have 10,000,000,000 miles driven and your Autopilot system is 10 years ahead of everyone else's. Driverless taxis with no steering wheel and no gas pedals. Just a lounge on four wheels. You open up the TeslaTaxi app on your iPhone 15 or Galaxy S30 and hit the Summon button. While your TeslaTaxi is on the way, you input your destination. It arrives and you get inside. You change the channel on the TV inside to Bloomberg Television. $MU is down another 8% and several traders jumped from the top floor of the Morgan Stanley building again. You laugh. You're on the way to Nobu to have sushi with your post-op Vietnamese girlfriend. Life is strange.\n\nThat's the endgame, bucko.\n\nTSLA could very well hit $10000 in 5-10 years.\n\nYou've already lost $31,000, just strap in and enjoy the ride.",

I've been in wsb since 2014. First as a lurker and then I used to spend hours here daily. It became a big distraction for me throughout medical school almost causing me to drop out. Even this past year I'd stopped trading as I got married, graduated and started working as a medical resident, and in Feb dumped 3k in as markets tanked , yoloed it into 80, and tried yoloing it more losing a good most of it. Made me laugh. Some things never change. Couple years I took square/mu calls from 2k to 80 in a week. Did I withdraw? Ofc not. No lessons learned. \n\nI've also seen wsb turn into what used to celebrate losing culture as much as winning into a win-only forum that barely glorifies/pretends losses exist anymore. Anything that gets wsb publicised is wins, half the posts are fake or guys with mega accounts posting their play money Tesla calls so they can jerk off as college kids drool at their portfolios. What got me into wsb was that kid who made 50 grand back in 2015. We have ppl posting those plays every ten minutes here now. \n\nFrom March -may I spent a lot of time here and felt myself getting sucked back in as markets swayed but decided to kick the habit again and check out wsb a couple times a week, and remember why I'm not as into it as I used to be. I've talked to others much smarter than me who made millions, used to post here, got bored felt incomplete and found meaning elsewhere. \n\nAt the end of the day my stupid bets paid off like almost 200k of med school but the amount of money I had to hide/pretend I didn't have (which was complicated because unfortunately my parents had to be involved in my tax filing for certain reasons), and how desensitized I got to losing 10-20k in minutes opened my eyes to how I was changing negatively here and needed some introspection. While it helped pay for school, it almost lost me relationships as I prioritized trading over friends/family. Trading hours turned into checking when futures opened turned into checking Eurasian markets before bed turned into waking up to checking premarkets..... If you have an addictive personality like me, Just be careful. This community is humorous, supportive, and often welcoming when you feel others don't understand you. But be aware.  \n\nAs a medical resident now I'm making like 55-60k a year working 80 hour weeks, my schedule fucks me, my life is a constant stress, but I have meaning and happiness in treating patients that I never had before despite the laughable like $5 per hour salary.  Just encourage you to find meaning in something you do separate from this. \n\nTldr: no one will read this it's too long.",

On the contrary.\n\nAnd I am not saying T didn't fucked up things buying shit at gold price, but at the end of the day (or the year, or 5 years) the market is gonna put everyone's in place.\n\n\nAMD and NVDA are CLEARLY Overpriced.\n\nAnd MU is CLEARLY undervalued.\n\nYou can use whatever technique you want to calculate intrinsic value or fair value. There is no way, any of your calculations put MU under a fair price of  60$. And even others elevate that number.\n\nMay be it takes 1 month, may be one year. But MU is gonna be at 60$ soon.

        "body": "go look up ISO classifications. in a pharmacy where you draw up drugs you'd be working in an ISO 5 hood, that hood has to be tested every 6 months down to 0.1 microns in order to be used and they are basically a box around a hepa filter with a blower pushing air through a HEPA filter directly into the hood. those hoods allow up to 100,000 0.1 micron particles through for every cubic meter of airflow. you are usually well below that number but I've never seen an ISO 5 hood be able to pass for ISO 4 which would be 10,000 particles. our hoods passed at ~70,000 0.1 micron particles last week(that's literally the only reason I remember the number, we just got them tested) and I believe those filters are less than two years old. Now, that's in a very small controlled environment which has super high airflow you can feel it blowing on your face when you work in it. Whole rooms are much harder to keep clean. We have trouble keeping out ISO 7 room at that level and they don't even test down to 0.1 microns. Testing stops at 0.5 microns for a whole room environments where we are concerned with bacterial/fungal contamination of drugs that will be directly injected into humans. \n\nwe've got retards spouting technical specifications designed by manufacturers to give the best number possible so they can tell consumers how good their filters are. in the real world, nobody uses HEPA filters for that purpose because they don't work. no medical professional thinks their hepa filter stops viruses. we aren't retarded regardless of what a manufacturer says we also have the data that shows they are full of shit because we are required by law to know these numbers.",

I've been in wsb since 2014. First as a lurker and then I used to spend hours here daily. It became a big distraction for me throughout medical school almost causing me to drop out. Even this past year I'd stopped trading as I got married, graduated and started working as a medical resident, and in Feb dumped 3k in as markets tanked , yoloed it into 80, and tried yoloing it more losing a good most of it. Made me laugh. Some things never change. Couple years I took square/mu calls from 2k to 80 in a week. Did I withdraw? Ofc not. No lessons learned. \n\nI've also seen wsb turn into what used to celebrate losing culture as much as winning into a win-only forum that barely glorifies/pretends losses exist anymore. Anything that gets wsb publicised is wins, half the posts are fake or guys with mega accounts posting their play money Tesla calls so they can jerk off as college kids drool at their portfolios. What got me into wsb was that kid who made 50 grand back in 2015. We have ppl posting those plays every ten minutes here now. \n\nFrom March -may I spent a lot of time here and felt myself getting sucked back in as markets swayed but decided to kick the habit again and check out wsb a couple times a week, and remember why I'm not as into it as I used to be. I've talked to others much smarter than me who made millions, used to post here, got bored felt incomplete and found meaning elsewhere. \n\nAt the end of the day my stupid bets paid off like almost 200k of med school but the amount of money I had to hide/pretend I didn't have (which was complicated because unfortunately my parents had to be involved in my tax filing for certain reasons), and how desensitized I got to losing 10-20k in minutes opened my eyes to how I was changing negatively here and needed some introspection. While it helped pay for school, it almost lost me relationships as I prioritized trading over friends/family. Trading hours turned into checking when futures opened turned into checking Eurasian markets before bed turned into waking up to checking premarkets..... If you have an addictive personality like me, Just be careful. This community is humorous, supportive, and often welcoming when you feel others don't understand you. But be aware.  \n\nAs a medical resident now I'm making like 55-60k a year working 80 hour weeks, my schedule fucks me, my life is a constant stress, but I have meaning and happiness in treating patients that I never had before despite the laughable like $5 per hour salary.  Just encourage you to find meaning in something you do separate from this. \n\nTldr: no one will read this it's too long.",

On the contrary.\n\nAnd I am not saying T didn't fucked up things buying shit at gold price, but at the end of the day (or the year, or 5 years) the market is gonna put everyone's in place.\n\n\nAMD and NVDA are CLEARLY Overpriced.\n\nAnd MU is CLEARLY undervalued.\n\nYou can use whatever technique you want to calculate intrinsic value or fair value. There is no way, any of your calculations put MU under a fair price of  60$. And even others elevate that number.\n\nMay be it takes 1 month, may be one year. But MU is gonna be at 60$ soon.

Now, that's in a very small controlled environment which has super high airflow you can feel it blowing on your face when you work in it. Whole rooms are much harder to keep clean. We have trouble keeping out ISO 7 room at that level and they don't even test down to 0.1 microns. Testing stops at 0.5 microns for a whole room environments where we are concerned with bacterial/fungal contamination of drugs that will be directly injected into humans. \n\nwe've got retards spouting technical specifications designed by manufacturers to give the best number possible so they can tell consumers how good their filters are. in the real world, nobody uses HEPA filters for that purpose because they don't work. no medical professional thinks their hepa filter stops viruses. we aren't retarded regardless of what a manufacturer says we also have the data that shows they are full of shit because we are required by law to know these numbers.",
