        "body": "IV Crush Explained:  \nBased on the state of the current market as a whole, and the state of the stock in question, the stock will have a certain % of Implied Volatility.  \nFor example, if the IV is 40%, this means that a year from today, the market expects that the current stock price will either be 40% higher than it is today, or 40% lower than it is today.\n\n  \nThat's why IV was very high for stocks during Coronavirus, because the market was volatile and nobody really knew what was gonna happen, so there was a chance for stock prices to move drastically either up or down.  \nAbout a couple of weeks or a month before the earnings of a stock, people start talking about how the company will perform on their earnings report. If everything has been chugging along normally, their Implied Volatility stays pretty low since nobody expects there to be a huge move in either direction.  \n\n\nNow in the case of Tesla, which is a meme stock (basically incredibly popular and in the news all the time), there are drastically varying opinions. Some people believe they will fail their earnings for Q2 and the stock will crash down to 1000 or less points.   \nSome people believe they will succeed and the stock price will jump to 2000 points.  \nBecause of these drastically varying opinions and controversy, the Implied Volatility goes up.   \n\n\nBecause IV goes up, more people buy into the stock thinking they could earn some nice tendies. This increases the demand for options, which in turn raises the premium fee of buying those options.  \n\n\nThe demand and premium price stays high right up until earnings, since people are expecting a huge move in the stock price. As soon as the earnings gets released, everyone knows the truth and they know if they were wrong or right. The stock price changes quickly in after earnings trading to reflect the earnings report.  \n\n\nThis instantly crushes the Implied Volatility since nobody expects the price the move drastically anymore, and this GREATLY reduces the premium price of the option you own, so you lost all of that extra value due to increased demand.   \n\n\nOn top of that, your option expires tomorrow and the extrinsic value of your option decayed over time. Tomorrow, the extrinsic value will be worthless, so all you will be left with is the difference in stock price and your strike price. If you're not above break even, you basically lost all of your money.",

        "body": "For 8 years, I worked at Intel as an electrical engineer designing circuits for the future manufacturing processes that Intel would be releasing 2-4 years into the future. There are literally thousands of MS and PhD engineers working on the myriad of challenges involved in making better computer chips. All the way from the design of the manufacturing tools, the amount of NAND gates in a library, the modeling and forecasting of dozens of transistor parameters, writing and supporting the simulation tools, to what I was doing designing and testing: analog circuits in a not yet stable manufacturing process. And hundreds of other challenges that each had teams from a few to a few dozen engineers trying to solve them. It's an insanely complex task. Most engineers working on any of these tasks are so specialized that they don't have any idea how to do the job of the engineers sitting a few aisles over. These engineers are 5-9 management layers below the CEO. Other companies operate the same way, it's just how chip design is done. \n\nIntel's main advantage over the last few decades was that it continuously had the most advanced manufacturing process, maintaining a 1-2 year lead over its closest competitors. However over the last ten years, TSMC has caught up and now overtaken Intel. This is mostly due to Intel's engineering struggles with it's last few manufacturing processes. These things spend half a decade in planning and development. Decisions were made years ago that they are now stuck with. \n\nYour points are all about top level management and I'm sure there's some truth to how important the CEO's decisions are, but I think Intel's current problems are primarily engineering problems with the manufacturing process. I sincerely doubt it's for lack of investment by CEOs. I think it's more likely that TSMC had better engineering talent and was able to do things more creatively that ended up wildly successful.  And surely some luck there too.\n\nAMD has been doing well with their architectures recently and they should get credit for that, but their architectures were always quite good, the thing holding them back was their process and what had been a disadvantage, with TSMC, is now a huge advantage. They are poised to take market share, but they mostly have TSMC to thank for that.",

Any of them is simple enough that anybody could memorize them.  It turns out that 499 of them are duds, but 1 of them is a significant improvement.\n\nHere is the problem - that formula is something that dozens of employees at least end up knowing.  It cost the company $1B to obtain that formula - not so much to obtain the formula but to figure out that this is the one worth putting in the product.\n\nNow some other company can just offer one of those dozen employees $1M as a signing bonus and they get a $1B secret.  So, pay them all $10M a year!  Well, now the company can offer $100M and STILL get a $1B secret.  \n\nAnd it wasn't like any of those dozen employees \"discovered\" that formula due to their ingenuity and deserve all the money personally.  Maybe those 500 formulas are just all random tweaks of a common formula, and it was purely trial and error that lead to the right formula.  ANYBODY who did the work would have discovered it - the company just had to assign the testing to 100 scientists testing 5 formulas each at great expense, and one got lucky, purely because they were lucky.\n\nWhile I agree that companies should pay employees well to retain them, that doesn't mean that this is a substitute for IP law.  If you make the cheapest approach to R&amp;D to let somebody else do the work and then just poach their employees for a bit more, then nobody will do R&amp;D, and all of those employees will end up unemployed.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I think that plenty of employees are underpaid or not given sufficient bonuses for their creative discoveries.  However, the person who pulls the ball out of the lottery machine shouldn't get a cut of the jackpot every time somebody wins just for being the person who drew the ball.",

I usually follow rules (admittedly taken from a [discord](https://discord.com/invite/zCRns4w) group I'm in):\n\n1) I usually only trade Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday/ Thursday EOD/Friday EOD \n\n2) I only play sectors I am confident in \n\n3) If i see something that looks truly unusual (ie: I don't know this ticker, why is it have such high volume, let's look at the bids, let's look at its option history, let's see what on twitter/stocktwits is being said about that) at the morning/lunch/EOD, I may trade it. A great example of this is Friday contacts a month ago on INO, which netted over 1000% when all was said and done. \n\n4) History and flow is most important. If I have been trading for a while and the market is topsy-turvy, I know when an alert comes in (and I check the history), I may be in for a quick intraday play. If things seem slowly growing, longer out, I know to play longer, directionally. \n\n5) Don't FOMO ever \n\n6) If you have a smaller account limit your exposure. Bigger accounts can make winners run longer, and take more losses. \n\n7) News is most important. An alert is often proceeded by a flurry of news in most tickers. Figure out what that news is. If you can't find anything, could potentially ignore. \n\n8) If you are having a bad day, don't make it worse by revenge trading. A whale alert are usually quite OTM, capturing direction. You will get greedy and lose momentum if you are chasing. \n\n9) Figure out your trading style and stick to that schedule \n\nEdit: Spacing",

I think it would be politically toxic in this environment, and very dangerous precedent.  It would basically backstop any widespread speculation, and 100% take any risk out of the stock market, which would lead to runaway valuations, and a massive bubble.  The other part of this is with it going to congress, Democrats uphold one chamber, and they are not going to go down a path that is seen as simply backstopping all those wealthy people in the market, and leading to widespread speculation.  \n\nPeople see recessions as all bad for the stock market, and that's really not true.  During expansions valuations tend to expand much faster than profits and economic activity does.  Recessions force a reset of this.  Not letting it reset means you're going to have the entire market trading at a 100 pe ratio.",

Something about them is no longer working. \n\nSecondly, MRK\u2019s press release for their phase 3 trial of [Islatravir](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) is set to begin soon after their presentation at the AIDS 2020 virtual divulging that the Phase 2b results proved that their drug has higher efficacy and safety from the analyses. \n\nThirdly, MRK has a proven track record for putting up great [earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-earnings-surprise-streak-could-161004767.html), and most analysts are bullish already about them for their earnings coming out 7/31. And will be even more so in the near future thanks to their EIDD-2801 exclusive rights from RidgeBack Therapeutics for an antiviral for covid until others produce a sustainable vaccine, and more so because they\u2019ll likely make up the shortage for HIV meds with current meds and their upcoming Islatravir. \n\nFuthermore, MRK just got [FDA approval](https://www.mrknewsroom.com/newsroom/news-releases/news-details/2020/FDA-Approves-Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-First-Line-Treatment-of-Patients-With-Unresectable-or-Metastatic-MSI-H-or-dMMR-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx) to use Keytruda for first-line colon cancer. Which will only drive their earnings. \n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t share the seeking A article, but it goes into further detail about why antivirals will be very important in the coming months since vaccines are still projected to be at least 6 months out, if not longer. If you want to see the SA article just google \u201cAntivirals Rather Than Vaccines for COVID-19\u201d\n\nAlso, the EIDD-2801 candidate they have rights to from RidgeBack is currently in quite a few trials, but one of the more pertinent one is in South Africa where they\u2019re needing 50 HIV positive people to see if it can help prevent covid in them, but also they\u2019re secretly hoping by sheer luck that the same drug can help manage HIV at the same time it prevents covid. \n\nSticking with my originals 7/31 $85-$90c, and 10/16 $90-$95, but I\u2019ll also add 1/21 $100-$105c since there are many analysts setting $100+ fair values for eoy.\n\nEdit: TL;DR\u2014 MRK $85+ calls cause they make the good drugs for bad things and it make printer go brrrrrrrr.",

        "body": "Here is the article:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn Ontario government task force is calling for the province\u2019s securities regulator to be dramatically transformed, proposing an independent tribunal to hear cases and a broadened mandate that includes making economic growth a priority.\n\nThe Capital Markets Modernization Task Force, which was launched by the Ministry of Finance in February, has also proposed rules that it hopes will allow smaller, independent investment dealers to better compete against their larger rivals in the banking sector and has urged the government to ban a specific, exploitative type of short-selling.\n\nThe proposals are among 47 recommendations touted as the first wide-scope review of Ontario\u2019s capital markets since 2003. The full list of proposals is scheduled to be released Thursday but is not final; the task force, chaired by Walied Soliman, the Canadian chair of law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, is seeking public comment before it puts forward its final list in the fall.\n\nAmong the more sweeping proposals are major structural reforms to the Ontario Securities Commission, the country\u2019s largest. Currently, the organization is run by about a dozen commissioners who play three roles: setting policy, functioning as a board of directors and adjudicating cases of alleged wrongdoing.\n\nThe task force has called for that system to be dismantled and has proposed creating an entirely new capital markets tribunal \u2013 one that would be completely separate from the OSC and report directly to the Minister of Finance. It has also proposed a slightly less drastic option, which would create an adjudicative tribunal within the OSC.\n\nOntario\u2019s securities law stipulates that the roles of OSC chair and chief executive officer be filled by the same person. The report says those roles need to be split, as is expected of the corporations the OSC oversees.\n\n\u201cIt was time for the Ontario Securities Commission to evolve to the governance standards that it holds our issuers to across this province,\u201d Mr. Soliman said in an interview.\n\nAnother big-picture proposal is a rejigging of the OSC\u2019s mandate. As it stands, the commission is responsible for enforcing securities laws, but the task force has raised the idea of expanding its mission to include the \u201cfostering of capital formation and competitive capital markets.\u201d Such a move, it said, would \u201cinstitutionally and culturally\u201d shift the organization to consider economic growth, which would help it reduce \u201cfees and anti-competitive behaviour.\u201d\n\nThe task force has also floated a number of changes that it said will \u201clevel the playing field\u201d between smaller, independent market dealers and the behemoths in the banking sector. It has singled out the practice known as \u201ctied selling,\u201d in which banks use preferential interest rates or incentives to compel companies to raise capital through their own affiliates. Although this is already banned by federal banking law, the task force said it heard from dealers and issuers that commercial lenders \u201ccontinue to engage in these practices.\u201d\n\nThis raises the possibility of forbidding such \u201cexclusivity arrangements\u201d and requiring a senior banking officer to attest that no such bundling deals have been struck. The task force also asked market participants how they would feel if, by law, a specific percentage of all underwriting arrangements across the province were required to be performed by \u201cnon-bank-owned investment dealers.\u201d\n\nMr. Soliman said many of these proposals are in response to a decline in the number of smaller investment dealers. He said that when bank dealers were asked about tied selling, they denied offering such incentives \u2013 in which case, Mr. Soliman said, the proposed changes won\u2019t affect their business.\n\nHe said the province needs to sustain independent dealers because small companies and entrepreneurs are not able to get an audience with bank dealers. \u201cWe would not have had a cannabis capital market in this province if we didn\u2019t have small dealers,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of the larger financial institutions were interested in getting involved in cannabis issuers because of cross-border legal issues.\u201d\n\nHis group is also seeking to stamp out a sophisticated financial trick used by some institutional investors, a type of trading that was highlighted in a Globe and Mail report in November on the collapse of the cannabis sector. Hedge funds anticipating a new cannabis deal would short the issuer\u2019s shares before the deal launched, knowing an offering in the works would be available at a discount. They would then cover their positions by purchasing large portions of the financing and, in effect, instantly earn a discount percentage.\n\nThis practice \u201charms the corporation, its shareholders and the uninformed investors trading against the short sellers,\u201d the task force report states. The report proposes that any market participant that has previously shorted securities of the same type as offered under a prospectus should be forbidden from acquiring those securities under the prospectus.\n\nThe task force has also urged the government to give the OSC new powers to help it collect unpaid fines from market wrongdoers. Similar to changes enacted in British Columbia, it has called for new laws that would allow the regulator to freeze assets in the early stages of an investigation and force fraudsters to pay their OSC fines before they are allowed to renew their driver\u2019s licence or licence plates.",
