I'm still expecting maybe a 20% drop in the markets, overall, if things don't get better sometime soon (regarding the economy, domestic and international).\n\nTechnology has been strong and steady through all of this.  just keep an eye on things, it's good you have your list going.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nopen up excel and start tracking which have the best dividend yields, which have the best survivability (being innovative). a lot of people like AAPL, but they're not really innovative anymore. people aren't gonna be stocking up on new phones and shit this year, and their div-yield is pretty low compared to some others. so IMO, I don't consider AAPL a good buy, compared to some other options. I would replace AAPL with JNPR, CSCO, VZ or even MCD.\n\nIf you plan on holding these for 10+ years, start DCA'ing or buy and stop watching. for the short term (next few months) shit's going to be volatile. in 10 years, the strong companies will have recovered from this, most likely already way beyond the 20-30% hit they just took.\n\nthis is all just my opinion, I'm in no way a professional.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: something else to consider is Shareholder Rewards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my index watch list: LVS, WYNN, VZ,  JNPR, \\*AAL, CSCO, CVS, MCD,  JNJ, EXPE, LMT, PG, H, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, TSLA, \\*BA, GBTC, NFLX, \\*FB, \\*DAL, BKNG, DIS, \\*CCL, \\*NCLH, \\*RCL, IHG, WVVI, ONVC, CWGL, CHDN, F, BRKB\n\n\\* = I'm watching to see how things pan out over the next few weeks-months.\n\nNote: They're sorted by highest dividend yield, with the exception of DIS and ONVC. there are several there that don't have dividends, but I'm watching anyway as I think there is long term growth in them.",

I remember in 2012 it had a P/E over 3500. At around 250 it would that would have been a great investment. \n\nCOST just reported 1.5 billion YOY revenue increase for March. I think that this leans in the direction of it\u2019s not merely e-commerce. \n\nDisney+ (DIS) reported recently it has over 50 million subscribers as of 2 months ago being around 20. \n\nWorking from home requires additional security. You are vastly under playing the business required for this. Home based networks can make confidential information more vulnerable. PAWN and CSCO both stand to benefit from this. (Carbonite mcafee, etc). There is also additional companies that help provide a safe portal (NTAP, CSCO, MSFT) to access the infrastructure. The servers networks need built (INTC, AMD, NVDA) and then stored (DLR). Then maintained (JNPR CSCO). \n\nBeyond al of that Stock market is speculative. I speculate this is a great country and we have great people in this country that will pull through and make it a better place to live. \n\nGood luck to you sir, you are your family stay safe.",

        "body": "Yea that's a good question (tldr at end).  For some stocks it can be like 5+ years.  For sure, Tesla won't realize it's fundamentals until like 5+ years, and even then, it can pull a MSFT in which it goes from a blue chip to a blue chip + growth stock (with Azure), in which case, it still may not fully realize that part of it's fundamentals until we know how big cloud will be.\n\nBut when I invest, my target is always like 2+ years for all my stocks and for the stock market as a whole.  That's why I've always been buying this entire time, since even though we can definitely sell off short term back to say 240, I know long term, the stock market will be better than 280.  More importantly, I am confident the individual stocks I pick will be better than what they are currently longer term.  That's why a DCA approach is a fairly standard and safe approach.  Of course, you can adjust this DCA approach to be way more aggressive on drops and less aggressive on up moves (like buy way less on a day like today, if today was your set buying date).  I don't worry about the market going down short term for my long term investments.  Plus, if you look, so many tech stocks, like MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, NFLX, etc. are all up for the year despite this!\n\nNow, for trading, you can also trade the fundamentals in the short term - which would be months here.  If you believe the economy will be slower to return to work, if the Q1 and Q2 earnings will be bad, if the vaccine will take longer than normal, if social distincing in a way still continues even after we open up, if consumer demand is less, if the credit problem comes back, etc., or some combination of that, you can trade that.  So for example, you can buy like a 3 month 15% OTM put or something.  Perhaps you believe QQQ &gt; IWM (that's what I believe), so in that case, maybe if you are long QQQ, you can short IWM as a market hedge.  So many ways to trade that.\n\ntldr: \n\nTrading should be on either short term TECHNIALS (days - weeks) or short term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be months)\n\nInvesting should be on long term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be years).  I'm a believer in the US Economy and particularly the tech sector and a few non-tech stocks like COST, so I will always invest when I have the chance to do so, without having to always try to predict the bottom.  Predicting the bottom or the top is best used in the above trading section.",

Buffet evaluates what he thinks a company should be worth before looking at the stock price and sees how it compares. The guy in the big short saw systemic flaws in the mortgage industry and traded on that. Both are frequently wrong short term, but usually right long term. If you think Microsoft (just picking a company) has the management, products, vision, and capabilities to double their income in 10 years, you should buy them regardless of what their stock price is or does over the next year.

The fact of markets is that its driven by 80% financial institutions who are not barred from holding short positions. The market is irrational in the short term, but its never irrational long term. \n\nTake a look at the VIX, its at 42. This implies that SPY can move 12% up or down as driven by premium prices. This means that the underwriters of options (the guys you buy options from) are pricing in this movement. Now lets look at SPY's movement the last 2 weeks, gee what do you know? its moved up 12% well within the expected volatility of the market. \n\nThis means that the SPY index can swing up or down 12% within this month, and it will mean absolutely NOTHING. It would be considered random noise.\n\nNow during the last 2 weeks we've had 2 uncertainties become certain.\n\n1. PPP was activated and disbursed\n2. Fed commited to buying Equity based securities\n\nThese were the 2 big driving factors of the gains.\n\nNow if you scrutinized the winners and losers of the last 2 weeks of gains, you can notice a theme. Companies like MSFT/AMD/NVDA/Netflix are rewarded. Can you think of a rational reason why that is? Compared to say BA? This is proof the market is evaluating companies rationally corp to corp.\n\nNext, I want all the bears to understand that in the history of 100 years of equity movement, the stocks only moved down 4% of the time ( vs 96% of the time up) and in addition, bear markets only lasted 200 days on average. With the way algos reacted and the fed, you can expect this bear market to be compressed at LEAST by a factor of 2. Lets say 100 days. Now we've had market reaction for over 60 days now. this means, we are likely already halfway through this market correction statistically.\n\nKnowing the above quantifications, how many are actually brave enough to continue to short? It makes no sense logically given the above.",

Then buy puts against the shares so if we do go down soon you\u2019ll have cash to buy more shares on down days. Over time you\u2019ll be rich, alternatively buy long calls instead of shares.

Laying off at least half of our dick beating workforce will save us enough cash to be able to start buying back shares of our stonks again, boosting EPS by {UNREASONABLE\\_PERCENTAGE}.\n\nThanks to the free money printer, we haven't had to outlay much working capital to continue to pay our work from home employees, as JPOW has been cranking that money crank till his eyes started bleeding and he had to hire an intern to take over.  In addition, team JPOW has been buying up our high yield bonds that we've been issuing, further preparing us to continue our very efficient stonk buyback program.\n\nWhile we can't issue guidance at this time, we all here at {COMPANY} want you to know that we are very excited about what 2021 is going to look like.",

I remember in 2012 it had a P/E over 3500. At around 250 it would that would have been a great investment. \n\nCOST just reported 1.5 billion YOY revenue increase for March.

You are vastly under playing the business required for this. Home based networks can make confidential information more vulnerable. PAWN and CSCO both stand to benefit from this. (Carbonite mcafee, etc). There is also additional companies that help provide a safe portal (NTAP, CSCO, MSFT) to access the infrastructure. The servers networks need built (INTC, AMD, NVDA) and then stored (DLR). Then maintained (JNPR CSCO). \n\nBeyond al of that Stock market is speculative.
