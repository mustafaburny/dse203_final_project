        "body": "First of all, if this is your first valuation, that's really impressive. Are you a student? I love that you picked a sub 1 BN market cap, beaten up company in an obscure industry with hair on it. I have a few questions/problems regarding the analysis.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Questions**\n\n\n1) This company has a long public history. You can pull financials back ~20 years. Why was this not included in your analysis? History is important and should always be a part of due dilligence.\n\n\n\n2) What happened to revenues from 2010-2012?\n\n\n\n3) In 2004, the company was doing 360m of operating cash flow. 17 years later they are doing half the number. Stock performance has been abysmal. It certainly hasn't been a compounder. If you are betting on this stock, you are betting on a change in the status quo. How has/will this business change going forward *for the better*? Has their revenue source changed? Change of management/strategy? Did legislation change/there are different opportunities now? Why is operating cash flow not going to be half of 150m 17 years from now?\n\n\n\n4) In 2004, book value was ~1B. Now it's 800m. Even if you could get confidence in a growing cash flow number, how does capital get allocated going forward? It appears the company predominantly did buybacks when it was a cash cow - which is just about the best thing it could have done in my opinion. Basically, if the best thing management can do with excess capital is return it to shareholders, that's not exactly an attractive attribute, and only offers room to screw things up. \n\n\n\n5) What is the TAM (total addressable market)? What are the competitive dynamics in the industry? How about the growth rate of the industry and penetration of PRDO? These are important questions to answer in order to get a handle on how they grow (shrink) over the next 5 years. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Advice/Problems with Thesis**\n\n\n\n**You provide essentially no catalyst and conservatively project declining/stagnant margins/revenue.** However, your DCF shows upside. What your thesis posits is that market participants will decide to run a similar DCF on the company and the stock will re-rate. That isn't exactly compelling. Are you or are you not betting on the near term acceleration in free cash flow persisting? To me, understanding that is core to this thesis.\n\n\n\n**Your upside is 20-50%.** Again, how/why would this thing re-rate 50% upwards given all the hair on this business and revenue/cash flow is stagnant/declining? Even if it miraculously happens, you get a ~20% CAGR over 2 years on a business that could be a 0 if the government flicks a switch. Do I want to put my neck out and take that risk or buy a modestly-priced bonified wealth compounder with an established track record instead, for a similar CAGR?\n\n\n\n**You stumbled upon this company by running a quantitative value screen.** It is helpful to be cognizant of the significant drawbacks of sourcing your ideas with this method. Especially using 52 week lows/high ROIC/low valuation multiple... you are going to be left with a list of companies which investment managers threw out for deliberate *qualitative* reasons. But the companies look good *quantiatively*. For the stock to be a buy, you need to refute the negative qualitative perception, not emphasize the obvious quantiative attributes. You hit on the 90-10 regulation - but after spending an hour with this business I believe there are other significant factors (which I have alluded to elsewhere). \n\n\n\n**On the \"once it's fairly priced, I'm out\" mentality.** I feel that you gloss over a major problem being a short-term focused investor, buying a business like this. It is the line of reasoning which enables one to rationalize buying a business with a skeptical value add, dubious long term growth prospects, and unethical practices. It is a dangerous mentality for a value investor, in my opinion. **If the market decides to hate this company more and it sells off 50%, what are you going to do then?** If I am focused on the long-term potential of the stock, I can confidently hold and let compounding do its magic, maybe even buying more on a pullback. But if I know the truth is the long term picture is gloomy, then in the back of my mind, I know I am holding onto a melting ice cube... So will you buy more if it falls 50% or take a permenant capital loss?\n\n\n\n**Knowingly buying into an unethical business**. These businesses result in a type of self-selection bias in which lower-quality, unethical individuals tend to associate with it. That includes employees, management, suppliers - even customers and *investors*. Again - reiterating how significant that drawback is.\n\n\n\n**On margin of safety.** Margin of safety can be thought of quantiatively. I believe it is more prudent when thought of qualitatively. I'd be happy buying a company trading at 10x revenue and 100x net income if I am 99% confident in management's execution, TAM, product, growth prospects, and economics of an industry. However, I wouldn't touch a business trading at .5x book and 20% cash flow yield if management is shady, growth prospects/capital allocation isn't there, and the company is in the business of screwing over its customers. In my opinion - qualitative attributes is where you get true margin of safety.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAgain - great work. Thank you for the contribution, these are my favorite posts on this sub. Please note that regardless of my pushback the stock could do great. It's not compelling enough for me, however, and I believe this is a classic value trap. But I also note, with humility, that [I told the famous gamestop guy (DFV/RoaringKitty) that gamestop was a value trap in 2020.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/i3m1pd/i_just_published_my_analysis_on_gamestop_gme_401/)",
