In no particular order. \n\nWKHS:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/YqdW6TJ6/C7-AADB53-B2-A8-4-BA2-B02-B-414-C638-EA560.jpg\n\nUWMC:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/D0ZbHgGJ/262-ABCC5-E3-F3-4-CB6-B87-C-BADBC089-D4-C2.jpg\n\nSNDL:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/sXKhT8MC/5-EE62214-44-B2-46-F7-8-FF1-904-C9-C566-A6-F.jpg\n\nTLRY:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/25QvZ3m6/60-A08-E7-A-844-B-44-DE-A829-FE166-D6-B699-A.jpg\n\nRIDE (this one is pretty weird (and the PT will be downgraded due to the recent filings); I mean why would you buy calls on this?):\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/59S3G4HL/33-ECC1-E9-4663-4-ED6-B093-74-B609-F89136.jpg\n\nWISH (pretty new; the PT will be reassessed with time):\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/bJjxCWpm/550-D67-BA-C6-A0-4661-95-AD-B105-EF546-D68.jpg\n\nAlso of interest to this particular ticker, the number of shares outstanding and authorized to be issued, read dilution is coming, especially if it runs:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/KYT75xSK/DA181-EBA-19-C6-443-D-BD23-D85-B7-A148-B57.jpg\n\nPLTR:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/4ys1dM0Y/72620410-7161-45-E3-9-C5-B-5525598-CEFAA.jpg\n\nIVR:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/ZKYczG3g/85381-F49-C68-C-45-FA-B07-B-FDC9-F4-D193-D8.jpg\n\nCLF:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/x1c3cL63/9-A2-AF3-F2-742-D-447-A-BCE3-7735117-C5-D89.jpg\n\nRKT:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/Wb97N5w4/D3-BFA536-470-C-463-D-A878-D3-CCF3256-F56.jpg\n\nAMC is ranging from $1 to $16 ($16 being insane, imo).\n\nThe above are the meme stonks that had the highest options volume on June 9. Most had calls trading to puts roughly at 8 to 2, on average; except for CLOV and AMC because those two are switching to puts pretty quickly (currently ~6 to 4 from 8 to 2 just a few days ago, which is not a good sign and almost always leads to drop in share price, as far as meme stocks are concerned). RIDE is also an exception, 5 to 5 as far as calls and puts trading goes.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the mother of all! It didn\u2019t make the most active options list today though. \n\nGME (pretty generous, imo):\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/V6ztB1LF/43735-EE7-F1-A6-4-B6-A-84-C3-C69-BC4-DF9469.jpg",
