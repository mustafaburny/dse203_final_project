Aside from the usual bug schedule (which cisco is no better/worse than anyone else) their hardware is rocksolid, it really comes down to the software for the API on the devices, or the software of tools to manage it.\n\nCisco is only a leader in the market when you look at the entire breadth of their portfolio because: No one else is spread as thin.

Furthermore, if you expect the price to go down further you would be good to buy a put contract on Cisco. \n\nIf you want to hang on to your shares of Cisco because you expect them to go up, but want \"insurance\" against that, you could also buy a put contract in case the price goes down.",

They've been on a straight tear in [acquisitions](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/corporate-strategy-office/acquisitions/acquisitions-list-years.html) so if any of those pan out it could be big for them.  If you look at what each of those acquiring companies does though, it's all over the place.  SaaS, analytics, security, communications...I don't know if they're trying to be a jack-of-all-trades or if they are just throwing darts and seeing what sticks.",

If you sell you gain the 15% in the discount plus 4% from the dividend you gained as well. Historically, the stock has gone up as well, which also increase your gains.\n\nSo, continue to buy your company stock.\n\n\nNow there is some people I bet at your work, just like mine, that have bought their company stock for 20+ years and never sold. Doing this increasing your exposure to that one company. If the company tanks, your stock will be worth a lot less and you could be out of a job.\n\n\nHowever, if you go with selling right after your lock out period it\u2019s a great way to use that discount to generate more money for you. \n\n\nRelax investing is a marathon not a sprint.",

I gave up on Cisco when the company sold off a shit ton of shares and made up \"low guidance\".. they fucked themselves and got rich in the process. Stupid assholes",

In 2008 crisis, millions of people were on the verge of losing their homes and becoming homeless, every street had a few foreclosed homes, our biggest banks and financial institutions were on the verge of bankruptcy and needed bailing out, our 3 big car companies were losing billions and about to go bankrupt, every day thousands of people were getting laid off, we had unemployment rate going in double digits, small companies were going bankrupt right and left, it felt like this was the end of capitalism and the whole system was collapsing under its own weight. Now what do we have? Possibly 3-6 months of supply chain disruptions. Oh please!",

Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",
