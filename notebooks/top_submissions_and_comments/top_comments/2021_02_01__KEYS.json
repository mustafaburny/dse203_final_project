Posting here: \n\nI don't see enough people talking about how lawyering up could tip the balance of this game. The only things I've learned as a lawyer are\n\n1. Dishonest people really have a way of shaping up -- at least temporarily -- when lawyers start watching them.\n2. The only people who make more soft-brained YOLO bets in winner-take-all scenarios than WSB are civil litigators.\n\nThe only way to truly scare giant, billion dollar entities like hedge funds into playing by some semblance of rules is to sick litigators on them who are backed with litigations funds financed by other billion dollar entities that want their money.\n\nMy point: there are 8.3 million people (and bots) here. A handful of you I imagine some of you might be itching to be plaintiffs in a case -- if for no other reason than to show all the hedge funds currently laddering, creating synthetic longs, naked shorting, manipulating the market through bots, etc. that someone is watching them. And it if they keep doing it, it will be found out in discovery. I have no clue what the funds/brokers/etc. doing. It could be nothing, or it could be everything. But civil lawyers are incentivized by millions or billions of dollars in damages awards to find out if they sniff out anything wrong that they can actually prove.\n\nThis post gets flagged if I put a bunch of links to firms in this, but assuming this gets upvoted I can actually put together a more coherent and useful list from my actual case research platform.\n\nBig money is not afraid of the SEC. BUT they might be afraid of some civil lawyers who want to make a name for themselves by taking a big broker, hedge fund, et al. down while the world is watching. Think about it: they might even be in the movie based on GME. Someone would do it OR at least crunch the numbers on it.\n\nJust one example:\n\n[https://www.rgrdlaw.com/services-litigation-securities-fraud.html](https://www.rgrdlaw.com/services-litigation-securities-fraud.html) (for example, these dudes recovered 7.2 billion for investors of Enron)\n\nPlaintiff's lawyers generally don't charge: they take a rake of the award they win. So they're incredibly picky about cases to take, but incredibly incentivized to win the ones that they do.\n\nNot all firms are created equal. Big firms can move the needle with their big dollar energy. Small firms don't have any power but might actually be hungry for a fight and might be willing to run directly into a spear if it means the case of their career.\n\nIf this gets any traction, I'll go to my actual case research platform and give a few real recommendations. This is not investment advice. This entire thing was typed by me randomly hitting keys on my keyboard with my fists.\n\nHOLD THE LINE.",

Many people have lost hundreds of millions in Bitcoin when they lost access to their private keys through whatever means. It also kind of annoys me that I cant buy a lot of these coins in my brokerage acct. and almost 12 years later there is still not an ETF with a good mix of crypto you can just buy without a premium. I say skip it, who cares if it goes to a million, too much uncertainty and you can find stuff out there that is a lot more likely to keep doubling with lower risk (ex. cannabis oplays, SPCE, JMIA etc.). Theoretically I own some BTC through all my ARK ETFs which have a lot of companies that either own or process crypto transactions, such as SQ and PYPL, ICE etc, that is the safer way to play it. Also safer may be BLOK ETF for indirectly owning crypto without huge risk when it tanks.",

Having said that, we are still talking about volume here that - in the immediate - minute to minute transactions - me buying at some point during the day, and you buying 30 at some point during the day - aren't going to make a dent in their plan. On yahoo you can look at it minute by minute candlesticks and they are moving around 50k in shares per minute. My thought is that they are coordinating it like a hot potato sort of situation..they just keeps shuffling the same potatoes back and forth to each other.  Now - short to medium term - if you and keep buying and holding our 20 here and 30 there...we keep taking from their potato. They are used to people being in this game for the sole purpose of making money so when we continue to hold no matter how much we lose - and then continue to double down....if the daily net Diamond Hands can continue to counteract the daily Paper hands....then if it is indeed shorted as much as some people continue to think it is, then a squeeze is still very much possible because the shares that they need to cover simply do not exist within the available float.\n\nFor the love of god --- this could be off by a mile and be extremely dangerous advice if it were to be construed as such...so please do not consider it as such.

Prebuilt gaming computers? Steam keys? Your own online PC game store or subscription/streaming service? Your own line of affordable, top quality peripherals?\n\nAs a PC player, there is currently very little reason for me to buy anything from existing retailers, or to go into their stores (unless I'm after merch). I get my hardware from PC stores and my games from Steam and resellers like humble bundle and G2A. \n\nWe're a huge portion of the gaming community that is completely untapped by gaming retailers. If the estimate that about 50% of gamers are on PC is correct, then by adding us to your target demographic, you're potentially increasing your customer base by 100%.\n\nThere are plenty of subscription services for PC players, but they're all lackluster and have a long way to go to be worthwhile. \n\nHow about tapping some of the investment funds you just received to develop THE GO TO SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE FOR PC GAMERS? Think Netflix, but for PC gamers.\n\nGaming subscription/streaming services are young. You have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and create an amazing product, especially with the huge recent injection of money into your company.\n\nAfter the huge amount of chatter around GameStop in the last few weeks, and the stake I have in your company (both moral and financial), I'd definitely support these products and services if you made them available, and I'm sure many of the other apes here feel the same way.",

        "body": "&gt;Decentralized but you have to mine it? \n\nThe mining is actually how its decentralized. All the miners are 'working' for the protocol, and they do this because they're paid in cryptocurrency. That's why the actual cryptocurrency is essential to how the system works. Otherwise you can't get all of these disparate parties to work together. It's incentivization, they call it cryptoeconomics. \n\n&gt;Cant be controlled by large finance institutions? So why would they allow it\n\nFirst they don't really have a choice. It's a little like saying why does the post office allow email. Anyone with an internet connection can access it so from a practical point of view, it's very hard to ban it. \n\nAlso there's still some idea of freedom of choice. If they ban it, it's a bit totalitarian and antithetical to free enterprise. Not to mention this might only make them more popular.\n\nThere's also the fact it's international. Why would Canada ban it when US, China, UK, and others are all using it to their benefit. It's a little like banning the internet, you're just shooting yourself in the foot. \n\nAlso it's important to note that this is just back end infrastructure. It can just as easily be used by banks to transfer funds as you or I. In fact, you might not want to 'hold your own keys' and prefer to leave it in the custody of your bank, whom you have a trusted relationship with. So banks can still add value in other ways, while reducing their own costs. \n\nThe openness is what actually adds value to banks and enterprises. They no longer need to spend money maintaining their own system, and this system can be trusted by everyone so it's much easier to do business across jurisdictions without costly onboarding of new partners. \n\nI highly recommend watching this video from Paul Brody, Head of Innovation at EY. He's a guy who really 'gets it' and it shows you just how useful this technology is to large corporations. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAmNjJRtLGo)\n\nIt's very similar to the internet in the sense it benefits the rural person in developing countries, but also benefits large enterprises.",

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm.   \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges (which costs nothing because they currently do not have any withdraw fees) and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. Currently, there are sign-up bonuses for both companies (Newton $25, ShakePay $30) and I can give you referral codes if you are interested in using them in combination as a means of maximizing efficiency and reducing fees with respect to procuring Bitcoin as I do. Interestingly, for users with existing accounts with both Newton and Shakepay who have never used a referral code, you can still get the bonus money from both companies and unlock the ShakingSats feature of ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin. All you have to do is e-mail their customer service teams and they will manually add the referral codes for you. Time wise, ShakePay usually takes care of this issue within 24 hours due to their notoriously high level of customer service quality while Newton usually takes 2-3 business days. I had my account for months and I was still able to get that manually adjusted for me after e-mailing them. \n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC.U (USD) or QBTC.TO (CAD) in your TFSA. It is certainly expensive in terms of its premium (5%-20%) and management fees (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC because QBTC is a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet to take my Bitcoin off of every exchange that I use (Newton and Shakepay). \n\n4. If you are current in financial news, you would know what happened with the exchange and Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia while GlobalNews published it at 220 million dollars CAD. This is easily verifiable information and a famous story as well as a perfect example about \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\".\n\n5. Unfortunately, with both QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple Crypto's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher).\n\n6. With those two options outlined above, there is no reason why you cannot do both (i.e. truly own actual Bitcoin in a cold storage wallet and own shares of the QBTC fund in a TFSA). Just realize that with the first option of truly owning the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling Bitcoin, buying products/services with Bitcoin, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nCold Storage Wallets for Bitcoin (Part 1)\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. For a lot of retail investors, there is a huge misconception in that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that physical wallet device, it will never be stored on there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave the blockchain.\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage wallet device do? The physical device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" (and it is literally 24 words). From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your private \"keys\" to your assets (Bitcoin) on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to your assets. It does not matter if you lose your physical hardware device and it does not matter if your physical hardware device was destroyed physically. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device itself. So, if you lose your physical hardware device for whatever reason, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your private \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. So, in the rare event that you got physically robbed for your physical device, your Bitcoin are still secure under the assumption that the robber never forced you to give up your private \"keys\". They will simply have a useless physical device without the \"keys\". Then, you can just replace your physical device (with the same manufacturer or a different one) and use your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" during its initial setup to recover your Bitcoin.\n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\nGood luck and let me know if you have any questions!",

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC.U (USD) or QBTC.TO (CAD) in your TFSA. It is certainly expensive in terms of its premium (5%-20%) and management fees (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC because QBTC is a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet.\n\n4.

This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\".\n\n5.

They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple Crypto's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher).\n\n6.

You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

        "body": "It is likely safer, depending on how you hold the bitcoin. For example, I run the bitcoind on a colocated server that I don't use for anything that important, so, it's not 100% hardened down, so, if someone got in, my private key is on that server, so they could steal my bitcoin.  Or if I forgot my password to this server and my hosting company cannot get me in, all I can do is re-image the machine, I lose that bitcoin, it is just gone. AFAIK in Vancouver there was some big bitcoin firm where the owner died and the password was lost so the bitcoin he held for other people is inaccessible.\n\nIf I am invested in QBTC.U then I presume they have pretty good security.\n\nSo it is mostly \"convenience\" but not totally, the problem of having a bitcoin wallet is not actually as simple as it sounds at first glance, e.g. you can have a USB key you put the keys on, those can fail, so you can put it on two, check them at intervals, recopy to new ones, etc. etc. But ultimately you're working against MTBF where for a security, etc. there is essentially zero MTBF on your ownership of the security, tho, if their underlying asset is a bitcoin, they have to solve these problems, but generally the more money you have the better your solution to these problems is, e.g. anyone who could make a profit spending $10,000 a year would be able to create a pretty good redundant bitcoin wallet, but most of us cant spend $10,000 a year doing that, so we would be less secure than someone who could, so they presumably can afford better security than you can if you are only investing a few dollars in bitcoin, not investing a substantial amount and building a redundant wallet.",

Between the limit on buying stocks and hedge funds trading between themselves to drive the price down, and creating a distraction (SLV) to draw attention and fill pockets, this should be throwing off a significantly larger red flag than \"ERMERGERD WSB SAYS GME WORTH $69,420 LOOL\". Who gives a shit, you're completely missing the point here. Short sellers expose themselves to basically unlimited risk. But that risk never actually materializes for them because they can just cheat the system. Meanwhile someone can go buy a stock and lose value because of *their* game OR someone can go short a stock and become insolvent while the *big boys on WallStreet* walk away.\n\nGME isn't an isolated incident. BB, NOK, AMC and a number of others are getting hammered- and have been getting hammered since last Wednesday because the people on the losing side don't want to lose at the game they created for themselves. BB basically experienced a rug pull- it didn't taper off or settle in the 20's... it looks like someone pulled a plug. Look at what happened a month ago (or more) with PLTR and Shitron. Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia... AMD have all been recent targets of this institutional wide short selling.",

Due to their HF structure, they couldn\u2019t get the fuck out. So they spent a metric fuckton of cash shorting the shit outta GME (shorts, not puts of which they have 500k.) That\u2019s because an HF without sleeves in an SMA/UMA account has to follow certain rules for rebalancing and portfolio management. Thanks to COVID causing GME to accelerate their pivot, Melvin lost the momentum war. Read the post that one autist wrote on how Steve Cohen\u2019s favorite play is momentum stall. That\u2019s why MC doesn\u2019t hedge with long/short; they just break momentum and ride the trend down. \n\nNow what happens if they\u2019re picks are replicated across a bunch of hedgies, and everyone is leveraged to the tits? They\u2019re frontrunning retail and making your money back on earnings and momentum plays. Citadel gets some theta, Melvin gets returns, and 30% goes to every institution that bought in. Wash, rinse, repeat. \n\nWell, that\u2019s a fuckin problem now, because in their desperation at the start of the uptrend, they expended a lot of capital shorting. Shorting so much, in fact, that the shares weren\u2019t there. For every underwriter and facilitator of the MSFT/GME deal, they started accruing more shares. Value investors were doing the same. Cohen comes in and destroys available shares. Now what? \n\nWelllll, what if MC\u2019s models combined with Citadels frontrunning allowed a distributed copy cat position. All of Gabe\u2019s picks are actually very solid, *except for the one that\u2019s going to bankrupt the fucking firm*\n\nI have no doubt they have been closing when they can. However, how many time\u2019s did Cohen share these plays with peeps at idea dinners and meetings? Shit, get a big enough bank to underwrite, you could legit sell Melvin Capital\u2019s model and strat with accompanying positions as a type of short aggregate option bundle. \n\nNow everyone in their Skype favorites is leveraged to the tits and each one is in it for way too much fuckin money. Meanwhile, firms with their own clearing houses that are massively pissed off about losing commission trading are accruing shares of the counterparty\u2019s weakest link. \n\nThis shit wasn\u2019t supposed to pop off yet, but here it is, thanks to retail getting the tip from DFV and a bunch of others that took the time to do the one thing that would have saved Gabe Plotkin when he put this portfolio together earlier this year during rebalancing: reading the fucking balance sheet.",

I would love to imagine if they launch a brand new online playstore platform at peak of this Squeeze. It would instantly stabilize the price and build huge expectations.

        "body": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that  Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles (with some duplicates in there).  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... with many of these senior roles sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At an 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel are a recurring revenue stream so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto. \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

        "body": "Note that I'm not an experienced investor, kinda got interested in it because of the whole GME thing. But I am pretty knowledgable in tech, so figured I'd comment.\n\nI think AMD can (note, not *will*, but has the potential to) equal or exceed Nvidia within 5 years. Their rastorization performance is basically on par with Nvidia right now from what I remember, now they just need to figure out ray tracing and a DLSS equivalent (which they are going to add to current gen cards in the future, if they haven't already). If they get those down, then they're a true competitor. The big problem is if the customers will follow them. Nvidia has been so dominant for so long, I think the market will lag behind AMD's performance. Right now that doesn't matter too much, as both have major supply issues. However, more and more major companies using AMD's will definitely bolster them outside of their consumer supply. Nvidia is a bit behind in that aspect from what I can tell. Both AMD and Nividia are in good spots, it's whether or not you believe AMD can make up ground soon.\n\nI think Intel is in a rough spot. AMD is currently beating them in current programs with their CPUs. However, AMD's major advantage is core counts, and most programs aren't yet optimized to make use of all of those cores. When they start to do that, there won't be competition, the gap will increase. I read somewhere that Intel is working on phasing out their 14nm manufacturing, which should help them come back. But combine their losses to AMD with both Apple and Microsoft (allegedly, for the latter) shifting towards in-house ARM chips (who were both large Intel purchasers), and they really need to innovate if they want to get back on track.",

This subreddit likes high risk, high reward investments that act a lot like day trades at times, which can be overly stressful. If you are ok with massive risk but massive potential reward, GME is an option but you need an entry and exit plan.\n\nBut a safer (but boring) option for long-term returns are ETFs or shares in the top companies in the S&amp;P500 usually. Example stocks like MSFT, apple, and amazon are high earners over time, but likely overvalued (though this has been said repeatedly the last several years and they keep going up). For ETFs you can go a mix of VTSAX, VOO, and other funds to get more safety from individual stock drops, but lower potential returns. I'd also suggest getting 4 sectors you believe in long-term for ETFs. I personally have Green energy (ICLN, PBW) and a few ARK funds (ARKG for genomic, ARKK for innovation etf).\n\nI'll see if I can find a post I personally found really useful on r/investor to link here.",
