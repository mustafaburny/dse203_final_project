        "body": "A lot of people are investing in this ETF without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual Bitcoin. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. That is a pretty big risk even though this ETF can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. This is all public knowledge. IMHO, there will be a lot more capital flowing into this ETF from retail investors who have not executed proper due diligence and have FOMO. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company in Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (about 1.75%+) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC or BTCC because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. These products are not insured and same goes with the newly released ETF called BTCC. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients.\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset. They simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset, it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. You need to be prudent in your bookkeeping and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin.\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

Posting here: \n\nI don't see enough people talking about how lawyering up could tip the balance of this game. The only things I've learned as a lawyer are\n\n1. Dishonest people really have a way of shaping up -- at least temporarily -- when lawyers start watching them.\n2. The only people who make more soft-brained YOLO bets in winner-take-all scenarios than WSB are civil litigators.\n\nThe only way to truly scare giant, billion dollar entities like hedge funds into playing by some semblance of rules is to sick litigators on them who are backed with litigations funds financed by other billion dollar entities that want their money.\n\nMy point: there are 8.3 million people (and bots) here. A handful of you I imagine some of you might be itching to be plaintiffs in a case -- if for no other reason than to show all the hedge funds currently laddering, creating synthetic longs, naked shorting, manipulating the market through bots, etc. that someone is watching them. And it if they keep doing it, it will be found out in discovery. I have no clue what the funds/brokers/etc. doing. It could be nothing, or it could be everything. But civil lawyers are incentivized by millions or billions of dollars in damages awards to find out if they sniff out anything wrong that they can actually prove.\n\nThis post gets flagged if I put a bunch of links to firms in this, but assuming this gets upvoted I can actually put together a more coherent and useful list from my actual case research platform.\n\nBig money is not afraid of the SEC. BUT they might be afraid of some civil lawyers who want to make a name for themselves by taking a big broker, hedge fund, et al. down while the world is watching. Think about it: they might even be in the movie based on GME. Someone would do it OR at least crunch the numbers on it.\n\nJust one example:\n\n[https://www.rgrdlaw.com/services-litigation-securities-fraud.html](https://www.rgrdlaw.com/services-litigation-securities-fraud.html) (for example, these dudes recovered 7.2 billion for investors of Enron)\n\nPlaintiff's lawyers generally don't charge: they take a rake of the award they win. So they're incredibly picky about cases to take, but incredibly incentivized to win the ones that they do.\n\nNot all firms are created equal. Big firms can move the needle with their big dollar energy. Small firms don't have any power but might actually be hungry for a fight and might be willing to run directly into a spear if it means the case of their career.\n\nIf this gets any traction, I'll go to my actual case research platform and give a few real recommendations. This is not investment advice. This entire thing was typed by me randomly hitting keys on my keyboard with my fists.\n\nHOLD THE LINE.",

IMO way better plays in disruptive tech out there that actually have a viable product and earnings. I also dont like the fact that you cant safely invest a large amount of money in the coins and hold them without a high risk . Many people have lost hundreds of millions in Bitcoin when they lost access to their private keys through whatever means. It also kind of annoys me that I cant buy a lot of these coins in my brokerage acct. and almost 12 years later there is still not an ETF with a good mix of crypto you can just buy without a premium. I say skip it, who cares if it goes to a million, too much uncertainty and you can find stuff out there that is a lot more likely to keep doubling with lower risk (ex. cannabis oplays, SPCE, JMIA etc.). Theoretically I own some BTC through all my ARK ETFs which have a lot of companies that either own or process crypto transactions, such as SQ and PYPL, ICE etc, that is the safer way to play it. Also safer may be BLOK ETF for indirectly owning crypto without huge risk when it tanks.",

        "body": "Hey Gamestop: how about trying to target the PC players too? \n\nWe're hugely under represented in the retail gaming stores, even though we make up almost half of all gamers according to some sources.\n\nMaybe start selling PC hardware? Prebuilt gaming computers? Steam keys? Your own online PC game store or subscription/streaming service? Your own line of affordable, top quality peripherals?\n\nAs a PC player, there is currently very little reason for me to buy anything from existing retailers, or to go into their stores (unless I'm after merch). I get my hardware from PC stores and my games from Steam and resellers like humble bundle and G2A. \n\nWe're a huge portion of the gaming community that is completely untapped by gaming retailers. If the estimate that about 50% of gamers are on PC is correct, then by adding us to your target demographic, you're potentially increasing your customer base by 100%.\n\nThere are plenty of subscription services for PC players, but they're all lackluster and have a long way to go to be worthwhile. \n\nHow about tapping some of the investment funds you just received to develop THE GO TO SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE FOR PC GAMERS? Think Netflix, but for PC gamers.\n\nGaming subscription/streaming services are young. You have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and create an amazing product, especially with the huge recent injection of money into your company.\n\nAfter the huge amount of chatter around GameStop in the last few weeks, and the stake I have in your company (both moral and financial), I'd definitely support these products and services if you made them available, and I'm sure many of the other apes here feel the same way.",

Take a look at what happened when Dr. Burry, the king of brass balls and short positions, announced his short position in $TSLA.  Dr. Burry lays out a very reasonable and encouraging message to Elon to issue shares and take profits to cement Tesla's existence.  He even used an email from Elon where he himself admits that the stock price is not based in real value.  In response Elon essentially jingled some keys by announcing a massive Bitcoin position.  I'm guessing he has dozens of such distractions ready to go since the entire existing electricity model can be improved by leaps and bounds.  Not to mention you can electrify new things like boats, ships, bikes, boards, flight, etc. Each of these would serve as fuel for the hype train.  Also there was the flame thrower...\n\nTLDR:  It's Dr. Burry's brass balls VS Elon's long shlong.",

People have been researching and developing this technology recently. The biggest issue is that purifiers are extremely costly and can cause more harm than good if they arent installed properly. They want to spend a lot of money on marketing to properly educate people how and where to install it, so I doubt its going to cost 45k$, probably more towards 50-60k$, but that is still a massive difference.\n\nAs for how it will end up performing on the stock market, I doubt the stock will keep rising, but I am fairly certain that it will at the very least spike once it is proven to have any positive results on covid, let alone that a lot of aging purifiers can be replaced with higher end hardware for the same cost.  \n\n\nAs for which ticker belongs to the company providing the new technology, I have no clue exactly, but according to other comments, there is vyst(for cheap play), LLC, trox, carr, jci(carr and jci might already be too late to invest), xiaomi, haier and midea(last three for china market).
