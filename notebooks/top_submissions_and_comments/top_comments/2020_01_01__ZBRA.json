        "body": "so, I didn't even think about XSP, but that's a good point.  But... I'm doing ZEBRAs in SPY and SPX because IV% is very low, 0% when I bought them.\n\nToS is showing XSP's IV% as 13%, but the IV for the 21 Feb book is pretty close to the IV for the SPY 21 Feb book, and the expected move is pretty close to the same.\n\nBear in mind this is all after hours prices so it may be garbage.  I'm looking at how the 50/70 delta zebras set up between SPY and XSP, and they don't setup quite the same because the deltas are different, but it's looking like the XSP zebra will be as cheap as $1440 or so, where the SPY zebra is closer to $1900.\n\nDef gonna look closer at it tomorrow and prolly buy a lot or two in XSP.",

It won't theta decay the way long calls will, and it will return $100 per $1 above 15, just like long stock.  Cheaper than a 13 Call, and more stable in value.",
