        "body": "For myself, I only sell options at a price point that I'm either willing to get out (covered calls), or want to get in (cash puts).\n\nI'll admit the puts are a bit rarer, but I look at both as a way to get some extra $ if I can't think of anything else to jump into at the moment.\n\nOverall, it's a simple process.  Sell your contract at the price point you choose.  I strongly recommend using a limit, like when purchasing stock directly.\n\nOnce you've got a contract, you get the cash, but you shouldn't/can't do anything with your cover shares until the contract expires, the holder assigns it (pays you the strike and you give the stock), or you buy another contract of the same strike and date to replace your obligation.\n\nNow, as time passes by, the price people are paying for a contract may change.  If you sold at $25 but now people are only paying $10, you could buyout yours for a profit of $15 each, minus fees.  You're then free to move your cover to another contract or sell your shares.\n\nAs for getting yourself out of a bag position, they aren't really a fix for that, imo.  The premiums are usually a fraction of the strike levels, unless the stock has been getting a good rise on volume (see KLAC right now for an example).\n\nOverall, calls are best seen as a way to accumulate small gains on your investment without relying on buying/selling the stock, like risky dividends.  Puts are a way to pick which dip you want to buy at, while getting paid if the dip doesn't happen, like risky interest on your free cash.\n\nDon't know how much of this counts as advice, but hopefully what I wrote will spell out the basics for you well enough. \u270c",
