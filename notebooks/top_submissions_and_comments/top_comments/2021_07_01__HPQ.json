        "body": "One reason is that they aren\u2019t static indexes. They are dynamic survivor bias indexes. What does that mean? \n\nIt means they replace losers with winners. Go look at the Dow or S&amp;P components from 1980 and see how the castoffs have fared. \n\nFor the Dow, changes used to be VERY rare. From 1959-1976 there were ZERO changes. \n\nNow? It changes its components several times\na year. \n\nIf it didn\u2019t keep doing this, it wouldn\u2019t \u201cperform\u201d\nNearly as well.\n\nLook at how shitty GE has done over the past three years. They used to be THE corporate bellwether of the US economy. But GE\u2019s plunge didn\u2019t hurt the Dow at all. It was removed as a component in the middle of 2018. \n\nIn March of 2015 the Dow added Apple to replace AT&amp;T (once so big and fearful it had to be busted up by regulators, but is now a dogshit dividend stock). That one change alone did wonders for the Dow average. \n\nIn Sept 2013, Nike, Goldman Sachs, and Visa replaced such dogs as Hewlett-Packard and Alcoa.\n\nIn 2009, Cisco Systems replaced GM.\n\nAnyways, you get the point. The Dow and S&amp;P, by definition, will always go up over time. They will simply drop dog sticks with no future and replace them with up and coming stalwarts. \n\nI\u2019ve often looked, but have never found, a report that would show how the Dow and S&amp;P would have performed if they didn\u2019t modify their components and always stack the decks. \n\nTLDR: the Dow and S&amp;P change the component stocks to always contain far more winners than losers. They will rise over time. They don\u2019t reflect the more broad stock market as a whole, nor do they reflect how the average American family is doing economically. They just reflect a basket of \u201cwinning\u201d stocks.",

Today's HPQ price is the same as was in April 2000.\n\nHPQ made several ill fated acquisitions over the years including Compaq, EDS, and 3Com.  HPQ always bought companies that looked promising on the surface, but consistently failed to deliver on the bottom line.  That pattern of bad decision making remains to this day.  Look how they failed to create two distinctive company names when they spun off HPE.  Both HPQ and HPE are named Hewlett Packard, LOL.  It is staggering how stupid their leadership is.\n\nHPQ is also married to its desktop, laptop, and printing businesses to the exclusion of almost everything else.  These are mature, low profit product lines.  It is not a growth business.  In short, HPQ has been dead money for 20 years and is going nowhere.",

My (old fashioned) go to metrics, MACD and stochastics are telling me that the stock is neither under or over bought or sold.

By accurately estimating the magnitude of the future tidal wave they can calibrate their CETO device to generate a lot more energy from the wave (I still don\u2019t understand how that works)\n\nFor a micro cap penny stock I think their future outlook is actually pretty good. They have a contract to power one of Australia\u2019s largest naval bases, they got a $50 million grant from Microsoft to help develop the CETO tech (and I think they get help from Microsoft\u2019s ML devs too), and I know they have a contract with Hewlett-Packard. They also are debt free I am pretty sure and recently increased their cash reserves. \n\nI just love the fact I own 109k shares for like 200 dollars lol and the whole predicting future tidal waves thing I think is cool as fuck\n\nIf you wanna learn more about them this sub is very tiny but people talk about the company on r/CarnegieCleanEnergy",

It might go up temporarily when schools open in the fall, and in November, in preparing for Christmas, etc.  \n\nMaybe HP's main revenue comes from bulk orders of HP products from corporate businesses / corporate offices, and if they are, that could also be an indicator, as most corporate employees seem to want to work from home now, or not return to work at all. \n\nAnother potential reason, is with the growing adoption of ESG becoming a requirement in all organizations around the world, perhaps HP is struggling with this as well, in how it manufactures it's products, which in turn, is affecting it's value. \n\nPlus, generally and personally, I haven't thought about HP in a few years.",

The sector of semiconductors has a lot of companies but they can all be successful and have huge business due to the size of the market. Semiconductors/microchips whatever you wanna call them are literally in everything we buy now except food/water (hopefully? Lol). \n\n\n\nI'm long Gas/Oil (XOM, COP) and Semiconductors the next couple years. Steel is a great play too, my favorite being CLF or NUE. I know the hype with electric vehicles but there are so many more aspects to oil/gas than cars. Gas/oil is going to be needed in large quantities for a decent amount of time ahead of us.",

Let's look at some examples:\n\n\\- So in this case, Didi's operation got suspended because \"Didi had illegally collected users' personal data.\"\n\n\\- Alibaba got fined because of monopolistic practices.\n\n\\- Ant Group's IPO got slashed because the CCP wanted to regulate Ant Group like an actual bank.\n\nTo be honest, these sound pretty reasonable to me. Facebook was in trouble for collecting data without content too. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal? But now everyone is hot for FB stocks.\n\nMicrosoft has been fined millions by the EU for monopolistic practices as well. But everyone loves Microsoft stocks nonetheless. \n\nAnd as to Ant Group, they are a massive financial service company that can offer customers credit. How come they don't get to be regulated like a bank? My point is that these actions make sense and good regulations is beneficial for investors too in the long run.",

It was the #1 company by marketcap in 2019 and march 2020.\n\nMoreover, It has never fallen out of the top 10 list for more than 20+ years even with failure of Ballmer, tech bubble crash, Nokia, etc. Now with the new ceo, I dont see it going out of the top 10 especially since it is so far ahead from #10 spot which is Alibaba at 600 billion market cap. (Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).\n\nBack in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.\n\nMicrosoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2012",

Tesla sells under 1% all vehicles worldwide but is somehow worth *more than all the other carmakers combined* because lots of people were buying Tesla stock and not because of any financial status of Tesla. dogecoin started LITERALLY as a joke but somehow was more valuable than companies like Ford Motors only because a ton of cash flowed into Dogecoin. this is all sheer insanity by traditional stock valuation guidelines. asset bubbles are nothing new, but Burry believes it's being exacerbated by passive investing. \n\n- Burry believes this situation of prices being based on cash flows is similar to what happened in the housing bubble, when multi-zillion Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) were being priced not by a reasonable estimate of their fair value but by cash-flows. \n\n- when flows reverse and lots of people want out of index funds, it will get ugly because so many stocks are linked/benchmarked to major stock indexes *including lower volume stocks*. consider VTI: the top holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson) might have a billion shares in total and hundreds of millions of dollars trading each day. but the smallest company stocks might have only a few million shares and a few million dollars trading each day. if too many people want to sell all at the same time, it will drive prices down sharply because these stocks are so often sold as a bundle/unit. as Burry puts it: \"The theater keeps getting more crowded, but the exit door is the same as it always was\"\n\n&gt;since the guy predicted 2007-2008 crash.\n\nhe also predicted the dot-com bubble.",

The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD. \n\nA plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and \"5G-cloudification\" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI &amp; tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM &amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China's Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.",

SO derived it\u2019s monopolistic power through acquisitions of rival refineries and distributors; purely horizontal integration, followed by outright price fixing.\n\nAmazon is absolutely massive, but the growth method and diversity of markets they participate in distinguishes them from old trust oriented monopolies. I\u2019m terms of AWS, the majority of growth was organic, and would not have ran afoul of antitrust law back in its hay day, such as when US v. Aluminum Co. of America was prevailing law.\n\nAn attempt to break up Amazon by business segment would probably fail due to the shift since the 70\u2019s from Per Se Antitrust violations to the Rule of Reason. They aren\u2019t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.\n\nOnline shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.\n\nOverall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren\u2019t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",

        "body": "I personally invest heavily in Web3 crypto's and crypto projects that help run and keep these crypto's decentralised. \n\nWhat's a web3 crypto? These aren't to be confused with junk like Bitcoin that thinks it is a store of value or will become the new financial system, web3 crypto is literally creating the next stage in internet where you don't need to worry about your companies information / personal information / classified documents being stored on a server that is owned and managed by other companies. Web3 splits this up between 100's of validators that all talk to each other and keep this decentralised and secure from attacks. \n\nThere's also ones creating the future of finance. No longer do you need to get bent over by huge interest rates and banks fucking people over whenever they feel like it. DEFI is run by liquidity pools, people like you and I who store our money with the service and as a result get a percentage of the interest rates. These rates always remain low and competitive and go to the people rather than the big banks.\n\nThen you have oracles that power the decentralisation. Oracles gain info from many sources and feed it to the protocol to offer decentralised information. For easy laymans terms, if I wanted a weather oracle, it would gather weather data from 1000's weather stations and news outlets, work out the average forecast and feed that to my protocol. This means my protocol is giving the users the most accurate non-biased information. Just as a high-level. \n\nSo how do you make money from this? Well, let's look at Ethereum just as an example. Every single protect that runs on Ethereum has to pay \"gas\" fees on each transaction, this is paid in Ethereum. Ethereum already has 1000's of applications including VISA and MasterCard that constantly have a demand for Ethereum in order to operate and pay these gas fees. You as the investor holds the Ethereum they need and this creates supply and demand. Additionally, each time a company pays their gas fees, the gas is \"burnt\" (meaning Ethereum used to pay for the transaction is burnt) creating deflation. \n\nEthereum is just one project, and not one that I personally even invest in that much, but it's one that I'm sure most people have heard of.   \nIf you want to look at getting some crypto while it's currently on a low and has huge potentially to be the future of a new decentralised internet feel free to use my exchange code. Swyftx is aussie based exchange and you get 20% off fees with my code, plus I get a kick back [https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner](https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessage me if you want to know more",
