I appreciate that the technical reality has little bearing on how high the stock will go, but saying AMZN is a safe place to park your money is kind of like saying IBM is as well because \"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM\".  Like that phrase rested on it's laurels for a long ass time, and AWS' time will come too.\n\nAlmost every new feature they release is delayed, comes out with bugs, the amount of effort they actually ask their customers to put in to developing working solutions that integrate their services together in to something valuable is high.\n\nThe total cost of ownership angle, once you get past the strippers and steaks pitch to your management, is far less compelling than they would like you to believe.  In some cases Amazon will charge you what an FTE salary would be for something that could be accomplished with a pair of $15 servers and still leaves you with half the operations concerns - then tell you gee aren't you glad it's semi-managed? AWS likes to bring up the Dynamo paper as if that's not like Al Bundy's four touchdowns in one game.\n\nAzure, Oracle Cloud or Google Cloud have (Spanner, CosmosDB, and so on) offerings that beat the pants off of RDS.\n\nOn the frontier, AWS' serverless approach is woefully inadequate and only really offsets a portion of the devops overhead and only integrates 'loosely' with a lot of their services.  Okay, I've already typed way more than you care about, but my point is while I would never say short AMZN because who knows how long they'll run for, and with COVID, it will be interesting to see what impact a lack of re:Invent will have once their fans stop getting treated to outlandish parties, I'd be cautious about treating it like some safe haven. They are also notoriously high-stress, high-turnover, and I think that negatively impacts their ability to attract the talent needed to elevate their platform or keep it in league.",

        "body": "I would be more concerned with people eventually catching on that AWS is the General Motors of the cloud and that most of their competitors, even Oracle, have product offerings that run circles around them.  I appreciate that the technical reality has little bearing on how high the stock will go, but saying AMZN is a safe place to park your money is kind of like saying IBM is as well because \"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM\".  Like that phrase rested on it's laurels for a long ass time, and AWS' time will come too.\n\nAlmost every new feature they release is delayed, comes out with bugs, the amount of effort they actually ask their customers to put in to developing working solutions that integrate their services together in to something valuable is high.\n\nThe total cost of ownership angle, once you get past the strippers and steaks pitch to your management, is far less compelling than they would like you to believe.  In some cases Amazon will charge you what an FTE salary would be for something that could be accomplished with a pair of $15 servers and still leaves you with half the operations concerns - then tell you gee aren't you glad it's semi-managed? AWS likes to bring up the Dynamo paper as if that's not like Al Bundy's four touchdowns in one game.\n\nAzure, Oracle Cloud or Google Cloud have (Spanner, CosmosDB, and so on) offerings that beat the pants off of RDS.\n\nOn the frontier, AWS' serverless approach is woefully inadequate and only really offsets a portion of the devops overhead and only integrates 'loosely' with a lot of their services.  Okay, I've already typed way more than you care about, but my point is while I would never say short AMZN because who knows how long they'll run for, and with COVID, it will be interesting to see what impact a lack of re:Invent will have once their fans stop getting treated to outlandish parties, I'd be cautious about treating it like some safe haven. They are also notoriously high-stress, high-turnover, and I think that negatively impacts their ability to attract the talent needed to elevate their platform or keep it in league.",
