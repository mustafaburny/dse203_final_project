Do they have great intellectual property? If so, this is a moat. (Disney, Pepsi)\n\nSwitching Costs- Once in Business with said company, how easy is to replace them? If a company is very difficult to replace their business with, then that is a moat. (Oracle for example)\n\nNetwork Effect- As the business expands, do they create channels where only their business can run through? Are consumers becoming almost forced to use their business because they are so widely accepted? If so, this is a moat.\n\nCost Advantages (Non scale and Scale) - Does the company have access to tech that makes production cheaper or the cheapest available? Is there scale so massive competition can\u2019t move in? Are they able to keep their prices low through other means? If so, this is a moat.\n\nHope this helps!",

This case is important as it will give Unifire a revenue stream for 10 years. If they lose, they still have the GSA and other means but SOE is big!\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/20/former-ceo-atlantic-diving-supply-settles-fraud-allegations-million/\n\n\nCourse Case\nhttps://www.docketalarm.com/cases/Court_Of_Federal_Claims/1--20-cv-00120/QUANTICO_TACTICAL_INC._v._USA/",

That is the reason I subscribe to the news hoping to get some leads in the morning before I head to work and set a limit for auto execution of plays. I can start giving 3 am a shot if it means profits. \n\nThe Oracle is on sale for $9 for a week trial.  Planning on driving to work tomorrow night so I can start trying from Monday. If that proves out to be useful I will probably just stick to that and unsubscribe to news alerts because the oracle is a cheaper option. Right now I don't think I can afford both or even just news alerts by themselves...",

        "body": "I think one question we should ask every year. Is there anything new about the company that changes your view that its a good investment longterm. Back in 2000 Microsoft was riding high but there was tons of bad news and it lagged for next decade or so. Post Balmer company pivoted to a cloud based and again is a huge player.\n\nGE, Cisco did not reinvent themselves, if anything GE went downhill post JW while Cisco was hit hard by white glove manufacturers of their core products and did not innovate fast enough to be relevant. On the other hand Amazon, Apple etc reinvented themselves significantly since 2000 and are the biggest players along with Microsoft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo blindly following even Oracle of Omaha is not a great idea. He avoided most tech firms and invested in oil/energy/banks. Not exactly ideal approach in past 2 decades. Thankfully post Todd Combs and Tedd Weschler coming in, Berkshire has invested in some tech firms and now Apple is the biggest position in Berkshire portfolio.",
