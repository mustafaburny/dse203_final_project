Data centre operators are going to see the power savings with ARM and are going to drop Intel like a hot potato.   Apple's ability to ship the \\*same silicon\\* in iPad, Macbook air, and iMac format, with better performance, and no need for a fan... man, I don't know what else would put them on notice.     The same designs can be wrapped up on a Linux or Windows server already.  I can run an ARM instance at amazon today.  If this trend picks up steam, the server HALF of their business is going to get rekt. And did you notice that Windows is shipping ARM versions? I sure did.\n\nOr we could consider that Intel's leadership completely *blew it* when it comes to the various new semiconductor businesses that were invented in the last 2 decades, namely phones (ceded to Qualcomm and ARM), tablets (same), game consoles (ARM, AMD), cars (blackberry, microsoft), smart TVs (qualcomm).  They have a small IoT hobby business, but I would be real worried about Nvidia in this department, who are iterating fast with Jetson.\n\nI just looked at AMD's 5 year stock price chart compared to my previous favourite chart, Intuit, and holy cow, they have just completely kicked ass.\n\nTrue fact, Intel's 5 year performance is worse than Blackberry's.\n\ntldr; Intel = woof",

It's far more secure and it's even quicker than pulling up an OTP code for sites that support the FIDO protocol directly, such as Coinbase and Gemini. For sites that don't support FIDO and still use OTP (what Authy/Google Auth is), Yubikey can do those too with a Yubico Authenicator app which requires your key to generate the codes.\n\nYubico's site has excellent setup guides and FAQs to get things going. The only downside is the expense, as you want to buy multiple keys to have a backup incase you lose your primary. But, if you've got a decent chunk of money to protect, spending a hundred bucks for a couple Yubikeys is well worth the vastly improved security.\n\nTradFi is so behind crypto on security models, it's insane. For Fidelity, TDA, and my three banks, they *all* only have SMS 2FA as an option, not even OTP. And for my trading platform, ThinkOrSwim, it doesn't have any 2FA at all to login and make trades.

        "body": "Well, in my case I was using Authy, right? I am also heavily involved in crypto, where there is no FDIC, no fraud prevention departments, no auto-blocking of transactions for suspected fraud, no 2-5 day processing time for me to call customer service to get my money back before it moves, etc etc. So, for me, \"being my own bank\" is a real thing, with real money, so 2FA is critical.\n\nAlright, so here's what I was doing with Authy. Authy can be used in place of Google Auth, and I was using it because it is tied to your phone number and provides the ability to do encrypted backups on Twilio's servers. I was always paranoid about what happens if I lose my phone, and I need quick access to my accounts, so that's why I used the backup option in Authy. So I had my main phone, and two backup phones that I always updated Authy in tandem with the primary phone. This way, I had quick access backups should I lose my phone. But there's another threat with Authy, since it's tied to my phone number, theoretically there's a risk of SIM swap attacks where someone steals my phone number and accesses my Authy backups through the phone number. They'd have to know the backup password, of course, but I just didn't like that theortically it's possible.\n\nFrom what I've already described, I felt pretty fucking safe. I have great password practices, so I didn't think it was very likely at all for my Authy to be compromised. And that's why I was lazy and never made the switch for years. But... technically... it *could* be remotely compromised. It's non-zero, no matter how small a chance, it's non-zero. And as someone deep in crypto where there is no protection other than my own OPSEC, that bothered me.\n\nWith the security key, there's no way to remotely get at it. None. You need the actual key, in hand. The natural question is, what if someone wrench attacks me and steals the key physically, which is a real possibility. The key also has a password on it, so they'd need to take my key, and know the PIN to unlock the key to use it. This could happen to me with my phone and Authy's PIN as well, so what's the difference? At this point we're at a very similar state of the Authy risk with the critical difference that *remote* attacks are impossible. After using it, after producing mulitple backup keys and storing them in various places (a safe, a bank box, a trusted relative, etc), I now have complete confidence in my security. That super small non-zero chance of a remote compromise is gone, and I like that it's gone. I feel way better no matter how small the chance was.\n\nEven if I'm drunk and fall for a phishing attack, say by hitting a link to coinbasi.com instead of coinbase and entering my OTP code, and then getting my account emptied by the phisher (which is the story posted to a crypto sub that prompted me to make the swithc) -- even if I derped and fucked up that bad, I'm still safe. No phisher can get my 2FA remotely, no matter how dumb I am, no matter if I got phished.\n\nIt's a small difference, but, for me, with a heavy crypto involvement, it's a big increase in peace of mind. It might not be for everyone, but I operate in an industry with no safeguards except my own diligence. And the key helps remove some of the remaining risk. It's that simple. It's an improvement, and I'll gladly take it.",
