This means your forward leg can increase by more than a further leg bc the market is not pricing in a retrace yet. \n\nLastly, if you want to maximize theta gains and minimize gamma risk, you can sell 30-45 days out. However, this gives you a lot less flexibility if there is a sharp decrease and you want to exit the position.\n\nLastly lastly, if you hold the long leg for a full year, you actually pay capital gains tax on the option rather than taxes as income. Don\u2019t hold on to a losing position to try and maximize tax rates, but it is something to consider if you are pretty close to the year long time frame anyways.",

Those features cost me between $1000-2000. On a tesla, those features come standard. So you could say that 100% of tesla users buy that tech, and less than 100% buy it for honda (If I remember correctly, the base model didnt even have the option when I bought my car).\n\n\nComparing FSD (which is doesnt have a great definition for comparison) to all forms of sensors is not a great comparison. It is really easy to detect the large metal car directly in front of you moving at appoximately the same speed, but it is a huge step to detecting a crosswalk 2 miles ahead or a one way sign for full self-driving.",

It's just a huge portion of SMH which is great and it gets pumped with the rest of the sector but there's definitely sellers out there keeping it in this tight 110-126$ range.\n\n\n\n[Anyhow after pumping to relative highs vs SMH last year it's now come back to relative lows vs SMH. So it should be a good buy vs the sector, or at least it should start to outperform the sector once again for a few weeks/months](https://i.imgur.com/whQ1QP4.png) \n\nMy thinking is the big leaders will consolidate and this laggard that has been consolidating all 2021 after the early pump will go back to it's highs. Maybe it can even grab it's leader seat back for a while and push new highs.\n\nFor some reason the market isn't valuing it with huge multiples unlike the AMDs and NVDAs out there, probably because it doesn't have the same growth prospect.\n\nLooking back a few years ago it's a very stable stock compared to the other semis, it has a beta of just 1 compared to AMD's 2 and NVDA ~1.5 so it's not as volatile as them hence the lesser returns.\n\n\nIf this company was american i'm sure it'd be worth 1T$ by now, just the fact that it's taiwanese means there's less US $ and foreign $ going there than for US companies, also surely the china-taiwan tension isn't helping it",

Even though I only made around 20k a year, beginning of last year, I had roughly 40,000 in my 401k. I was able to turn my 401k into a self directed brokerage account right before Covid hit, February of last year. While not being able to play Options, I got into Gamestop in November because I saw it everywhere on WSB, and I followed /u/deepfuckingvalue GME plays month in and month out along with watching his youtube videos. I put $10,000 into gamestop at a cost basis of $21.75 and rode that rocket to about $300. Made over 120k with that trade, immediately put 60k into VTI and 60k into NVDA. \n\nThe BULK of my NVDA came from very early on though. Back in 2016, I would try to buy 10 shares every two weeks, leaving me with just a few hundred dollars in my checking account at any given time. I lived at home so I had absolutely no expenses. Instead of going out, I just put money into NVDA and VTI. Pre-split, I had only around 700 shares. Once they announced the split, I repositioned my 401k. I was originally 60% VTI 40% NVDA in that, but now I am 80% NVDA and 20% VTI. It's super risky but I am so young that I am 100% okay with taking this risk. This 1.2m from NVDA is very fresh, and it's all in accounts that I can't even touch so in my mind I don't even have the money. These days, I only buy 1 NVDA stock a week due to not making very much money and actually having real expenses now.",

But he wasn't really an agent, although he obviously helped them.  He was a \"journalist\" but his job description was mostly to \"entertain\" American visitors.  These Americans were carefully vetted before being invited to Russia and upon arrival he did things like get them drunk, make Russia look really good, and try to get them in slightly compromised situations.  Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.  That was the majority of KGB \"spy\" operations.\n\nWhen it comes to Evergrand, cui bono? China.  So whether intentionally carrying weight for China or just useful idiots victimized by CCP intel operations, NYT is carrying water for the **CCP who desperately wants to unload assets before the rest of the world catches on**.

Jobs from July on were just revised up by almost \\*700,000\\* jobs. In these earnings reports, there's some mention of inflationary troubles for some companies, but there's also significant news about how companies are starting to bring prices down to move volume, which is expected... inflation, it turns out, likely is actually transitory... just not \"transitory is like a month\" like all of the ADHD newb kids think.  \n\n\nOil's going down. At the port, shipping container backlog is down 25%. There's just a TON of great macroecon data.  \n\n\nFor retail, margins suffering in the short term doesn't result in market insolvency in the long term, and the big drag on the market was V... Visa has a ton of issues, almost none of which have to do with retail or inflation and everything to do with the fact that their business model is being disrupted by BNPL and Visa's starting to lose vendor interest.  \n\n\nIf you actually zoom out the graph, the market's actually still on a very strong upward leaning bullish streak for the month... these Bear theses need major work.",
