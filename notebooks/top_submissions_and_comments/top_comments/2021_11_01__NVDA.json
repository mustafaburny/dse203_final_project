This means your forward leg can increase by more than a further leg bc the market is not pricing in a retrace yet. \n\nLastly, if you want to maximize theta gains and minimize gamma risk, you can sell 30-45 days out.

It's just a huge portion of SMH which is great and it gets pumped with the rest of the sector but there's definitely sellers out there keeping it in this tight 110-126$ range.\n\n\n\n[Anyhow after pumping to relative highs vs SMH last year it's now come back to relative lows vs SMH. So it should be a good buy vs the sector, or at least it should start to outperform the sector once again for a few weeks/months](https://i.imgur.com/whQ1QP4.png) \n\nMy thinking is the big leaders will consolidate and this laggard that has been consolidating all 2021 after the early pump will go back to it's highs. Maybe it can even grab it's leader seat back for a while and push new highs.\n\nFor some reason the market isn't valuing it with huge multiples unlike the AMDs and NVDAs out there, probably because it doesn't have the same growth prospect.\n\nLooking back a few years ago it's a very stable stock compared to the other semis, it has a beta of just 1 compared to AMD's 2 and NVDA ~1.5 so it's not as volatile as them hence the lesser returns.\n\n\nIf this company was american i'm sure it'd be worth 1T$ by now, just the fact that it's taiwanese means there's less US $ and foreign $ going there than for US companies, also surely the china-taiwan tension isn't helping it",

Even though I only made around 20k a year, beginning of last year, I had roughly 40,000 in my 401k. I was able to turn my 401k into a self directed brokerage account right before Covid hit, February of last year. While not being able to play Options, I got into Gamestop in November because I saw it everywhere on WSB, and I followed /u/deepfuckingvalue GME plays month in and month out along with watching his youtube videos. I put $10,000 into gamestop at a cost basis of $21.75 and rode that rocket to about $300. Made over 120k with that trade, immediately put 60k into VTI and 60k into NVDA. \n\nThe BULK of my NVDA came from very early on though. Back in 2016, I would try to buy 10 shares every two weeks, leaving me with just a few hundred dollars in my checking account at any given time. I lived at home so I had absolutely no expenses. Instead of going out, I just put money into NVDA and VTI. Pre-split, I had only around 700 shares. Once they announced the split, I repositioned my 401k. I was originally 60% VTI 40% NVDA in that, but now I am 80% NVDA and 20% VTI. It's super risky but I am so young that I am 100% okay with taking this risk. This 1.2m from NVDA is very fresh, and it's all in accounts that I can't even touch so in my mind I don't even have the money. These days, I only buy 1 NVDA stock a week due to not making very much money and actually having real expenses now.",

I fully agree - after seeing all the gains on this sub from FDs (weeklies) it's kind of hard not to feel like \"F it, I wanna make some money too\" and YOLO your money in - VERY BAD DECISION. It would be hard for me to pay attention at work and school since my mind would just be focused on trying to chase gains and praying that my portfolio wouldn't be red. Then, I eventually lost like $4k in total. It was initially hard to stomach the loss but I had to just accept it as a learning lesson. \n\nI also just wanted to say I fully agree with you on the LEAPS in safe companies. 80% of my portfolio is stocks and 20% LEAPS. LEAPS are great ways to control more of a stock with less money and I make sure to only buy LEAPS on great fundamental companies (NVDA and AMD) but am planning to buy some SPY GOOGL and MSFT LEAPS that you mentioned as well.\n\nI just want to say that I actually sleep better now and my quality of life is MUCH better. I realized I just couldn't handle the stress of 90%+ swings in my portfolio without being glued to it or worrying \"IS IT TIME TO SELL?\" LEAPS and shares remove all of that because they don't really have an \"expiration.\" Shares are unlimited and LEAPS are like 2-3 years out so there's no rush to feel like: THE STOCK HAS TO RALLY 20% in a day, all you have to do is choose companies you have high conviction in and let them naturally make their way up.",
