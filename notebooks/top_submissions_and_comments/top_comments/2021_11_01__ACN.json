Out of the 30 plus standards I went through I don't remember any other examples. \n\nI heard a PwC partner called it buying season back in the early 2000s, because they got Arthur Anderson businesses for practicly nothing. Accenture is valued at $240B and was 35%-40% of AAs business. Crazy to think where Arthur would be now, since all of the accounting firms have added $10s of billions in revenue and 10,000s of employees.",

Companies buy the software and then need to build out a  team or work with deloitte, accenture etc. This is one major area that limits growth.\n\nBut the product is the best in its field. Very easy to automate processes that save very large amount of time/money if you are at least a mediocre developer.",

Riley Securities, Inc.\n\nVELO is being way oversold for a 1/3 warrant-in-units split with a good team. It was already cheap even with the BBQGuys DA, but now that it's been cancelled it's the best buying opportunity. At this point there aren't too many great 1/3 WiU teams in the low .60s.\n\n&gt;Adrian Covey (Global Managing Director of Growth &amp; Strategy, M&amp;A Lead Accenture), Nicolas Brien (Fmr CEO McCann Worldgroup, CFO of FST), Carla Hendra (CEO Ogilvy Consulting), Ramin Amari (CFO Vice Media, FST)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tech, Digital Services and Platforms  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trust: $230,000,000  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Related: FST, FZT  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Underwriter: Citigroup, Canaccord Genuity\n\nLEGA is a 1/4 WiU and traded consistently over 1 for months during the summer and now has stalled out at the bottom of the .70s and got forgotten about.\n\n&gt;Mitchell Green (Founder &amp; GP of Lead Edge), Meg Whitman (Former CEO of HP, Former CEO of eBay, Former CEO of Quibi, and Director of Procter &amp; Gamble)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Software, Internet, Tech  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trust: $300,000,000  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Underwriter: Credit Suisse, J.P.Morgan\n\nAs for post DA warrants, SCVX-WT (Bright Machines) looks like the best opportunity. Strong PIPE (over $200M, including Fidelity and Softbank) means the deal should go through, they've already filed an S-4, and as of yesterday warrants were trading at .79. The company is very interesting, building custom robotic modular assembly \"microfactories.\"",

It's kind of problematic considering that if someone wanted a particular strike in the fourth expiry which isn't too far away btw, they don't have an option. They have to settle for a shorter DTE which may not be the duration they are lookin for. My point is that there is a lack of uniformity when it comes to strike prices.",

This is why they have low PE. \n\nTheir business model has no moat, AWS which hosts many of these small businesses can easily create a product like this and undercut PLTR by offering bundles and integrating with AWS well. You can bet your ass Amazon is looking into it right this moment if there is money to be made. \n\n\nPLTR is a decent company, it\u2019s a glorified tech consulting company that customises its core product per client and sells it to them. They are better than companies like Accenture who take up trash back office work. PLTR takes up data management, AI projects so they have higher margins.
