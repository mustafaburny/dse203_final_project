I wanted to spread some love to PYPL, NFLX, SNPS and PINS. I should have let it run, but oh wellz.\n\nWhat I'd like to do is hopefully have 40% annualized return so I can get $1,000,000 in a 10 year timeline. I'm not interested in going with index funds (I will advise folks who are in their 20s to do that; I'm in my early 40s and my risk appetite is quite high.)\n\nI am think of liquidating everything to keep my double-up and go into the following M1 pies:\n\n**Financial Pie** 25%\n\n**Consumer Cyclical Pie** 25%\n\n**Communication Services Pie** 25%\n\n**Technology Pie** 25%\n\n**\\*** **Financial Pie**\n\nLMND 50%\n\nPYPL 50%\n\n\\* **Consumer Cyclical Pie**\n\nAMZN 50%\n\nTSLA 50%\n\n\\* **Communication Services Pie**\n\nDIS 20%\n\nFVRR 20%\n\nPINS 20%\n\nTWLO 20%\n\nZM 20%\n\n\\* **Technology Pie**\n\nCRWD 17%\n\nHUBS 17%\n\nSHOP 17%\n\nTTD 17%\n\nADSK 16%\n\nOKTA 16%\n\n\\--------\n\nShould I start from scratch with the above?
