        "body": "Except your analysis is fundamentally flawed - BB is valued at a far lower P/S for many many reasons. It hasn't got anywhere near the revenue growth of a company like crowdstrike. BB revenue between FY20 - 21 dropped 10%, Crowdstrike grew 80%, Zscaler grew 46%, PNW 18%, Sailpoint 27%. You're comparing a declining company with booming companies and expecting them to share the same valuation.\n\nNot to mention - you're either unaware, or not mentioning the **actual** competitors to BB. Blackberry's Cylance/UEM is more comparable to VMware, or Cisco. Both of which have P/S of around 5, like BB. Companies like Zscaler and SPT don't really have endpoint management or security software, and Crowdstrike's tech blows BB out of the water. Tbh most UES/M companies tech blows BB out of the water - Microsoft, Symantec, VMware etc. PNW UES isn't the best - but they've got a myriad of fantastic enterprise security products besides that, and they don't trade at multiples like Crowdstrike. Don't just lump all companies at the same valuations because they're in the cybersec space - that shows a serious lack of information about the nuances of the industry.\n\nAnd BB isn't really a serious company when talking about cybersec. This is popular misinformation spread around this sub - when companies are talking seriously about enterprise security, at the top of their minds isn't BB.\n\nAlso it's a plain lie to say BB has a moat on all its products. They're barely a competitor on UEM/S. The only moat is QNX, which is an incredibly low revenue product - literally like 4$ or less per car per year.\n\nSaying Chen takes his compensation primarily in stock is also stupid. Most CEOs take their compensation primarily in stock - it's how boards and shareholders enforce that share price is a priority to CEOs. Chen also has sold millions upon millions of stock - he's clearly not forseeing some huge price increase.",
