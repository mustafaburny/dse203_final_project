Foundry now use 300mm as a standards to process, where as dated before the etch, etc the Si.

Therefor not only silicon is needed I.

        "body": "These are both risky because they have a lot of expectations built in. For example, the price rise that NVDA got out of the ARM acquisition announcement presumes that they intend to behave in a monopolistic way, and can squeeze that market without vendors switching to RISC-V. And that the won't receive any significant regulatory response. Otherwise, the acquisition price makes no financial sense at all, it is just tossing money out the window. \n\nINTC has similar problems. People are bullish because they're building a fab. When they tried to contract out use of their existing fabs in the past, they did very poorly at it; they were greedy, they were unwilling to offer competitive prices. And when people wouldn't pay a premium just to have the honor of being their customer, they discontinued the service instead of lowering prices. And they made a lot of excuses about what had happened.\n\nBasically none of that is going to find its way into either technical or fundamental analysis. That is why I don't touch either of these stocks, and I prefer companies like AMD, AMAT, and even IBM. (What I like about IBM is that the bear case has been very popular, everybody can say something bad about them, and yet they're doing a great job of integrating their AI tools with the cloud and providing quality APIs to developers; and they're doing that while maintaining high margins and large revenue)",

        "body": "&gt;TXN\n\nI love TXN as a company. I do firmware and I use gcc compiler instead of proprietary ones (so I have a consistent toolchain across device vendors) and when I hit a bug in the example code for a T I chip, I posted to their forums and an engineer answered with a fix within 4 hours. And I posted from my personal login and email without disclosing any company information. They're really great. And their example code is all high quality. Very wonderful company.\n\nBut everybody else thinks so too, their stock price is really high... they'll get murdered in a downturn.\n\nI remember when AMD spun theirs fabs off to GFS and people said it was the death of AMD! \ud83e\udd23 But it is hard to know what GFS is worth this early in the filings game.\n\nAMAT is great too, but if not all the anticipated fabs get built they'll get hammered.\n\nON is way up in a couple weeks. I'm hoping they'll come back down. If they do, I'll look for an entry point; though, they're probably undervalued even after the bump, with a P/S under 4. They're sortof a sleeper with the US fabs that will come online, because there will be more board assembly done in the US, and in the US people care about getting the specified part. In China they like substitutions, so almost everything gets generic mosfets and amplifiers. When American Engineers want a good mosfet, ON is one of the shortlist choices. And their prices are good. I normally swing trade, but if I get a good entry on ON I'll probably hold that.",

AMAT also has expertise in equipment to make advanced displays and screens.  It'll only become more and more important as the metaverse is built out.  AMAT is one of the most important companies in the entire country and is a great way to cash in on basically all big tech movements. Own the damn shares for life. It is a fantastic company unlike all of the other speculative crap that makes up 99% of the stuff here.",

So all bad debt now going to that spinoff company\n\nThe real problem is that IBM has a longstanding, very successful managed IT services division. 30 years ago that was high margin, but now it is low margin. And now they're more focused on cloud services. These units are directly competing. And it creates confusion for existing customers. By spinning off the old-school part of the IT consulting services, they clarify things a lot. It can be awkward to negotiate contracts when you're competing with yourself. And the industry has moved strongly to \"hybrid cloud,\" with multi-vendor support, so they can get more money from the managed infrastructure clients in the spinoff, where those clients might choose some other cloud provider. And IBM can stay focused on being a cloud and AI provider.\n\nKyndryl isn't full of debt it is just low-margin and contains a lot of harmful redundancy that may thrive separately.\n\nIBM has been doing major partnerships for almost 100 years, they're not the sort of company that creates a bunch of debt they can't pay and have to stuff in a suitcase. Check their credit rating.\n\nThe Palo Alto deal sounds really good, that could be a big winner for both. The Cisco deal will likely be irrelevant unless Cisco finds a better angle for a 5G play. The Boston Dynamics thing may be pretty good, but it is always hard to tell with BD if it is just going to result in nice videos. The Raytheon thing is good for Raytheon in the short term, and in the very-unlikely event that quantum computing actually impacts computer security in the next 100 years, it will help them both to have a working relationship in place.\n\nIBM has a lot of other stuff going on too. They recently signed a deal to take over Honda's European finance and procurement operations. They've been \"global allies\" with Deloitte for over 20 years are going to offer a new AI-backed anti-fraud service to governments, for example to identify tax fraud.\n\nMost of what they do flies under the radar, but they've got a lot going on, and the extra free cash flow they'll get from spinning off the legacy IT will really help them.",

Many of the highfliers went bankrupt or still didn't reach it's high after 20+ years (Cisco, Intel, Microstrategy, Yahoo). \n\nPrice matters and the company has a P/S of 120. Plug their numbers into a DCF (using their non-Gaap earnings, and assume an annual EPS of $0,12). Using 100% growth the first five years and 50% from year 5-10, a PE of 30 and a target rate of return of 15%, we arrive at a maximum price of $216,24.  The company increased revenue 50% a year tho, so using 50% growth for the 10 years, we arrive at a price of $51,31. \n\nLooking at the FAANG stocks, not a single one could increase revenue 50%+ for a decade. \n\nSo even if everything goes perfectly for Cloudflare and 50% growth for a decade, you loose heavily. If they grow 100% a year (which they don't even do now), you have an upside of less than 8%.",
