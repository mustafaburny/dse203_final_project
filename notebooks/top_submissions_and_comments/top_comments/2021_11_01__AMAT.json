ASML has a monopoly on the EUV but they are limited by the supplier's capacity (you can't make as many as you'd like). This is the same as the TSM problem. One thing to remember, semiconductor is a cyclical business and won't go up forever. When oversupply/stockage happens, it will last for a few quarters. Most of these stocks will pull back. I don't expect them to have any oversupply until possibly at the earliest, late 2022 however. Watch the capex as usually that indicates expansion in the industry.\n\nFyi, I work for process dev. engineer in a fab for 6 years. If my opinion matters to you.",

        "body": "These are both risky because they have a lot of expectations built in. For example, the price rise that NVDA got out of the ARM acquisition announcement presumes that they intend to behave in a monopolistic way, and can squeeze that market without vendors switching to RISC-V. And that the won't receive any significant regulatory response. Otherwise, the acquisition price makes no financial sense at all, it is just tossing money out the window. \n\nINTC has similar problems. People are bullish because they're building a fab. When they tried to contract out use of their existing fabs in the past, they did very poorly at it; they were greedy, they were unwilling to offer competitive prices. And when people wouldn't pay a premium just to have the honor of being their customer, they discontinued the service instead of lowering prices. And they made a lot of excuses about what had happened.\n\nBasically none of that is going to find its way into either technical or fundamental analysis. That is why I don't touch either of these stocks, and I prefer companies like AMD, AMAT, and even IBM. (What I like about IBM is that the bear case has been very popular, everybody can say something bad about them, and yet they're doing a great job of integrating their AI tools with the cloud and providing quality APIs to developers; and they're doing that while maintaining high margins and large revenue)",

        "body": "&gt;TXN\n\nI love TXN as a company. I do firmware and I use gcc compiler instead of proprietary ones (so I have a consistent toolchain across device vendors) and when I hit a bug in the example code for a T I chip, I posted to their forums and an engineer answered with a fix within 4 hours. And I posted from my personal login and email without disclosing any company information. They're really great. And their example code is all high quality. Very wonderful company.\n\nBut everybody else thinks so too, their stock price is really high... they'll get murdered in a downturn.\n\nI remember when AMD spun theirs fabs off to GFS and people said it was the death of AMD! \ud83e\udd23 But it is hard to know what GFS is worth this early in the filings game.\n\nAMAT is great too, but if not all the anticipated fabs get built they'll get hammered.\n\nON is way up in a couple weeks. I'm hoping they'll come back down. If they do, I'll look for an entry point; though, they're probably undervalued even after the bump, with a P/S under 4. They're sortof a sleeper with the US fabs that will come online, because there will be more board assembly done in the US, and in the US people care about getting the specified part. In China they like substitutions, so almost everything gets generic mosfets and amplifiers. When American Engineers want a good mosfet, ON is one of the shortlist choices. And their prices are good. I normally swing trade, but if I get a good entry on ON I'll probably hold that.",

Growth in new continents (S. America and Europe) is barely starting, with India representing massive growth in the long term, and US residential adoption of solar is somewhere around 5%.

The SPY was going up but the tech heavy high growth market was tanking. FSLY released bad news and it caused it's price to tank. NET had a sympathy crash as well, going from $84 to a low of $64 over a matter of days. If you were holding NET and were scared off by this movement due to emotions. FSLY on the other hand didn't recover. This fell because investors lost confidence with their revenue dependence being linked to one customer.\n\nSo in that case, getting out of FSLY if you don't believe in their ability to recover was a good move. But selling out of NET because of a sympathy dump is not a good move and is driven by emotions.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget all those fears of rate hikes in February and March when the 10Y treasury yield curves were spiking over 1.7%. Everyone was saying that inflation was run away, that growth stocks were dead because future money was worth less, etc etc. Well what happened? Good performing stocks still did great. ENPH, DDOG, ZS, NET, TSLA, DASH, AMD, NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, all those stocks are over their February highs. What got clobbered and didn't recover? Stocks that didn't perform (ie. CRSR, PTON, FSLY, FUTU, HOOD, etc).\n\nMost macro factors just move the entire market. Being able to take emotion out of it and discern what is actually due to performance and what is due to macro factors is important.",
