I got no problems with the growth, just the valuation and profit.\n\nSHOP - they increased over 200% since pre-covid and made 50mil op income last quarter. Over 200bn market cap. Again no problem with growth but valuation and profit. \n\nPeople call NVDA overvalued at over 800bn and they 'only' made 3bn last quarter.\n\nWell you'll find many supporters for SE and SHOP which are 1/4 of NVDA's size yet don't make a profit at all, I repeat - almost 200bn company that loses 500mil last quarter.\n\nPYPL growth was just 13% last quarter, for a company above 200bn and over 40PE. With competitors everywhere they turn.\n\nPLTR only grew 35%. You might think 35% is fine, except when you see they've more than doubled since IPO 1 year ago, for a paltry 35% growth. Not to mention they lose bucketloads of cash and their employees are happy to sell you their shares.\n\nSQ barely has any profits as well. Company is worth over 100bn. Revenue growth earlier in the year was inflated by bitcoin revenue (with associated costs just as much as revenue) so really isn't comparable growth. Only 27% growth last quarter.\n\nWhy FB, GOOG and ADBE are the safest picks and highest quality on the list?\n\nMaybe FB and GOOG have anti-trust issues.\n\nBut their financials are A-grade. The best financials relative to PE you can find on the US market.\n\nFB trading at 23PE for a company that grew revenue by 35%. Always buyback shares and virtually zero debt. \n\nGOOG had a staggering 41% growth and 65bn in revenues (HUGE)  and almost 19bn in profits, healthy balance sheet and also buying back shares. All for 28PE.\n\nADBE will announce their results next month. They are on the expensive side too, PE fluctuates in the 50s-60s. But it's one of the few highly profitable software companies that's growing. Their growth was just 22% but INTU results of higher growth has people hoping ADBE will also have higher growth. \n\nMarket probably thinks companies like SE, SHOP, SQ can turn on huge profits after their growth. I don't think it's that easy. GOOG and FB grew while being extremely profitable. TSLA doesn't spend a cent on marketing whereas these current companies need to spend 20%-50% of revenues on marketing.  Disgusting amounts to gain revenue. \n\nPeople are bored of GOOG and FB but they're extremely profitable and at the top for a reason. They grow at 20%+ consistently without having to aggressively spend to achieve it.",

        "body": "One strategy that I've been **experimenting** with, is daytrading and very short swing trading, in gigantic tech megacaps. (GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE, AMD, INTU, FB)\n\nFor example, I would take your $33,014, and I'd buy 100 shares of MSFT for $336.00 (ok, so technically 98 shares). Let it go up to $339.00, then sell it. $300 profit, pre tax. Rinse and repeat. Hopefully do two of these per day, maybe 3 if you get lucky.\n\nNow, there's two major risks with this strategy. You buy a dip, but it keeps dipping. In this case, you just convert from a daytrading/swing trading mindset, to a long-term \"I'm going to hold this stock for 10 years\" mindset. This is why I would only mess with my 7 Golden Tickers (GOOG, MSFT, FB, ADBE, AMD, NVDA &amp; INTU). I'm completely comfortable with bagholding any of those companies for several years. Especially GOOG and MSFT. In fact, I'd be perfectly comfortable having my ENTIRE net worth in GOOG or MSFT. \n\nRight now, half of my NW is in those two, so I've put my $$$ where my pie hole is.\n\nNow, the other worry, besides being stuck in a downtrending stock, is that you sell MSFT for $339, but it doesn't have another intraday dip, allowing you to get back in and repeat the process. Instead, you sell at $339 and it goes to $340, then $341, then $342, then closes the day at $345.\n\nNow what? Do you buy it again the next day anyways, but get less shares? Normally what I do, is look at the Golden 7 again. Usually at least one of the Golden 7 might be on a nice intraday dip. So, you gotta be flexible. If MSFT, GOOG, AMD, NVDA are all hitting ATH's, but ADOBE is down 3 percent for whatever reason, time to hop into ADBE. \n\nNow, what if all of my Golden 7 Tickers are all running away from me? Take the day off and go do something else. Don't look at my portfolio at all. Patience is a mofo virtue.\n\nAlso, you could potentially consider other stocks that happen to be dipping considerably, but the difference with these is that you need to set a tight stop loss, and be willing to cut. But, I've done this before while waiting for one of my Golden 7 to present a nice opportunity.\n\nAlso, the key to this strategy, is to hopefully have a lot of success early on, and make some nice profits, just playing the intraday gyrations of these megacaps. Because, let's say you're in NVDA, but the stock has corrected to the downside, and you're down 3k. If you did well early on with this strategy, maybe you can consider taking a 1.5k loss on it, just to get out of it ahead of schedule. So, you let it rally back to a 1.5k loss from a 3k loss and you jump out, sacrificing some of your earlier gains.\n\nI only do this, if one of my other 7 Golden Tickers happens to be cracking back right at that time, making it almost an irresistible move to make.\n\nYes, this strategy definitely has downsides, but it does mitigate risk quite a bit. I'm never fucking around with shit like DKNG, WISH, CLOV, PLTR and stuff of that ilk. I'm only messing around with the absolute cream of the crop. If the entire market tanks 50 percent, and I'm stuck in Google and Microsoft, gee.... I wonder how I will sleep at night? Like a fricken baby, that's how, lol.\n\nAlso, long-term investors will absolutely HATE a strategy like this, because they know deep down inside that they should probably be doing the same exact thing, but oh my God... the taxes, the taxes. Very comfortable excuse imo.\n\nWe all saw what Amazon did for about a year. It went basically nowhere for a full calendar year. Now imagine instead of holding AMZN for that full calendar year with it doing absolutely nothing, instead you were buying at $3100 and selling it at $3300. Over and over and over and over and over again.\n\nYou just take the money made, and you buy additional shares. Just keep putting the money back in, and getting more shares. All you're concerned with is growing the number shares. Everything else is noise.",

Or are they just selling a product? Cars don't enable people to produce things, it's a product with a function. Unlike macbooks, MS office, semiconductors that are tools for people to create things. If we consider cars tech, then every company becomes a tech company because they all sell a useful product/service. But cars don't help create anything. \n\nORCL, INTC, CRM, ADBE are the companies in the 200-400bn range but probably won't get there. ADBE at 5bn profit, 50bn in 5-10 years is just unlikely. CRM profits are 500mil, unlikely. INTC and ORCL profits are not increasing.\n\nV, MA, PYPL - unlikely profits over 50bn and also not really tech companies. Their products/service don't enable people/businesses to produce things, it helps people do one thing - transfer funds which is what all financial companies do.\n\nAll the other tech companies are so far off the 50bn profit hurdle that it is unlikely they'll meet it in the next 5-10 years, or ever. \n\nMaybe you don't agree with my definition of great or tech but if we have an environment of negative interest rates then market cap will be meaningless as everything would be inflated.

This Fed meeting will include the \"dot plot\". Do some Google searches on \"Fed Dot Plot Interest Rates\" and you'll see that it's often the reaction to the dot plot that really moves the markets. Especially to the downside. \n\nIf you're 100 percent cash, just bide your time till December 17th, and then make a decision on when to jump in. It's going to be a sea of red for probably a few weeks. Think of it similar to the dip in late September, except likely about twice as strong of a dip as that one.\n\nIf you really want BABA then, you could probably buy it for $109 per share, or somewhere in that neighborhood, but why buy that when you can buy Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, INTU, ASML, etc, etc at amazingly low prices comparatively speaking.\n\nWhen everything is on sale, buy the absolute cream of the crop.\n\nAlso, if you really want to buy a Chinese stock.... why BABA?  The CCP dislikes BABA more than any other company. Why invest in their most hated mega corp?  I'd much rather put my money in JD.com or Pinduoduo. Same upside opportunity with less downside risk, because last time I checked, JD.com and Pinduoduo's CEO's haven't been forced into exile.",

        "body": "I have been doing this for 4+ years now. Here are my learnings as I too don't want to be called as I have capital gains.\n\n\\- I first look at the market direction. Some will say best to sell calls when your stock is going down if you want the call to expire OTM and you keep the premium.\n\n\\- I look at the IV of the stock. I have now learned to stay away from stocks with 30%+ IV as the roll to repair is costly. These stocks have a higher chance of being called away as my call will ITM. \n\n\\- I sell 1-2 weeks until expiration and sell a strike that has a 20 Delta. This means in theory that there is an 80% chance the call will expire OTM. Or another way to think about it, is there is a 20% chance my strike will be hit...which I do not want to happen.\n\n\\- If my stock is in an IRA or another tax advantaged account and the call is ITM, I will let my shares be called. There is not capital gains tax to worry about. I can always buy the stock again. And, to repair/roll would cost me money.\n\n\\- I had a costly experience with Adobe end of Oct going into Nov. At the time of trade, ADBE had an IV of 25.3%. I sold a call with 20 Delta and received $330 in premium. My strike was 585. Rather than be assigned, I then rolled/repaired the trade to a 630 strike, this cost me $2,275. I had to roll again to a 670 stike at a cost $1,464. So I lost $3308 due to my rolls. But, I avoided capital gains tax which would have been more and I have the gain in the underlying stock. ADBE is at $687 as I write this.\n\n\\- You can set alerts as the underlying price gets close to strike price and roll before the call is ITM. This will be less costly. Unless earnings is approaching, I roll by selling a OTM call and buy to close the call I have. This will cost me but I do make some premium by selling another OTM call. \n\n\\- One last thing, I avoid earnings. I will sell a call to expire before earnings. Or, wait a day or two post earnings then sell a call.",
