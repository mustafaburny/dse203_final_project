Apple is demonstrating the power of ARM, and is releasing chips to compete with Intel's high end next spring.\n\nWindows will get back into Windows on ARM, and expect that announcement to be a HUGE blow to Intel. nVidia can make ARM chips and will do well.\n\nAMD will leverage Xylinx to get into ARM and will continue to grow in x86. I guarantee they are already working on this, mainly I imagine they want to offer high-end arm compatible graphics chips to Apple. \n\nIntel just gave up and contracted TSM to produce their power efficiency line of chips. The first time they have outsourced their core offering. If they don't have a breakthrough in the next year they are finished, because ARM offerings will take over the consumer market, and they are already taking over the server market. \n\nApple has proven that hardware x86 emulation can serve as a transitionary technology very proficiently.",

Also, red days become your friend: just DCA your position on red days. Sleep like a baby at night.\n\nMy next major position will be INTC. This sub and most of reddit has written them off. But INTC still generates in a month what AMD does in a year. No way INTC doesn't hit $60 before Jan 2023. IV is probably the lowest among the tech stocks.

At any point you can sell for a loss (but still recoup a lot of your original premium).\n\nAnd you have more than one contract, so eventually you're going to be in the green on most of them.\n\nIf you can't profit from this then you're really bad at picking stocks and should stop or pay someone to help you.\n\nTLDR look at every good stock, look at IV, find low IV (this usually means premiums will cost less), find indicator of being oversold, look at the greeks, look for high vega, high delta, low theta, contracts with at least 1 year to expiry, buy as close to ITM as you can, but OTM are cheaper and can reduce risk but also profit greatly from these types of IV spikes and spikes in premium as a result, I prefer OTM because cheaper.\n\nglhf",

I mean it, this company is a complete tar-pit you dumbass fucktards.\n\nLets take inventory of what that dip-shit of a CEO, Bob Swan is sitting on. Intel's core business of semiconductor fabrication is effectively dead. Their competitor TSMC entered in risk production phase for their 5nm process in Q3 2019 [1]. They are entering 3nm risk production in 2021 [2]. Those sorry shit eating cucks at intel have stated their 7nm process maybe delayed until 2023 [3]. 2023? Are fucking serious right now Bob Swan? AND you wont bring a 10nm desktop CPU to market until Q2 2021 while it was already 4 years late?  Your last earnings call was a fucking joke bobby boy. You tried to play it off like it was all under control. So you went begging to TSMC to let you eat the cum from their sloppy anal seconds. They made fun of you bobby. They even admitted that you're not shit and they are \"rescuing\" you and they\"will not place extra effort to handle the CPU giant's orders\" [4]. You're fucking nothing. From \"CPU giant\" to this?\n\nTSM personally has each engineers cock massaged by a Taiwanese fuck-toy every morning before work. TSM has the backing of the American government [7]. Yeah, a TAIWANESE chip fab is being backed and NOT YOU. What the fuck do you offer bobby? A place so toxic to work that you can't even find a space nice enough keep Jim Keller safe [5]? Go fuck yourself. AMD is already on 7nm [4] and Lisa Su is have her raging cock injected with even more erection enhancers AS WE SPEAK YOU FUCKING PISS DRINKER.\n\nKeep buying Intel stock bobby [8]. Buy another 8,000 shares at $50. Your terrible excuse for an earnings call sent the stock all the way down to the $40s immediately loosing you money. And guess what? I bought put options at 11:46 AM today. Right before the dip. I have already broke even. I'm going to make money off of you losing money because you're a complete idiot and I know more about this business than you. It's so fucking obvious how fucked you are swanny. You might as well stop fabbing silicone wafers and fab a silicone butt for you to fuck during the next earnings call as that would be infinitely more valuable than whatever you could possible have prepared. What are you going to do, delay AGAIN? Or maybe you can get another one of your marketing goons to tell everyone on the call how great AMD is [9].\n\nBuy Intel PUTS now and gather round to watch it burn.\n\nINTL 53.5 PUT 10/23\n\nUpdate 10/23/2020 INTL -10% ME +100%:\n\nFuck all you god damn doubters and haters. I doubled my fucking principal with this put. To all of you idiots who mocked me for doing extensive research and analysis and making an aggressive call, FUCK YOU. I'm an actual expert who works in this industry and has payed close attention to this stuff.  You idiots are just some fucking asswads who don't know the first thing about this shit.  I made money while Bob Swan and you asshats lost money. I'm plotting my next move and in my next post, I'm going to come clean about Intel and what all of this was REALLY about. I have positions that I am MUCH certain about and I will show you. Follow me and I will lead you retards to tendy town.\n\nBe on the lookout for my next post.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://www.extremetech.com/computing/289157-tsmc-completes-5nm-node-design-node-in-risk-production\n[2] https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/19/tsmc-3nm-risk-production-in-2021-paves-the-way-to-2020-mass-production\n[3] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-first-10nm-desktop-cpus-land-in-second-half-of-2021\n[4] https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-tsmc-not-long-term/\n[5] https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately\n[6] https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2020/07/intels-chief-engineer-out-amid-manufacturing-crisis.html\n[7] https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/09/taiwan-semiconductor-secures-government-aid-for-us.aspx\n[8] https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hznvk1/intel_ceo_bob_swan_just_bought_8000_shares_at/\n[9] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFHBgb9SY1Y&amp;ab_channel=GamersNexus",

        "body": "If AMD can consistently stay above INTC, I believe they'll be poised to make the market very competitive.\n\nHowever, as it stands there's a possibility their success is a flash in the pan. Intel regained a lot of confidence with their recent AWS deal. In addition, INTC still has a minor edge in single-threading. My money is on INTC at least recovering to most of their former value within the next year. After that, who knows.\n\nI do think Intel will have a major turning point in the next 1-2 decades however. Boomers only know Intel and think of AMD as a cheap knockoff. Once the last of them retire and stop representing the buying power, AMD will be on equal footing in terms of reputation.",

Intel has great sales lines and are still the industry standard but if they can't get competitive with amd they are going to continue losing ground. Apple moving to arm systems is also really scary. Intel is far from dead in the water but I don't like what I see right now, a change of leadership or breakthrough in tech that isn't just keeping pace with amd would make me reconsider. I don't think you will lose money but I think you would make more in nvda or amd",

In addition, some of the better known ETFs out there are focused on AI coupled with robotics (e.g. ARKQ, BOTZ, IRBO, etc.).  I think that focus misses the mark because the future growth of AI is in helping to automate white collar jobs, IMO.  I don't think there's a great answer.\n\nTesla is the darling of the AI crowd right now. I get AI exposure via funds that are invested in the biggest players, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, as well as the manufacturers of deep learning chips; Xilinx, AMD, Qualcomm, NVidia and Intel.",
