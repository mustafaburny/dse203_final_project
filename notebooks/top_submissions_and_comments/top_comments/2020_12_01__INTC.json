Intel. amd ect, financials (B of A , J p mm), do some newer companies too for good premium(chewy or anything else I see MACD inversion on). Indices of course. These all have a max loss of 50-100, which allows for you to manage your risk better. **I use MACD and RSI indicators on 1hr to pick my direction(put vs call) You can use trading view for free for this.** I also take profit/cut losses quickly to protect my basis. Do not be afraid to just take 10-15$ of premium : consistent money is better than losing all your money like an ape. I am not sure how much of this you already know, but I hope it helps!",
