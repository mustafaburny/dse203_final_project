        "body": "For long term investment, time in market generally beats timing the market. ICLN gained $1.45 today, up 6.5% to close at something like $21.45. It could lose all of those gains tomorrow. But if you\u2019re planning to hold for 3-5 years (or longer) and the price goes to, say, $400, do you really think you\u2019ll be kicking yourself about losing out on $1.45? Probably not. Better to jump in now and add a set amount on a monthly basis than miss out on potential gains. \n\nETFs or Stonks? I buy both \u2018non-diversified\u2019 ETFs and pure-play stonks. The former are lower risk but also lower (potential) reward than the latter. I buy the pure play if I know the company, it has a good track record, wide moat, and is currently pushing the field. I go with ETFs to diversify within fields that I think will take off in the future, but where a pure play is a bit too risky or I don\u2019t know much about the field. The more I know about the industry, the more comfortable I am going pure play. \n\nI have about 10-15% of my portfolio on \u201cgreen revolution\u201d stuff like ICLN, QCLN, PBW, and TSLA. I think green energy and EVs are definitely going to be huge, but the big question is when. Batteries are a major hurdle for intermittent solar and wind, efficient and cheap purification/generation for hydrogen. Once those are solved (and batteries probably sooner than H2), this field will skyrocket. We could be in a dotcom-like bubble with these guys right now (is TSLA the next Yahoo?), but maybe not. Who knows. Time in market, diversify. \n\nI have another 10% or so in ARKs. ARKK is well comparatively diversified and pretty much consists of the Crown Jewels of all of the other ARKs. That said, ARKG has provided better returns. I\u2019m a biologist, and biotech is moving at an incredible pace. It\u2019s a much surer thing in the short (2-5yr) term than clean energy. I\u2019ve also bought a number of the stocks in the ARKG portfolio independently. TXG has been skyrocketing recently, and for good reason. They\u2019ve already had a huge impact on the field and show tremendous promise for future gains. They\u2019re basically a household name in my field, which is saying something for a company that went public just over a year ago. CRSP is another promising company. The founder just won the Nobel yesterday (up 16% today on the news), and CRSPR offers the potential to cure diseases, not just treat them. The people at ARK are really doing their research, and I have no problem piggy-backing on \u2018em. \n\nAnother field you might want to consider is semiconductors. AI, gaming, VR, data analysis/mining gaming, fintech, internet-of-things, you name it, the tech is based on computer chips. My bet is a lot of the processing that\u2019s currently done on a device is going to shift to the cloud as software demands begin to outpace hardware capabilities. That means server farms, which are simply massive numbers of GPUs, CPUs, SSDs, memory, etc. Company-wise, AMD, NVDA, TSM, and AMAT are all at the forefront, and their stocks have all killed in the last few months/years. SMH and SOXX are good semiconductor-focused ETFs. I have about 15% of my portfolio here. \n\nI also have some in COVID darling stuff like ZM, MRNA, BNTX that I got in on early and will probably be selling in the 3-6 months. Wouldn\u2019t suggest any of these at this point, especially given your goals here. \n\nThe rest is safer play blue-chip stuff like MSFT, APPL, TMO, ADBE, etc. - these guys all have massive war chests, which means they\u2019ll probably be expanding in the coming downturn, whereas other, more indebted companies will be contracting or going belly up.\n\nThat\u2019s my 10 cents. That\u2019ll be 10 cents...",

(you might have better luck at a casino...) There\u2019s plenty of information out there on selling credit spreads. \n\nIf multi leg strategies seem too complicated, what may benefit you the most right now would be to find companies you believe will do especially well in the future (e.g. AI/chip designers/manufacturers (nvda, intc, qcom, amd, amat, mu), home delivery (Amazon, chewy, Walmart)). After you find what you believe to be a few solid companies, trade shares (buy low, sell high) to get a general feel for each stock\u2019s price movement. This will help you immensely in understanding position sizing and will train you to spot opportunities to open/close options positions. \n\nOnce you\u2019re totally confident on an options strategy I\u2019d only risk at most 5%-10% of your capital. Even with what appears to be a completely winning options strategy, you must be prepared to lose it all. Things will happen in the market that will totally catch you off guard. Limiting your risk exposure is the best way to protect against this, especially during this election time.",

        "body": "For long term investment, time in market generally beats timing the market. ICLN gained $1.45 today, up 6.5% to close at something like $21.45. It could lose all of those gains tomorrow. But if you\u2019re planning to hold for 3-5 years (or longer) and the price goes to, say, $400, do you really think you\u2019ll be kicking yourself about losing out on $1.45? Probably not. Better to jump in now and add a set amount on a monthly basis than miss out on potential gains. \n\nETFs or Stonks? I buy both \u2018non-diversified\u2019 ETFs and pure-play stonks. The former are lower risk but also lower (potential) reward than the latter. I buy the pure play if I know the company, it has a good track record, wide moat, and is currently pushing the field. I go with ETFs to diversify within fields that I think will take off in the future, but where a pure play is a bit too risky or I don\u2019t know much about the field. The more I know about the industry, the more comfortable I am going pure play. \n\nI have about 10-15% of my portfolio on \u201cgreen revolution\u201d stuff like ICLN, QCLN, PBW, and TSLA. I think green energy and EVs are definitely going to be huge, but the big question is when. Batteries are a major hurdle for intermittent solar and wind, efficient and cheap purification/generation for hydrogen. Once those are solved (and batteries probably sooner than H2), this field will skyrocket. We could be in a dotcom-like bubble with these guys right now (is TSLA the next Yahoo?), but maybe not. Who knows. Time in market, diversify. \n\nI have another 10% or so in ARKs. ARKK is well comparatively diversified and pretty much consists of the Crown Jewels of all of the other ARKs. That said, ARKG has provided better returns. I\u2019m a biologist, and biotech is moving at an incredible pace. It\u2019s a much surer thing in the short (2-5yr) term than clean energy. I\u2019ve also bought a number of the stocks in the ARKG portfolio independently. TXG has been skyrocketing recently, and for good reason. They\u2019ve already had a huge impact on the field and show tremendous promise for future gains. They\u2019re basically a household name in my field, which is saying something for a company that went public just over a year ago. CRSP is another promising company. The founder just won the Nobel yesterday (up 16% today on the news), and CRSPR offers the potential to cure diseases, not just treat them. The people at ARK are really doing their research, and I have no problem piggy-backing on \u2018em. \n\nAnother field you might want to consider is semiconductors. AI, gaming, VR, data analysis/mining gaming, fintech, internet-of-things, you name it, the tech is based on computer chips. My bet is a lot of the processing that\u2019s currently done on a device is going to shift to the cloud as software demands begin to outpace hardware capabilities. That means server farms, which are simply massive numbers of GPUs, CPUs, SSDs, memory, etc. Company-wise, AMD, NVDA, TSM, and AMAT are all at the forefront, and their stocks have all killed in the last few months/years. SMH and SOXX are good semiconductor-focused ETFs. I have about 15% of my portfolio here. \n\nI also have some in COVID darling stuff like ZM, MRNA, BNTX that I got in on early and will probably be selling in the 3-6 months. Wouldn\u2019t suggest any of these at this point, especially given your goals here. \n\nThe rest is safer play blue-chip stuff like MSFT, APPL, TMO, ADBE, etc. - these guys all have massive war chests, which means they\u2019ll probably be expanding in the coming downturn, whereas other, more indebted companies will be contracting or going belly up.\n\nThat\u2019s my 10 cents. That\u2019ll be 10 cents...",

(you might have better luck at a casino...) There\u2019s plenty of information out there on selling credit spreads. \n\nIf multi leg strategies seem too complicated, what may benefit you the most right now would be to find companies you believe will do especially well in the future (e.g. AI/chip designers/manufacturers (nvda, intc, qcom, amd, amat, mu), home delivery (Amazon, chewy, Walmart)). After you find what you believe to be a few solid companies, trade shares (buy low, sell high) to get a general feel for each stock\u2019s price movement. This will help you immensely in understanding position sizing and will train you to spot opportunities to open/close options positions. \n\nOnce you\u2019re totally confident on an options strategy I\u2019d only risk at most 5%-10% of your capital. Even with what appears to be a completely winning options strategy, you must be prepared to lose it all. Things will happen in the market that will totally catch you off guard. Limiting your risk exposure is the best way to protect against this, especially during this election time.",

        "body": "Imagine basing this months price action on TA when everything is going to be driven by the news cycles around 2 events. I'm waiting for AMD moon this month because their 2 significant product launches are not sufficiently priced in.\n\nWhy do I say that? Look at any \"investing\" comments section on AMD and all they will talk about is how AMD is overpriced because their P/E is 160 lol or AMD is just another overvalued tech company like Tesla. Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like &gt;2X and &gt;3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that. Last weeks action was all about the 5800X AotS benchmark leaks - without knowing when future leaks are coming I don't see how we can predict any specific movements.\n\nMarch 21 95C, 100Cs",

Don't read this so I can tell you I told you so.  \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44 \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD is hotter then Mugatu right now and with the latest news i'm sure a bunch of you fucks were also wondering what might happen if this buyout occurs. I have studied in the hyperbolic time chamber and return with wisdom of ages. Behold.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD cash on hand for the quarter ending June 30, 2020: $1.775B (1)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nXLNX has a market cap of ~25B (2)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nClearly, AMD does not have anywhere near the amount of cash on hand for the acquisition and will have to resort to doing it with shares. Generally speaking, acquisitions like this seem to add a premium onto the shares to make it compelling for the company being bought out to take their offer. As XLNX has a market cap of 25B, seeing something like 29-30B in shares offered isn't unreasonable.\n&amp;nbsp;\nHere's what looks like will happen if the offering is 30B in shares when AMD is trading @ 90 to make math easy. AMD will issue something like 333,333,333 new shares, you read that right, and exchange them for all of XLNX's shares. As of right now, that's over a quarter of how many shares are currently outstanding. If the market seems certain the buyout will happen, XLNX will fucking moon and trade near 2x what AMD trades at theoretically until the buyout happens as shareholders of XLNX will receive multiples of AMD if i'm not mistaken. Do your own DD.\nSources:  \n\n\n(1) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/cash-on-hand  \n\n(2) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XLNX/xilinx/market-cap\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPS: I'm only posting it in this thread and not it's seperate post so I can be a greedy little fucking gremlin and keep the mad gains to myself whilst simultaneously being able to say \"Technically I told you so\".\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",

TSM manufactures AMD's chips as well as AAPL and many other major chip companies, and they have a solid dividend for investors looking to hold. \n\nRKT: RKT has been pretty cheap and hasn't been rebounding as quickly since the selloff until today, but the future is extremely promising and they're disruptive in the housing loan market by decreasing friction in mortgages through simplified technology. Housing for the next couple years with low fed rates will be promising with millennials looking to make first time home purchases. Looking to see how it does tomorrow and may start a position next week.\n\nZ: Looking to add to the position if there is a pullback next week.
