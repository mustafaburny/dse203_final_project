Do you understand who we are?  \nWe don\u2019t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money.

We come here to YOLO our children\u2019s college funds away just to post memes about it.  \nYour plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam.

Still risky, because you\u2019re trading the news.  I believe in it.  \n\nI think residential solar is inevitable.  To the best of my knowledge, Enphase and Tesla are the only manufacturers of home power storage batteries that can be used with different types of power.  Enphase is respected within the solar community, but is, and this is how it was explained to me: Many current solar users use alternative energy because they want to be \u201coff the grid.\u201d  ENPH doesn\u2019t really market to these buyers beyond some of their niche products that are above my understanding.  ENPH residential services are like a Nest thermostat- you\u2019re able to to control and monitor from your phone, it\u2019s an expensive investment, installers have to do everything, but they have an excellent support network.  They integrate with tons of solar companies as well.\n\nIt\u2019s also a decent company to work for, it\u2019s US-based and occupies that weird area of tech vs. energy.  \n\nAs a stock... kinda volatile.

Examples are ENPH (I got out at 96), PINS (I got out at around 40),  TSLA (most painful one, exited at 350, pre-split, after buying it around 250).\n\nBut on the other hand, there are cases where I wish I had taken profit, and see all of it disappear or get reduced tremendously.\n\nFor example, MGNI. I was up almost 130%, now in two weeks, that has been reduced to just 70%. IQQH, I was up almost 50% at some point, now -9%. \n\nSo probably the best decision is to set some limit. e.g. I take x% out, if it grows to y%. You set the x and y based on how confident you are on the company. For example, for a solid company like APPLE, MSFT, etc, x will be very low, and y will be high, while for a biotech company that is not generating any revenue yet but riding on good expectations/story, you can have x quite high (e.g. take 50% out when the gain is 100%, basically letting just the profit ride...) \n\nIf only I listen to my own advice!",

They recently sold a lot of ENPH stock close to its high, so they had a sudden rush of money that's not related to the core of their business, thus their 2020 Q4 results shouldn't be considered representative. \n\nSolar in general has passed a major milestone in 2019/2020 in which it became cheaper than nuclear power (residential solar) and even natural gas (utility solar). Since solar is likely to get cheaper still due to Swanson's law (similar to Moore's law), the tailwinds are very strongly at the back of all stocks in this sector. \n\nThat said, as  an investor I've noticed that the rise in the price of solar equities like SPWR is correlated to EVs. It wouldn't surprise me if solar is just tagged \"green high growth\" in algorithms along with hydrogen and EVs. Right now a lot of their movement is correlated, even though in my opinion the case for solar is much stronger  in the medium and long term than either hydrogen or EVs. It's not like a Tesla is rapidly becoming cheaper than a Honda, but solar is becoming much cheaper than its fossil fuel competitors. \n\nThe biggest concern is the sensitivity these stocks may have to interest rates.

If you believed in them enough before to throw a significant amount of money into them, what has changed? \n\nThis is the same price at which SK placed a huge investment in them. Walmart continues to be a big parrner. They are still affirming future guidance. Nothing has changed.",

SPWR has a stake in ENPH and its current beat down is a double whammy of two things:\n\n1. SPWR mediocre earnings that don't justify is valuation\n2. Huge rotations out of growth/tech\n\nI think this rotation is honestly excessive. But, if you look back, solar went through this like 5 years ago and only now did it recover to those prices.\n\nI agree that ENPH is the winner in microinverters, and if the green new deal actually goes through I think we'll see a 2x return on ENPH from current prices.",

I have done some extensive backtesting modeling over the years on options - and it shows that option buyers lose, and those that sell options win...\n\nSo I sell covered calls, and cash/margin-protected puts. The key is in the stocks you pick for your fund! Do not get lured into only picking high IV high premium plays - like GME! I am not saying do not have GME as one of your plays - but keep the fund balanced, and only allow a small % for dicey plays like GME or BB - BTW - I have both in my fund but both are less then 2% of fund...\n\nSo I try am keep about 25 stocks in my fund - with no one stock over 87-8% of the fund. I have some dividend stocks, small caps, large caps, and try and have diversification - not too many stocks in the same industry or correlated to one another. Again - for these stocks - you have to like them - belief in them, and willing to own them long term. \n\nI have about 40 call and put contracts going all the time - I just keep spinning that wheel! I always make sure that the $$ value of my call stocks is 3 times higher than my put plays. I manage these \"rentals\" for max ROI. I will buy these contracts back if it increases the ROI % significantly.\n\nThis strategy works well in most markets. I do best when the market slowly goes up or flat over time. This strategy also works if the market goes down - slowly. This strategy does not work with market crashes like a year ago - but then only a short strategy would work for that...\n\nMy fund is solid 7 figures - and I average high returns 25%+, but this strategy would work for almost any size fund. Having a large fund like mine does allow for better diversification?\n\nLooking over the past 4-5 years, my biggest winners have been:\n\nMU, EWY, ZEUS, GM, LUMN, UAL, TPH, MHO, AYX, TAN, TSLA, ENPH, SEDG, JKS, FSLR, etc..\n\nIn this above list I have stopped spinning MU, TSLA, ENPH, SEDG due to their huge rise in price making them a bit overvalued for me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biggest losers:\n\nGPOR, BIIB, MNK, ACB...\n\nSo you can lose by spinning - I was making great option income on GPOR - until they went BK! My mistake with GPOR, MNK, and ACB - I got sucked in by the really juicy premiums...I really did not want to own them long term...\n\nHope this helps;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nESP",

September was one of the worst months...and I always was reminded of the Green Day song, \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\".

        "body": "Lumen Technologies (NYE: LUMN) Expands Fiber Network Across U.S. and Europe\n\nProject uses Corning fiber to create largest ultra-low-loss fiber network in North America, substantially adding to significant fiber network.\n\nAs customer demand for extreme high-capacity, low-latency data transport continues to grow, Lumen Technologies is utilizing its global multi-conduit infrastructure to expand the company\u2019s intercity network by 4.7 million miles of fiber, making it the largest ultra-low-loss fiber network in North America.\n\n\u201cOur newly-built intercity fiber network, created with the latest optical technology, is another example of how our diverse fiber assets differentiate us from other network providers,\u201d said Andrew Dugan, Lumen chief technology officer. \u201cOur multi-conduit infrastructure has a significant amount of capacity for supporting the growing demand for fiber and will allow us to quickly and cost effectively deploy new fiber technology now and in the future. This uniquely positions Lumen to meet the needs of companies seeking highly reliable, low-latency network infrastructure designed to move massive amounts of data.\u201d\n\nThe first phase of this overbuild fiber network, completed in June 2019, connects more than 50 major cities throughout the U.S. and represents another powerful asset in Lumen\u2019s vast global fiber-optic network, which includes a purpose-built long-haul network and dense metro networks designed to stay ahead of the growing data demand. The second phase of this expansion will include areas in Europe and will be completed by early 2021. The expanded infrastructure, using the latest optical innovations from Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW), will enhance performance levels across Lumen\u2019s network, benefiting businesses, government agencies and providers seeking fiber to build their own secure, scalable networks for demanding next-generation applications.\n\nThis project uses Corning\u2019s SMF-28\u00ae ULL fiber and SMF-28\u00ae Ultra fiber in a hybrid Corning\u00ae SST-UltraRibbon\u2122 cable. With a silica core design, SMF-28 ULL fiber offers the lowest loss of any terrestrial-grade optical fiber and will provide the CenturyLink network with a boost in optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) which can extend optical reach at very high data rates. The added capacity will further improve the scalability of the network to meet the high bandwidth demands of emerging technologies and applications such as 5G, augmented reality, high-definition video streaming and the Internet of Things.\n\n\u201cA next-generation network requires next-generation optical infrastructure, and we believe Corning's fiber and cable innovations will enable Lumen and its customers to unlock the opportunities presented by the Internet of Things and other transformative technologies\" said Dr. Bernhard Deutsch, vice president and general manager, Corning Optical Fiber and Cable. \"With the expanded optical reach and capacity provided by our ultra-low-loss fiber, Lumen will magnify the capabilities of their expansive, scalable fiber network.\u201d\n\nLumen was able to quickly and cost effectively complete the first phase of the project using multi-conduit infrastructure already in place. The company is currently selling routes to large enterprise companies and content providers in the U.S. and will work with customers to add additional routes as needed.\n\nKey Facts:\n\nLumen is creating an extensive 4.7-million fiber mile intercity fiber network across the U.S. and parts of Europe.\nThe first phase, comprising 3.5 million fiber miles, was completed in June 2019.An additional 1.2 million fiber miles will be added by early 2021.\nLumen is currently selling fiber routes to large enterprise companies and content providers in the U.S.\nMulti-conduit infrastructure allows Lumen to quickly and economically deploy new fiber technology or    add network capacity as needed.\nThe expanded fiber network utilizes Corning\u2019s SMF-28\u00ae ULL fiber and SMF-28\u00ae Ultra fiber, creating the largest ultra-low-loss fiber network in North America.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n *See Lumen\u2019s expanded intercity network map:  http://filecache.mediaroom.com/mr5mr_century_link/183014/FiberMap_Update0719_FINAL.jpg\n\n *Hear Andrew Dugan explain the benefits of the fiber network expansion: http://origin-qps.onstreammedia.com/origin/multivu_archive/MNR/Century_Link_Dark_Fiber_Andrew_Dugan_Proof_v4.mp4\n\n *Learn more about CenturyLink Dark Fiber:  http://www.centurylink.com/business/networking/dark-fiber.html\n\n *Learn more about Corning\u2019s SMF-28\u00ae ULL fiber and SMF-28\u00ae Ultra fiber: https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/products/communication-networks/products/fiber/smf-28-ull.html\n\nAbout Lumen Technologies \n\nLumen Technologies is the second largest U.S. communications provider to global enterprise customers.
