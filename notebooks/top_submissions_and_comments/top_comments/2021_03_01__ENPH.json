More of a personal stock recommendation if you would like but I would recommend Sony for you to check out, I can send you a DD on them if you would like, but just putting Sony out there. I would also recommend for you to get started that you get some education under your belt, and would highly recommend the following websites etc. Investing.gov has a great getting started page, investopedia has some great education in general, and is like the Wikipedia for investing, and also khan academy playlist on stocks and bonds are super helpful",
