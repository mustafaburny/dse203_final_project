Options have returned 40% overall from trading, and that\u2019s with Leaps and FDs, while my biggest stock purchases were at least 100%+.

Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money.

        "body": "I agree with some of your points and disagree with some others. I'm not sure how to organize it so I'll just vomit them out here. \n\n1. Engineers are cheap. As a data-driven company PLTR spends an order of magnitude more on compute than on engineers. You can send them out to do demos and it doesn't impact the bottom line that much until they start ingesting tons of client data, at which point you are starting to get paid.\n\n2. You're right that SaaS scales extremely well. Pay engineers to develop Tableau, then sell a million licenses. That's what we think tech companies are, and if you're a tech company you should be selling software because it scales forever and a successful piece of software has the best margins imaginable. But the problem is that those are not tech companies - they don't sell technology. They sell software, which they use technology to develop. Palantir *sells technology*. Thiel would argue it's the first real tech company. \n\n3. The business model fits because the product (custom tech) is fundamentally not scalable. Custom data solutions have to be built on a case-by-case basis, there's no way around that. That's why they have adopted the consulting model. It's a business model that works - consulting, CROs, every single law firm, operates like this. Demonstrate value, land a contract and repeat business. \n\n4. The reason the company has not been profitable in 17 years is because we were not ready. Think about 17 years ago, that was 2003. The Seagate Barracuda IV drive just came out with a whopping 60GB of capacity. The hottest new processor is the Pentium M. The cloud is just a thing that blocks the sun and dumps water on you when you've forgotten your umbrella. Advanced data analytics as we know it today requires (a) hardware and (b) algos to run on the hardware, neither of which we had 17 years ago. (Some would argue the algos predate the hardware which is technically true but theoretically not proven). I don't think both pieces existed until 2012, which is when got AlexNet. But more than the actual capability to do the work, Palantir needs  mainstream corporations to embrace data collection on a large scale and recognize that it can drive meaningful business decisions. I would argue that has only started to happen over the last 5 years, largely as a result of Facebook. \n\n5. I think this is a 10B+ company. We know the consulting model scales at least that far, and I expect the demand to exceed capacity for a long time.",

        "body": "- First off, the founder/chairman Bruno Wu founded a company a while back called Sun Seven Stars group. There were a couple scandals that the group was related to that was pretty fishy. It didn't originate from them, but some of the people they were doing business with ended up taking a lot of money from investors.\n\n- Wu also has had no clear vision for Ideanomics. It's been a while that I did research on this so I forget some of the paths they took, but I know at one point IDEX used to be in the oil business (lol?). They would be the middle man of selling oil directly from the supplier to the consumer. It failed miserably, so then they got into fintech/blockchain because it was the next big thing (also failed). Now they're in the EV space because, you guessed it, it's the next big thing.\n\n- Ideanomics has cycled through more leadership than I care to count. I don't mind Alf Poor, but he doesn't get me excited to invest in the company.\n\n- Hindenburg Research put an article out on them back in June/July about a few things I mentioned above, but they also targeted the MEG center (glorified EV expo). They claimed that IDEX mislead shareholders into thinking that IDEX owned this entire facility, when in fact they were given permission to use part of it for selling EVs by the Chinese government. I always take everything Hindenburg says with a grain of salt because they are short sellers and looking to profit off stocks selling, but I already knew this. The way Alf and the company explained MEG to the shareholders did make it seem like they owned the entire building and that it was a full fledged operation. Not true\n\n- Speaking again of Hindenburg and MEG, they sent someone to this expo and had them take pictures and ask around about IDEX. They claimed there was no IDEX presence there in their article. IDEX took a very long time to provide any sort of proof that they actually had presence at the MEG center, and it came in the form of an LED sign outside the building that read \"MEG\". Those were probably the most painful weeks any investor has experienced, and I know they lost a TON of trust with people during this time. Imo this is the biggest point, because once you lose trust with someone, it's over.\n\n- From a financial/actual business perspective, their balance sheet was bad at the start of this year, but I will say they did clean it up a little regarding debt (nothing too impressive). The thing that was keeping their share price so high (and is now) is the China EV market. I will admit, there is amazing potential there, and when Alf laid out the PowerPoints with the potential order numbers, I was impressed. I sat on so many virtual conferences with these guys, and I always liked the outlook. However, when actual numbers came in, they were abysmal. The meat of their backlog is the electric bus orders, but as far as I know, none have been filled even to this day.\n\nThere's a lot more but I'll spare the details. It's fine to play the hype train, but from a long term investing perspective, I will never buy and hold IDEX. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

As for it being a reserve asset, it is the hardest asset known to man. There is a reason BTC was recently added to the balance sheets of Square, MicroStrategy, and numerous hedge funds. \n\nhttps://ir.microstrategy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microstrategy-adopts-bitcoin-primary-treasury-reserve-asset\n\nhttps://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment\n\n&gt;Gold and silver are semiconductors and thus always have some value. \n\nSomething like 20% of golds price is based on utility. The rest is entirely speculative. Its use-case outside of semiconductors is even worse than BTC. It has an unknown supply and is very difficult to transport and transact with. \n\nBitcoin has plenty of intrinsic use. These include borderless transfer without needing to convert to to local currency (cant do this with Western Union), black markets, safe haven from oppressive governments, sending aid to citizens of oppressive governments, ways to bypass import sanctions (see Iran), and more. Just because you don't have intrinsic use for BTC, doesn't mean others don't (see links below). \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html\n\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amid-protests-bitcoin-gives-nigerians-alternative-to-banking-system-2020-10-19\n\nhttps://asiatimes.com/2020/10/iran-to-use-bitcoin-to-fund-imports/\n\n&gt;Anyone can clone Bitcoin and spin up their own Blockchain, and there are hundreds of altcoins that do things better.\n\nOf course they can and they have, thats the beauty of being open source. However, all of those forks continue to die a slow, painful death. This is like saying anyone can create a better social network than Facebook and therefore Facebook has no value. Just like with Facebook,  network effects are real. BTC is trusted and secure and every day it doesn't die it becomes stronger. \n\n&gt;Best case scenario Bitcoin remains a niche currency used by tech enthusiasts and criminals online. Worst case scenario governments ban it due to usage by criminals, and it's valuation tanks due to inability to buy/sell through an exchange.\n\nWrong. Best case scenario is that BTC continues to be added to the balance sheets of large, publicly traded companies and that small nations continue adopting it until it can no longer be ignored all while second layer solutions continue to be improved upon. This is literally already happening. Its not speculative at this point\n\n&gt;You can say \"what about fiat currency it has no intrinsic use\". It's still legally required to be accepted to settle debts, and is required to pay taxes that are mandated by law. So it has statutory support. Also fiat currency generally isn't an investment besides as a hedge.\n\nAgain BTC does have intrinsic use today and those uses will continue to expand. The genie is out of the bottle at this point and adoption is occurring rapidly.",

If the whole market is propped up by dollars that are not real dollars but people accept them as real dollars, then guess what happens if that falls apart.\n\nAgain, Tether likely does some sketchy shit. Its looked down upon by crypto purists as well. That being said, its not nearly as significant as its made out to be.\n\n&gt;yeah I'm calling bullshit that corporations are buying it hand over fist. It's a supply-demand commodity that a bunch of people are bag holding and doing nothing with... As a result the market appears to have limited supply at times, but it's only a few market manipulators and a little bit of momentum. None of that is really a value proposition.\n\nI never said companies are buying it hand over fist (yet).I said large, pubicly traded companies have just begun not only buying it, but adding it to their balance sheets. Square and MicroStrategy are the two biggest examples.\n\nI believe this trend is just getting started. Time will tell.\n\n&gt;chaos hedge? If there's actual chaos, you need internet and electricity for it to even matter. Actual chaos has neither of those things. The rest of what you said is crypto fan fic. Might as well build a bunker and stock it full of guns and canned food.\n\nInteresting, i wasn't aware chaos had to involve a complete and utter shutdown of the electricity grid and/or Internet. Bit hyperbolic dont you think?\n\n&gt;it's still a drop in the bucket compared to 2016. Congrats on Paypal, still latgely irrelevant. It's always about it's price in sweet sweet USD after all.\n\nNo no -- right now is most similar to 2016. It was in 2016 when BTC slowly made its way back to its previous ATH of $1K (from $200). It was 2017 when the fireworks started. Those are coming. Interestingly enough 2016-2018 was almost entirely retail investors. Now that institutions are in the mix? Look out.\n\n&gt;oh Jesus Christ. A) there are other ways to avoid hyper inflation than buying bitcoin.\n\nSuch as?\n\n&gt;B) most of the people in those countries don't own bitcoin and won't.\n\nMost don't, plenty do. Who are you to criticize what actions they take to protect themselves and their families?\n\n&gt;If you actually cared about those people you'd probably try to circulate the currency around instead of pretending that the best thing we can all do for the really poor people in hyperinflation countries is to just buy and hold bitcoin.\n\nHow exactly do you plan to do that? Sending them money via Western Union forces them to withdraw in their home currency. The same home currency that devalues itself by the literal minute.\n\nFurthermore, both Venezuela and Nigeria were seizing aid because...central banking! BTC helps to solve this. Also - how do you know I haven't sent small amounts of BTC as aid to both countries. Many people have - thats why its been so helpful!\n\n&gt;Do it for the poor starving kids.

It's also too early to trying to figure out exactly what bitcoin is or will become (store of value, payment system, monetary unit, method for software applications to validate each other without a central provider, etc).\n\nIt isn't about getting rich and it isn't about a new world order. I find it most useful to think of the bitcoin protocol in the same way we view other protocols (ftp for files, https for secure web, sip for calls, tcp for data assembly, ip for data routing, etc). It's just another layer to the internet, albeit an incredibly powerful layer that I personally believe will eclipse all others aside from tcp/ip &amp; https.\n\nEvery time I hear people trying to prescribe what exactly bitcoin is or will be all I can think about are these quotes:\n\n&gt;\"By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet\u2019s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine\u2019s.\u201d Paul Krugman\n\n&gt;\"This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.\" William Orton, President of Western Union\n\n&gt;\u201cFooling around with alternating current (AC) is just a waste of time. Nobody will use it, ever.\u201d Thomas Edison \n\n&gt;\"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM\n\nThe limited supply and ownership of a digital asset that is secured by a system processing 131,000,000,000,000,000,000 SHA-256 calculations per second on a global scale that has built in governance and economic incentive is powerful. Will it change the world, yes. Will it make everyone who invests rich or poor, who the heck knows :)",

        "body": "&gt; Depends on how you look at it and your stomach for volatility. However, 95% of transactions are in the green compared to the dollar, so yes, it has been a good store of value.\n\nno... that's not what store of value mean.  A bitcoin bought today could easy be worth +/- 50% in 12 months.  Volatility is the opposite of a storing value.\n\nIf i want to save for a downpayment on a house, bitcoin isn't a good choice because its value is volatile.  If i want to get luck7 and be able to afford that house in half the time, but that is gambling not storing value.\n\n&gt;Visa is not more secure. Visa and visa card have been hacked. Bitcoin has never been hacked.\n\nThere have been events where hundreds of millions of bitcoin have been lost. \n\nVisa transactions are reversible.  AFAIK bitcoin is not.  So with visa you have the ability to reverse fraudulent transaction.  That's an added level of security not possible with bitcoin.\n\nOn paper bitcoin is more secure, but we live in the real world.  In the real world the user is usually the weakest point.  Visa takes this into account better the bitcoin.\n\n&gt;Wrong. Services like Western Union or Moneygram are required to send money internationally and take 3-5 days and something like 5% of the transfer value. Furthermore, they require the recipient to cash out in the currency of the country they are in which doesn't help them if they are in a country experiencing hyperinflation, like Venezuela or Argentina.\n\nNot wrong, don't use those services, use better services.  I spend 2 years living in Europe and tbh my wife handled the details but we were getting early the bank rate on our money transfers, and when outside the netherlands, we had a visa card that also gave us near the bank rate with 0 transaction fees.\n\nMaybe i did have to wait a day on larger transfer, but again that is no issue.  I don't need (or even want) 10 of thousand dollars transferred out of my account in an instant.\n\n&gt;The Internet was created in the 1970's. Even years after WWW was created, people were still skeptical of its value. Nascent technologies take time to adopt. Below is a hilarious article about how the internet wont change the world.\n\n&gt; https://www.newsweek.com/clifford-stoll-why-web-wont-be-nirvana-185306\n\nso the article basically predicted the dot com bubble and its ridiculous?  4 years after that crash google came onto the scene.  Your not making money by hold bubble stocks from 1995.\n\nmaybe someone will find a use for blockchain.  Maybe 10 years down the road.  That's not going to make your bitcoin be worth anything.\n\n&gt;Tell that to the large, publicly traded companies adding it to their balance sheets. Or the people in Nigeria receiving aid via bitcoin. Or the people of Venezuela using it to beat inflation. Or the country of Iran for legitimizing its use for imports. Shall I continue?\n\nyes please.  What are any of these things you are talking about?\n\nlarge publicly traded companies are buying up bitcoin?\n\nI'm not so interested in Iraq using it to beat sanctions... that's pretty similar to the criminal enterprise use case that i said exists.  Its not enough to support bitcoins valuation and if regulations/policing ever catch up to bitcoin, then the investment collapses completely.\n\nWith Venezuela, i don't think you want to count on failed states as the backbone of your investments value.\n\n&gt;Lets just look at the last 3 months, shall we? In that time Square, MicroStrategy, and multiple hedge funds have not only invested in BTC but added it to their balance sheets as a reserve asset, Paypal announced it will add support for its use at over 28 million merchants, and Iran has legitimized its use for imports.\n\nthe paypal support in interesting.  but still i don't understand the point.  Why am i going to get paid in dollars, convert my dollars to bitcoin, then buy things online with bitcoin.  I might as well cut out the middle man and use dollars.\n\nI can only see the value spending money in bitcoin if i get paid in bitcoin.  But why would i want to get paid in bitcoin?  Dollars are accepted everywhere and transacting in dollars is easy.  \n\nPeople have been talking about merchants adding support for bitcoin for 5+ years.  And yet, nearly 100% of transactions are still done in dollars (or Euros, or Yaun or whatever).\n\nHedge funds are engaging in speculative investing?  No way.  This tulips must really be worth something.\n\n&gt;If you want to go back further we can.\n\nIt is fun to argue with you guys.  Let pretend its 2017, and you can tell me how steams support for bitcoin is proof that its finally taking off.  I should just copy and paste a chat from back then.  Literally nothing has changed.\n\nYou'll eventually admit that it is not very useful as for transactions.  Then fall back to its usefulness as a store of value.  You talk about how its great because its numbers are fixed, and i'll explains that leads to volatility which (unlike the dollar) is why its not a great store of value.  Then you'll go to the third world, but its still not taken off there, so its just conjecture despite it being 10+ years old.  Then you'll say its useful to move money internationally, but i lived in netherlands for 2 years with 10 other xpats form around the world, they all spent weeks researching how to move 10s of thousands of dollars a month, and bitcoin wasn't a good solution.\n\nThe only use case is crime (and i guess similar things like defeating US sanctions, maybe there is also a use case in north korea, i'm not interested in that investment).\n\nMaybe i'm wrong, tell me when you bough bitcoin for a purpose other then selling it for a profit.  You buy bitcoin because you want to turn 1 USD into 2 USD.   You don't want the bitcoin you want the dollars.  for christ sakes we measure the value of bitcoin in dollars!",

These include borderless transfer without needing to convert to to local currency (cant do this with Western Union), black markets, safe haven from oppressive governments, sending aid to citizens of oppressive governments, ways to bypass import sanctions (see Iran), and more. Just because you don't have intrinsic use for BTC, doesn't mean others don't (see link below).\n\nYou can do this with Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Vertcoin, even Dogecoin. I agree cryptocurrency and blockchains are useful but I don't see Bitcoin as a long term store of value. It's far more volatile than precious metals and also intangible.\n\nIBM is making huge strides towards quantum computing, and once they pull it off, Bitcoin will become worthless once the public/private key cryptography is cracked and anyone with access to a quantum computer can simply sign transactions to send coins to themselves. We're easily within 10 years at this point, possibly less.\n\n&gt;This is like saying anyone can create a better social network than Facebook and therefore Facebook has no value\n\nWhat about Myspace? It came first.\n\n&gt;Wrong. Best case scenario is that BTC continues to be added to the balance sheets of large, publicly traded companies\n\nLike 1 or 2 companies that hold it as a tiny position. I think Overstock and Square? Most companies that accept it just use Bitpay or Coinbase to instantly sell it.",

        "body": "Copy and pasted from another comment, TL;DR I'm staying away:\n\n- First off, the founder/chairman Bruno Wu founded a company a while back called Sun Seven Stars group. There were a couple scandals that the group was related to that was pretty fishy. It didn't originate from them, but some of the people they were doing business with ended up taking a lot of money from investors.\n\n- Wu also has had no clear vision for Ideanomics. It's been a while that I did research on this so I forget some of the paths they took, but I know at one point IDEX used to be in the oil business (lol?). They would be the middle man of selling oil directly from the supplier to the consumer. It failed miserably, so then they got into fintech/blockchain because it was the next big thing (also failed). Now they're in the EV space because, you guessed it, it's the next big thing.\n\n- Ideanomics has cycled through more leadership than I care to count. I don't mind Alf Poor, but he doesn't get me excited to invest in the company.\n\n- Hindenburg Research put an article out on them back in June/July about a few things I mentioned above, but they also targeted the MEG center (glorified EV expo). They claimed that IDEX mislead shareholders into thinking that IDEX owned this entire facility, when in fact they were given permission to use part of it for selling EVs by the Chinese government. I always take everything Hindenburg says with a grain of salt because they are short sellers and looking to profit off stocks selling, but I already knew this. The way Alf and the company explained MEG to the shareholders did make it seem like they owned the entire building and that it was a full fledged operation. Not true\n\n- Speaking again of Hindenburg and MEG, they sent someone to this expo and had them take pictures and ask around about IDEX. They claimed there was no IDEX presence there in their article. IDEX took a very long time to provide any sort of proof that they actually had presence at the MEG center, and it came in the form of an LED sign outside the building that read \"MEG\". Those were probably the most painful weeks any investor has experienced, and I know they lost a TON of trust with people during this time. Imo this is the biggest point, because once you lose trust with someone, it's over.\n\n- From a financial/actual business perspective, their balance sheet was bad at the start of this year, but I will say they did clean it up a little regarding debt (nothing too impressive). The thing that was keeping their share price so high (and is now) is the China EV market. I will admit, there is amazing potential there, and when Alf laid out the PowerPoints with the potential order numbers, I was impressed. I sat on so many virtual conferences with these guys, and I always liked the outlook. However, when actual numbers came in, they were abysmal. The meat of their backlog is the electric bus orders, but as far as I know, none have been filled even to this day.\n\nThere's a lot more but I'll spare the details. It's fine to play the hype train, but from a long term investing perspective, I will never buy and hold IDEX. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",
