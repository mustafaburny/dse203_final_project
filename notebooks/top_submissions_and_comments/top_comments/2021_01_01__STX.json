People in the company also don't seem to like him much but maybe it's just people who are sour about something else. Also, Seagate CEO last summer (when Huawei bans happened) was like, yea we are selling all we can to China, HDDs are not on the list of banned technologies. Meanwhile WDC CEO was like, yea maybe we will sell  some if US Gov allows us but we will have to see. Did not inspire confidence in him.",
