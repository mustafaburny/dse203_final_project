An expanded product line of shiny computers and reality TV-show streaming aren't something to be counted on for unlimited upward stock movements nor is it something to celebrate as the dazibao of 21st century progress.",

        "body": "Intel is a mammoth company. CPU is a big but not the only part of their business. Intel enjoys a special relationship with Microsoft for many years. Currently their CPU business unit is having problems. I suspect it's something similar to Microsoft when Ballmer was CEO. But I believe it's a temporary setback which Intel will overcome. Intel still has over 70% of CPU market share. Currently it's highly undervalued and trading at very low P/E ratio.\nAMD on other hand is growing very fast, however expectations are much higher than growth rate. AMD is currently extremely overvalued and share price has priced in high growth for the next 2-3 years. CPU and GPU are 2 main revenue sources of AMD, however in GPU, Nvidia is always one step ahead and any advances in GPU quickly disappear. Current CPU architecture is better compared to Intel, so there are high hopes for AMD to take market share from Intel. However, history of AMD shows that such outperformance is only temporary and Intel will come back with better designs.\nLong term I'd invest in Intel, however with a couple months horizon, AMD can bring a good profit.",

        "body": "This is a post from u/Mintykanesh a couple days ago about AMD. Should give you an idea of what they've been up to\n\n&gt;TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both.",

        "body": "I'll get downvoted but w/e\n\nLet's take AMZN for example. Everyone knows the price is forward looking. Right now they have 21 billion in FCF. Let's be generous and say tech *should* trade at 30x FCF. AAPL, for instance, trades at 27x FCF. WMT (which is MUCH more tech than people give credit to), who has more infrastructure in place than AMZN for single/same day deliveries is trading at 24.5x FCF.\n\nI digress. AMZN is trading at 76x FCF. They operate on liquid thin margins if you're not including AWS which its market share/profit margins are being competitively eaten up by GOOGL, MSFT, etc. Anyway, even INCLUDING AWS, to get twice the FCF is going to be insanely hard. When a company is that large, growth is so, so much harder to achieve. Also keep in mind that it would have to maintain its market cap.\n\nMy point being that AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, etc kind of companies are so forward looking that it will be impossible for them to \"catch up\" to their current evaluations. Eventually, either they'll lose market cap or grow FCF (probably a mixture of both). Please don't talk about growth potential either (what do you think forward looking means?)\n\nI know the meme here is stocks only go up, which right now is true, but over time a company's goal is to make money and eventually hype will die down and investors will put money into more profitable/sustainable businesses. I'm not taking about value investing, either. It's never *not* happened given an extended period of time. And sure, we could have hyper asset inflation that is so far \"unknown\" making these PE ratios and FCF x's actually acceptable, but that wouldn't explain other companies being \"unfairly\" valued.\n\nAnyway, my other point being is *some* of tech is in a bubble that *will* be popped. everyone knows this but no one knows when it will happen.",

Also tsmc already has their plate full of AMD apple and others, it doesn't even look like Nvidia is going to be able to get their next generation GPUs from them and they might have to go to Samsung. Also it takes a lot of time and work to switch to a completely new fab, time others will spend innovating and they are already behind even before that. This doesn't read like a solid cost cutting move from Intel but instead it's them giving up all their cards to have anything at all to release next year until they can get 10nm extreme ultraviolet lithography to work for them. They cannot stay competitive with their current fab for products next year so they are desperate, I don't see how anyone can read this as them about to release something game changing\n\nThat being said we can't rule out Trump not knowing China and Taiwan are different and banning both of them. Also if/when Intel ever modernize its fabrication they will absolutely destroy everyone else, so maybe we should buy the dip but there is nothing good coming in at least a year",

Amd is having their gpu tech and cpu tech in the ps5 and their new thread ripper pro lineup makes it impossible to resist the opportunity. Not to mention that they have a brilliant new CEO and are dominating intel in the cpu game and nvidia in the gpu game as far as price to performance is concerned. You can trust my word, I am a day trader and investor. Also this is kind of a risky investment because if you look at AMDs past you can see that every time they seem like they are doing good their stock price crashes because intel launches a new insane chip.

Lots of stores do online shopping and delivery these days.  [Jet.com](https://Jet.com) was a thing.\n\nOracle, Azure, Google all have AWS competitors.\n\nNFLX, Disney+, et al for video streaming.\n\nAmazon isn't getting big via acquisitions of its competitors, either.  There's no antitrust discussion like there would be if ATT tried to buy Verizon, for example.\n\nI think AMZN is safe from any kind of antitrust lawsuit.

        "body": "I would be more concerned with people eventually catching on that AWS is the General Motors of the cloud and that most of their competitors, even Oracle, have product offerings that run circles around them.  I appreciate that the technical reality has little bearing on how high the stock will go, but saying AMZN is a safe place to park your money is kind of like saying IBM is as well because \"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM\".  Like that phrase rested on it's laurels for a long ass time, and AWS' time will come too.\n\nAlmost every new feature they release is delayed, comes out with bugs, the amount of effort they actually ask their customers to put in to developing working solutions that integrate their services together in to something valuable is high.\n\nThe total cost of ownership angle, once you get past the strippers and steaks pitch to your management, is far less compelling than they would like you to believe.  In some cases Amazon will charge you what an FTE salary would be for something that could be accomplished with a pair of $15 servers and still leaves you with half the operations concerns - then tell you gee aren't you glad it's semi-managed? AWS likes to bring up the Dynamo paper as if that's not like Al Bundy's four touchdowns in one game.\n\nAzure, Oracle Cloud or Google Cloud have (Spanner, CosmosDB, and so on) offerings that beat the pants off of RDS.\n\nOn the frontier, AWS' serverless approach is woefully inadequate and only really offsets a portion of the devops overhead and only integrates 'loosely' with a lot of their services.  Okay, I've already typed way more than you care about, but my point is while I would never say short AMZN because who knows how long they'll run for, and with COVID, it will be interesting to see what impact a lack of re:Invent will have once their fans stop getting treated to outlandish parties, I'd be cautious about treating it like some safe haven. They are also notoriously high-stress, high-turnover, and I think that negatively impacts their ability to attract the talent needed to elevate their platform or keep it in league.",

        "body": "I use Merrill Lynch.  They're good for passive investors who want to set it and forget it.  Since I've become more active they are less useful.  ML provides a fair starting point, but I need to use several other resources to get the big picture that I'm looking for.  I'm especially disappointed in their lack of tracking with dividend suspensions.  I use Finviz for dividend info.  ML has amazing customer service though.  I called to ask about some of their paid services and they talked me out of it.  What company talks people out of giving them more money?  The kind that cares more about quality customer service than a few bucks.  \n\nWhat I like about Snowflake:\n- I'm still learning about Cloud Computing and Data Warehousing, but they seem to be doing a good job and be in a competitive position in this area.  From what I can tell, they call their customers partners.  Partners include AWS, MS Azure, Google Cloud, Salesforce, and more.  I could be wrong about the partner vs customer terms, but I do know that they really work with this companies to some capacity.  I didn't see a customer count on their website, but I saw an article that says Snowflake has over 3,500 customers that include Netflix, Yamaha, Lululemon, and some universities.\n- Their website is clean and easy to navigate.  They offer free demos, 30 day free trials, and training labs.  Starting up with them is supposed to be as easy as filling out a single form.  They charge by usage, not subscription.  Supposedly this is the same model Twilio uses.  All of these things are good for customers.\n- Website also acknowledges that sometimes partners can also be competitors and has a Standards of Conduct Guide that tries to address it.  They also post their Code of Conduct.  Both documents say things in a general, common sense way.  But I appreciate that they publicly address it and have a baseline.\n- The platform they use is theirs, as in they built it.  I like that they own their product.\n- $100M revenue in 2019 - 174% increase (from various articles)\n- Valuation in Feb 2020 was $12.8B (from various articles)\n- Founders come from Oracle, IBM and Alphabet.  \n- Current CEO, Frank Slootman, has a good track record.  Was previously the CEO of ServiceNow.  Took them from $100M revenue to $1.4B revenue (refer back to Snowflake's 2019 revenue for significance).  CEO also ran Data Domain and sold that for $2.4B.  \n- I've seen a variety of good customer comments and reviews across different sources.  Customers don't really seem to express negativity, it's more that there is an option or function that they want and isn't currently available.  Everyone seems to be happy with the service that is provided.\n- Employees on Glassdoor seem to believe in the product.  Complaints are either sales members who are struggling or people who aren't comfortable in competitive and fast growing company.  Regarding sales - there are also good reviews from that department who say it's a good company that needs minor improvements.  I don't have a Glassdoor subscription so I could only see what was free to access, but their overall rating is 4 stars.\n\nOverall they just seem like a good company with a good product.",
