I was a fresh new fish swimming in a tide that was much too strong. \n\nExactly one year later I decided to play CRM ER again. Huge beat sky and skyrocketed. The day after that? The infamous Trump Tweet day where he warned all american companies to find alternative supply chains to China and consider bringing their operations to America. The market dipped very hard and CRM was a casualty. \n\nI have been keeping tabs on CRM as I always use their products for work and like to see how it does. Not kidding, for the past two years (8 ERS) the day after CRM ER is a big red day for the market. \n\nThis is my DD. Tomorrow is going to be rough.",

As someone who has worked in enterprise technology, SalesForce is the backbone for a ton of major large corporations undergoing billion dollar digital transformation initiatives and even on a smaller scale, salesforce is gaining with small sized businesses as well. Not going away anytime soon.\n\n**SQ** I wish I would have gotten more on Square during the decline in March. Its up 200% since and has no signs of stopping. The most promising thing is Cash app user growth, if you've never tried the app, check it out. They're creating an entire digital ecosystem that is more like an easy to use bank. Outside of that, they are heavy into ecommerce and allowing businesses to create online prescence like Shopify on top of their flagship product of processing transactions. Tons of opportunity here.\n\n**FB** As much as I'm not a big fan of the platform itself, there's no denying this powerhouse. They've created the most advanced ad platform in the entire world that is pumping cash flow. More and more people are learning about online advertising and how to use FB ads effectively, and with everything FB owns, they're going to be able to pull a lot of levers for growth on revenue.",

        "body": "Daily Market and Options Summary for Aug-25-2020\n\n**Context -**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (+0.4%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) rose to record highs today. The market found continued support in the mega-caps following a disappointing consumer confidence report. \n\nConference Board's Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 84.8 in August (consensus 93.0) from 91.7 in July for its lowest reading since May 2014.\n\nPresumably, there were some concerns that the decline in consumer confidence would translate to less consumer spending, absent another round of fiscal stimulus. In addition, the report overshadowed new home sales showing a marked increase of 13.9% m/m in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000 (consensus 787,000).\n\nAmazon (AMZN 3346.49, +39.03, +1.2%), Facebook (FB 280.82, +9.43, +3.5%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1608.22, +20.02, +1.3%), which have performed well throughout the pandemic, posted strong gains after a slow start. Apple (AAPL 499.30, -4.13, -0.8%) was a notable exception. \n\nIn key stock news, Salesforce (CRM 216.05, +7.59, +3.6%), Amgen (AMGN 248.22, +12.65, +5.4%), and Honeywell (HON 164.53, +5.16, +3.2%) will replace Exxon Mobil (XOM 40.89, -1.33, -3.2%), Pfizer (PFE 38.41, -0.43, -1.1%), and Raytheon Technologies (RTX 60.95, -0.93, -1.5%) in the Dow 30 average prior to the open on Aug. 31.\n\nThe change was enacted to account for Apple's 4:1 stock split, as its lower price would reduce the price-weighted Dow's exposure to the technology sector.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 93.01. WTI crude futures rose 1.7%, or $0.72, to $43.33/bbl.\n\nInvestors will receive Durable Goods Orders for July and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.\n\n**Index Summary -**\n\nS&amp;P 500 +0.35%; Nasdaq +0.79%;\n\nDOW -0.2%; Russell 2000 +0.11% \n\nVIX:  22.03 -0.34,( -1.52%)\n\n**Sector Summary -**\n\n*The three highest sectors for today were :*\n\n Communication Services +0.94%;  Health Care +0.68%;  Information Technology +0.5%;\n\n*The three lowest sectors for today were :*\n\n Energy  -1.41%;  Utilities  -0.95%;  Materials  -0.4%;\n\n**Commodities -**\n\nGold -  1933.1,(  -0.31%);  Crude -  42.79,( +0.4%) \n\n*Today\u2019s Option Activity Fast Facts -*\n\n **CBOE Put/Call Ratio -**  0.42\n\n ***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** TOL with 15 x the ADV of 4294. There were 49685 calls and 16270 puts.\n\n ***Ticker with Most Contracts -*** NIO with 1334235 contracts traded today with an AVD of 276108. There were 1108911 calls and 225324 puts.\n\n ***Largest Put / Call Ratio -*** JETS with a 6.25 P/C ratio. There were 62811 puts and 10043 calls.\n\n ***Largest Call / Put Ratio -*** EGO with a 67.33 C/P ratio. There were 13331 calls and 198 puts. \n\n *\\*Stocks must be &gt;$6, Highest Multiple must have &gt;1k ADV, Largest ratios must have an option volume &gt;10k*",
