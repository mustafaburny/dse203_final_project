Learned the difference between a hyped up pump-and-dump and a legitimate company, and shifted my focus to more established companies, mainly in tech.\n\nSince then I've followed a strategy similar to what the OP has done, buying stocks whose success is evident in my daily life and companies that demonstrate obvious value to their clients: I work as an IT consultant, so when I see that all my clients are using Paypal, building ecommerce sites with Shopify, and hooking up the CRMs with Salesforce, I research these companies and look for investment opportunities.\n\n1. Stick with what you know\n\n2. Trust your instinct\n\n3. Buy for long term",
