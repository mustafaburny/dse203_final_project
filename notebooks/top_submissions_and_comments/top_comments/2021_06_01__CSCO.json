They are solid systems that run soft codecs on either a NUC or dedicated user PC. They utilize far-end content sharing, a proprietary camera with voice tracking and mic/speaker system. The price point is attractive compared to similar solutions from Cisco or Vaddio, so I believe their market share will continue to grow in this space. \n\nThis will be their main source of innovation moving forward and a substantial percent of their business in 5 years. I do not believe it is an apples to apples comparison. \n\nOtherwise great DD. In for five 9/16/2022 45C.",

We had Intel, Intel, Dell, and Microsoft providing computers.  We had AOL providing network access and internet content for $25 a month.  One thing we didn't have was a large stock quite as overpriced as Tesla.  Tesla is a $50-$100 company trading at $600.  Cisco only had a PE of 110, not 600 like Tesla.  Companies were laying fiber in the ground like there was no tomorrow (which was sort of true). We had [pets.com](https://pets.com) instead of Chewy.  We had webvan instead of Instacart.   Ariba did b2b.    \n\n\nThe only thing that was different is rates haven't started going up yet.  If that inflation gets bad or sticks around a while forcing the Fed to raise rates, tech stocks will absolutely tank.  Nvidia doesn't get to keep an 80 PE when rates and inflation are at 4%.  It drops by 75%.  Intel was an amazing company in 2000 and it still makes loads of money, yet it still hasn't hit its 2000 high.  Back to Tesla -- I believe it will never see the $900 stock price again.  Ever.",

There's no way to seriously value any Coins, so I personally wouldn't touch Crypto at all, but if you seriously want to get into Crypto I'd advise you to NOT put 40% of your money into Crypto lol.  \n\n2. PLTR and TSLA are great companies but not great investments in my opinion. Especially Teslas valuation, even after falling about 30% YTD, is way too high. I seriously wouldn't even buy Tesla at $50. They're not only diluting the hell out of you but the \"projections\" (read: phantasies) are in no way shape or form realistic to justify their current price. If you seriously want to buy Tesla at a Market Cap of 650 Billion Dollars you should go to a psychiatrist first because this thing won't end well. People always laugh at you for not owning X stock. It was Cisco in the year 2000 when the Dotcom bubble burst. They'll laugh at you for not owning it, but they'll get very quiet the second all their phantasies turn out to be unrealistic which makes the stock crash. You might miss the hype but you'll also miss the crash. Generally I would advise you to not touch any EV or Renewable Energy stocks at the moment because almost all of them are horrifically overvalued, for obvious reasons (just like in the dotcom bubble).  \n\n3. It's great how you think Real Estate is overvalued but don't think that most stocks are in the same situation. I disagree.  \n\n4. ETF's are the way to go if you don't know anything about investing plus aren't interested in learning more about it. Quite cheap, almost always perform well depending on which one you buy, very low maintenance.",

There are rumors of Cybereason IPO as well. \n\nFireye has an EDR solution but I imagine it's a tiny part of their business. And no one really would bring up Fireeye when talking about endpoint protection. Fireeye/Mandiant is most known for their incident response and forensic products and services. They are usually on top of most people's list to call whenever there is a security breach. \n\nBoth Palo Alto and Fortinet started off as security networking companies competing with traditional firewall companies like Netscreen and Cisco. In fact, the founders of both companies are former Netscreen execs iirc. Both companies have expanded their product and service offerings over the years to support security operations solutions. You tend to see Palo Alto and Fortinet used in larger enterprises who need holistic network security solutions. Normally, if a security team is looking at a Palo Alto solutions, they are probably also comparing it Fortinet and vice-versa. \n\nGenerally speaking - cyber-security industry is very broad. You are not likely to find a single company that would cover the entire gamut of security needs for an enterprise. So if your interest is in broad industry exposure - an ETF is probably a better solution.",

        "body": "I partially agree with you on the salary issue, but I think it's a bit more nuanced than that. From a business perspective, I think you have to look at the big picture and think about how much it would cost you if your business was making negative headlines because you're treating your workforce poorly, exploiting the environment or have other questionable practices. \n\nIt obviously depends on your margins (and those are largely dictated by your industry \u2013 think software vs. retail, for instace), but it's not a good look if you're underpaying workers while the C-level execs are being compensated through the roof.\n\nAs far as due diligence goes, a lot of this stuff is very hard to accurately measure. Personally, I stay away from certain industries altogether (e.g. oil, steel and other CO2-heavy sectors) and try to focus on the ones with less potential for ESG risks. Those typically also have higher margins and can thus pay better wages. \n\nI do suggest reading a company's ESG/sustainability report. Obviously, that's not an objective assessment, so you'll have to make your own call, but I do think it tells you a lot about how serious a business is about making a positive impact. CO2 emissions, water usage, personnel turnover etc. are examples of metrics that can easily be tracked and if a business is tracking these and has ambitious goals that it's working towards, that's a plus in my book.\n\nAnother go-to for me is Glassdoor. In my experience, disgruntled (ex-)employees are more likely to leave a score than happy ones, so if the Glassdoor rating is excellent (4.0 or higher), I do think that's an excellent sign. Again, it pays off to read between the lines.\n\nFinally, there's everything else that might no't show up in the above sources, but might have been covered in the media. For instance, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have had so many violations of privacy or what simply I'd consider ethical business standards that this signals a toxic culture to me. I don't think I need to go into detail about these because they have been extensively covered over and over again.\n\nUltimately, this isn't easy to do and the results won't be perfect (especially if you have a value investing approach which eliminates a lot of businesses from the get-go). However, I don't think you have to be perfect, just good enough. \n\nCompanies I'd consider \"ethical\" based on the information I have found include Cisco Systems, Hg Capital Trust, Intel, SAP, Microsoft, Roche, Ericsson, Owens Corning, Vertex Pharmaceuticals. (Until recently, I would've included Biogen in this list, but I changed my mind after the FDA approval and hearing from people in the neuroscience field about \u2013 sounded a bit too icky for my taste).",

I'm just making examples here but that is nonetheless something that can be considered somewhat unethical.\n\nIn my opinion the problem doesn't come from companies themselves but rather from the consumer society we live in.\n\nHow ethical could be considered a company that starts to produce plant-based meat in order to take advantage of market opportunities and not because of true and honest ethical principles? That sells vegetarian burgers that costs them less to produce and charge them even more to customers?\n\nI think it's noble the idea of wanting to invest in a company that conducts its business according to ethics but it's pretty difficult for such a business to maintain a competitive margin over its peers and not be swiped out of business by them.

Plus there really hasn't been a significant correction that I recall in the last 10 years. An investor really has to look much further back to at least '87 to see how trading and investing has evolved. Plus - there have been significant changes in market mechanics since the late 80's.  \n\nI don't necessarily disagree with your overall sentiment. But I think that an informed investor should worry if their choice of investments drops in value. I agree that short-term fluctuations shouldn't be a concern. But macro issues do matter. \n\nI saw that you cited Enron as an example. But it's not just outright management fraud that can cause a slow decline or even a slow recovery from an initial crash. Companies like Sunbeam, Cisco, GE, Kodak, etc. can all be interesting examples and counter-arguments to why someone shouldn't ignore systemic risk.   \n\nIf a portfolio isn't risk balanced for the investors profile - they should worry. Someone in their 50's with 50% of their net-worth tied up in meme stocks probably should worry. As should someone in their 20's with a large chunk of their savings in a money market who is not seeing a raise in their net worth.",

Apple hasn\u2019t innovated in the last 7 years (flat revenue since 2015) and Netflix doesn\u2019t have a big moat + decelerating subscribers. \n\nMy comment was directed towards Microsoft/Amazon/Google. Yes, there can always be disruptive tech that threatens established businesses that have to be monitored for. But until then the only threat to these 3 are government regulatory pressures.\n\nEdit: I doubt Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and Dell in 2000 made up 27% of the S&amp;P 500 like FAAMG currently does",

I see a lot of comments from people believing that Apple can do no wrong and that their sales and share price will always go up with minimal comments about valuation.  I think Apple is overvalued at this point in time and believe that investing in the company right now is risky.  Share price could easily trade sideways for a few years (like Walmart from 2000 to 2010) to allow earnings to catch up with price or it could correct to the downside (like Cisco from 2000 to 2001).

Inevitably hot sectors attract overinvestment and a lot of failures while the technology is relatively immature.  This market feels almost exactly like 1998 did to me, we are getting the reverse mergers and the IPO count is up, although the IPOs are generally of OK quality right now.  Trust me when I tell you that all those things we were betting on then did in fact go on to become critical world technologies, and yet, most of the companies that were hot disappeared entirely, Some of the few survivors have barely returned at the rest of the market or have completely underperformed (look at CSCO which peaked in the $80s) while a few reestablished/reinvented themselves (MSFT).  Tech ETFs were dead money from 2000-2008.  During that time the people using the tools  were making the money rather than the toolmakers.  We will have a bear market cycle ... when it comes, the current market leaders will be kicked to the curb, and a new set of leadership will be elected until the next bull ends.  Because of that 10 years is almost exactly the wrong time frame, IMO, for that sector bet you are interested in.  So don't treat things like this as fire and forget because sectors go in and out of favor massively with the bear/bull cycle.  This will probably work great for the next couple of years, and then it will be on the outside looking in for possibly a very long time.",

Companies like Cisco have never reached a new high. 99% of tech companies from that period went bankrupt most likely.\n\nIf you diversify the majority of your portfolio over value stocks and ETF's and have a smaller part in tech stocks/etf's you'll make much more steady and safer gains. It's a solid strategy. People in this thread are acting like OP is an idiot for rotating to value stocks while that isn't a bad idea IMO, even if you lose some short term gains.",

No effective hedging identified. \n\n\r  \nLending permitted. Per NPORT-P filed on 2021-03-16 securities lending was conducted using all-cash collateral\n\n\r  \nListed: NYSE ARCA\n\n\r  \nPortfolio weightings range from .38% to 2.2% per NPORT-P on 2021-03-16\r  \nNotes: Fund limits 80% of investments to those held by the \u201cFidelity Value Factor Index\u201d. It does not require proportional weighting. This index is developed mid-cap and large-cap only, limiting the fund exposure to mid and large-cap funds for the majority of investment. The fund does not maintain a small-cap allocation.\n\n\r  \nGeode is permitted to utilize statistical sampling techniques to match investment characteristics of a variety of factors between the index and the fund. \n\n\r  \nFiling 485BPOS filed 2021-02-24 discusses the proprietary weighting strategy of \u201cFidelity Value Factor Index\u201d. The section goes on to explain the index\u2019s weighting and composite scoring methodology. Composite measures: High FCF yield, low enterprise value to EBITDA, low price to tangible book value, and low price to future earnings. Size-bias is removed, and the highest composite scores are utilized. The country-weights of the index are intended to match the developed international market. Each stock group category is market-cap weighted internally, plus a group weighting adjustment is applied, then each sector is equal-weighted against the international market portfolio. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing is semi-annual in February and August\n\n\r  \nOpinion: \n\n\r  \nThe management structure warrants additional investigation, as the senior manager covers many funds, and there has been a senior-management change. Next step would be to analyze the overlap of non-senior portfolio managers to ensure at least some competent member of management treats this as a primary fund. Due to the low management fee and small capitalization this is unlikely. Additionally research must be completed as to the compensation agreements between Geode and its managers, as well as Fidelity and Geode. \n\n\r  \nThe underlying indexing strategy is uninspired and vulnerable to value traps. The low adherence required to the underlying index poses ethical conflict to primary managers of the fund dependent upon compensation agreements. This is compounded by the ability of Geode to allocate per their statistical sampling techniques. \n\n\r  \nWhile their mandate permits small and mid-cap securities, a large majority of the fund is large-cap. Size tilt should be accounted for when determining any allocation. Additionally, they have deviated from the global allocation with a Euro-centric tilt against their mandate. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing periods align with that of the MSCI ACWI Ex US index, which is quarterly rebalanced. Semi-annual rebalancing will result in drift away from MSCI on the underlying fund index. \n\n\r  \nCurrency risk of this fund may require portfolio-level currency management upon purchase. \n\n\r  \nInvestability is low due to low ADV and wide spreads, among other market impact concerns. This fund may be a target for creation-unit arbitrage given the large liquid underlying securities and relatively high premium available for the underlying securities. It should be noted total fund value equals only \\~11 creation units.",

        "body": "You are correct this is not a full due-diligence report, and I think you misunderstand what I was trying to do. The purpose of this is to give a high level summary of some key features of the fund, and to determine whether it is investable from a portfolio management perspective. Based on the ADV/spreads it is not realistically investable for me, so much of the remainder of the information listed is moot for my purposes. For that reason I touch on a couple high notes so that if I were to ever come back to this fund I would have some context to start from. My full documentation is about 12 pages, but I figured I would toss some summary info up here for anyone who was interested. \n\nThe info I gathered was from Morningstar reports and (primarily) their EDGAR filings, which I reviewed all of. I did not look at the Fidelity website. I also did not copy + paste anything besides the manager/advisor names\n\nI called it euro-centric because it has 134% of the euro allocation of the market index. It isn't a positive or negative, just something to be aware of. Tracking error and prospectus limitations are different issues as one is forward looking and one is backwards looking. When doing portfolio allocation of investor funds being aware of the degree of third-party discretion is important, and since it is not investable for me at this point I did not evaluate historical tracking error. There is no \"problem\" per se at present, but the structure of the fund and loose tracking requirements indicates that before investing client money additional research would need to be done as to how management is compensated, that is all. \n\nThere are several strategies to avoiding value traps in passive investments, the most common are \"quality adjusting\", or G-scoring, or F-Scoring, among many others. [Here](http://www.independance-et-expansion.com/files/upload/fondements-theoriques/Novy-Marx%20-%20Value%20Investing%202013.pdf) and [Here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2672906?seq=1) are a couple articles on the topic. You will note that the size dimension plays a role in the effects of quality-adjustment, which is why I addressed the portfolio size tilt in my opinion.",

        "body": "Thanks for your question. There are a number of ways in which we are very different, and the differences are really significant. First and foremost, Payoneer was custom-built for business to business transactions, while Paypal focuses primarily on consumer to business payments.   This means our infrastructure and pricing are targeted at bigger transactions at lower price points while Paypal is essentially built around consumer credit card infrastructure and pricing, which is too high for B2B.  Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",

You don't just open and walk away, you have to think through the whole time frame. I primarily trade in RH and Fidelity. I love RH (people will probably scream at me for that) the execution has gotten a lot better since the start of last year AND it is really easy to roll the spread if you need to and save your ass. \n\nSo looking at SPY right now. RSI is at 57 so a little oversold but its coming off its correction so I'm ok with that. MACD bounced off its low the end of last month. We're seeing some stagnation but I'm pretty confident we aren't going to see a massive correction by the end of next week. We also haven't seen it cross the 50 day moving average really since that one time in March. \n\nSo actually I just opened a 100 spread order for 6/11 405/404 @$5/spread so $10K tied up for a $500 premium. And people will scoff at this but really that's 5% return in two weeks for basically doing nothing but looking at a chart and clicking some buttons (yes not with taxes blah blah blah, but taxes wont be realized until next year so..) given market conditions this allows me to sleep too.

How, after watching RH gain huge market share over the years, these companies haven\u2019t tried to mimic their user experience is a complete mystery to me.  RH literally made a multi-billion dollar company by simply creating app that doesn\u2019t give you an aneurism when you try to use it, and it seems like everyone else is like \u201cwow how did they possibly do it\u201d.  Guh.\n\nThat said, I transferred my GME to Fidelity because RH has shown they can\u2019t be trusted in a squeeze.  It literally took 1 day, not even.  Happened overnight for me.

        "body": "\nPaysafe preps post-Spac\u00a0refi\n\u00a0\n\n02 Jun 2021\n\nFintech payments provider Paysafe has launched a refinancing of its remaining credit facilities, following its $9bn merger with a Bill Foley-controlled Spac, which closed in March. The merger and its accompanying PIPE allowed the firm to pay down debt and cut its leverage, and now it wants to lock in the benefits with a lower-cost refi.\n\nJP Morgan is sole physical bookrunner on the dollar and euro term loans, totalling $1.026bn between the currencies. This will be followed with an equal sized slug of bonds in dollar and euros, yet to be launched.\nTalk on both tranches is 300bp-325bp at 99.5, with a 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, half a turn below its present level, according to the loan marketing materials.\nLenders have successfully pushed back on proposed margin ratchet terms \u2014\u00a0including Cerba, for example \u2014 but these are generally deals which started with more aggressive terms, such as multiple step-downs for each quarter-turn of leverage. Deals with 25bp for half a turn have largely sailed through.\n\"It's a real economic term and something investors can easily rally around,\" said a leveraged finance syndicate banker. \"Some of the other docs points can be a bit of a niche interest but this is universal.\"\nPaysafe earmarked \u20ac1.25bn-equivalent of its outstanding debt for repayment as part of the merger, which closed at the end of March. The company said in\u00a0its introduction to equity market analysts\u00a0that it would have net leverage of 3.6-3.8 times on its 2021 earnings following the transaction \u2014 suggesting it intends to activate the margin step-down quickly.\nIt will, however, be going on the acquisition trail as well. Outlining the deal to analysts, Foley said: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6 times. As Paysafe continues to grow and generate cash flow, that leverage ratio will continue to come down creating even more opportunity to pursue accretive M&amp;A opportunities.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s estimated leverage at 5.2 times on March 2021 numbers, after backing out some of the company\u2019s adjustments.\nBased on its expected 2021 Ebitda, the business was 6-6.2 times levered at the end of last year, with net debt of $2.99bn, incurred when Blackstone and CVC took the firm private in 2017. The sponsors scored a huge win with the transaction, paying \u00a33bn for the company and selling it on at a valuation of $9bn.\nHowever, both firms will remain invested. They took $2.3bn off the table as part of the Spac deal, but rolled over $3.29bn, while the Spac itself put in $1.467bn.\nThe PIPE investment (private investment in public equity) closed at the same time injected a further $2bn, with cornerstones from Foley-affiliated entities Cannae Holdings and Trasimene Capital Management, and outside capital from Fidelity, Third Point, and Maplelane Asset Management.\nAlongside the term loan and bond refi, the company will have a new $305m revolver in place following the closing of the deal.\nSpac-driven M&amp;A activity is increasingly\u00a0feeding through to leveraged credit markets and to CLO portfolios, as sponsor-owned companies become targets for SPAC acquisitions. The equity raised through this route usually deleverages the company, meaning loan repayments or refinancings tighter \u2014 in some cases, helping take out loans trading at low levels at par.\nPaysafe\u2019s existing euro loan already had a margin of 325bp, the wide end of the new guidance, but it also had outstanding second lien debt of $200m and \u20ac214m in its original LBO capital structure, which paid 725bp and 700bp respectively and have now been repaid.",

At this point I'm planning on basically only holding blue chips with one or two other real plays for barely a couple hundred thousand at most after all this pans out so I can prove to myself I'm not just a lucky retard that got in on the tail end of the biggest bull run in modern history, and so that in the event I'm wrong I'll still have millions I can just leave in my fidelity account and make enough off interest from to live fat until the day I die. And that's if I'm just the laziest bastard that ever lived.  \n\nStocks will never be this fun for me again and given all the regulations that have been passed leading up to this insanity I've got a strong feeling that 8% gains per year will be a lot moving forward.

Personally, I'd recommend Fidelity; it may not have the flashiest looking app, but it has an app, it is a full service brokerage and has a lot of resources and it offers customer service. I'd rather say Fidelity now and then when you have even more you'll be happy that you're at a full service brokerage vs starting in some basic app now and then eventually having to transfer everything.",

I just made the switch last week from Fidelity to Schwab because I wanted a better trading platform and customer service, My other smaller account (TD Ameritrade) for short-term trading is only 3.3K. Since my account tanked I've been rethinking my investment strategy and I've been talking my time. I only have a little over 1/3 of my portfolio invested for my long-term investments. I debating weather I should start setting stop losses and thinking about setting plenty of price alerts for helping me keep focus on the stocks unlike before.",

I gasped when I saw the $20 strike, and was a lil salty fidelity wouldn't let me sell $21+ for 06/04.\n\nI think it's going over $20, I just don't think so before friday. If I'm wrong, well, I'll have my cb back as powder and still have shares on the house's dime. Not sure where I'll put it, mebbe moar GME, or another 300 shares of UWMC to make it an even 1k.\n\nIdk, either way this week is exciting.",
