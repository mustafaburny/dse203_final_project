My first recommendation is if you\u2019re not married to the idea of individual stock picks, go boring and pick a broad market etf. \n\nIf you really want to pick individual stocks, i personally employ a strategy that looks for quality companies with strong balance sheets, strong FCF generation or the prospects of doing so, and have excellent management and/or are market leaders in their segments. \n\nI take a barbell approach where I have traditional \u201cvalue\u201d picks on one side and \u201cgrowth\u201d on the other, but they all fit the criteria I have above. I think value and growth are stupid labels because you always want to buy when it\u2019s good value relative to prospects and you don\u2019t want to buy companies that aren\u2019t growing in some way. I like some pharma names like MRK and VRTX; I have a good position in PYPL, V to capitalize on secular trends in payments. Look for sectors that don\u2019t have much attention at the moment since you want to buy before people realize they\u2019re gems.",

Old. Successful but *old*. Really good numbers but Paysafe already has all the companies kids will be using. And if those kids grow up and continue to use Paysafe it'll just get more profitable. \n  \nSquare is wildly popular. Jack Dorsey is obviously a smart man. And I think cashapp will be around for a loooooong time. Have you ever been in the inner part of any city? All the poor people use cash app. It's UI is simple and people with 4 kids in the tough brooklyn neighbors who are always paying their baby daddy's and momma's child support all use cashapp. \n\nBut nothing is gonna take off like e-commerce in the next few decades.

Pennystock so small pump and dump , plus large fees to buy on FRA, so lost a little bit. Didn't fall to intial levels, so I believe in the stock, will increase position and average down. \n\n\\- *The stock of which we do not speak*:  learned to regulate emotions, hold, and get profit by buying and selling on the good moments. Will keep doing that for a bit + decrease position but keep it as a YOLO in my portfolio &amp; a possible hedge in case of moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current portfolio** is very spread, want to make my own ETF.

I am slowly buying during dips, and averaging down, I also waited to invest in green energy after last month's runup. Will increase positions in most except for TSLA, SHOP and G\\*E. Will keep a permanent 30% cash aside for buying dips and rotating portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis month's profit: 4.47% (bought every week so on average it is 2.5 weeks?)\n\nSold with profit: Sony, Apple, AMC, GME, might repurchase Sony. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stocks I am looking into purchasing too:**\n\n    FRA:Nintendo    NTO \n    TPI composites\tTPIC\twind \n    OMK:Vestas wind\tVWS\twind \n    OMK:Orsted A/S\tORSTED\twind \n    Sunrun\t        RUN\tsolar china \n    DAQO new energy\tDAQO\tsolar residential \n    Quanta services\tPWR\tpipelines, transmission building \n    XET:Verbio\tVBK\tbiofuel \n    XET:Volkswagen\tVOW3 \n    FRA:\tVolvo\tVOL1    believe in Polestar\n    EAM:PostNL\tPNL\tEU parcel service \n    XET:Adidas\tADS\tprobably replace Nike with this \n    XET:Astrazeneca\tZEG\t? \n    EBR:Ackermans &amp; van haaren ACKB hedgefund \n    EAM:Boskalis    BOKA\tdredging, wind, ports\n\n  \nI feel green energy is currently below value after the hype, so will purchase some before they get back to true value level.

Green energy is a very long, also looking into dredging companies etc for climate change hedging.   \nWaiting to put money into construction should *the stock of which we do not speak* moon, and buy those dips. Also heavy in EU markets invested in case this makes the US market crash, EU will follow but I'll have time to get out without so much losses.

(Is a company undervalued or are they just presenting themselves like this or are some HF profiting from making the company look that way in the news? )   \nI only buy companies I know, mostly intuitively: is the public perception good (or brand loyalty) are they innovating or expanding, or will they be needed more in the future?\n\n  \nIt's based on Warren Buffet's: \"*I bought Dunkin Donuts because I liked their coffee.\"*  \nWhich might make me a complete idiot, so feel free to completely tear this all apart.",

If i wasn't about to swing back to tesla, i would be balls deep in square, paypal, and any genomics i could get my hands on (after ofcourse looking at their financials, products they are working on, and who is leading these companies). I'm really psyched about these shifting landscapes we now find ourselves on. Ark invests has great funds but i dislike being in second place companies and \"diversifying\" for the sake of being safe. We're young. Let's take risks and change the world! \n\n#disclaimer#  i don't have all of my networth in the market anymore.

        "body": "I'm focusing on all of tech, but primarily companies I know. Even if Powell raises federal interest rates early and we have another setback, which he has said over and over he won't so I believe him, interest rates are going to be very low for a few years. \n\nFirst let me summarized why I believed the cycle was already on the verge of turning back to tech, posted earlier in the week in an Ark thread.\n\nDisclaimer, assume I have a position on every stock in this topic, even the retails.\n\nApple and Amazon started falling from their ATH quite awhile ago actually, before the rest of the tech correction. They bottomed out around 118 and 3000, both dipping below those marks even but not for long. Then they started to show resistance and basically trade sideways around 120 and 3050 while the rest of tech continued to sink, and finally early this week they were even rising and beating the market. This all showed a bottom out to me.\n\nDisney was my reopening stock, crushing it and breaking ATH. The news and this sub was all about DIS and other reopenings/retail/cyclicals. But then they started to fall back on positive earnings. They got a one hour bump from positive park news, the next time they got zero bump from positive park news, and they fell a good 10% from their ATH.\n\nBy the time Roku hit 300, Etsy below 200, SQ at 200, it was time to put all money possible in. Even if they keep going down, at that point I don't believe they can go too much farther, as they were at their prices from last Fall, much like Apple and Amazon had bottomed out there. These stocks are going to fall to summer prices while TGT soars indefinitely past its ATH high?  Fine I'll keep buying down, but I don't think so. Now we have lulu being shorted as soon as they beat earnings and there's nothing but positive news, the same thing that was happening to the companies like Apple a couple months ago.\n\nThe bond yields should climb some more and stabilize closer to 2, maybe even in the near future, so there might be some more choppiness ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even that bad and we already got most of that priced in though.\n\nFAANG of course is recommended, although I did think it was interesting Biden called out Amazon twice in the infrastructure speech and there may be bipartisan agreement against some of these companies. It's not like I see any major problems here, but I think their cash reserves will matter more in a year or so, so they're just buy as you can per usual.\n\nMy favorites are the household names or dependable tech stocks that are still way below their ATHs. I'm deep and long on Roku, just search the sub for the excellent DD about Roku if you don't really know what they're about. Their industry is mid-game, so room to grow, but also at a point where Roku has spent the money to secure their position, with an agreement with every major streaming service, pretty much every non-first or discount tier smart TV brand, and now their own advertisement company which is where their money flow will come, as they both help the streaming services make money while getting a cut. They crushed earnings and gave a better than expected outlook but fell $180, all I could post was to buy at point. They are not a gimmick, they are over 70% institutionally owned.\n\nSquare, PayPal, Zoom, Tesla, Etsy, Pinterest, pick your poison, there's more than I can think off the top of my head. I'm picking as many of these household tech stocks that have been around for years and will be around for years to come. I don't see a reason to get safer investments while these stocks are 50-75% from ATHs if you can ride it out long enough for them to climb again. I'll even throw out an Uber mention despite their bump in UK, because this is a household name product.  I hate apps, but I'm not deleting by Uber app anytime soon. Longevity and % of dip is what I'm focused on when it comes to taking on perceived risk.\n\nThen you can look at stocks I don't even like such as LMND and FSLY. Fastly is still almost 50% from its ATH, sure I'll take a small position there. A short time of rising with the rest of the market and one positive news story and they'll be back to at least $85 or $90, surely.\n\nPeople are over the semiconductor shortage by now after MU yesterday, right? Surely semiconductors, ev charging, clean energy, uranium, etc has room to climb even if they can't boom as fast as they did previously? \n\nSoftware companies? Sure. HPE was unaffected lately.check that chart. I guess it's because they pay dividends, all I know is they're working on every futuristic cloud and software idea. I won't even talk someone out of PLTR, we know it's going to continue being pumped daily on Reddit lol, but it's also by far the lowest Institutionally owned stock in this post I'm sure. MDB should be a good one again although it already got 8.5% since Thursday opening,it's 75% from its ATH and the company is going to be around for awhile.\n\nI don't know your companies, and I like to focus on what I know, but I will look into them too. I don't think this tech storm lasts too much longer, and regardless of how long it lasts I'm riding it out if I believe the company will be a well known name five years down the road.\n\nHappy day off everyone, hopefully the next quarter is good to you all. Just get SPY or something if you want to safely grow your money, I think that route will be very good to you this year and beyond as well.",

Set the groundwork for a solid, long-term position that can grow with you and your family rather than a moonshot.\n\nThis isn't financial advice, but you could do a lot worse than buying a good AAPL, MSFT, or PYPL (the last one being the most risky but likely also most upside potential). If you want something with a more dividend bent, you could look at EXG (more growth holdings with a dividend) or GDV (more value holdings with a dividend).",
