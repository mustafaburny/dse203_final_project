The stocks I hold (yes hold) are MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, PYPL, SQ, AMD, LULU, FCX and some other re-opening stocks too long to list. Check what all of these were worth 1 year ago. BB is the one stock \u201cright now, in this market\u201d that I am big on for a tech holding growth potential. I have said many times on this site I am not a bag holder on BB, but I do keep averaging \u201cup\u201d on it, like I did today. I chose BB as my EV growth stock over EV manufacturers because the EV manufacturers will be in heavy competition to sell a car while BB pretty much has a lock on the software and security part of the EV business - monetization of said TBD, but it will be huge. I did not buy BB at the wrong time for the wrong reasons. I know BB will start it\u2019s real growth path soon and if it dips another 2-1/2% tomorrow I\u2019ll buy more. For those of you who want to trash BB it\u2019s because you\u2019re a bag holder who bought it as a meme stock and I\u2019m not so fuck you. For those of you who don\u2019t see the potential and growth coming in BB that\u2019s too bad. Check in with me in 1 year from now when it\u2019s at $20-$25 PS on it\u2019s way to 10 times current valuation. For those of you who downvote me because you lost money today also fuck you. My portfolio was full of green and BB will get there too when the sentiment changes and I guarantee it will.\n\nP.S. Post, pre-market and futures mean nothing. Stop looking at them and blowing up WSB when something is green. If they meant anything every single one of you here would be filthy rich by following the leader. SMH",

So you\u2019re probably best off having most of your money in something like spy. But I know that\u2019s not much fun (I pick my own stocks for my Roth IRA). So if you want to pick stocks, I\u2019d say have 15-20 companies or so (more is fine with zero commissions now). Pick stocks that have monopolies (Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon), the strongest brands (Starbucks, Disney, Nike), and stocks which are growing their earnings and their revenue consistently over time (United health, Home Depot). Plus maybe throw in some newer companies (just 1 or 2 or a few more if you want more than 20 stocks) that have hyper growth and you think will be dominant in 2030 or whatever (square, crowdstrike, Zillow). AI is good! (Nvidia, Tesla) And definitely have half or more of your stocks NOT tech! New investors seem to want mostly tech....you need diversity. Also, really try to have most of your stocks be on the cheaper side as far as forward P/E ratio. Under 30 forward p/e is good right now. And if it\u2019s higher, at least have a lowish PEG ratio, like Amazon. Dividends are good too! Other stocks which will be great for many years to come are Linde, Deere, JP Morgan, Blackrock, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, PayPal, Lam Research, Chipotle, Visa. Do your thing! Make sure you\u2019re super diverse and have mostly the biggest, best companies that will grow earnings and revenue for many years!",

After Y2K, we had 10-15% drop - I thought free month and rushed to buy more - I am genius it went back up a little. By mid June, lost $300K and exited.   Hindsight is 20/20 but if I held on until it would be a good investment, but I could not handle the lost.\n\nI knew people that lost more than 7 figures with CMGI - everyone is genius during boom.  \n\n**Everyone during a boom will tell you that this time is different (new economic, interest rate, stimulus, ---) - do not believe the BS they are self-justifying thing.**\n\nI learned one thing - slow and steady wins the race.   First, full fund retirement accounts with low cost mutual funds or ETF,  secondly pick-up a 2-3 blue chips stocks and consistently re-invest dividend; then and only then - start a speculative portfolio to keep you mind active and involved \"i*n the game*\" - and ***NEVER touch the retirement or blue chips and NEVER invest in speculative stocks in your retirement account***.\n\nGood Luck",

You\u2019re welcome \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4417169-ase-technology-vs-amkor-an-analysis-on-worlds-leading-osats\n\n\u201cStrategic Alliance between ASE and TSMC\nASE is based in Taiwan, one of the leading centers for outsourced semiconductor and electronics manufacturing in the world. Its close geographical proximity allows the company to benefit from strong manufacturing activity. It has maintained a strategic alliance with TSMC since 1997, the largest dedicated foundry with a market share of 56% of the foundry market revenues. The alliance has made ASE the preferred provider of packaging and testing services for TSMC clients. This allows ASE to benefit by leveraging TSMC's clients of leading companies including Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, Nvidia (NVDA), MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTKF), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as clients who account for nearly half of ASE's revenues. Apple, Qualcomm and MediaTek are major players in the smartphone processor market and are developing 5G chipsets that require advanced packaging capabilities which ASE can provide. Given the long-standing relationship between TSMC and ASE, we expect the alliance between both companies to continue as it enables them to provide a total semiconductor manufacturing solution and the close geographic advantage between both market leaders. This means that ASE should be able to continue counting on TSMC's clients of leading chipmakers.\u201d",

I think we are seeing the start of the 2-3 year sell off period as the EV bubble pops.\n\nOf course, even if this 2-3 year sell off is happening, it can still rally in the short term. If TSLA hype relights I can easily get flattened on a weekly position. Though, if the hype doesn't relight on this 10% beat, I think panic sets in and it massively sells off.\n\n\"A 10% beat didn't even stop the downward trend? What will?\"",
