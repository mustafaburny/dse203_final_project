        "body": "If you want to see someone that's doing this kind of revolution more transparently albeit ruthlessly, see NortonLifelock.  Norton Anti-virus used to be a somewhat respectable antivirus software company.  It's now been bought by the grifters behind the \"life lock\" brand which is basically a questionable insurance against identify theft.  \n\nBut anyway, they've adopted an aggressive shift away from selling their renewals through retail stores like Staples and Target.   They'd previously sold renewals for about $99 MSRP that the retailer could discount to $79 or whatever to be competitive.  Due to keystoning, norton's share of the retail revenue was moderated.  The new NortonLifeLock is killing that off.  Retail will only sell full starter software, and renewals will be pushed as digital-only subscription.  Even at a lower subscription price, all that revenue will soon be captured directly by a Norton Life Lock, cutting out their retailers.  They're employing various means to get there.  So even as they're going to be losing legacy revenue channels, they're rapidly building a higher margin channel to replace it.  \n\nDisney isn't doing that.  They're killing off high margin legacy revenue channels and replacing them with a zero margin channel.",

After an S-1 is filed they have a set amount of time before they can actually list. You\u2019re looking for a 424B1 and 424B3 form. The 424B4 is then filed after the IPO to summarize what happened (price, shares, etc.). Some companies will file an S-1, not IPO, and then refile when they finally do (Yeti is an example of this). Others file an S-1 and then get acquired (this happened with Blue Coat getting acquired by Symantec in 2016), and some never go public at all. An S-1 is pretty much like a longer 10-k, some additional information and longer risk sections, also info on what they want to use the IPO funds for, etc.",

After paying a special dividend of $12 NLOK went to trading at $17 from $26. And my NLOK put option now has the symbol NLOK1 and trades for a penny or two at a 99% loss since purchase. Wtf?! I am trying to find out what right do I have by owning the Put options - that I can exercise at the time of expiry? Also, was there any way I could have known that this would be the likely outcome at the time of purchasing such options? At least E*TRADE didn\u2019t provide any heads up. And even now they are clueless and have asked me to refer to OCC website for additional details on the option.",
