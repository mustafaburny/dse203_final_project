I'm already catching a small portion of what a lot of those companies bring in through DIA, IVV, and QQQ, but I also have a small stake in V, MA, and FISV.  That's about all I will probably take from that sector atm, and currently I'm going all in on SPCE and REYN because the first could be the one that retires me if they become a success.  The other is a very successful company that quietly launched their IPO about two weeks ago and I see a lot of growth potential once they put all that money to use.  If LK, JD, or BABA get beat up good in the next earnings report I'm buying from those dips.  Gonna be a bit before I get back into the fintech stocks the way things are shaping up this year.",
