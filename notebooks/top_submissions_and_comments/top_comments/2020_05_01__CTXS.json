Now this is Jan-March so April was probably better as both US demand increased and China supply improved. Also based on his quote in Feb it showed that issue. \n\nThat said I still think they probably blew on the earnings side, as their product mix of Laptops to Desktops certainly changed. With seeing Nvidia's numbers the workstation (and obviously gaming)  improved nicely yoy. I would think HPQ should at the very least get to the 52 week moving average. Also Lenovo just reported pretty good numbers even though their stock did not respond muhc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDell: From the Laptop/desktop side, Dell 100% blew it out the most. IDC shows they had it figured out in Jan. Also with a large amount of sales going direct.  Their margins should be even better and they sell attach with that. Logi showed great numbers and that would sell through Dell. \n\nThat said their enterprise business is def screwed. It is already a tough market and with budgets all going to WFH, no one is buying capital equipment if they can delay. This is where the money is made. Cisco showed infrastructure is down,  HPE showed the same. Dell will have a large hole there. \n\nThey also have a big part of VMware which I personally think will have a good quarter as well. Although on-prem virtualization will not have great numbers, VSphere in AWS will, NSX, and most importantly horizon for VDI (look at Citrix numbers). Although vSphere is now considered more legacy to a certain degree everything still runs on it.\n\nLong story short I think Dell is going to be a tough one to call and would just pass but maybe buy VMware\n\nI made 250% on HPQ and cashed out the end of last week but might buy back in for some FDs.\n\nPoss:\n\nNetApp NTAP $45p 5/29\n\nplan to buy FDs for VMW and HPQ",

And because studies have consistently shown that people aren't nearly as good at timing the market as they think they are, so you're actually better off just staying invested than trying to trade out and in based on the short term moves. \n\nTrue, if you were able to successfully sell your equities early in the crisis and also managed to successfully buy back in around the bottom, you would be better off than if you have just held through the crisis.  But very few people have the ability to time things this well.  And besides, what we saw during the crash was that some stocks held up very well.  If you had sold stocks like TDOC, WMT, PTON, CLX, CTXS, DOCU, etc., early in the crash, you would have missed out on their gains.",
