They are the largest movie theater in the world and trading at a 650million market cap.  CNK, much smaller , trading like it's worth 3 billion.  The A-list subscribers are doing better than they thought.  AMC is a 15 dollar stock, when the short squeeze happens its going to boom.  I would get in at 6.80ish.  disclaimer, i currently hold 500 call options for a 9 dollars strike after earnings.  Swing for the fences.  Peterthewindmillbennet out",
