        "body": "Value investing is getting hard.  I've been an active buyer for the past few years, but this year thus far I'm not seeing opportunities.  In the past three years, I've bought great stocks like AAPL and DIS at a F/PE of 10-12.  Today AAPL's trading at an F/PE of 21.\n\nI picked up some AMZN in 2019, obviously not on a PE analysis, but on PE and revenue growth, and I think AMZN remains a good candidate.\n\nWDC was trading at value levels a month ago, and I picked some up.  Already up over 40%.\n\nAt this moment, the stocks that I see in value range are oil and chemicals.  Problem is, they've had a lot of bad news and might have more to come.  If past year earnings return, stocks like XOM, DD, and OLN have lots of room for prosperity.  But will those earnings return?\n\nThe media sector is getting pretty weak, as it was about 3-4 months ago.  CMCSA is hurting on the Cats fiasco, and VIAC.  I think CMCSA is probably a good buy, and I have some in my portfolio already, but I'm waiting on adding to my position.  VIAC is great on PE and F/PE, but it has a mountain of debt, which I hate.",

He was drumming up Xilinx on the way up to 141 and its reversion down to the 80s, then all of a sudden \"I don't like it, too much China\". He was negative on Tesla before the rally and is now just following the trend. \n\nPrediction: He'll stop being bullish on Tesla well before it's double the market cap of Ford+GM, because it's a volatile stock and after the next dip he'll say he warned you when he didn't. Any idiot can tell you what happened yesterday.",
