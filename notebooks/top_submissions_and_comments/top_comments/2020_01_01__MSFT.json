This has already started a couple of years ago and will continue to do so until basically all of the old companies that used to be in those categories are forgotten like old railroad companies and the new categories will be based of the new technology. Currently everything is grouped up in tech. If you think tech is just one basket then you will miss the boat as you will be trying to diversify too much and invest in old companies which the tech companies are about to turn obsolete. Sure some old companies will survive, but history has shown that companies come and go like empires.",

Perhaps 3 to 7% a month.  If you have a relatively small amount that you are going to keep adding to each month then now is probably OK but perhaps we put a 1/3 in for 3 months.\n\nHere's my Fund recommendation\n\nVOO 77%\n\nBND 10%\n\nIAU 5% (physical gold ETF)\n\nFXI 5% (China ETF)\n\nFIVG 2% (Companies involved in 5G roll-out ETF)\n\nIndividual stock picks 1% - use a very small amount for learning. Look for long term plays when technology or society changes. Basically you are looking for a Microsoft or Amazon type of company. You will need to actively trade but realize that it takes a long time to learn how to do it well, so don't put much into it, or it's gambling.\n\nWell, this is what I would tell my younger self.\n\nGood luck.",

You would have paid $16.39 per share. Around Christmas 1999, it's up to $58.75. You've more than tripled your money in less than two years. Do you hold or sell?\n\nIf you decide to sell, you miss the dot-com crash. If you don't, the stock is back around $21 at the end of 2000. Now, do you panic or stay in the game? \n\n9/11 happens, there's a recession in the U.S., Enron and WorldCom collapse, the war in Iraq begins, etc. Then gloom turns to boom. The market bounces back and Microsoft is around $36 in December 2007.\n\nThen there's this whole global financial crisis near the end of the decade. Everybody panics. There's talk of a second Great Depression. In February 2009, the stock price is lower than where it was at the start of 1998. While you received some dividends over the years (Microsoft began paying a dividend in 2003), you're probably only looking at the price return and not the total return so you think you're down. You're probably thinking this is the worst investment ever (although it's not so bad when you think about Enron, WorldCom, Nortel, Pets.com, etc.).\n\nIt's not until near the end of 2016 that Microsoft is back to where it was during the dot-com frenzy. And then it triples over the next three or so years to $158.62 today. Would you have held on for 22 years or would you have sold somewhere in between? \n\nIt's psychological and it's hard not to let your emotions take over when investing.",

Their technology is years beyond the top level performance products of their competition, not to mention their novel RDNA architecture as a backbone for a series of product line ups help to solidify a strong future heritage of its products just like Intel did with Its processors. I\u2019d expect expenditures to be high for this coming Q1 given their extensive development in the new architecture and in their 7nm. As soon as they ramp up production, a bit of marketing via esports sector and professional workplace sector, their market cap is going to be north of 100B quicker than most can see. The only thing setting them back is their fund allocation and debt management. If they can get the money towards the right development (which they are with graphics and gaming) they\u2019ll bake up a storm and become incredible my profitable. Their partnerships are a great sign of their success, or in other words, Apple, HP, Microsoft, Lenovo, etc are keystone companies that can help gauge the potential market exposure that AMD will get.\n\nMy position/plan: \n\nCurrently 45/46/47/48 Calls expiring 1/17. \n\nWill sell 3 days before expiration hoping it will go up and max out on the gains. \n\nRoll profits into TBD calls",

They'll probably release a minimal viable product sometime in the early 2020s when 5G becomes widespread then iterate it up to something more polished. The AR/VR product category is very compelling and will likely replace the laptop/tablet/smartphone as the main computing interface by the late 2020's/early 2030's.\n\nApple needs to speed up its product upgrade cycle- its design team has been a major bottleneck, for example taking years to upgrade the Mac Pro. Thats no way to win over the gaming market which is used to yearly GPU/CPU etc upgrades from the PC world. Hopefully Jony Ive's departure will allow more consistent and frequent product upgrades.\n\nOne the other players- Google is stagnant with a lazy and disjointed culture and management but has a lot of potential if it streamlines and regains its focus. Facebook has been hemorrhaging user trust but they own the social networking ecosphere. Microsoft under Nadella on the other hand has been a superstar with blistering product innovation and development and incredible leadership. Expect them to continue to win in the near future.\n\nTesla has the potential to be in the top 5. They've already overcome immense hurdles in achieving scale with their manufacturing and are lightyears ahead of the competition with autonomous driving, electric capabilities, and a software-centric Silicon Valley-style corporate structure. Their rapid obliteration of the German luxury auto industry shows how consumer preference strongly favors their vehicles- who wanted a Blackberry when the iPhone was released, even if the Blackberry's specs were more impressive on paper? Musk will likely continue to expand into other product categories such as utilities and other forms of transportation.\n\nI think a game engine company like Unity or Epic Games has the potential to be in the top 5 with the rise of AR/VR and the expansion of the game platform beyond video games into a variety of immersive digital experiences. The Unity, Unreal, and Valve app and game stores are a portent of things to come.",

Then the markets will stabilize on Tuesday a bit. Aapl will release earnings and analysts like Dan Ives will rave about how aapl is the best stock in the whole world or whatever. Then, fomo will hit hard because people realize that we\u2019re in a temporary dip and that huge tech companies are doing well. Msft will probably also have a huge gain along with amd since they haven\u2019t had any pre-er run-up. Analysts will just stfu for once and pump everything because they know that the market cannot sustain aapl and msft going down. Eventually, we\u2019ll end the week with a 2 percent gain for spy. Then, the Chinese markets will reopen and they will be blood red because the Chinese retail investors actually know how bad the state of things are in their country. The US markets will have a flash crash like they did back in 2015 when the Chinese markets crashed 8% in one day and we\u2019ll enter the February sell-off. Then, analysts will be like this is like the Feb 2018 sell-off that happened because markets were stretched. Most of wsb will lose all their money and the price of ropes will go up.",

If you are looking for fun, you should probably just buy puts / calls on whatever you want since that\u2019s just gambling with a a little bit of DD sprinkled in.\nIf you want to try to make money (very few autism\u2019s here), you should probably look into selling options / selling credit spreads. It definitely can still be gambling (especially on a stock like ACB), but I\u2019ve seen many strategies that seem to be able to make consistent returns if you are patient. A lot of people hate on it because it can be quite hard to make enough every trade to justify the potential losses (see: picking up pennies), but in my opinion doing something like selling credit spreads 1-2 months or more out will give a much easier exit in case things go wrong. \nIn this market I\u2019ve been having a really easy time selling put credit spreads on apple, Microsoft, sometimes amazon. I go pretty far otm, and those gains make up for my losses when I just buy options. Anyways, most people here don\u2019t care about consistency or long term gains, but I definitely recommend something like put credit spreads, because even a 4-12% return every 2 weeks really compounds over time. It still takes tuning and DD tho, so be careful.",

You do need to make sure you understand their agenda, and whether they\u2019re a sell-side or buy-side CFA.\n\nThe problem is that many analysts are great at analyzing established industries with years and years of data at their fingertips, but they aren\u2019t benefited with the same advantages when looking at the new kids on the block (FAANG, etc) \u2014 especially companies in intangible goods where their best data outside of corporate confessions will come from alternative data sources provided by iffy sources that companies like Bloomberg and FactSet sell to them (this much insurance was sold on these electronics, making ____ the likeliest amount that they\u2019re selling\u201d). I\u2019m paraphrasing an Economist article here, but it makes sense. Still, they have to have an opinion on the innovating companies, and so they swing away anyway. Check their sources when looking at GOOGL compared to, say, ROST or XOM.\n\nI think WSB is too harsh on analysts sometimes, which I think comes from a twisted spin on loss aversion. You remember when an analyst was wrong far for more than when they were right. For years I\u2019ve trusted reports prepared by CFAs over autists and been happy with the results, but I also am still holding MU bought at 55 and it hurts a lot more than the MCD I bought feels good.\n\nTL;DR Analysts sometimes have agendas, and sometimes are talking out of their asses when it comes to intangible goods-providing companies. But it would be a mistake to still not read their reports and their collected info over the opinions of a 13 year old WSBer in his pajamas who is looking up Step Mom porn while he writes his \u201cDD.\u201d",
