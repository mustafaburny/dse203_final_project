Each tech company actually operates in a different industry for example, Apple is in consumer products, Amazon is in retail and cloud computing, Facebook is in Social Media and Advertising, Google is in Advertising, Netflix is in Content Media and Media Distribution, Microsoft is in work productivity software and cloud computing, Nvidia is in semiconductors, Uber in transportation, and the list goes on.\n\nEventually there will be new categories and there will be a reshuffle of the companies into the new categories. This has already started a couple of years ago and will continue to do so until basically all of the old companies that used to be in those categories are forgotten like old railroad companies and the new categories will be based of the new technology. Currently everything is grouped up in tech. If you think tech is just one basket then you will miss the boat as you will be trying to diversify too much and invest in old companies which the tech companies are about to turn obsolete. Sure some old companies will survive, but history has shown that companies come and go like empires.",

Perhaps 3 to 7% a month.  If you have a relatively small amount that you are going to keep adding to each month then now is probably OK but perhaps we put a 1/3 in for 3 months.\n\nHere's my Fund recommendation\n\nVOO 77%\n\nBND 10%\n\nIAU 5% (physical gold ETF)\n\nFXI 5% (China ETF)\n\nFIVG 2% (Companies involved in 5G roll-out ETF)\n\nIndividual stock picks 1% - use a very small amount for learning. Look for long term plays when technology or society changes. Basically you are looking for a Microsoft or Amazon type of company.

You would have paid $16.39 per share. Around Christmas 1999, it's up to $58.75. You've more than tripled your money in less than two years. Do you hold or sell?\n\nIf you decide to sell, you miss the dot-com crash. If you don't, the stock is back around $21 at the end of 2000. Now, do you panic or stay in the game? \n\n9/11 happens, there's a recession in the U.S., Enron and WorldCom collapse, the war in Iraq begins, etc. Then gloom turns to boom. The market bounces back and Microsoft is around $36 in December 2007.\n\nThen there's this whole global financial crisis near the end of the decade. Everybody panics. There's talk of a second Great Depression. In February 2009, the stock price is lower than where it was at the start of 1998. While you received some dividends over the years (Microsoft began paying a dividend in 2003), you're probably only looking at the price return and not the total return so you think you're down. You're probably thinking this is the worst investment ever (although it's not so bad when you think about Enron, WorldCom, Nortel, Pets.com, etc.).\n\nIt's not until near the end of 2016 that Microsoft is back to where it was during the dot-com frenzy. And then it triples over the next three or so years to $158.62 today. Would you have held on for 22 years or would you have sold somewhere in between? \n\nIt's psychological and it's hard not to let your emotions take over when investing.",

Hopefully Jony Ive's departure will allow more consistent and frequent product upgrades.\n\nOne the other players- Google is stagnant with a lazy and disjointed culture and management but has a lot of potential if it streamlines and regains its focus. Facebook has been hemorrhaging user trust but they own the social networking ecosphere. Microsoft under Nadella on the other hand has been a superstar with blistering product innovation and development and incredible leadership. Expect them to continue to win in the near future.\n\nTesla has the potential to be in the top 5. They've already overcome immense hurdles in achieving scale with their manufacturing and are lightyears ahead of the competition with autonomous driving, electric capabilities, and a software-centric Silicon Valley-style corporate structure. Their rapid obliteration of the German luxury auto industry shows how consumer preference strongly favors their vehicles- who wanted a Blackberry when the iPhone was released, even if the Blackberry's specs were more impressive on paper? Musk will likely continue to expand into other product categories such as utilities and other forms of transportation.\n\nI think a game engine company like Unity or Epic Games has the potential to be in the top 5 with the rise of AR/VR and the expansion of the game platform beyond video games into a variety of immersive digital experiences. The Unity, Unreal, and Valve app and game stores are a portent of things to come.",

If you are looking for fun, you should probably just buy puts / calls on whatever you want since that\u2019s just gambling with a a little bit of DD sprinkled in.\nIf you want to try to make money (very few autism\u2019s here), you should probably look into selling options / selling credit spreads. It definitely can still be gambling (especially on a stock like ACB), but I\u2019ve seen many strategies that seem to be able to make consistent returns if you are patient. A lot of people hate on it because it can be quite hard to make enough every trade to justify the potential losses (see: picking up pennies), but in my opinion doing something like selling credit spreads 1-2 months or more out will give a much easier exit in case things go wrong. \nIn this market I\u2019ve been having a really easy time selling put credit spreads on apple, Microsoft, sometimes amazon. I go pretty far otm, and those gains make up for my losses when I just buy options. Anyways, most people here don\u2019t care about consistency or long term gains, but I definitely recommend something like put credit spreads, because even a 4-12% return every 2 weeks really compounds over time. It still takes tuning and DD tho, so be careful.",

If yes, you could hold it. Otherwise, sell it.\n\nIf you want to bet on an explosive move beyond what the market has priced in, you could close that position, and then open one with much more gamma \u2014 maybe closer to expiration, maybe closer to ATM or slightly OTM. It becomes much more risky in the sense that it can very quickly become worthless. But on the other hand, there's more potential for huge gains.\n\nSo it's a trade off.",

It doesn't have the selection you might get with the paid providers but you can access the majority of major UK and US stocks.  Trades are commission-free, providing you are willing to wait until 4pm UK time for the purchase to go through.  If you want immediate trades, it costs \u00a31.  The app is basic and won't provide you with hugely in depth analysis, but it's easy enough to use and has met my needs adequately.\n\nI am loath to give you any real advice as to how to invest your money as I only started last year and am certainly a novice investor.  My personal tact has been to mainly invest in companies that I considered 'safe bets' - Microsoft, Apple, Visa, Google - that were unlikely to tank anytime soon, although I did invest in Tesla too as I believe in the company, although it's a volatile stock.  If you want greater security, though, you could invest in index funds to ensure your investment is diversified - I imagine most people will recommend this route.\n\nI would recommend doing some reading and research on your own, using sites such as Investopedia, and there are countless books on investing if you're interested.  Take what I've said with a large grain of salt, as I am no authority on the subject, but I just thought I'd try and help out a bit as I saw the only comment you'd had was snarky and unhelpful.",

You need to learn to control your emotion. What I mean by that is when the stock price fall, you can't panic, fear, and just sell your shares. You can't let your emotion of fear dedicate your decision. Also, you need to be patience. If you are hasty you can miss out on important information that may impact your portfolio. You need to able to have faith in your investment even though they may be in negative. But most importantly you need to study and research your investment thoroughly. What's going around the world that can impact your investment (for better or worse)? What can happen in the world that can impact your investment (for better or worse)? If you have done your study and research, and you purchased your investment, then you should be confident in your investments even when the stock is not doing well.\n\nSecond: stock market will crash eventually. It will happen, over and over. But, they will always recover, and they will break new record every. Single. Time. Yes, not every single company is gonna make it, but majority of the companies will. This is why you need to understand what you're investing. For example when market crash happen, Microsoft will crash. Disney will crash. Apple will crash. Amazon will crash. But they will recover because of what these companies represent, and their foothold in the world. Like I said over and over, you have to study and research the company in your investment. That's why I personally believe studying and researching the investment is the most important job because you're trying to build strong portfolio that can withstand the crash, and thrive afterward to break new records. And don't be persuade by what the social media, news, or people around you are saying. They can't predict the future, but you can research and see what is going around the world that can impact your portfolio.\n\nThird: time in the market will beat timing the market for most investors.\n\nFourth: if you don't feel comfortable investing with large amount of money, start with $100. Get your emotion use to the feeling of stock market going up and down. Also get experience in meanwhile. When you feel comfortable and confident, invest $200, $300, and so on until you feel completely good about investing in thousands of dollar.\n\nLast, and this may sound contradicting, know when to cut your loss. This comes from knowing what the company is going through. For example, if the company is going down from lawsuit, or legal issue, or whatever it is that will bankrupt the company, it's best to cut your loss and move on. Again, this is why you want to study and research your investment. Check if they have a records of lawsuit that they seem to unable to grow.

Depend on your situation you might even want to build emergency fund before having to set money on the investment. The emergency fund purpose is to avoid touching your money in your investment/retirement account(s). Less money in your account mean less money you will make from interest.

Sure Microsoft is big, so is Amazon, so is Apple, So is Apple...... But then I'd pick them.  I really don't know if they are good for long lasting IRA stocks even though I could goof around and put them in other companies.\n\nRather, I'll just keep mine in Vanguard \"retire at year\" setting.    I think Vanguard can probably pick way better than I can.  Especially for my retirement account.\n\nNow behind door number 2 is I have about 50k+ that I can invest into the markets too.   Thus far I think Vanguard is \"pretty good\".   Can I simply just put my money in, pick something stable (like a group) and let them do the trading for me?   I'm definitely a newbie at investing.  I'd rather say \"here\" and let them do the expertise with it.  Besides that I know I can get a bank CD with about teeny interest LOL.",
