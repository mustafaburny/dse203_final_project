The thing is that you have to step out of your box and just read what's out there and what serious papers are saying. Again, we live on \"retail consumers\" box so we do not see huge potential for factories automation.\n\n&gt;With 5G, wireless connections for controllers, switches, sensors, and actuators can offer latency and reliability that rivals those of wired connections, up to 99.9999% availability and sub millisecond latency. 5G can connect higher device density, offering a path to connect \u201ceverything\u201d in the factory floor. Data transmission speeds of up to tens of Gbps support new use cases that depend on Ultra High Definition (UHD). Interference from metal objects is less of an issue, too, since multiple 5G transmitters create redundant paths to the receiver. If a metal object, such as a forklift or a piece of equipment blocks the path, the packet can use an alternate route. (paper by NXP)\n\nSo that's just one example that we are oblivious about as most of us don't work on factory floors. And there are other just as ground breaking and legitimate use cases.\n\nIt is a big mistake to disregard great technology just because we do not know applications for it. Someone else does.",

You think they're going to abandon their positions?\n\nJensen Huang is literally considered a genius in the field by his peers. Nvidia is on the cutting edge of technology that's forming the future, AI, Edge Computing, Data Centers, etc. I believe they're also developing software to compliment their chips that's going to act as a SaaS reoccurring revenue model.\n\nShorting winners because of valuation metrics is a fools errand. Perhaps the market momentarily sells down or the ARM deal doesn't go through and the stock takes a hit. Then your puts pay off. Otherwise, I think you're wasting money and time.\n\nIf you wanna short a semi company. Take a look at NXPI. Massive insider selling outside of scheduled sales. Highly tied to the auto market which has been softening. They're reliant on the fabs who are not prioritizing low end auto chips at the moment. Probably a better put.",

If anything Aerojet has become a stronger company as they wait for approvals. \n\nI agree to an extent that it can be picking up pennies, however I only participate in cash out arbitrages when the underlying company is a good sound company in case of a deal collapse. A great example was when I participated in the NXPI deal when they were suppose to be bought by QCOM in a cash deal. The deal collapsed due to regulators blocking it and their stock price significantly dropped in the short term. However, holding them for the long term afterwards paid off and I believe a similar situation with AJRD is happening. There are risks which give it a tremendous spread to cash out price and if the deal falls through yes there will be a drop. But if you hold it for the long term I believe you can recover your short term loss.",
