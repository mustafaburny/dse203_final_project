        "body": "Market and Options Summary for August 31st - \n\nDaily Synopsis\n\n* Mega-cap tech powered the Nasdaq Composite to a 0.7% gain and to new record highs on Monday. The S&amp;P 500 set an intraday record high but declined 0.2% amid relative weakness in the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, and the Russell 2000 fell 1.0%.\n* There was an absence of new macro developments, so the same tech-related stocks continued to set the winning pace at the expense of the cyclical stocks within the energy (-2.2%), materials (-1.5%), financials (-1.2%), and industrials (-1.2%) sectors. Declining issues outpaced advancing issues by more than a 2:1 margin at the NYSE.\n* Apple (AAPL 129.04, +4.23, +3.4%) and Tesla (TSLA 498.32, +55.64, +12.6%) rose 3% and 12%, respectively, as investors continued to bid shares higher following their stock splits today. Amazon (AMZN 3450.96, +49.16, +1.5%) gained 1.5% after its drone delivery unit received FAA certification.\n* AAPL and AMZN carried the S&amp;P 500 information technology (+0.4%) and consumer discretionary (+0.2%) sectors into the green, but the health care (+0.3%) and utilities (+0.3%) sectors also put in a positive performance.\n* Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index climbed 15.0% to 26.41, as investors assumed some protection against a possible downturn in equities. The popular view is that a modest correction could come in September after a strong two-month performance in the S&amp;P 500. The benchmark index ended August with an impressive 7.0% gain.\n* Separately, CNBC reported that a TikTok deal could be announced as soon as tomorrow. Front-runners Microsoft (MSFT 225.53, -3.38, -1.5%), Walmart (WMT 138.85, -1.45, -1.0%), and Oracle (ORCL 57.22, -0.66, -1.1%) declined at least 1.0% today.\n* U.S. Treasuries saw modest gains amid the underlying weakness in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined four basis points to 0.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 92.19. WTI crude futures declined 0.8%, or $0.35, to $42.62/bbl.\n* Investors did not receive any notable economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for August and Construction Spending for July on Tuesday.\n\nIndex Summary\n\n**S&amp;P 500 :** (-0.36%);**NasDaq :** (+0.86%);  \n**Russell 2000 :**(-1.08%);**Dow :**(-0.84%);  \n\\*\\*Vix :\\*\\*26.41 3.45 (+15.03%)\n\nSector Summary -\n\n*Three highest sectors for today were :*  \nInformation Technology(+0.32%); Utilities(+0.3%); Health Care(+0.24%)  \n*Three lowest sectors for today were :*  \nEnergy(-2.17%); Materials(-1.53%); Industrials(-1.24%)\n\nCommodities/Futures\n\n(1-day %), \\[5-day %\\], {10-day %}\n\n*Currency -*  \nUSDIndex : 92.379(-0.17%); \\[-0.85%\\]; {-0.6%}; {-0.6%}; BC : 11630(+1.68%); \\[+4.55%\\]; {-0.59%}\n\n*Precious Metals -*  \nGold : 1974.9(+0.06%); \\[+3.36%\\]; {+2.18%}; Silver : 27.79(+1.69%); \\[+7.66%\\]; {+4.2%}\n\n*Farming -*  \n*Soybeans : 950.5 (+1.63%); \\[+5.06%\\]; {+6.98%}; Corn : 359.25(+1.39%); \\[+2.68%\\]; {+7.37%};*  \n*Coffee : 126.35(+1.54%); \\[+4.48%\\]; {+8.22%}*\n\n*Industrials -*  \nCrude : 42.97(+1.16%); \\[+0.28%\\]; {+2.09%}  \nCopper : 3.0195(+1.14%); \\[+4.2%\\]; {+2.83%}; Nat Gas : 2.657(-1.51%); \\[+5.14%\\]; {+11.27%}\n\nOptions Fast Facts\n\n*CBOE Put/Call Ratio - 0.42*  \n*Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -* AIMT with 1390x the ADV of 77746.

        "body": "Fuck it. I was writing a super long DD post about MSFT/WMT and ORCL, but copied and pasted some other shit and deleted it all.. Here\u2019s the quick breakdown for you: ORCL will lose the bidding war.. as will every other fucking company submitting a bid. Everyone submitting such a bid will pop and fade.. im personally riding those waves. They may last minutes, they may not even come.. but every wave I scalp will be reinvested into long term WMT calls and leaps. Now onto the good stuff.. MSFT and WMT have a combined market cap of $2,086,000,000,000.. that\u2019s 2.08 TRILLION.. US.. MUTHA ..FUCKIN.. DOLLARS. That is 12 fucking zeros.. and if tendies are your preferred currency, that\u2019s enough tendies to have fed all life from the Precambrian era to present day. Now back to Oracle.. because people think they actually have a shot..... let me put this out there, their total market cap is $175B. TOTAL! Their bid was $20B in stock and cash.. TikTok is said to be valued as much as $30B. Now although WMT is interested, they partnered up with MSFT, as they need to follow their own slogan of \u201ceveryday low prices\u201d and split the tab with someone else.. guess why WMT popped today.. Their investors LOVE that slogan and splitting the bill on an acquisition is like a blue pill to their portfolios. Also, side note, WMT announced AH they\u2019re selling off some online assets to add some more money to their bank. \nSo what\u2019s my move you ask, WMT Dec 150c. Why December? Because I\u2019m not retarded and am interested in the WMT+ tendies this holiday season as well. I will additionally add leaps tomorrow. Good luck. Stay safe. And do your own DD before investing.\n\nTLDR: WMT and MSFT TikTok Deal will happen, WMT to the moon. WMT Dec 150c",

In addition, a substantial majority of our free customers historically have not converted to paying customers and we expect this will continue in the future.\n2. The term of our current agreement with Baidu expires at the end of 2020. Since the on-going tensions between US and China might have an affect on this agreement.\n3. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\n4. Sales and Marketing Expenses are increasing at a rapid pace\n5. Their competitors are well established and they always pose a threat, see below the list of them in each domain\n   1. On-premise hardware network vendors, such as Cisco Systems Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., FireEye, Inc., Imperva, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., and Riverbed Technology, Inc.;\n   2. Point-cloud solution vendors, including cloud security vendors such as Zscaler, Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. through Umbrella (formerly known as OpenDNS), content delivery network vendors such as Akamai Technologies, Inc., Limelight Networks, Inc., Fastly, Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc. through Edgecast, domain name system vendors services such as Oracle Corporation through DYN, NeuStar, Inc., and UltraDNS Corporation, and cloud SD-WAN vendors\n   3. Traditional public cloud vendors, such as [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), Inc. through Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc. through Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Corporation through Azure, and Alibaba Group Holding Limited through Alibaba Cloud\n\nIt is expected to have fierce competition, they will increase their Research and Development expenses too to ensure they are able to offer better products at competitive prices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not bear thesis though but a bull point, they have acquired S2 systems in 2019 who are known for Browser Isolation. Cloudflare and google collectively did a research on Browser Isolation. Even though, the results weren't promising, they are working towards it.   \n\n\nAlso, a key point to note is, Cloudflare leverages the idle network bandwidth to provide the free service to their customers since the highest priority is given to enterprise customers. By doing so, they were able to increase their exposure as well as establish more routes that been said, they want these customers to at least go for pay-as-you-go subscription which might help Cloudflare in terms of revenue.",

In addition, a substantial majority of our free customers historically have not converted to paying customers and we expect this will continue in the future.\n2. The term of our current agreement with Baidu expires at the end of 2020. Since the on-going tensions between US and China might have an affect on this agreement.\n3. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\n4. Sales and Marketing Expenses are increasing at a rapid pace\n5. Their competitors are well established and they always pose a threat, see below the list of them in each domain\n   1. On-premise hardware network vendors, such as Cisco Systems Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., FireEye, Inc., Imperva, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., and Riverbed Technology, Inc.;\n   2. Point-cloud solution vendors, including cloud security vendors such as Zscaler, Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. through Umbrella (formerly known as OpenDNS), content delivery network vendors such as Akamai Technologies, Inc., Limelight Networks, Inc., Fastly, Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc. through Edgecast, domain name system vendors services such as Oracle Corporation through DYN, NeuStar, Inc., and UltraDNS Corporation, and cloud SD-WAN vendors\n   3. Traditional public cloud vendors, such as [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), Inc. through Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc. through Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Corporation through Azure, and Alibaba Group Holding Limited through Alibaba Cloud\n\nIt is expected to have fierce competition, they will increase their Research and Development expenses too to ensure they are able to offer better products at competitive prices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not bear thesis though but a bull point, they have acquired S2 systems in 2019 who are known for Browser Isolation. Cloudflare and google collectively did a research on Browser Isolation. Even though, the results weren't promising, they are working towards it.   \n\n\nAlso, a key point to note is, Cloudflare leverages the idle network bandwidth to provide the free service to their customers since the highest priority is given to enterprise customers. By doing so, they were able to increase their exposure as well as establish more routes that been said, they want these customers to at least go for pay-as-you-go subscription which might help Cloudflare in terms of revenue.",
