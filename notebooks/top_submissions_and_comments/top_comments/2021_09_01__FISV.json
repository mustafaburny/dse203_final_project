I will say it's decidedly micro and anecdotal, whereas I'm taking the most macro view: Fastly has the most advanced tech that's respected by the most tech heavy players.  That has to be worth something.  \n\nI'd certainly be bitter if I did buy and hold, but I was selling tranches of FSLY on the times it was surging above $100.  I did however rebuild positions as it was falling to and through $70.  I thought it had a least one more run to $100 in it.  \n\nIf Roberts' prognosis is true, then it's been a heck of a turn.  \n\n Fastly was ready and able to solve the world's problems when COVID came along.  Seems pretty quick to be deemed irrelevant.  \n\nAnd what's even more crazy is their death was essentially triggered by Trump having a tantrum after social media users embarrassed him into thinking he was about to have a million person rally when in fact it was just 6,000 people.  \n\nHe made up that bizarre threat that tiktok was a national security threat... yet somehow this \"threat\" would be allowed to continue for 90 days as long as it was force-sold to the a Trump-supporting Walmart heirs.  That's a whale-sized pile of crimes and corruption right there.  \n\nInvestors speculated on what percent of Fastly's business might be impaired.  5%?  12%?  \n\nThe shocker came: China had abruptly killed 100% of their Fastly-Tiktok business.  Not just the US part.  All of it.  They'd either stolen or replaced FSLY's tech, all because of the tantrum threat.  \n\nI listened as Fastly management responded.  It sounded unpaniced and measured.  They talked about \"reserving the capacity\" in case Tiktok were to switch back.  At first that sounded ok.  But once it became obvious that wasn't going to happen, it sounded like they were still pining for that lost lover.  That was somewhat concerning to me.  Move on, and tell us what big client bases you're going to attack instead. \n\nThey did seem to recognize what the market was ruffled about, which at the time was Cloudflare's claim of distinction around security.  They acted seemingly appropriately by folding in Signal Sciences pretty quickly, so I was feeling somewhat comfortable about that.  \n\nHowever it's been quite awhile and I haven't seen or heard much from Fastly. They don't seem to have turned people on to the compute-on-edge, which feels to me like it might have huge potential.  \n\nWorse, when they've had hiccups, like with Tiktok or the large one hour outage this spring, it sounds like customers are flipping away from Fastly and the customer continues to do just fine without them (?)\n\nI think I read that after Amazon cut over when Fastly had the spring outage, they haven't bothered to flip back. If true, that doesn't speak too well of Fastly being essential.\n\nStill, if we think of NET and FSLY as Coke and Pepsi, there's always going to be a market for both.  I can't see Fastly just ceasing to exist, except through buy out of course.  I'd guessed some old blue chip like Cisco or IBM or Intel might buy them.",

        "body": "Firm's market cap climbing to $1 trillion\n\nOne trillion dollars.  \nThat's how much at least one analyst believes Cisco Systems Inc. will be worth in a few years--and you'd be hard pressed to find anyone to disagree.  \nThe San Jose-based networking behemoth's stock closed March 14 at $131.75 a share, slightly down from its March 10 one-year high of $141.88 (The entire Nasdaq slid 4 percent on March 14.)  \nThirty-seven investment banks recommend either a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" None recommend a \"sell\" or even a \"hold.\"  \nOn any given day the volume of Cisco shares traded is the equivalent of every man, woman and child living in California--having hit 33 million as recently as March 9.  \nGeorge Kelly, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York who took Cisco public a decade ago, is one of the Cisco bulls. Cisco's stock is trading at roughly 120 times Mr. Kelly's earnings' estimate of $1.13 per share.  \nThe multiple, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a number that places a value on a stock. It is a ratio of the price of the stock to the profit of a company expressed per shares outstanding.  \n\"A low P/E usually signals investors are uncomfortable,\" Mr. Kelly said.  \nAs a reference, in 2000 Cisco's multiple of 120 compares to Microsoft Corp.'s multiple of 55 and Intel Corp.'s multiple of 42. Yet their values are below Cisco.  \n\"One of the reasons investors value Cisco so highly right now is that, unlike Microsoft, Cisco doesn't have the uncertainty of a Justice Department settlement--it's a much cleaner situation,\" Mr. Kelly said. \"Second, Cisco has had a tremendous track record of continuous upside surprises. And Cisco is viewed as opening several new markets, the biggest of which is optical, which is expected to be an explosive market.\"  \nPerfect returns  \nPaul Weinstein, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, believes a $1 trillion market capitalization (stock price multiplied by shares outstanding) is within reach in a few years. He said Cisco's stock has increased 1,000 times, a perfect 100 percent annual return since it launched its IPO in 1990.  \n\"We humbly submit that over the next two to three years, Cisco could be the first trillion dollar market cap company--and don't think they wouldn't love it,\" Mr. Weinstein wrote in his \"strong buy\" recommendation.  \nAs of March 14, Microsoft's market cap stood about $510 billion, compared with Cisco's $465 billion, which is threefold the annual revenue of the state of California.  \nMichael Neiberg, lead analyst in the communications equipment sector for Chase Hambrecht &amp; Quist in New York, said Cisco is turning a lot of investors long-term.  \nRecommended  \nTechnology  \nRedwood City-based Jasper Therapeutics drops nearly 19% in Wall Street debut  \nTechnology  \nIonQ sets sights on new growth targets after going public  \nTechnology  \nTesla is launching a lottery with a $10,000 prize to encourage workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19  \n\"If you had picked a price point to sell \\[high\\] at anytime in the past 10 years, you would have been wrong,\" he said. \"They have such an impressive track record of growing ... that the financial community isn't thinking in terms of a multiple of what they're earning this year, but what they will be earning three or four years down the line.\"  \nAn opposing view  \nThere are market watchers that are dubious, however, about the high valuation assigned to a large-cap company like Cisco.  \nJeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School, wrote this week in The Wall Street Journal that the high valuation assigned to large-cap technology stocks--Cisco is at the top of his list--are unsustainable.  \n\"History has shown that whenever companies, no matter how great, get priced above 50 to 60 times earnings, buyer beware,\" Mr. Siegel wrote.  \nHis statistical research concludes when companies reach big-cap status--ranked in the top 50 by market capitalization--their ability to generate long-term double-digit growth slows dramatically.  \nYoung bucks in a different field  \nLooking at multiples of high-flying valley gazelles that compete with Cisco is almost meaningless.  \nTake Juniper Networks Inc. The firm has rapidly gained a 15 percent market share in the high-end routing market, cracking a lucrative niche dominated by Cisco.  \nJuniper posted its first profit for the fourth quarter of 1999 of 3 cents per share. Extrapolating that performance out to a 12-month period would conservatively give the company a profit of 12 cents per share. But with its stock price closing March 14 at $245 a share, the upstart company can boast a P/E ratio of 2,042.  \nIs its stock more valuable than Cisco's? In a word, yes. At least Wall Street believes so.  \nBut both Messrs. Neiberg and Kelly note that what Wall Street is valuing is relatively short-term growth--the explosiveness of these new valley firms.  \n\"For the early adopters and early movers, Wall Street is willing to assign these values,\" Mr. Neiberg said.  \nBut he added that what Wall Street is betting on is extremely rapid growth for a year or two. As the rapid growth slows, the multiples will fall into a more earthly range.  \nComparing P/E ratios of other industry giants in different technology spaces may be tempting to investors, but Mr. Neiberg is wary of mixing two different dynamics.  \n\"Both \\[Microsoft and Intel\\] are benefiting from the PC revolution,\" Mr. Neiberg said. \"But they are in a much more moderate growth phase. The more rapid growth is to interconnect all those computers, and Cisco is the standard bearer for all that interconnection.\"  \nYou can reach Mr. Taylor at dtaylor@amcity.com.",

That is absurd, Tesla made $31.5bn in revenue in 2020 whereas VW made $258bn in 2020. Fundamentally, the current valuation of Tesla is wrong. That's the problem with Tesla.",

I am 59 and when I was in my twenties I was paying off student loans while putting what was left in options trading.  I made what felt like a small fortune in Csco options before I lost big. \n\nI stopped trading options in 1995 and starting gradually building up a stock portfolio.  When the IPhone came out I was I intrigued about the new  Apple. When I was at an awards dinner I saw my first sergeant watching a live basketball game on his iPhone\u2014holy cow!  I bought 400 shares the next day, I think it was trading around 40 bucks a share in early 2007. That $16,000 appl investment is worth $2.25m today.
