I have V in my Roth account, and won't sell it, basically forever, or at least 5-10 years. Visa and mastercard are likely the only finance companies related to consumer spending that have an actual moat due to their ability to process payments immediately in a way that literally every other bank (large or small, old or fintech) is required to utilize their channels to have payments process.\n\nYes, SQ is a bank now. Yes I'm happy they've had a huge run up for the past couple years. Yes I'm sad that I sold half of my position when I had 100% return. No, I do not plan on selling more. Yes SQ is fantastic, and yes I hold a similar amount in PYPL as well. \n\nNo, I do not think SQ or PYPL will surpass visa as the king of payment processing. Visa is a giant, and could simply reveal their own p2p lending platform if any of the minor banks manages to cross their moat....it still hasn't been crossed yet.",

I think you could possibly see this happen with Amazon and Facebook, but I think it\u2019s unlikely to happen to the others. Anyway, this action was not catastrophic for the telecom sector. If anything, the breakup of the monopoly enabled innovation and increased the TAM of telecom companies. If it was just Ma Bell in town, think how long they would\u2019ve resisted DSL or cable internet and tried to keep us all on dialup.\n\n\nWith IE, the problem was that they used their platform (Windows) to monopolize the browser space. I think there\u2019s an extremely compelling case to argue that Google and Apple will be in trouble with this and be forced to spin off their app stores, but this will not cripple them \u2014 the vast majority of revenue does not come from App Store monopolies. Microsoft stock has been on a rampage since then, as well.\n\nTLDR: long term investors should not fear antitrust action under current regulations.",

My thoughts are like this because while we do see some of the top tech names pretty overextended via RSI they just went through a healthy minor correction on Thursday and Friday. They might even recover considering how bullish they are but regardless many of the names in energy and financials are undervalued right now and that presents opportunity. \n\nThe recent crash happened because everything was overextended but right now it\u2019s only certain sectors so that makes things different. We might end up playing a seesaw effect with financials and energy as some move away from tech. They have a massive amount of upside potential and that could possibly balance out some of the people moving away from the overextended sectors.",

It has no foreign transaction fees, or ATM fees at certain ATMs anyway. I'll certainly try it here. MasterCard generally gives a better exchange rate than Visa, so if I can use this debit card with no fees, that would be advantageous over my Schwab debit card, which is Visa.\n\nWhen I get the card, I'll try it out and see what happens.",
