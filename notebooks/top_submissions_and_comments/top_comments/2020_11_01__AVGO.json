Maybe they'll make a massive turn around, but calling it seriously undervalued isn't right. There's more competitors in the space now, and the only criteria they're better in now than then is reputation, and they're losing that fast. \n\nWouldn't touch it if it was me. Stuff like Qualcomm or Broadcom is more interesting to me.",

But i do rather tend to like growth companies more but i do own and plan to invest into dividend paying companies also. I think a mix of both is best.

As i have just started a new portfolio from 0$ and want to grow it as much as possible. i own 64 companies from the US stock market, BYD from the Hong Kong exchange and some Bitcoin (i only like Bitcoin or ETH in the crypto wolrd) but that is only a 2% target of my portfolio. \n\nA couple of good dividend paying companies that i own in my opinion are: AT&amp;T, AbbVie,  Store Capital, Broadcom, JP Morgan,JNJ, Home Depot and a couple of others that have lower dividend yields but they are more growth focused.\n\nMy average dividend yield for the whole portfolio is just 1% but as i told you i am more growth focused",

        "body": "I understand the desire, but those sparse expirations, low volumes, and crazy wide bid/asks are all warning flags to steer clear of options on those ETFs. You're just throwing away money trading those options.\n\nA better idea would be to figure out what the top 3 holdings of each of those funds are and see if any of those companies have highly liquid options. Then trade options on those companies as a sort of proxy.\n\nFor example, the top three holdings of SOXX are AVGO, NVDA, TXN. All three have decent liquidity.\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SOXX/holding\n\nYou can then use an asset correlation app to see which of those individual stocks with liquid options most closely correlates to the fund's performance. For example:\n\n[Portfolio Visualizer asset correlation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&amp;symbols=SOXX+AVGO+NVDA+TXN&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;tradingDays=60&amp;months=36)\n\nTXN is the closest with a .84 correlation to SOXX.\n\n\n\nFWIW, you're paying an obscene expense ratio on ARKK. You'd likely make more money over the long run holding QQQ instead of ARKK.",

All of the companies they supply are behemoths, they only compete with Intel and Samsung, (Intel has basically given up and actually wants to use TSMC's chips) they are based in Taiwan, so no anti-trust shenanigans, they are rapidly expanding with large profits (creating more factories literally approved a 17 billion dollar factory a couple of days ago), and they also have the fastest CPUs.\n\nAMD is also a great buy as they are rapidly expanding and Intel/NVidia won't have a decent response for months.\n\nI'll go into more detail if you want, but I'm not even sure if you would consider these companies. If you are feeling very risky I'd buy Corsair (that's where all my money is) because I've made +95% in the past month and a half going from 2k to 4k and they will keep going up significantly at least until January.",
