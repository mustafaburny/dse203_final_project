You're just throwing away money trading those options.\n\nA better idea would be to figure out what the top 3 holdings of each of those funds are and see if any of those companies have highly liquid options. Then trade options on those companies as a sort of proxy.\n\nFor example, the top three holdings of SOXX are AVGO, NVDA, TXN. All three have decent liquidity.\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SOXX/holding\n\nYou can then use an asset correlation app to see which of those individual stocks with liquid options most closely correlates to the fund's performance. For example:\n\n[Portfolio Visualizer asset correlation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&amp;symbols=SOXX+AVGO+NVDA+TXN&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;tradingDays=60&amp;months=36)\n\nTXN is the closest with a .84 correlation to SOXX.\n\n\n\nFWIW, you're paying an obscene expense ratio on ARKK.

All of the companies they supply are behemoths, they only compete with Intel and Samsung, (Intel has basically given up and actually wants to use TSMC's chips) they are based in Taiwan, so no anti-trust shenanigans, they are rapidly expanding with large profits (creating more factories literally approved a 17 billion dollar factory a couple of days ago), and they also have the fastest CPUs.\n\nAMD is also a great buy as they are rapidly expanding and Intel/NVidia won't have a decent response for months.\n\nI'll go into more detail if you want, but I'm not even sure if you would consider these companies. If you are feeling very risky I'd buy Corsair (that's where all my money is) because I've made +95% in the past month and a half going from 2k to 4k and they will keep going up significantly at least until January.",

I'm a millennial and I played it really early on, and it was really popular among a smaller crowd at the time. And it wasn't really marketed towards kids at that time (I was in college as were most people I knew playing it). It wasn't until it started moving towards its full release that it started to get uber popular with kids, partly through gamimg becoming a bigger thing on YouTube I think.\n\nEven Fortnite might have had that cycle with some people. I was subbed for UT4 and got into the Fortnite beta, played it and didn't care (this was before it got BR). Maybe there were people younger than me who liked it and stuck with it and eventually it evolved.",
