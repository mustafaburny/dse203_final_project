And the person that bought the shares never actually received them.  \n\nNow, in practice, the broker just had to report it as FTD, and the shorter is still on the hook for the value of the shares.  When a stock appears on the threshold list, that ticker has now been highlighted as having a high potential for manipulation or other fuckery.  At the end of the day, it *should highlight the fuckery to the SEC, but it really means nothing.   GME has been on the list many times before.

Sell 100 2023 puts at a $1.50 strike, collect $110 in premium each contract, use the $11k to sell 77 puts at same strike and premium, and cascade it down? Quick maths in Excel has me able to do this 11 times to control roughly 344 contracts, and if Biden bails them out and they survive then I end up with $52k?\n\nAlso if the underlying gets a bit of a bump and I want to close my position, I think I could do the reverse and buy to close my positions, freeing up my collateral to buy to close the next level up. So for example if I can buy to close for an average of .70, I make $40 off each of the 344 contracts for a profit of $13,000?\n\nAm I missing something crucial? Max downside is $15k loss (bankruptcy) max upside is $37k profit (options expire worthless)",

Movie lineups for 2021 are also trash at the moment. \n\nCOVID doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. Vaccines could help.\n\nAMC is going to be a YOLO play that might net you 60-80% gains depending on when you YOLO IF you win. Since 2017, their share price was never too high even pre-covid. \n\nOptions would be a better play if you don't want to YOLO but earnings are considerably lower.\n\nIMO, it's a risky play and I wouldn't buy",
