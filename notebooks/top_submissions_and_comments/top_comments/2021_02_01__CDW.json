        "body": "I think this is my biggest mental hurdle for GME if you take away the whole short squeeze thing.  What is their value proposition long term?  There is no moat in selling consoles (as you mentioned).  The MS deal certainly helps a little, but not enough to increase its value significantly.\n\nLet's assume for a moment GME reshapes their store into something of an \"experience\" center and pivots to ecommerce (MS, DIS tried this with their physical stores to mimic Apple with mixed results if I recall correctly).  That can only last so long before you hit a wall.  If successful, others will copy then the competitive advantage disappears.  I can see a remote chance where it becomes a premiere/niche location for gaming purchases, but is that enough to drive revenue increases?\n\nLet's say they then pivot to strong ecommerce presence.  If I am purchasing online for a console/game etc, then why not just buy direct from MS or Sony?  or better yet, Amazon with my prime and get it the next day?  Is it enough to shift the existing consumers over and add more?  I guess they could use their physical stores as pick up locations which would be the only advantage they would have over the others.\n\nIf we then assumed they are pivoting to PC store/experience center.  Well, PC component stores are generally low margin in the past (probably still is).  Unless they get some exclusivity deals (and hence eating further into margins) with some PC component/accessory manufacturer.\n\n$20 billion market cap would put them in similar cap size as HP, CDW, Logitech.\n\nI would love to see it pleasantly surprise me though.

You can quibble about quality and use cases, but you'll find a metastore, some columnar storage, a fast/parallel MPP and maybe a batch engine alongside. If you're sitting there thinking CLDR is \"hadoop\" your information is from about 2012 and needs updating. \n\nAnd *that* is the real problem the company has. Its executive team simply do not understand what it is they sell and do not know how to communicate it to the market. What's a Salesforce? CRM on the cloud. What's a Snowflake? DWH on the cloud. What's a DB? DE/DS on the cloud. Easy, punchy, clear, accessible.\n\nWhat's a Cloudera? Well apparently \"We deliver an enterprise data cloud for any data, anywhere, from the Edge to AI.\"\n\nIf anyone knows wtf that means in today's market then I'd love to know, and I *worked at the company when that slogan was coined*.\n\nDig into the on-boarding experiences and how you're supposed to use this stuff and it just gets worse and worse and worse. They're not a cloud stock yet - they still do 80-90 percent of their business on prem in traditional form factors; this isn't a bad thing (e.g. they do actually turn a profit) but if you tell investors you're all cloudy then don't return cloud numbers then.... duh.\n\nIf and when CLDR decide to clean house and turf out their useless marketing function and hire a few product leaders who aren't just ex-Yahoo rejects out of their depth then they could easily be a force to be reckoned with. Until then they're probably going to spin their wheels praying for IBM to swoop in and buy them out at a price where not everyone is underwater.",

One thing to keep in mind with CRM is that, in light of the Slack acquisition, they are positioned for less operating profit.

I think CRM is likely in the penalty box for 2021 until they can prove that they can scale efficiently.",

        "body": "You nearly precisely echoed my thoughts. I was a Facebook owner right up until the legal case came out with nearly every state attorney general on board. By comparison, the 2001 Microsoft antitrust case had only 20 AGs. \n\nBefore the legal case, my logic for being a Facebook investor was simple: its network effects, even if they were getting weaker over time in their core social media products, were strong enough to let them print money in the near/medium term and they could use that cash to wisely acquire new social media networks to sustain their network effects over the long term. Meanwhile, my attorney girlfriend noted that Facebook might be the single biggest antitrust target for the government compared to the other FAANGs, primarily because of their acquisition strategy. Through into that growing discontent from the general public + politicians on **both** sides of the aisle and Facebook and it's clear Facebook had a big target on its back (which is too bad because - hot take - I actually like grown-up Mark Zuckerberg). The case was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nRe: VR. Also agree with you there. It's like how I feel about Gamestop  justifying a $20B+ market cap: that would only happen if the company did a total 180 and went into e-commerce or downloading games. Sure, it's possible, but unlikely. A coal miner could launch CRM software and wreck SalesForce, but the chances of that happening are exceedingly small. VR is worse than those two examples because it isn't yet clear that VR will be a major industry with big profits for key players; we know e-commerce/software downloading/CRM are all high-demand services.\n\nThat's not to say that there won't be small divisions within large companies that end up being big earnings drivers in the future. It happens. So it's important to not dismiss out-of-hand any currently small division or business just because it's currently small. But as an investor, I'd need a stronger justification (and a fair price) before I'd make an investment in anything based on VR.",

So if your gut is wrenching, and you're thinking about hitting that sell button to stop the bleeding let's talk about some **expectations** and realistic choices. I'm bullish about GME as a company long term. **I've been following this story since August 2020**, and the Ryan Cohen factor has me bought in. **Without Ryan Cohen, I would have absolutely sold everything at $200**. Also, imma try to keep this short and not write the neo testament cause you fuckers can barley read as it is.\n\nDisclaimer: **THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.** I have literally no idea what I'm talking about and really prefer the green crayons, cause they taste like salty moss covered rocks. I know nothing John Snow.\n\nJust a starter lesson. A B H. Always Be Hedging\n\nDid you buy GME? Did you ride with us from &lt;$100 to $480? Did you sell nothing? Bro, you need to hedge. I personally sold 1/4 of my GME at $190 &amp; $300. Cause it could go the other way. While betting it all on 00 and it hitting is awesome, if you hedge, you still get to buy a couple G&amp;Ts and some coke from the stripper in your lap at the end of night, instead of going back to your hotel room worried about the cost of breakfast tomorrow.\n\nAs Robert Downey Jr once said ...\n\n&gt;\"You went full retard man, never go full retard.\"\n\nGetting out right now, is ok\n\nLook, you can get out right now. It's possible that GME continues it's sell off. We had a huge push in hype from \\~$20 -&gt; \\~$38. This was the Ryan Cohen board seat(s) announcement. Then again -&gt; \\~$60 then again to -&gt; $85 and then the after burners started to kick in. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Likely, the shorts allowed the price to almost 3x in that time, and purposely got out of their most fucked positions. And, they absolutely re-shorted at $300 &amp; $400. Pretty fucking good deal for the shorts. Cause they've made a shit ton off of that trade. I understand #holdtheline and #imnotselling and fuck wall street &amp; the SEC. Especially the SEC. But the goal my apes is to make fucking money. And a key thing most of us did not do while the price hovered around $300 for a couple days was FollowTheFuckingTrend. AKA, once the RH bullshit happened, and momentum got fucked, we could of all gotten out to get back in later. It's a thought know, but if you cut off huge swaths of buying power, a stock is going to fall.\n\nSo if you're down, and you can accept that before it gets better or we **go to fucking Andromeda** your investment may halve, then awesome. You're a true \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd18. But, if this shit has gotten cray for you. Sell, it's ok. No one even has to know. GME could go to $40 or to $30 a share. And then you could buy back in. It's OK to decide you'd rather take a loss and use that capitol for some other trade than take all your cash to burn on the pyre of retardation. But you would get some sw33t WSB karma for doing so.\n\nIf you do choose this route, **read up on the wash sale rule** so you don't fuck your taxes. Again, this is not financial advice, I'm not sure why washing anything has to do with taxes.\n\nThings could pop off cause of good news / whale / long HF\n\nLook, the short data seems fucked. Check out this post\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbxb9i/why\\_i\\_highly\\_doubt\\_some\\_posted\\_s3\\_si\\_numbers\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbxb9i/why_i_highly_doubt_some_posted_s3_si_numbers_and/)\n\nLikely the short interest is still as high as ever. Even though there are millions of us. Not everyone of us is a GME bull. Bears exist on WSB, and bears also visit everyday but don't subscribe. We are but passengers in the night waiting for people with REAL FUCKING MONEY to make this shit move. Portnoy of whatever the fuck that dude's name is, is not real fucking money obviously. So good news could come out. Ryan Cohen could increase his stake. Some firm could provide a ridiculous price target for GME. Things could get popping, but it would have to be HF, whales, trading houses getting in and getting in big.\n\nOfficial short data out from FINRA Feb 9th, 1 days away\n\nThe official report of what the short interest is in GME at the end of Jan comes out this day. This will reveal if the media has been full of bullshit, 99% chance they have been, or not. This could be another catalyst of buying as it'll show you, what you already know. GME is shorted over 100%. But now there are shorts at \\~$300 &amp; $400, Instead of only at \\~$60. Harder to bust, but still bustable. And, busting makes me feel good. (Hopefully someone gets this reference)\n\n[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)\n\nQ4 Earnings Call 2021-03-25, 44 days away\n\nIf you are committed to GME as a business and are looking for that sweet short squeeze cherry, this is a big fucking day. We all expect GME to have their first positive earnings QTR in 7 freaking QTRs. It will be huge if they beat expectations. Everyone made sure to buy from GME before Jan ended, right? I bought $250 bucks worth of games. Can't wait to not find enough time to play any of them. This could have big money pile in, fucking the short. It's the event that all of us autists holding April calls are waiting for sweet tendies. If you're a \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd18, there is no reason to not wait until this event.\n\nGME annual Board meeting 2021-06-11?, 124\u00a0days away\n\n*FYI idk when the fuck this meeting is. last year is was June 12. So I'm assuming 2nd Friday of June for this year.*\n\nStill only in for the short squeeze eh? Well this is the other catalyst. This is the meeting where, perhaps Ryan Cohen may give Sherman \"the pedigree\", \"the spear\", \"the Figure Four Leglock \", \"the Macho Man\" RIP and becomes CEO. This is a huge fucking deal. The other thing that may happen, as they need to shake out 3 board members at this meeting is a share recall. RC and GME insiders, may have all purposely lent their shares to be shorted. This could be a moment where they all tell their brokers they don't want to lend their shares anymore. Then good news happens, etc, snowball squoze.\n\nThe great beyond, unknown # of days away\n\nAt this point the squeeze didn't happen. You've effectively held your shares for \\~35% of a year if you are still \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd18. You have two choices. Sell and put the capital into something you have more conviction in. Or become a long term investor in GME and make it to at least the 1 year mark so you get long term capital gains tax. Again, this is not financial advice, after what happened Jan 6th, I'm not sure I would be long on the capital? What am I talking about? And $GME could be like TSLA. A slow, arduous burn over time. Many things would have to go right over the next 2+ years, but they could \\*shrug\\*\n\nTake this as you will, but realize for those thinking they we're going to 10x in a week's effort ... sometimes it's that easy, sometimes its not. Remember **$CRM** on 2020-08-26? Yah, those people's lotto tickets printed fucking hard as hell. But if everyone knows the game, then it's probably getting late. Unless you are some electric car company that defies all rational valuation.",

That way, you don't get scared when Citron decides to say $PLTR is going to 10, and you don't hold $CHK all the way to delisting.\n\nThe key thing in my trading is keeping track of a stock for a solid month or two before buying in. With some companies, you can't really do that because they're volatile or they simply are too new. But, if you've watched the price long enough, you'll get an intuition on how the stock reacts to good and bad news, and be able to automatically know when's a good time to buy or not. \n\n$CRM for example, I've been watching for a few months now. They had their initial price drop all the way from $280 to the $215-225 range, and after a few weeks of sitting there, I knew that it 1. wouldn't go down any more, and 2. that if I wanted to buy in, then this would probably be a good time to do so. If it went down to $200, then it would've dropped $80 from their peak and I'd only have lost $15-25 per. share - those odds seem pretty good because dropping $80 in total isn't likely, and even if it went even lower, then I wouldn't be losing all that much. Realistically, the company will recover: I have good feelings about their software platforms and I've done a good amount of research on the company to know that they won't be leaving any time soon. So with all that information: 1. cut loss at $200, or even lower if you're feeling risky; 2. buy-in from $215-225 (and there will be multiple opportunities to buy because their next catalyst will be Feb. 25 - not sure on the outlook of their Slack acquisition yet, so I'll need to check if it's still looking good); 3. low price target: 250, medium: 265, high: 280, really high: 315. \n\nBut, it's also easy to be very optimistic about companies and stocks right now given our market. I've only started since last year, but this is the way that's worked for me. Even if I'm totally wrong in my analysis, I think it's a general rule to *really* identify what you're going to be stopping at if it goes up or down, because then you won't be subject to your emotions telling you to get out when the going's good.",

So, after losing 50% of portfolio then I stopped the weeklies.\nNow, I only trade in growth companies after reseraching. I follow four rules mostly:\n\n1. High growth companies (usually have high IV as well) - I have leaps for PLTR, NIO, XPEV,SKLZ, SQ, MVIS, ABNB etc.( had DKNG, SE,RIOT and JMIA but sold too early yet made goos money)\n\n2. ER corrected companies- I buy leaps for those companies which have good performance but got corrected. Like EHTH, QCOM,AMD, CRM,U,UNH, ANTM, ENPH.\n\n3. Companies which have been consolidation phase- NVDA, CRM since,  I can't time them well so I buy longer period calls and IV is relatively low so they price not that bad for me.\n\n4. Upcoming trends: like currently semi conductors shortages so i bought TSM, TER, AMD, QCOM and NVDA are also in that sector. Also, traditional internal combustion engine companies like GM and Ford making headlines on Ev  and current initiatives are making me bullish on that so I have been buying their leaps too. I missed the TSLA train but I dont want to miss others.\n\nLeaps give me 70%-80% success rate in this bullish market. It may not give very fast returns but helps me focus on my full time job give me less stress than short term trades.\n\nSorry for the long message.",

In researching to install solar at the house, one of the big problems with solar arrays (when you don't live in a flat, open area) is that production is drops to the level of the lowest producing panel in the array. That big tree at the corner of my property starts throwing some shade on the array, all of those panels in full sun are slacking. Enphase makes \"micro-inverters\" which allow each panel to operate independently. Their product makes the solar installation a little more expensive on a per-panel basis. In non-ideal solar areas (like where I live), though, the price per kWh produced is better -- or, more accurately, I can produce the power I need with fewer panels (less space AND less money). I expect additional federal incentives either this year or next, so anticipate an increase in residential solar installations. And I'm hoping growth in residential solar installations in places that aren't wide open, flat, super sunny locations drive micro-inverter sales.",

Their brain trust is grade A and is continually iterating and improving.  Also, SPWR owns a large chunk of ENPH shares still as part of an agreement when ENPH was restructuring. SPWR makes panels with ENPH micros built in - ENPH is the provider for these. So don't be surprised if good earnings for ENPH reflects in upward momentum for SPWR and vice versa.

For a description of how the PUREVAPTM works:\n\nhttps://www.pyrogenesis.com/products-services/innovation-custom-process-development/purevap/\n\nWhile the technology for the PUREVAPTM application specific to Silicon may belong to HPQ, all other PUREVAPTM uses are owned by Pyrogenesis. As they said in their first News Release on the technology, from 10/2018, \u201cPyroGenesis\u2019 PUREVAPTM is a disruptive process that has the ability to revolutionize the way the mining &amp; metallurgy industry produces metals.\u201d \n\nhttps://www.pyrogenesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PR-PYROGENESIS-ANNOUNCES-PUREVAP%E2%84%A2-PROCESS-BREAKTHROUGH.pdf.\n \n \n \nHPQ PUREVAPTM for Silicon production\n \nThis section is quite long, however I felt it is appropriate as Pyrogenesis and HPQ are tied quite closely and the efforts in advancing this technology are from Pyrogenesis.\n \nIt all started in 2016, when Pyrogenesis received an $8.26M contract to provide HPQ Silicon Resources (Ticker: HPQ.V) with a PUREVAPTM Quartz Reduction Reactor (QRR) pilot system, aimed at producing Silicon metal directly from Quartz. This is a new process that allows a One-Step production of High Purity Silicon Metal of 4N+ (3N is 99.9% and 4N is 99.99% Si), the key to a green and low-cost metallurgical production of Solar Grade Silicon Metal (SoG-Si), which is necessary for the conversion of the sun\u2019s energy into electricity via solar cell.\n\nSince then, Pyrogenesis has helped build Gen 2 of the PUREVAPTM QRR, and is currently working on the PUREVAPTM NSiR (Nano Silicon Reactor), a modification to their PUREVAP QRR which allows it to produce nano size silicon for Lithium-ion batteries.\n \nHPQ\u2019s website states: \u201cIn collaboration with world-class technology partners, HPQ is working towards demonstrating its unique capacity to be the lowest-cost producer of the advanced Silicon Metal (Si) materials needed for the next generations of Lithium-ion batteries, silicones, and aluminum alloys.\u201d\n \n[Update: the near-term priority of the company has shifted to focus on silicon nanomaterials for the battery space; it appears this is due to the value proposition from the nano silicon market being greater than from the Solar market &amp; them wanting to develop their technology for this without delay. HPQ mentioned in the AGM June 2020 presentation below that perhaps further down the line they would go back to address SoG Si UMG (upgraded metallurgical grade) for the Solar industry.\n\nMr. Tourillon mentioned in the AGM presentation Q&amp;A session (at Timestamp 19:30-20:05):\n \n[06-30-2020]: VIDEO: HPQ AGM 2020 Question &amp; Answer session: https://youtu.be/TlkcRcyedBs\n \n\u201cExpansion of the solar business is going to be limited by the problem related to the energy storage space, so it\u2019s not really a high priority at this moment. The QRR gives us an ace in the hole in the battery space [\u2026] the potential for the market in what we are doing in nano far outweighs whatever we dreamt of at the beginning in the solar part of the business\u201d\n \nThe following corporate presentation clarifies the current plans from HPQ:\nhttps://hpqsilicon.com/presentation/innovative-silicon-solutions-june-2020/ ]\n\n\nFrom this partnership, PYR will receive royalties representing 10% of HPQ\u2019s revenues, should the commercialization of the PUREVAPTM process with Silicon prove successful. They also currently own more than 10% of HPQ\u2019s shares (~14% fully diluted as of 07/03/2020).\n \nThere is lots of interest in industry and academia for the next generation of Li-ion batteries, and especially high-capacity Silicon anode material that can replace graphite. Enter the PUREVAPTM NSiR (Nano Silicon Reactor)\n \n \nPUREVAPTM Nano Silicon Reactor (NSiR)\n \nHPQ and Pyrogenesis are working on the PUREVAPTM NSiR, an upgraded version of the PUREVAPTM QRR Gen 2 reactor, that can transform melted Si metal into spherical Si Nano-powders and Nanowires. They have updated their milestones and by Q4 2020 are expecting to start to produce the nanopowders and nanowire samples for delivery to some battery manufacturers and research institutions, targeting delivery for this year. These key materials are what is needed to produce silicon anodes for the next generation of Li-ion batteries. Impressively, these anodes induce a 20-40% gain in the energy density of Li-ion batteries when using graphite anodes, resulting in a much higher storage capacity! This allows for smaller size batteries for electronic devices and electric cars.\n \nhttps://hpqsilicon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HPQ-NSIR-PUREVAP-RELEASE-FEBRUARY-11-2020-FINAL-VERS-1.pdf\n \nhttps://hpqsilicon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/HPQ-PR-PUREVAP-Battery-Material-VERS_CL7.pdf\n \n \nThe PUREVAPTM Gen 1 NSiR assembly and testing is going on in the next few months, with process validation &amp; optimization expected in Q4 2020. In parallel with this, from Q2 to Q4 2020, engineering design of semi-continuous PUREVAPTM Gen 2 NSiR is expected from Q2 to Q4 2020, with assembly and operation in Q4 2020.\n \nFor all the timeline details of HPQ\u2019s plans with the PUREVAPTM, see their 2020 corporate presentation:\nhttps://hpqsilicon.com/presentation/innovative-silicon-solutions-june-2020/\n \n \nThere are two difficulties that has made using silicon as anode material such a difficult process.\n \n1) Resolving silicon swelling and cracking during the lithiation phase represents a significant challenge in order to achieve a comparable cyclage stability to graphite, the reference anode material of Li-ion batteries [see link of 2020-04 NR above]. According to HPQ\u2019s AGM 2020 corporate presentation, one effective strategy is, if they can get the nanoparticles 150 nm\n \n2) Commercial-scale production of silicon anode materials is prohibitively expensive at the moment, cost reductions are needed to make them viable in the market.\n \nThe issues above are being addressed by HPQ in order to ensure their nano silicon succeeds commercially. HPQ has stated that they are aiming to be the biggest producer of silicon nano materials for industry and not necessarily a producer of silicon anodes; this is their main focus at the moment. With regards to commercializing silicon nano materials, current manufacturing methods used by industry to produce these Si nanopowders are expensive, at US $30,000/kg selling prices, while manufacturing nanowires is so prohibitive that only government funded special projects can afford them. (These statistics cited by HPQ might be slightly out of date, as Mr. Tourillon did mention $2000-$30000/kg in a later interview, but what comes next is what is key). HPQ is working to reduce this down to $30-100/kg at commercial scale. They are looking to supply silicon nanomaterials tailored to the energy storage industry\u2019s requests, with the goal of become the supplier of choice.\n \n[The above paragraph\u2019s information is pulled from the following source: the 2020/02/11 HPQ NR (link is a few paragraphs above) for the current manufacturing costs, 2020 AGM Q&amp;A video below (@Timestamp 11:05-13:20) for their vision with nano silicon production, and the Agoracom 2020/04/15 interview for the $30-$100/kg selling price target (video link is below with the HPQ Agoracom interviews, see timestamp @6:14-8:35)]\n \n[06-30-2020]: VIDEO: HPQ AGM 2020 Question &amp; Answer session: https://youtu.be/TlkcRcyedBs\n \n \nDemand for silicon (Si) based nano powders, in the present state, is estimated to represent an addressable market of US $ 1B by 2022, expanding at a CAGR of 38.9% between 2019 \u2013 2024 (See 2020-04 link above). BloombergNEF indicates that by 2040, energy storage could translate into a demand for 920,000 MT of nano silicon (These statistics are from p.17 of the 2020 Corporate presentation: https://hpqsilicon.com/presentation/innovative-silicon-solutions-june-2020/).\n \n \nPUREVAP &amp; Apollon Solar\n \nHPQ is working with Apollon to develop a manufacturing capability that uses the High Purity Silicon (Si) made with the PUREVAP\u2122 to make Porous silicon wafers and powders needed for solid-state Li-ion batteries &amp; Li-ion batteries.  HPQ stated the first Silicon wafer should be ready to be ship for testing to a battery manufacturer (under NDA) later this year.\n \n \n \nFor those who are interested, the following are recent interviews by Agoracom with Bernard Tourillon, HPQ CEO:\n \n[06-14-2020]: VIDEO: HPQ Silicon Signs 2nd NDA For Its Silicon To Be Used In Energy Storage Application\n \n[04-15-2020]: VIDEO: HPQ Silicon Launches Missile At Graphite, With Potential To Replace Graphite In Lithium-Ion Batteries\n \n02-11-2020]: INTERVIEW: HPQ Game Changing Silicon Process For Lithium-Ion Battery Market Is Just Months Away\n \n[01-30-2020]: INTERVIEW: HPQ Porous Silicon Attracts Lithium-Ion Battery Manufacturer",

Another way they're ramming our ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When settlement failures happen, the shares you buy may not be in your brokerage account regardless of what your broker statement says.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let\u2018s say that your broker gets one of these fails to receive. First of all, they don\u2018t tell you that they got a fail to receive. If you were an institutional buyer or a high-value client, they will tell you that they failed to receive and they will give you some monetary compensation for the delay and inconvenience. They don\u2018t tell individual retail investors. If they did, they would have to share the revenue they earn on investors\u2018 money already paid them for the shares, since brokers don\u2018t have to transfer money for shares they fail to receive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The question then becomes, \u201cWell, how did I get dividends?\u201d You didn\u2018t really get dividends, you got \u201cdividends in lieu.\u201d That means the broker sent money (maybe part of *your* money) as dividends. You will know this if your 1099 from the broker says \u201cunqualified dividends.\u201d They are generally considered ordinary income and not eligible for dividend\u00a0tax rates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sometimes, a large broker with many clients seeking the same stock will receive only part of a particular share order. Some clients get real shares, others phantom entitlements. Trimbath said an investor might ask, \u201cHow did I get picked out for that?\u201d She said, \u201cThe problem is, we don\u2018t know. And they won\u2018t tell us. If you were assigned the fail to receive, then the broker has many options, none of which they have to tell you.\u201d\n\nOh, and they're fucking our voting rights! They're letting us vote and then throwing out the votes they don't like. Legally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Before the 2008 crash, at an annual proxy meeting, Bank of America counted 130% of its shares voted, that is, they received 30% more votes than they had shares outstanding. That\u2018s just the number of people who actually voted their shares! Imagine how many shares were sold beyond what they actually authorized and issued. This violates the voting rights of shareholders and reduces effective corporate governance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath pointed out, Let\u2018s say it\u2018s the merger of Compaq and Hewlett Packard. Let\u2018s say that there are a lot of these extra shares around and they have more votes than shares coming in. And let\u2018s say that your broker/dealer is JP Morgan, who was actually one of the advisors on that merger deal. They stood to gain more in fees if the merger went through than if it was voted down. Do you think that they would be so careful about your vote that if you voted against something they were in favor of that they would not be tempted to only turn in the votes that they thought should be counted, those that were most favorable to their position, as opposed to trying to make sure that everything was done according to the rules. But, there are no rules! They just make them up as they go along.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said, They can, in fact, throw out your vote and just not count it. They can randomly assign your vote to some real proxy that wasn\u2018t voted. They can vote what shares they actually do have proportionally based on how many phantom votes come in. It\u2018s all done in secrecy. They don\u2018t have to tell you, they don\u2018t have to tell the NYSE, they don\u2018t have to tell anyone. They don\u2018t have to tell the company whose shares they voted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And the SEC isn\u2018t interested. To deal with over-voting, the SEC didn\u2018t say, Stop telling clients they have voting shares when they don\u2018t. It said, Don\u2018t submit more votes than shares you are holding. And brokers could choose which votes they wanted to submit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey even have cutsy little names for their fuckery and fraud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Even a university economist who spent 2004 at the SEC studying fails acknowledged in so many words that the broker-dealers do it on purpose. Leslie Boni (now with a hedge fund in Southern California) attributed the extraordinary increase in settlement failures to investment decisions known as \u201c**strategic failures**.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath noted that in 2007, \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2018s Treasury Markets Practices Group (TMPG) describes several intentionally abusive practices such as **\u201cslamming the wire**\u201d (holding back deliveries until immediately before the close with the intention of causing settlement fails) and requests from traders for settlement operations to \u201c**hold the box**\u201d (a demand to delay settlement of an executed trade). The fact that these practices are colloquially named and described in such detail indicates that they are common causes of settlement failures.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh! Everyone saying it's illegal to naked short? Only sort of. Only for the stock of certain financial companies. That's right, they only made it illegal to drive down the valuation of their buddies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The SEC continued to declare that fails to deliver were not an indication of naked short selling. That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected. Trimbath pointed out that not till the banks/broker-dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short-selling ban in place \u2013 but only for the shares of banks, insurance companies and securities firms, including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, it's a big problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission: In the first two weeks of July 2019, 914,261,864 shares valued at over $17 billion failed to deliver in settlement from the clearing house, an average of about $1.9 billion every settlement day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCon't below...",

War? Yes, the war on **The Establishment**. Let me explain...\n\nFor the very first time - in a real fuck\\*\\*\\* long time - i have some hope and faith for mankind.\n\nI\u00b4ll give you first some context to who am I :\n\nI\u00b4m a 30 year old dude from Germany, went to college, majored in economics, working a 9-5 Job in a bank and I\u00b4m really interested in economy and geopolitics. I speak english (sorry for all typos and mistakes in this post), german, russian and some spanish. Living just the normal life you know. I watch and read a ton of news from all over the world. From diffrent sorts of media, countries and perspectives, basically everything i can get my hands on. And let me tell you one thing, ***the world is ill.***\n\nThe coronavirus hit the world hard, everywhere and more or less homogeneous. Germany, USA, Europe, Russia, China, you name it. Every country is handling the problem on its own. And besides China, with their guerilla tactics on the virus and mass surveillance with big brother, the majority of the countries are doing pretty fuc\\*\\*\\* bad at it. Bascially every single country in the world is fighting the virus in expense of us humans. They restrict every privat aspect in our lives, just to keep the economy running as long as possible. Bailing out huge privat companies with tax money, pumping trillions of fresh cash into a system which is already at the bottom with 0 intrest rates all over the world. Investing and promoting climate-killing activites. All of that, because **the economy** is ruling every single country. Not the elected parties or politicans, all of them are just on the payroll of big corporations. They (big corp) set the Laws and rules which we all have to obey. It does not fuck\\*\\*\\* matter if you fight dems vs. reps, at the bottom, both parties are payed and controlled by big corp. Its the same in Germany, Russia, Spain and all over the world. Some are ruled by obvious corrupt dicators, some are better hidden with \"elected\" parties and representatives. At the end we - the people - are working and living exclusively for the purpose to serve the rich, wealthy, 1%.\n\nWe have to empower the people, showing them the mirror. We dont fight reps vs. dems. ; Black vs. white ; Immigrant vs. citizen ; you name it. We have to fight the 1%, the rich. They try everything to drive a wedge betweeen us the people. Making us hating each other, fighting each other. But GUYS were all on the same side. **Everyone of us 99%.**\n\nThe unequal distribution of wealth in the world is peaking never seen before in history. We all get pissed on our heads by our governments and they dont even have the decency to sell it as rain. People all over the place working in systemically relevant jobs earning the least money and having the greatest risk of all. All that while the Stockmarkets are skyrocketing and Billionairs and Millionairs are just getting richer and richer every. single. day. People struggeling making ends meet, living paycheck to paycheck, still recovering from 2008.\n\nAnd as this global pandemic is ongoing and finally uncovering who the government/big corps really cares about. People start to become awake of the situation. Schools are all over the place garbage, the Health system is stressed out, privatized and monetized for max profit. Riots taking place all over the world. Rioting against dicators, corrupt governments and mishandling the pandemic, everything in favor of big corp.\n\nI was devistated and felt powerless, knowing i couldnt change anything by myself in this fuc\\*\\*ed up rigged system.\n\nThat was until last week...\n\n# You crazy motherf**** autists.\n\nI do not exaggerate, when i say, - **this is History in the making** \\- All it takes are some brave, loyal, and stupid apes liking the Stock. Thats it. The financial system is on the merge of collapse and we\u00b4re witnissing a never seen before wealth transfer. This thing will change the market and the world for all future.\n\nI finally found a way to take action in the revolution we need. Simply liking $GME **\ud83d\ude80** and buying all the stocks I fuc\\*\\*\\* can **\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** . I already build a position last week and will buy more moday morning **\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c** . I yolo everything i have in, I dont even care. This is a once in a liftime opportunity for us to make a change in the rigged system. We cant live and work only for the rich an wealthy. Apes together strong!!!\n\nSo take your shot, seize the opportunity, dont let it slip and make the **GAME STOP**\n\n# #POWER TO THE PEOPLE\n\n# #EAT THE RICH\n\n \n\n# $GME I just love the Stock \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice or whatsoever, im just your everyday normal guy",

The open interest (OI) is updated once per day PRIOR to open; it is not updated again until premarket the following trading day. You also don't know if those are long or short calls - it's impossible to tell from OI alone. OI just tells you how many contracts are \"open,\" and you can sell a call to open - effectively shorting the underlying.\n\nThe volume for those $800C today was 16k. Volume includes all transactions that occurred this day i.e. sell to open, buy to open, sell to close, buy to close.  So 16k volume doesn't mean 16,000 contracts were open. It could mean 7k contracts were bought to open + 7k were sold to close (could've been opened/closed the same day) + 2k were sold to open. In that example, the volume is 16k even though the net effect was selling to open 2k contracts.\n\nSo how do you interpret the volume? You compare OI on consecutive days.\n\nTomorrow morning the OI will update to reflect the total number of open contracts, so the previous 6.6k may go up OR down depending if net contracts were open or closed. If we use that above example of net 2k contracts sold to open -&gt; tomorrow's OI would be 6.6k + 2k = 8.6k. So you can't look at that 8.6k and say \"That must mean there are 8,600 long calls\" because we just explained that we know 2,000 are short calls...and we have no idea about the other 6,600.\n\nStill, even after looking at how OI changes, it's impossible to say if those are buys or sells without looking at the order book/flow. For example, if the OI goes up by 2k those could be 2k long calls, 2k short calls, or some combination.\n\nThe call flow OP posted probably indicates OTM call buying because it's at the ask price (\"the \\_A\" indicates that), but in that same screenshot he posted there was some large ATM put buying. In this screenshot you could say there were 2k calls bought vs. 1.2k puts, but you have to remember the puts are much closer to the money so they will have a much greater effect on how MM's hedge.\n\nThere's been a lot of misinformation here recently, so hopefully this explains what vol/OI mean.",

The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It\u2019s illegal market manipulation at its finest.\n\nHedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.\n\nIn reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you\u2019d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.\n\nSo, stop panicking pussies. They\u2019ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven\u2019t already. Share this info to other newbie traders\n\nInfo of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg\\_WU-0AQ&amp;ab\\_channel=StocksBigPlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&amp;ab_channel=StocksBigPlays)\n\n**WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?**\n\nWell, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.",

So there\u2019s this man in his sixties with his phone out looking at a stock graph while he\u2019s watching the tv.  I mention that it\u2019s odd they are asking the reddit founder what\u2019s next for wsb.   The guy looks at me and smiles, says, \u201cwell now they are moving to silver.\u201d  \n\nI was like, wait, what?  I hadn\u2019t seen even a blip about silver.  I didn\u2019t say anything because maybe I missed it.  So a couple hours later, I\u2019m back on wsb and no... it\u2019s all GME, AMC, BB, NOK.  Nothing about silver.  But then by the next day... silver silver silver..\n\nIt really seemed like the attempt to manipulate wsb into silver got traction outside of wsb first where they believe anything the MM says.  Back here in the actual wsb, the attempted posts about silver were getting downvotes.  \n\nIs it a mystery that we have millions of new subscribers?

Their valuation was $25B, and you need to pay a premium in order to acquire a company.  And the play wasn't a result of trying to get Slack's revenue or profit.  Microsoft has been pushing Dynamics *hard* as part of the O365 licensing model.  That's a direct competitor to SFDC.  And MSFT's message that their sales org is pushing is \"We hit all of your software needs with one license.\"  The biggest driver of upsales on O365 are Dynamics and Teams.  Bundling CRM and UCaaS is a gamechanger, and has been wildly successful for them.\n\nSFDC needed to be able to compete with that bundling.  So they bought the biggest competitor to Teams.  And they'll bundle it with SFDC licenses.\n\nTableau is a similar purchase.  BI is a huge play right now, and *also* a feature that MSFT is bundling with O365.  Adding Tableau into the fold allows SFDC to directly compete with MSFT on that front, too.\n\nThese aren't cookie jar acquisitions, they're competitive expansion via acquisition.",
