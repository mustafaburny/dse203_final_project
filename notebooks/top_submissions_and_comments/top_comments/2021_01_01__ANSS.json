I found it interesting that they're also stating that we will have a *\"likelihood of low policy rates for the rest of our lives\".* Which is the same thing that many commentators on this sub-reddit have also been saying.\n\nFor fun, [here's the historical performance](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=TDG&amp;allocation1_1=5&amp;symbol2=ADBE&amp;allocation2_1=5&amp;symbol3=ADSK&amp;allocation3_1=5&amp;symbol4=ANSS&amp;allocation4_1=5&amp;symbol5=INTU&amp;allocation5_1=5&amp;symbol6=PAYC&amp;allocation6_1=5&amp;symbol7=VRTX&amp;allocation7_1=5&amp;symbol8=ANET&amp;allocation8_1=5&amp;symbol9=MA&amp;allocation9_1=5&amp;symbol10=PYPL&amp;allocation10_1=5&amp;symbol11=V&amp;allocation11_1=5&amp;symbol12=ABMD&amp;allocation12_1=5&amp;symbol13=ISRG&amp;allocation13_1=5&amp;symbol14=ALGN&amp;allocation14_1=5&amp;symbol15=TTWO&amp;allocation15_1=5&amp;symbol16=ETSY&amp;allocation16_1=5&amp;symbol17=XLNX&amp;allocation17_1=5&amp;symbol18=MNST&amp;allocation18_1=5&amp;symbol19=FTNT&amp;allocation19_1=5&amp;symbol20=NOW&amp;allocation20_1=5) of the \"high growth\" picks that JPM outlines on page 9 (equally weighted, thereby not optimized towards any specific metric), so we can revisit this in 2022 and see how they did. As a data point, historically, it looks like the running CAGR of this blend is around 40.64%. If someone wants to buy this allocation, they can do so quite simply via fractional shares.",

Fintech is huge and Foley is headlining it so it\u2019s a pretty well full proof. Other one is semiconductors which has a huge market in EV\u2019s and they\u2019re really the first Spac to do so. And then the third is lightning motors which of course any EV is gonna blow up but they actually have a good product just a bit behind with regards to production.",
