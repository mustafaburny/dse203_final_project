I am very interested in investing in this stock.\n\nNow, how do I figure out what is a fair price for the stock? I believe this is called intrinsic value?\nI can\u2019t find a well defined formula for this price, can anyone help me calculate this value for ANSS?\n\nI apologize for the noob question",
