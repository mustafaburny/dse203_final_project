TSMC is going to build a fab in Arizona (being pressured by the government). There are also some government money for supporting domestic semiconductor fabrication (DARPA ERI for example). And domestically fabricated chips are preferred in government contracts. I would say it is a consist policy that will continue no matter who is in the Whitehouse.\n* TSMC also receive supports from Taiwan government from lower utility cost and research funds. But I think more importantly the pay. Salaries at TSMC are very competitive in Taiwan so that it can easily attract talents with lower costs than its US competitors.\n* I believe some of them are irreplaceable players in the supply chain. If semiconductor sector does well, they does well. But I am not really familiar with them so I cannot give investment suggestion. You can add $CDNS and $SNPS to the list as well. They are also of similar roles.\n* Yes. Lidar and other sensors for autonomous driving. I believe $ON is mentioned the most for the recent months. I believe there are also some other companies but I am not quite sure. A lot of companies are doing CMOS image sensor. Another filed might hot is for VR/AR, like the suppliers for Oculus. But I cannot recall the names. There are a few startups doing optical neural networks. But I guess most of my peers wouldn't believe in any of them.",
