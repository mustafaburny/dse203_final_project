        "body": "Well, he announced he wants India to be the center of IBM's new efforts. So.... if you are talented and live in the US and work for IBM, will the last one turn out the lights?\n\nSeriously. Not much diversity at the head of top tech companies based in the US. This is what India pressure looks like - you get the best deals with India if you have an Indian CEO. Trump is not the only one playing with foreign influence playing with Putin. US tech companies play with foreign influence, because mathematically and otherwise, it is too much of a coincidence that most of the top US tech companies are CEOS from India - barring those companies created by a person. Why are the boards making this non-EEOC decision? Why is it that there is no Asian, no white, no hispanic, no black, no other as CEO of these companies that rely so heavily on Indian labor or sites in India that drive down cost? Hm.....maybe someone can get their AI to crunch the number on the probability of that being wholly without bias.\n\nBut so much for the US being a champion of diversity in tech for their US employees. Really. Tech may be high minded calling out ICE and so forth, but they are not a fan of the EEOC or the idea of diversity on their teams. Except for a couple of photo ops.",

Uninformed people just don't know any better, and it sounds like you had the kind of environment that didnt foster financial learning or stability. Reaching out and trying to better your future sounds pretty smart to me.\n\nOn average the S&amp;P500 increases about 8-10% annually. Look up SPY and VOO ETFs, which track the S&amp;P500 (500 biggest companies on the US stock market). People are usually better off buying and holding those than picking individual stocks. At that rate of return, you might expect between 59-75k if you invest $100/month for 20 years due to compound interest.\n\nAlso, 53 isnt too late for you! You have another 20-30 years left statistically, possibly more with medical advancements. A lot of great people didn't make it big until their 50s. IBM and Home Depot were started by a 61 and 50 year old, you've still got opportunity left! Good luck!",

        "body": "While I would agree with the general thesis that Intel has lost a few notches of their technical superiority, do you think that necessarily translates into stock price?  Such tectonic shifts - if real - can take a very long time.  \n\nThere used to be a saying \"nobody ever got fired for picking IBM\". It took decades for that rule to fade.  The same is true of Intel.  AMD may indeed be crushing it on tech, and winning customers one at a time.  But it will take a long time for Intel to lose their dominance, even if it's warranted.  \n\nKeep in mind the just had a blowout quarter.  Companies pay them $73 billion a year for what is essentially melted sand.  \n\nPerhaps their blowout is due to low analyst expectations.  But that's a condition that can take a quarter or two to rectify as the analysts gradually tweak their recommendations and targets to levels where Intel will struggle or miss.  That means they could beat again next quarter.  \n\nThey now have a permanent CEO who is a numbers guy, who reported is working for peanut salary with a strong incentive to crank those numbers.\n\nYour diagnosis is they've lost their way in product architecture and design and innovation. I won't argue as I wouldn't know and your case sounds plausible.  If so, then they probably have the wrong CEO since he doesn't sound like he'd be the inspiring voice to revive the product innovation.\n\nI sense the author is a die hard AMD fan, which is fine.  But AMD having a cooler product doesn't necessarily put Intel out of business.  Coke and Pepsi continue to punch the clock and fight each other.  And AMD's multiple is so out of whack that they probably need to crank up earnings by cranking up sales but any moves they make on price or competitiveness won't be as a monopoly; they'll be done with Intel fighting them for every inch.\n\nTo me that means even if your theory of AMD taking the crown from Intel is happening, it will be a slow moving coup.",

This is what India pressure looks like - you get the best deals with India if you have an Indian CEO. Trump is not the only one playing with foreign influence playing with Putin. US tech companies play with foreign influence, because mathematically and otherwise, it is too much of a coincidence that most of the top US tech companies are CEOS from India - barring those companies created by a person. Why are the boards making this non-EEOC decision? Why is it that there is no Asian, no white, no hispanic, no black, no other as CEO of these companies that rely so heavily on Indian labor or sites in India that drive down cost? Hm.....maybe someone can get their AI to crunch the number on the probability of that being wholly without bias.\n\nBut so much for the US being a champion of diversity in tech for their US employees.

Uninformed people just don't know any better, and it sounds like you had the kind of environment that didnt foster financial learning or stability. Reaching out and trying to better your future sounds pretty smart to me.\n\nOn average the S&amp;P500 increases about 8-10% annually. Look up SPY and VOO ETFs, which track the S&amp;P500 (500 biggest companies on the US stock market). People are usually better off buying and holding those than picking individual stocks. At that rate of return, you might expect between 59-75k if you invest $100/month for 20 years due to compound interest.\n\nAlso, 53 isnt too late for you! You have another 20-30 years left statistically, possibly more with medical advancements. A lot of great people didn't make it big until their 50s. IBM and Home Depot were started by a 61 and 50 year old, you've still got opportunity left! Good luck!",

        "body": "While I would agree with the general thesis that Intel has lost a few notches of their technical superiority, do you think that necessarily translates into stock price?  Such tectonic shifts - if real - can take a very long time.  \n\nThere used to be a saying \"nobody ever got fired for picking IBM\". It took decades for that rule to fade.  The same is true of Intel.  AMD may indeed be crushing it on tech, and winning customers one at a time.  But it will take a long time for Intel to lose their dominance, even if it's warranted.  \n\nKeep in mind the just had a blowout quarter.  Companies pay them $73 billion a year for what is essentially melted sand.  \n\nPerhaps their blowout is due to low analyst expectations.  But that's a condition that can take a quarter or two to rectify as the analysts gradually tweak their recommendations and targets to levels where Intel will struggle or miss.  That means they could beat again next quarter.  \n\nThey now have a permanent CEO who is a numbers guy, who reported is working for peanut salary with a strong incentive to crank those numbers.\n\nYour diagnosis is they've lost their way in product architecture and design and innovation. I won't argue as I wouldn't know and your case sounds plausible.  If so, then they probably have the wrong CEO since he doesn't sound like he'd be the inspiring voice to revive the product innovation.\n\nI sense the author is a die hard AMD fan, which is fine.  But AMD having a cooler product doesn't necessarily put Intel out of business.  Coke and Pepsi continue to punch the clock and fight each other.  And AMD's multiple is so out of whack that they probably need to crank up earnings by cranking up sales but any moves they make on price or competitiveness won't be as a monopoly; they'll be done with Intel fighting them for every inch.\n\nTo me that means even if your theory of AMD taking the crown from Intel is happening, it will be a slow moving coup.",
