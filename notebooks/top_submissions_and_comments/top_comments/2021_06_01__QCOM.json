        "body": "Copying and pasting from an earlier conversation I had today:\n\nNvidia has a few CMP HX partner models preparing to launch - these are the mining specific cards. They have no display output which means they can't be used for gaming. Nvidia is also revising ALL current 30 series (except 3090 I believe) to a LHR (light hash rate) version which is a physical difference in the silicon. They are doing this to nerf ETH mining performance on their 30 series cards at the hardware level.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's CMP HX mining cards make no economic sense to mine on since they are way less power efficient, and have no resale value since they can't be used for gaming. However, if Nvidia completely locks down ETH hash rate on the 30 series, they can increase their TAM by preventing miners from cannibalizing their gaming sales. So far, the CMP HX cards look like they are built on 10 series architecture so they will be able to be produced cheaper and in parallel to 30 series.\n\nLastly, the ARM deal seems to be moving along. Qualcomm has voiced concerns and said they are ready to invest in ARM as a partner if the Nvidia deal falls through. Nvidia says it has 3 other silicon manufacturers who support the Nvidia deal but details aren't known yet. Nvidia's recent rise is likely due to the probability of the ARM deal actually becoming more likely.\n\nIn case you dont understand why the ARM deal is good for NVDA, it means that all ARM-based chip manufacturers are beholden to NVDA. ARM is the most dominant CPU architecture for all mobile CPUs including micro controllers in other devices. Apple, qualcomm, samsung, amd, intel, huawei, IBM all have ARM licenses\n\nIt allows NVDA to penetrate the mobile market. Nvidia has the highest profit margins on their mobile CPUs because they don't have to rely on partners to distribute chunky desktop cards. They sell the silicon directly. Every iphone and samsung galaxy could have an Nvidia-produced CPU and GPU.\n\nThe reason ARM is used for mobile is because of its power efficiency. If Nvidia knows what they are doing (they do) then they know how they can use their proprietary access to ARM to create ultra performant and efficient server chips, feeding into their datacenter revenue.\n\nNvidia has announced plans to enter the server CPU market. When they announced this, Intel and AMD stock tanked 5% or so. My bet is that they are already working with ARM to deliver their CPU server chips\n\nTL;DR - ARM deal going through would make NVDA pull a page out of 2020 TSLA's book. Downside is ARM deal delays, pricing in approval then having it get denied. Would crush the stock.",

What happens to INTC in 2023 when their new shiny fabs that have cost &gt;$10B to build are idling because the market is flooded with cheap silicon?\n\nAMD and QCOM simply reduce their order flow to TSMC and call it a day, let TSMC take the loss. \n\nYou're right INTC is still the largest fish in the pond, mostly because they still have tons of B2B contracts rolling. How long do you think they can retain those for while behind? If it wasn't for the immense datacenter demand INTC would be a shrinking company right now.\n\nAMD is eating their lunch right now and growing at anywhere between \\~20-50% YoY. Do the math, how long is it going to be before they overtake INTC? AMD offer no dividends because they have better things to do with the money to fuel growth. If anything INTC is going to cut back on dividends too if they're serious about reinvesting in R&amp;D to catch up. \n\nAMD is not the only competition. NVDA has already announced Grace to launch in 2023 and I'm very confident they will be balling really hard for datacenter specific chips designed for certain tasks. While simultaneously gunning for embedded systems, inference nodes, edge computing etc. \n\nYou also have QCOM who's also competing for more and more market share outside of mobile. Chromebooks are rolling off the shelves with QCOM silicon already in them and we've seen the launch of entry-level laptops with the same chips. \n\nEveryone is after INTC's lunch and I have yet to see 1 compelling action taken that would allow Intel to level their footing and get back in the game. Until I see that I'm not changing my mind and my investment thesis. This is the next IBM until proven otherwise. If they can't turn the ship around they'll be selling off divisions in the next few years.",

They\u2019ve made it very clear that any company who wants to supply components for them, puts them first. Otherwise they\u2019ll just do it themselves. Tim Cook is a supply chain genius. And Apple isn\u2019t fucking around. They\u2019ll crush their suppliers if they cross them. Intel couldn\u2019t supply them goods? Fuck them we\u2019ll make our own chip, and get TSMC to put us first in line.\n\nQualcomm raising their prices for 5G modems? Okay we\u2019re developing our own. And also we\u2019re already almost done designing the 6G modem. Which by the way, when 6G comes around in 5-10 years Apple is going to have piles of 6G patents ready as they plan to be a leader in developing the technology. They plan to make a little $ on every 6G device sold everywhere. They will likely also be able to receive government subsidies for developing it to beat out Chinese corps like Huawei.\n\nEpic game trial is a joke. Their argument essentially amount to Apple has a monopoly ... over their iPhone. Yeah no shit it\u2019s their product.\n\nCar... they don\u2019t really need a car. However even though it would be their largest acquisition, I could see them buying Lucid. Time will tell if they go that route, or simply continue to focus on licensing tech to car companies.\n\nAlso AAPL plans to buy back $90 billion in shares over the next year.

But please do your research before blindly following my suggestions.   \n\n\n5G (LAM, Ichor, Appied Materials) will do well - hype is present\n\nSemiconductors (NVDIA, AMD, TSM and Qualcomm for dividends) look solid\n\nCloud is on a rebound, but still risky. \n\nFintech looks solid if you stick with JPM, Shift4, Square. \n\nCannabis, get out. It's far too risky.   \n\n\nBig Tech, can't go wrong with those. \n\nAutonomous vehicles are too expensive (Tesla), don't believe in self-driving hype. But Lumiar specializes in lidar tech that is used for self-driving cars. So given it's a hype stock, I invested some shares just to capitalize on the gains. Plus, Luminar poached execs from Intel and Tesla. \n\nFitness stocks like YETI, Garmin, Nautilus are great. Planet Fitness looks solid, but currently in a sell state. Under Armor expected to grow, Nike good for dividends. Lululemon is too expensive to hold. \n\nChina is a long term play, but it's not doing hot atm. \n\n3 growth stocks I believe will rebound further are AirBNB, Fiverr, Etsy. But that's my opinion.",

        "body": "Thinking about switching to index funds\n\nHey everyone! I\u2019m 26 and all my life my dad has been telling me I should diversify and buy good stocks in different sectors. I make about 60k a year and i just want to increase my net worth steadily over time. I have allocated about 90% to \u201csafe\u201d holdings and 10% to \u201crisky\u201d plays. (MP/PLTR). I have a 200k mortgage that\u2019s my only debt. Anyways, looking at my YTD profits I\u2019m sitting at only 2% gain. Looking at switching to index funds because a lot of them throw off an okay dividend as well as gaining a lot more than 2% for this year, wanted to know peoples thoughts on my portfolio and what I might be able to differently. I\u2019ve been told owning a stock is like owning a company and if you cannot spend the time to research every company and keep up with it, index funds are the best choice. \n\nHere are my stocks:\nMMM \nAMD \nAMZN \nAAPL \nCVX \nCMCSA \nD \nHD \nHON \nINTC\nJNJ\nKMB\nLMT\nNKE\nPEP\nQCOM\nKO\nV\nDIS\nPLTR\nMP \n\nPlease let me know what you think. I think overall it\u2019s a pretty diversified portfolio, a bit tech heavy, I know. Any suggestions please let me know, thank you!",
