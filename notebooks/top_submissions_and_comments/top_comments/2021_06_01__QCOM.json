        "body": "Copying and pasting from an earlier conversation I had today:\n\nNvidia has a few CMP HX partner models preparing to launch - these are the mining specific cards. They have no display output which means they can't be used for gaming. Nvidia is also revising ALL current 30 series (except 3090 I believe) to a LHR (light hash rate) version which is a physical difference in the silicon. They are doing this to nerf ETH mining performance on their 30 series cards at the hardware level.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's CMP HX mining cards make no economic sense to mine on since they are way less power efficient, and have no resale value since they can't be used for gaming. However, if Nvidia completely locks down ETH hash rate on the 30 series, they can increase their TAM by preventing miners from cannibalizing their gaming sales. So far, the CMP HX cards look like they are built on 10 series architecture so they will be able to be produced cheaper and in parallel to 30 series.\n\nLastly, the ARM deal seems to be moving along. Qualcomm has voiced concerns and said they are ready to invest in ARM as a partner if the Nvidia deal falls through. Nvidia says it has 3 other silicon manufacturers who support the Nvidia deal but details aren't known yet. Nvidia's recent rise is likely due to the probability of the ARM deal actually becoming more likely.\n\nIn case you dont understand why the ARM deal is good for NVDA, it means that all ARM-based chip manufacturers are beholden to NVDA. ARM is the most dominant CPU architecture for all mobile CPUs including micro controllers in other devices. Apple, qualcomm, samsung, amd, intel, huawei, IBM all have ARM licenses\n\nIt allows NVDA to penetrate the mobile market. Nvidia has the highest profit margins on their mobile CPUs because they don't have to rely on partners to distribute chunky desktop cards. They sell the silicon directly. Every iphone and samsung galaxy could have an Nvidia-produced CPU and GPU.\n\nThe reason ARM is used for mobile is because of its power efficiency. If Nvidia knows what they are doing (they do) then they know how they can use their proprietary access to ARM to create ultra performant and efficient server chips, feeding into their datacenter revenue.\n\nNvidia has announced plans to enter the server CPU market. When they announced this, Intel and AMD stock tanked 5% or so. My bet is that they are already working with ARM to deliver their CPU server chips\n\nTL;DR - ARM deal going through would make NVDA pull a page out of 2020 TSLA's book. Downside is ARM deal delays, pricing in approval then having it get denied. Would crush the stock.",

If anything INTC is going to cut back on dividends too if they're serious about reinvesting in R&amp;D to catch up. \n\nAMD is not the only competition. NVDA has already announced Grace to launch in 2023 and I'm very confident they will be balling really hard for datacenter specific chips designed for certain tasks. While simultaneously gunning for embedded systems, inference nodes, edge computing etc. \n\nYou also have QCOM who's also competing for more and more market share outside of mobile. Chromebooks are rolling off the shelves with QCOM silicon already in them and we've seen the launch of entry-level laptops with the same chips. \n\nEveryone is after INTC's lunch and I have yet to see 1 compelling action taken that would allow Intel to level their footing and get back in the game. Until I see that I'm not changing my mind and my investment thesis. This is the next IBM until proven otherwise. If they can't turn the ship around they'll be selling off divisions in the next few years.",

It's PE is fairly low compared to its competitors. I'm anxious to see what will make it finally pop back up. Will this next earnings report be enough? Or is it going to take you for earnings with the next batch of cell phones? We shall see.  So much chatter about big companies making their own chips, but qcom still owns the market",

        "body": "Let me preface this by saying I am part of the $BB bull gang here and while I haven't been posting actively, I own shares and have a good portion of money in long OTM calls on $BB.  The article you are referencing is not fake news.  The second part of your DD essentially backs that up.  Hypervisor is a completely different animal from the QNX Neutrino operating system that was being used on the Sync system.\n\nAs you already explained, Hypervisor allows for safety critical features to be run on the same SoC as non-safety critical components.  So for example, you can have your digital cluster software running on the same hardware as your infotainment system, however, if the infotainment system were to lock-up or reset, the cluster will continue working uninterrupted.  Essentially, this allows OEMs to save money on hardware because they can start to combine ECUs.  \n\nNow, the article says that Ford is looking to drop QNX and switch to Android - this part is true. This is the case with most OEMs as Android has a ton of advantages. For example, Android has an established eco system with a storefront that can be tailored for the automotive industry, QNX does not.  App developers can make things like navigation apps and media apps which can be adapted for the automotive space with little rework. Licensing costs are also a big factor here.  OEMs are actually approaching infotainment suppliers and specifically listing Android as one of the major requirements for their next-gen systems.  Suppliers are showcasing Hypervisor as a potential solution for driving multiple ECUs (cluster and infotainment mainly) on a single SoC such as the ones developed by Qualcomm or MediaTek.\n\nSo to summarize, $BB to the moon, BUT your post is calling something fake news when in fact it is not.\n\nSource: I have been working for one of the largest infotainment suppliers for the last 10+ years and have been working on next gen proof of concept projects.",
