That end of year statement was a bit of a \"Guh\" moment since everything I had earned plus some basically had evaporated.   But, wasn't like I was going to touch that money then.  I did nothing to change the strategy I had picked for investing and instead doubled up on my 401k contributions.\n\nBest decision I ever made in regards to my retirement investments -- I came out way ahead because I was able to buy more while everything was recovering.\n\nMy biggest regret over the last year is when COVID hit I was too focused on the disaster itself and neglected to make any real changes to how I was investing to take better advantage of it.  If this continues and goes deeper - don't look at it as a loss if your investing for the long term.  Look at as an opportunity to get more potential long term value out of the money you put in now. \n\nAs a current example - I bought NVIDIA because I believed they have a potential for real growth through the autonomous vehicle industry.  But, yeah stocks down since I invested in it.  Bought more this morning - why?  I **STILL** believe it's going to grow in the next 5-years because of the rise of autonomous vehicles tech.  *It's just on sale now.*",

        "body": "March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.\n\nAfter the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.\n\nProspects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a \"very strong\" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.\n\nThe Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.\n\n\"This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,\" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.\n\nA slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.\n\nTech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.\n\nThe divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\n\"The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,\" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. \"The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,\" he said.\n\nBy 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.\n\nBanks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.\n\nWalt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.\n\nGameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash in New York, Karen Pierog in Chicago and Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Lisa Shumaker)",

Better tech than Intel but cheaper than NVIDIA, no fabrication operations because they were losing money on it a few years ago so sold it off to focus on design, which I think gives them more flexibility to adapt to capitalize on any investments that could be coming from the public sector, and they probably aren\u2019t bleeding money from production constraints like the others. Probably the best CEO in the space as well. \n\nI also like Qualcomm a lot for similar reasons, but also because they\u2019re positioned to win big in 5G and will probably do well in the IoT space as well. Much more mature company too with a nice dividend ($.65/share).",

The newest Ryzen chips are incredible, in terms of price to performance, and their newest set of graphics cards, while suffering from the same shortage as their only real competition, nVidia, have on par performance specs for 25% less. I've been an Intel/nVidia user since I built my first PC years ago, but in the last few generations of chips and cards, I've always recommended AMD products to my friends looking to build PCs. In fact, if you look on the logicalincrements website, which is a very popular resource for speccing out a new PC, each and every recommended CPU is AMD. They were small, and overlooked in the past, but they are dominating as of late.\n\nLooking at the prices of the stocks, AMD is still less than 1/3 the market cap of NVDA, despite the fact that NVDA only makes GPUs, while AMD makes both CPUs and GPUs. If you look at Intel, they have 2.5x the market cap of AMD, and they only make CPUs.\n\nWith the way AMD's chips have been performing, and the fact that they are outperforming on both isles of the PC gaming industry, I think they'll end up doing very well. A stock price of $250+ is not out of the question imo.",

MP Materials is the only US based company REM company. \n\nThis all looks so obvious as a long term play.

I bought $10 worth of every stock listed above so I could keep tabs on them. All of them have followed the same negative trajectory the last month or so.

HOWEVER, the reason why I\u2019m so bullish on Fubo and why this recent dip is a massive buying opportunity is that Dish + DraftKing merger is not even a big threat. Dish is LOSING 100,000+ subscribers quarterly. Why? Because unlike Fubo, it requires satellite (not the future). Also, Verizon has a 7%+ stake in Fubo which gives it a lot of potential partners. Fubo\u2019s financials are getting hit because they\u2019re focusing on spending NOW to grow their customer base as fast as possible during the pandemic.
