SQ doesn't do anything particularly special compared to anyone else TBH (their product was easier to use years ago but the others have caught up). \n\nSQ also is running at negative earnings compared to their competitors, in a year where merchants who aren't Amazon have questionable revenue streams, and SQ is mostly dependent on merchant acquiring and volume which simply isn't there with small merchants shuttering due to the pandemic. Recent SQ drops seem more like a facing reality situation instead of some other fundamental issue. If you are more interested in tech payments PYPL is probably the way to go but what do I know.",
