        "body": "Yeah I mean my situation was looking for stocks to hedge against a portfolio with a lot of growth companies in it, which is how I came up with those names to look into. I don't know how to use any screeners so but that is an interesting question. If you can find a stock with low p/e, good d/e, pays a dividend, and grows then I think you've got a pretty good stock lol. Just depends what you're willing to trade off. \n\nIf you were willing to look at things with a little higher p/es there's ADP (a little high) and VFC (very high but if you look at the projected earnings it comes back to earth). Both are in good shape in terms of debt and probably have some more growth potential than most of the ones I pointed out.",

I\u2019m not a fan of apparel stocks, but it\u2019s worth noting, VF Corp\u2019s forward p/e is in the low 20\u2019s.

Reports of Blackrock paying 50% above asking price might just be because their MBS offerings are bought down by the Fed.\n\nNot saying that's all of it, but the thumb is on the scale for lower rates.   \n\nThe other side, everyone is anxious about the economy, we all know it's fucked, we all hope it can make a comeback before the fed/treasury stims run out, but honestly it's an artificial market.   People aren't moving over their paranoia, inventory only in the last month coming up (and not that much).\n\nI'm not sure it's a bubble like 2008, but yes there's some fuckery going on as OP said.   I haven't seen/heard of people doing massive cash-out-refinancing, or sub-prime lending.  In 08 I had friends with 5-10 houses with 0 down and clauses that they could just \"drop the keys off\" with the lender no-fault defaults.   They left banks holding the bag on dozens of properties, they weren't insolvent had renters, but so far underwater that it wasn't worth the effort.  Idiot lenders caused that.\n\nNow...I see MBS owners might be holding a heavy bag as values come off the highs, but I don't see private equity BR getting bailed out (or needing it, when your Fed fueled MBS rate is 1.2% what worry?).",
