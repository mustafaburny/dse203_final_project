        "body": "Crowdstrike is primarily known for endpoint protection which are software solutions to protect computers (workstations, laptops, servers) known as NGAV (next gen antivirus) and EDR (endpoint detect and response). They also offer a type of managed service known in the industry as MDR. Their customers will range across all industries and their solutions are appropriate for small to large enterprises. It's actually a pretty crowded market imo. There aren't a lot of comparables in the public market but you may be able to check out Sentinel 1 when they IPO. There are rumors of Cybereason IPO as well. \n\nFireye has an EDR solution but I imagine it's a tiny part of their business. And no one really would bring up Fireeye when talking about endpoint protection. Fireeye/Mandiant is most known for their incident response and forensic products and services. They are usually on top of most people's list to call whenever there is a security breach. \n\nBoth Palo Alto and Fortinet started off as security networking companies competing with traditional firewall companies like Netscreen and Cisco. In fact, the founders of both companies are former Netscreen execs iirc. Both companies have expanded their product and service offerings over the years to support security operations solutions. You tend to see Palo Alto and Fortinet used in larger enterprises who need holistic network security solutions. Normally, if a security team is looking at a Palo Alto solutions, they are probably also comparing it Fortinet and vice-versa. \n\nGenerally speaking - cyber-security industry is very broad. You are not likely to find a single company that would cover the entire gamut of security needs for an enterprise. So if your interest is in broad industry exposure - an ETF is probably a better solution.",

BI/big data and security are two examples of areas where people don\u2019t realize that MSFT has been undermining the competition silently.\n\nI dumped loads of stock in companies that offer a solution here/there (Fortinet is a great example), and rolled it over to Microsoft. Some of these companies offer good services, and maybe even do a bit better than Microsoft in that particular area. But it\u2019s laughable to choose a set of numerous, disparate vendors in an effort to get a solution that is all of 10% better but doesn\u2019t integrate. Seriously, you\u2019re crazy if you go that route.\n\nOne of these days, the world is going to wake up and realize that they\u2019re paying vendors to solve miscellaneous problems, and yet they could have been paying Microsoft even less to make everything more efficient and secure.",

So in order to get more spread I would need to find companies who has stable finances and growth potential but not included in the Top Tier yet. \n\nI believe there are a lot of tech companies out there that fit into this category, especially those focusing on core business tech (like servers, firewalls, software, hybrid clouds, etc). Some examples that come to mind are Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, Oracle, Adobe. \n\nBut I digress, thanks for the info (and the rest in this thread).",

Years down the line, the same title will be sold for a fraction of the price on their own platform... and that's it.\n\nWhy the focus on the amount of times a digital title can earn the publisher money? The incremental costs of producing additional copies of a digital game are near 0.\n\n&gt; A small percentage off tens of thousands of resales of an old or obsolete title that is no longer offered in the publisher's own catalogue vs. buying the game from the publishers' own old game discount bin for a few bucks... again, once? Might not make sense initially, but especially in the used / old game market those small revenue streams would add up: especially when compared to a scenario where users would not otherwise buy the game.\n\nI still don't see the incentive for a publisher to cannibalize their own sales. As an example, Fallout: New Vegas was released in 2010 on Steam and other digital platforms. It cost $59.99 then. \n\nToday, Fallout: New Vegas is available on Steam for $9.99. A person that wants a copy of the game can buy it today. The publisher will receive the same percentage cut of the $9.99 sale that they received from the $59.99 sale.\n\nLet's now assume that Gamestop has a digital NFT token that allows resale of digital games. Someone in 2010 buys the game for $59.99, and today sells its for $9.99. The publisher receives a cut of the $9.99 sale, in addition to the original $59.99 sale.\n\nThe problem here is, what's the difference to the publisher? They receive the same amount of money from the sales. The keys to sell a second copy of the game have already been generated and sent to Steam for resale, so there's no incremental cost there. The NFT resale is basically cannibalizing a new sale.\n\n&gt; drive up scarcity of used titles? Release special NFT collector's versions of certain titles which are unlikely to ever go down in price due to extreme rarity?\n\n&gt; Especially the latter: think Magic the Gathering and take the Black Lotus card as an example. If you could release a fixed amount of those into the wild and get a cut for each and every high-price resale of those decades down the line... wouldn't you?\n\nI can see the argument/value for NFT sales of collectible items intended to be artificially scarce. Maybe not a multibillion dollar market, but definitely a possible avenue for revenue growth.\n\n I don't see the argument for driving artificial scarcity for regular, non collectible digital games. Even in the pre digital games, the games that were scarce were driven by production costs, and not by publishers attempting to drive up prices by limiting availability.",

        "body": "\nPaysafe preps post-Spac\u00a0refi\n\u00a0\n\n02 Jun 2021\n\nFintech payments provider Paysafe has launched a refinancing of its remaining credit facilities, following its $9bn merger with a Bill Foley-controlled Spac, which closed in March. The merger and its accompanying PIPE allowed the firm to pay down debt and cut its leverage, and now it wants to lock in the benefits with a lower-cost refi.\n\nJP Morgan is sole physical bookrunner on the dollar and euro term loans, totalling $1.026bn between the currencies. This will be followed with an equal sized slug of bonds in dollar and euros, yet to be launched.\nTalk on both tranches is 300bp-325bp at 99.5, with a 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, half a turn below its present level, according to the loan marketing materials.\nLenders have successfully pushed back on proposed margin ratchet terms \u2014\u00a0including Cerba, for example \u2014 but these are generally deals which started with more aggressive terms, such as multiple step-downs for each quarter-turn of leverage. Deals with 25bp for half a turn have largely sailed through.\n\"It's a real economic term and something investors can easily rally around,\" said a leveraged finance syndicate banker. \"Some of the other docs points can be a bit of a niche interest but this is universal.\"\nPaysafe earmarked \u20ac1.25bn-equivalent of its outstanding debt for repayment as part of the merger, which closed at the end of March. The company said in\u00a0its introduction to equity market analysts\u00a0that it would have net leverage of 3.6-3.8 times on its 2021 earnings following the transaction \u2014 suggesting it intends to activate the margin step-down quickly.\nIt will, however, be going on the acquisition trail as well. Outlining the deal to analysts, Foley said: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6 times. As Paysafe continues to grow and generate cash flow, that leverage ratio will continue to come down creating even more opportunity to pursue accretive M&amp;A opportunities.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s estimated leverage at 5.2 times on March 2021 numbers, after backing out some of the company\u2019s adjustments.\nBased on its expected 2021 Ebitda, the business was 6-6.2 times levered at the end of last year, with net debt of $2.99bn, incurred when Blackstone and CVC took the firm private in 2017. The sponsors scored a huge win with the transaction, paying \u00a33bn for the company and selling it on at a valuation of $9bn.\nHowever, both firms will remain invested. They took $2.3bn off the table as part of the Spac deal, but rolled over $3.29bn, while the Spac itself put in $1.467bn.\nThe PIPE investment (private investment in public equity) closed at the same time injected a further $2bn, with cornerstones from Foley-affiliated entities Cannae Holdings and Trasimene Capital Management, and outside capital from Fidelity, Third Point, and Maplelane Asset Management.\nAlongside the term loan and bond refi, the company will have a new $305m revolver in place following the closing of the deal.\nSpac-driven M&amp;A activity is increasingly\u00a0feeding through to leveraged credit markets and to CLO portfolios, as sponsor-owned companies become targets for SPAC acquisitions. The equity raised through this route usually deleverages the company, meaning loan repayments or refinancings tighter \u2014 in some cases, helping take out loans trading at low levels at par.\nPaysafe\u2019s existing euro loan already had a margin of 325bp, the wide end of the new guidance, but it also had outstanding second lien debt of $200m and \u20ac214m in its original LBO capital structure, which paid 725bp and 700bp respectively and have now been repaid.",

We should easily be able to hit $25 and have a run for $30+ (IMO either end of this week or beginning of the next week unless fed tapering screws us or GME ER takes the whole sector down)\n\n1-3 month chart: looks extremely bullish. Key resistances at $20.50 -$21.00 and $30. Strong support at $14, $17 -$18. Overall, bulls are in charge. Growing 4% a day steadily past 2 weeks with maybe 1 Rex day. \n\n1 week chart: we\u2019ve been able to hold the $18 support and forming a new one around $19.90-20.10 range. We are slowly breaking down the $21 wall that was created back in Jan-Feb. in past 3 days we have hit $20.50-$21.00 range over 4 times and bounced back. But you can tel that it\u2019s looking bullish because while we are bouncing back at the same ceiling price, the support price is steadily increasing.

That\u2019s not very good advice...\nI\u2019m not telling people to be ok with their losses because them and my self included should have bought in at the start of the second impulsive wave, I am just stating this price movement is normal.",

        "body": "Yo so this is my analysis of TLRY and why I think it\u2019s bullish: \n\n 1 year+ chart:\nJust apply the Fibonacci curve. We are way below 38% and got lots to run. We should easily be able to hit $25 and have a run for $30+ (IMO either end of this week or beginning of the next week unless fed tapering screws us or GME ER takes the whole sector down)\n\n1-3 month chart: looks extremely bullish. Key resistances at $20.50 -$21.00 and $30. Strong support at $14, $17 -$18. Overall, bulls are in charge. Growing 4% a day steadily past 2 weeks with maybe 1 Rex day. \n\n1 week chart: we\u2019ve been able to hold the $18 support and forming a new one around $19.90-20.10 range. We are slowly breaking down the $21 wall that was created back in Jan-Feb. in past 3 days we have hit $20.50-$21.00 range over 4 times and bounced back. But you can tel that it\u2019s looking bullish because while we are bouncing back at the same ceiling price, the support price is steadily increasing. This creates an ascending triangle and is a sign of a strong bull coming up",
