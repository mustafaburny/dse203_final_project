        "body": "As a Software Engineer, a lot of successful technology companies have very simple ideas and businesses. The biggest benefit of tech is its ability to grow and scale up really quickly with stable revenue streams, especially SAAS companies.\n\nMy biggest and most successful position is Shopify. They have had consistent massive growth. For example, their annual revenue growth is 47%, not even including this year! Their technology is also simple; they make it easy to create online stores and handle payments.\n\nAnother example is Paycom. They provide a simple service to do payroll processing. Again they have stable growth being able to grow as a technology company, with revenue growth of 30%.\n\nChegg is another example. They provide a subscription based education service. This includes problem guides, practice problems, study material, math tools, etc. Their revenue growth is 28%.\n\nSo a good strategy might be to find easy to understand industries that can benefit from technology and there's plenty of those to be found!\n\n[Wix.com](https://Wix.com) makes it easy to make websites.\n\nSquare makes it easy for business owners to accept payments. They also are developing a digital wallet.\n\nZoom provides an easy way to do video-conferencing!\n\nDocuSign makes it easy to sign documents digitally.",

Still long $FXF Swiss Franc because they cannot even control their currency rising against the Euro.\n\nI am going to set up a poor mans covered call on BETZ or DKNG or both.  2022/2021 calendar calls on SPXL.\n\nShorting OXY.  Cramer just mentioned this stock again as a short today so I hope he did not jinx it but unless there is a takeover that is willing to overlook a balance sheet from hell....\n\nSelling my 0DTE puts tomorrow after the morning pre-market pump I expect a sea of red again on the $QQQ with 18 put contracts.

Cost 1.80.    \n\nIf rocket shoots up to like 80....lose all extrinsic value....spread is worth 2.00.    Needed to make sure spread was larger than premium paid.   After that...anything less than a massive sell off is profitable.  It could dip a little, trade flat, or go up.   Based on bad wsb info that i should've double checked, thought it was gonna go up a little at the very least.    \n\nResults, It sold off a little and I sold my spread for 3.05 this morning.  Stock went down, made profit on a bullish spread...iv is a bitch.   \n\nCurrently had avgo sept 4 / sept 11 call spreads at 375.  Bought for 0.4, sold half for 1.2.  Already booked a profit.    Expect good numbers...more so it just didn't have the run up the other semis implied it should have...., sell off because bitches are scared. Then a run up next week.",

        "body": "Broad Market:  That's tough to say.  If your very bullish on Tech stocks, QQQ might be your best bet. If you want a broader fund, then VOO is a good one.  QQQ uses the NASDAQ 100 as its bench mark while VOO uses the S&amp;P 500 as its benchmark. The top five holdings are the same for each of these, but in different percentages.  Another broad market fund I like is IWF. IWF uses the Russell 1000 as its benchmark.  It has a very good track record and seems to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over time. It's very similar to QQQ in its holdings, but again, percentages are slightly different.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices for a broad market fund. \n\nTech:  You'll get lots of opinions on this.  ARKQ and ARKW would be the choice of the ARK funds if you want it to be purely tech.  If you want to invest in disruptive innovative companies, but don't mind expanding beyond tech, consider ARKK. \n\nAnother one I like for tech is XLK. However, you have to keep in mind that XLK is almost 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft.  If you believe in those two companies, consider this one.  (VGT is very similar). \n\nSOXX is a fund that invests in semiconductor technology. One thing I like about this fund is that there will not be a lot of crossover between this one and your broad market fund.  Top holdings include: QCOM (9.5%), NVDA (9.5%), AVGO (8.3%), TXN (8%), INTC (5%). \n\nWCLD:  Cloud computing is a great sector, but be aware that many of these companies will also be in QQQ.  Top holdings include ZM (2.4%), CRM (2.3%), PLAN (2.2%), CRWD (2.1%), WDAY (2.1%). One thing I like about this ETF is that the investments are much more spread out than most ETFs. So, if any one company in the ETF is affected by bad news, it should have little impact on the ETF as a whole. I think WCLD is an excellent choice. \n\nClean Energy ETF:  I like ICLN like many others on this site.  I think the clean/renewable energy sector is really going to blossom over the next 10 years and I think ICLN is one of the better ETFs in the sector. Others you may want to look into include:  PBW, QCLN and TAN.",

This means a massive write-off on a big portion of their assets, suddenly making the asset part of the debt equation look much worse. That's basically admitting defeat in the cutting edge manufacturing aspect of chips, making their investors loose a lot of faith in them.\n\nI'm not saying this will happen, but the risk of it happening, means that I will not take the chance.\n\nA safer bet IMO would be TSMC ($TSM)\n\nMost of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, Broadcom., Marvell, MediaTek, Nvidia, and Qualcomm are or were customers of TSMC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA ***riskier*** bet, but with higher upside, is AMD.",
