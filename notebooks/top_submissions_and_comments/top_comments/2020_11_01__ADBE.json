        "body": "Here's the problem with their business model, and it states it up front in their prospectus that most investors aren't willing to read. Their customer acquisition costs are very expensive. They spend several hundred thousands trying to acquire a customer because it requires them sending developers to a client, writing custom code to ingest data, and then hope the client signs up with them. If the client does not, then they lose that developer time. The hope is that the client signs up and pays an initial subscription cost. Then over time, the client would request additional data to be ingested, which increases cost to the customer. Finally, they hope that their systems will be so integrated with the client's systems, that they cannot be easily replaced or it would not be cost-effective to do so. That's when they will profit the most from the client.\n\nHere's the problem. They haven't been profitable in 17 years because this business model doesn't work. It is limited by the number of developers available to implement their platform into different client systems. This is the painstaking manual process.\n\nHere is my opinion: it is a high-millions, low-billion dollar business, but nothing that will scale like Adobe, Netflix, and other cloud services. They may have the best product in the world, but just like any product, you need sales. 125 customers after 17 years is an average of 7 customers a year. Also, they need positive cash flow. Instead, they have increasing operating costs and uncertain profit because some of their clients have downscaled services or cancel completely. $10 IPO was cheap. I considered, but passed. Great that some were able to double their money so far. But right now, it is risky. MoviePass was a great product for their customers, but their increasing operating costs due to their bad business model was their downfall.",

In this talk, we'll give an overview of how Elasticsearch is used at Palantir and demo one of the latest applications, a tool that helps lawyers investigate financial wrongdoing. We'll then discuss how we made the switch to Elasticsearch from a custom solution built on Lucene and Postgres. The focus will be on one of our biggest challenges, implementing performant, fine-grained access control. \n\nThe main \"proprietary\" portion of PLTR as far as I could find, is that they've developed some custom APIs to streamline data processing, so if you're constantly getting real time data, they've put in work to make that process faster and more reliable. \n\nIt kind of makes sense if that's truly what makes them special that they tried to get into finance, since that's one of the few industries dealing with billions of transactions a day where speed of classification is really important. The fact that they haven't made many inroads in that sector makes me question how much value they have outside of government agencies.\n\nAfter looking at Palantir I decided to invest in Elastic instead, but I don't have a lot of conviction in that pick. I just viewed the fact that Elastic already has more customers than Palantir, especially among large corporations, as a roadblock for Palantir gaining share among corporations. Obviously Palantir isn't only Elastic Search, but that's really the core functionality that most companies want, and since Elastic is open source, all of the major developers either already have, or soon will develop a GUI that's the equivalent of the Palantir front end (such as Adobe Sensei).",

Except Palantir engineers must learn on hand the data from various industries and specially tailor the software to fit the individual customers better. Their profits are becoming less negative over the years as they increase their customer base and retention rates, and as their credibility and reputation increases. \n\nMicrosoft and Adobe were B2B before with their software before jumping 200000% since the 1980s.
