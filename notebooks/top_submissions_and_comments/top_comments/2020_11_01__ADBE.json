        "body": "Here's the problem with their business model, and it states it up front in their prospectus that most investors aren't willing to read. Their customer acquisition costs are very expensive. They spend several hundred thousands trying to acquire a customer because it requires them sending developers to a client, writing custom code to ingest data, and then hope the client signs up with them. If the client does not, then they lose that developer time. The hope is that the client signs up and pays an initial subscription cost. Then over time, the client would request additional data to be ingested, which increases cost to the customer. Finally, they hope that their systems will be so integrated with the client's systems, that they cannot be easily replaced or it would not be cost-effective to do so. That's when they will profit the most from the client.\n\nHere's the problem. They haven't been profitable in 17 years because this business model doesn't work. It is limited by the number of developers available to implement their platform into different client systems. This is the painstaking manual process.\n\nHere is my opinion: it is a high-millions, low-billion dollar business, but nothing that will scale like Adobe, Netflix, and other cloud services. They may have the best product in the world, but just like any product, you need sales. 125 customers after 17 years is an average of 7 customers a year. Also, they need positive cash flow. Instead, they have increasing operating costs and uncertain profit because some of their clients have downscaled services or cancel completely. $10 IPO was cheap. I considered, but passed. Great that some were able to double their money so far. But right now, it is risky. MoviePass was a great product for their customers, but their increasing operating costs due to their bad business model was their downfall.",

In this talk, we'll give an overview of how Elasticsearch is used at Palantir and demo one of the latest applications, a tool that helps lawyers investigate financial wrongdoing. We'll then discuss how we made the switch to Elasticsearch from a custom solution built on Lucene and Postgres. The focus will be on one of our biggest challenges, implementing performant, fine-grained access control. \n\nThe main \"proprietary\" portion of PLTR as far as I could find, is that they've developed some custom APIs to streamline data processing, so if you're constantly getting real time data, they've put in work to make that process faster and more reliable. \n\nIt kind of makes sense if that's truly what makes them special that they tried to get into finance, since that's one of the few industries dealing with billions of transactions a day where speed of classification is really important. The fact that they haven't made many inroads in that sector makes me question how much value they have outside of government agencies.\n\nAfter looking at Palantir I decided to invest in Elastic instead, but I don't have a lot of conviction in that pick. I just viewed the fact that Elastic already has more customers than Palantir, especially among large corporations, as a roadblock for Palantir gaining share among corporations. Obviously Palantir isn't only Elastic Search, but that's really the core functionality that most companies want, and since Elastic is open source, all of the major developers either already have, or soon will develop a GUI that's the equivalent of the Palantir front end (such as Adobe Sensei).",

Take Snowflake which have a lower revenue and still negative profit being valued over twice of Palantir. \n\nThe main reason why it was making a loss is because it has very high initial customer acquisition costs, similar to Microsoft and Adobe back in the 80s when they were developing for enterprise. Except Palantir engineers must learn on hand the data from various industries and specially tailor the software to fit the individual customers better. Their profits are becoming less negative over the years as they increase their customer base and retention rates, and as their credibility and reputation increases. \n\nMicrosoft and Adobe were B2B before with their software before jumping 200000% since the 1980s. If Palantir could create, transfer and scale their data AI technologies to everyday consumers and become a big name in the future, they will easily be a multi trillion dollar company. If they don't, at least I know they won't go bankrupt with their military dependence hahaha.",

Adobe keeps pouring money into bullshit apps like Premiere Rush or Fresco that literally nobody who is a professional gives a shit about.\n\nMy suggestion would be to put it into something like Unity instead, and bet on it becoming the \"Adobe\" of video game making. The learning curve isn't that bad, and it's cheap/free for people to start making stuff. The next generation wants to make video games, not commercials.\n\nDisclosure I have 40 shares of Unity.",

I believe the P/E reflects CSIQ's slow growth being a slightly more mature company (founded in 2001) whilst its competitors came around 5 years later. Also, if you look into these renewable ETFs like TAN, they favour SEDG (10.98%), ENPH (9.61%) and FSLR (7.70%) more against CSIQ (3.71%). It's the same story if you look into ICLN.\n\nThat's a just few areas of concern for me as a current investor in CSIQ.",

And the first question people ask when they find out what I did in college is about the economy and stocks. And it\u2019s a dumb question and they don\u2019t even realize it. Like I spent years learning about scarcity and a bunch of basically applied calculus and statistics. \n\nUnless I work directly for a brokerage I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to make an informed decision any one way or the other, and even then it would only be a best estimate and one with enough of a likely chance to not be correct that it would be pretty irresponsible to give an opinion on it. \n\nI can fully do the math behind it sure, but the stock market has proven time and time again that it\u2019s irrational and not really predictable with any algorithm. There is a reason that economic theory even says throwing a dart at a chart of stocks and picking where it lands is just as likely to be accurate than if you picked it based on extensive amounts of DD and research. \n\nBut I just point people towards index\u2019s, tell them if they aren\u2019t retiring in the next 5 years don\u2019t be afraid or worried that the stock market drops every now and then etc etc. \n\ntl;dr Economists don\u2019t study the economy they study scarcity. I\u2019d be extremely skeptical of any economist claiming to know what the market will do or that they have figured out the stock market. We exist to do small scale data analysis, or to advise large scale economic moves aka monetary/fiscal policy, we aren\u2019t adept at guessing small movements within certain markets. And if we\u2019re in a spot where we can then we are also in a spot where the sec would have something to say if we profited off it.",

        "body": "&gt; IMO it really validates the risks related with EM investments and the risks that are attributed to investments in Chinese markets\n\nActually if you read the piece the exact opposite conclusion is reached: that with this move China actually **derisked** its economy and therefore arguably made it safer for investors. It was not a \"move on a whim by Xi because he got his sensitive feelings hurt by Jack Ma\" like so many Western publications argued. Like the piece says:\n\n&gt; [Regulators think that] there are many deficiencies of the current Chinese financial system, but that does not mean \u201cBigTech\u201d gets to do what it wants, even if we can acknowledge their contributions to society.  TL;DR: we like innovation, but let\u2019s not overhype the magic of \u201cbig data,\u201d and anyway, you\u2019re still operating in financial services, and so that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be regulated, like it or not.  That\u2019s because if we the regulators don\u2019t step in, and something goes wrong, who will pay the price?  Society will, the citizens will. Don\u2019t you guys remember the Great Financial Crisis of 2008?  A few parties won, yes, but all the rest of us? We lost.  We were all set back.  That\u2019s not happening again, not on our watch!\n\nWhen regulators think like that, I think that's a system worth investing into IMHO, because they think long-term and they think greater-good which ultimately leads to a stronger economy, not something to be scared by...\n\nThe only argument that can be made, I think, is that they acted too last-minute and that is scary in itself but it is also actually somewhat reassuring because they're not afraid to stop something as iconic as the world's largest IPO when they believe it can ultimately be detrimental to society. They didn't mind losing face and that is a positive sign for China.",

Then in this speech he called all the banks \"pawn shops\" for loans and basically made fun of the biggest govt backed banks (who he had sold shitty debt securities to). Essentially he offloaded a shit ton of liability from ANT's (like paypal/venmo in china) loans onto the chinese government aka the chinese people.  So now the govt has to deal with all that before it potentially explodes in their faces, and they have to teach jack ma a lesson because he essentially sold them bags of dogshit and then bragged about it publicly while laughing in their faces",

        "body": "The big two for me are:\n\nNetflix - The Q2 lockdown was the absolute most perfect condition imaginable for Netflix's business and anybody that had any interest in Netflix should have already subscribed by that point in time. I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out. I've replaced them with Pinterest in my portfolio as my new search/advertising stock. Social search is the future and I now see the genius advertising potential of the Pinterest platform; I see them stealing advertising dollars away from Google and growing much better than Google over the next 5 years.",
