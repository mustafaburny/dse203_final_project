More of a personal stock recommendation if you would like but I would recommend Sony for you to check out, I can send you a DD on them if you would like, but just putting Sony out there. I would also recommend for you to get started that you get some education under your belt, and would highly recommend the following websites etc. Investing.gov has a great getting started page, investopedia has some great education in general, and is like the Wikipedia for investing, and also khan academy playlist on stocks and bonds are super helpful",

He was laughing and said he's never seen anything like this and it's funny because he's used to dealing with people after retiring and managing their 401ks and now all he's been doing is talking to \"young professionals that are getting into trading for the first time.\"\n\nThanks Ryan from Fidelity.",

To the moon!!\u201d\n\nNo. This is idiotic. Some of the largest asset managers in the world are Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity, State Street, Schwab, and T. Rowe. A huge percentage of their businesses are passive funds and ETFs. They buy whatever the index creator tells them to. If their ETF gets inflows they buy more. If it gets outflows they sell. They don\u2019t \u201clike the stock,\u201d they don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t make more money if the stock goes up or down. They own EVERY SINGLE STOCK IN THE MARKET. \n\nMost of these firms also have ACTIVE funds, which are actively managed and trying to beat an index. If an actively managed fund buys a stock, they like it. These are a smaller part of most of their businesses (T. Rowe and Fido still have big active businesses) Cathie Wood runs active funds. When she buys or sells, it matters! \n\nGenerally speaking active funds buying stocks is a \u201cgood sign\u201d (although they\u2019re obviously not always right). Passive investors buying or selling stock is no sign unless they\u2019re doing it because of new index inclusion which are well known in advance (see TSLA). \n\nA lot of passive investors in a low float stock actually IS a hypothetical good set up for a gamma or short squeeze. This is because they are indifferent to price. If Vanguard owns 95% of a stock in its passive funds and it goes up 1000% they... do nothing. The more passive investors in a smaller market cap stock the more retail trading effects pricing because there are few natural sellers (it is price inelastic) \nGood thread here: https://twitter.com/macrocephalopod/status/1362758036188758016?s=20\n\nHowever! This may only be the case between rebalances. XRT is an \u201cequal weighted ETF\u201d for example that rebalances every quarter. It will sell some of the best performers and buy some of the worst performers. \nOn the other hand S&amp;P 500 is market cap weighted index. It\u2019s rebalances are more about additions/exclusions. \n\nAnyway, generally speaking, stop saying sht like \u201cBlackrock (a multi *trillion* dollar manager) bought $3 *million* dollars of this stock\u201d and stop thinking it means anything unless you want to lose all of your money.",

Or Bernie? Or know how to make a FOIA request? People need to go to jail for this. \n\nI just emptied all my cash reserves into Fidelity, because even at $270, it's a bargain and I want to watch the fucking HF's burn. Burn.\n\nFull disclosure, part of why I'm pissed is that I was trying to do market buy for 135 shares when it got close to 200, but Fidelity glitched, and when I refreshed I forgot to set it back to \"buy\". I fucked it up and hit market sell. And even though the price was at $203, they sold for $180.00 for some goddamn reason. By the time I realized my mistake it was back up to $223 and I bought back in, but I essentially just jizzed $7k into the wind. I know this is my own fucking fault, but I was trying to do my part, and I fucked it up. I think I may have been the literal lowest sale price of the day.",
