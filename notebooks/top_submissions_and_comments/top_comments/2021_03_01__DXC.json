Hoplite soldiers utilized the phalanx formation to be effective in war with fewer soldiers (wsb vs. hedge funds). The formation discouraged the soldiers from acting alone, for this would compromise the formation and minimize its strengths (ape strong together). The hoplites were primarily represented by free citizens \u2013 propertied farmers and artisans \u2013 who were able to afford a linen armour or a bronze armour suit and weapons (stimulus check and ~~robinhood~~ Fidelity account). Most hoplites were not professional soldiers and often lacked sufficient military training (we aren't so bright guys, it's ok tho). Some states maintained a small elite professional unit, known as the *epilektoi* (\"chosen\") since they were picked from the regular citizen infantry (DFV). These existed at times in Athens, Argos, Thebes, and Syracuse, among others (Wild ronamarkets). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistory is important. Now lets go out and make some.",

I am starting to pick up on a trend: any time I read about a stock on Reddit, it's only *after* it has already spiked; i.e., it's too late to make a substantial profit, and likely to crash back down and make a bagholder out of me. Any tickers I have bought in on, I have sold back out of again very quickly before I could lose more than a pittance. Two months ago the idea of investing had never crossed my mind. Now I think I'm starting to learn how it works.\n\nAs I search for stocks and do my DD, I feel like I'm walking through a carnival full of carnies trying to swindle me. All of the financial sites try to drown me in nonsense, ads and disinformation. They only want to use me and leave me holding the bag. Unfortunately, I'm not finding much more potential in Reddit, either--these investing subs are pumped with tickers that have already made shareholders a massive profit... I'm not looking to buy at the top of a spike, or even at a subsequent median.\n\nRecently, I've stopped looking for stocks that are on the rise, and am instead looking for ones that have just crashed.\n\nHowever, it feels like I'm being restricted in terms of the stocks I can \"see.\" **All** of the NYSE and NASDAQ tickers listed on the pennystock scanner sites are greater than .50... Yet most of them were worth much, much less than that just a few weeks ago. Obviously by the time they're listed for me to see, someone has already made a massive profit off them. It's as if they *hide* the names of tickers that are currently bottomed out.\n\nNaturally, I started looking into OTC tickers, and got very excited about some of them. Then when I attempted to use my Fidelity account to pick up shares in some OTC stocks, they prevented me from buying 90% of the tickers I tried. They cite them \"being a big risk,\" etc... I'm frustrated by that. I know they're a risk, but I'm buying them at an all-time low, you mother-f\\*\\*kers. I stand to lose very little, and make a lot. I don't think I'm being \"protected\" by Fidelity, I think I'm being cheated from some fat gains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, which brokers do you recommend for unlimited access to OTC tickers? Schwab?\n\n I've also heard of Interactive Brokers, TradeStation...  Any insight for a noob?\n\nI'm finding some stuff here that *looks* like it has massive potential and very little risk. Maybe it's just because I have untrained eyes... But the fact I seem to be running into so many hurdles makes me feel like I'm right, and that **they** are just doing what they can to make it hard for the little man to get his piece of pie.\n\nHelp me out, and I will DM you with some of the tickers I'm looking at. Maybe you can confirm whether I'm a crazy gambling addict, or if I'm looking at potential for very attractive gains.\n\nP.S. Some people probably want to tell me to be careful with penny stocks. Lots of risk, don't get addicted, all of that. I know the kind of person I am. I've got an itch and I have to scratch it. Maybe I'll get burned. Maybe I'll find some fat gains. Either way, I have to see for myself. I'm only working with several hundred dollars right now and even if I lose it *all*, I won't lose any sleep over it.",

Early 2000's bought into FAANG's and others. Saw great returns in them, as expected. Pretty much ignored my investments other than 1 or 2 times/year when making IRA contributions and if I thought about it.\n\nWith market crash in 2020, plus older children interested in markets, I began investing/trading stocks which I thought would bounce back from lows, like MAR, HT, SVC, XOM, AAL, CCL.  Also, began swing trading SPY &amp; QQQ options, with moderate success. Learned more about wheeling and options strategy. \n\nRecently began selling small portions of FAANG stocks, because they were overweighted in my portfolio, and because I don't think they will go 10x+ like they did in the 2000's. Just too big, not because they are badly run.  Better to find the new FAANG stocks, which could be EV's, weed, health care, China stocks, etc.\n\nAll money is staying in my investment accounts, I have other sources of income for day-to-day living, but will eventually use this money for kids' weddings, retirement home, life in retirement, unborn grandkids' college funds, etc. Generational wealth.",

Many are junk companies that will go away.\n\nIf you look at Tesla, the hardest part has been manufacturing, and they still really aren't profitable on the actual cars. And if you look at the new mail truck, they talk about it being electric or not about \"a choice of propulsion\" and it's really not something that defines the vehicle. \n\nSo much of the clean energy space is problematic because the problems they are trying to solve are hard problems and the laws of science aren't that generous sometimes. Look at the history and challenges of Hydrogen, it was not practical a decade ago and I'm pretty sure it's not practical now, it's too inefficient at scale. \n\nI've heard people say that people will buy EV's because it's the right thing to do.
