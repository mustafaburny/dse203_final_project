Dassault Systemes and Siemens both have surpassed Autodesk in features, industries, customers etc.\n\nFor example, the automotive industry is almost completely off Autodesk, SpaceX uses Siemens and Dassault. Autodesk is still used in construction, but there are almost no new areas where it can expand into.\n\nThe main reason is that Teamcenter and 3DExperience are cloud platforms where you can link up your PLC software to the design. This is almost a must for all designs that contain any type of control software.\n\nSo is it still a big company and player in the markt? Yes. Is it going to grow and surpass its competition? No. Should you buy the stock? Not if you ask me.",

Autodesk has the market in land development and architecture.  It's an engineering preference thing as much as a time to learn and get efficient at using the product.\n\nAutodesk is far and away a better product.  And it doesn't matter as your clients are used to microstation have thier standards set in microstation and demand the files be submitted In microstation.  The folks in charge are boomers and they like what they like.  Sure some states will run autodesk for roads.... But amtrak and all of the east coast and west coast transit agencies don't and niether do thier consulants.  So autodesk is a clear winner but not alone and likely in second place for what the infa bill provides.  \n\nSo I agree, but I'm not nearly as bullish",

In other words, your potential for growth is tied to the popularity of TSLA, NVDA, and AMD, rather than company/market fundamentals. Of course, that still means you could double or triple your money \u2013 popularity is a powerful force in the stock market. \n\nPersonally I'd suggest trimming those hype stocks, and adding more solid, profitable companies with low P/E ratios. I'm bullish on FDX (FedEx), which is selling for a bargain at the moment due to supply chain disruptions. ADSK (Autodesk) has lots of room for growth as it captures more market share. NKE (Nike) is a safe play. HMC (Honda) is currently undervalued; I felt the same about Ford in September, and then Ford shot up by 35%, so I've switched that money into Honda. LOGI (Logitech) is another great company with lots of upside after suffering a big drop for no good reason \u2013 it's a market leader and set to profit from WFH trends.\n\nHope some of those suggestions work for you!",

I think that's the hesitancy of piling more into APPS.\n\nMost recent Quarterly report: https://ir.digitalturbine.com/sec-filings/quarterly-reports##document-41572-0001628280-21-021199-1\n\nAPPS made $310M revenue in Q3 with margins of 5%, net income of $16M. They have huge costs of revenue around license fees and revenue sharing. They actually put up a loss in Q3 of $8M because of their tight margins and increased administrative costs.\n\nWith margins of only 5%, investors will want much higher revenue growth or much tighter expense control reliably drive profits.\n\nTake a comparative example of other high multiplier companies. Even MSFT, NOW and ADSK have 60%+ margins. Having greater margins gives you much more flexibility in revenue scale and reinvestment. With 5% margins, it looks like APPS is more of a service company than a true software play. Their revenue sharing model may be their ultimate downfall.\n\nI don't have a bear case for APPS, but rather an apathetic case for APPS. You need high margins and strong revenue growth to dictate high P/S multipliers. Without that, you need very strong expense control so you can manage your P/E ratios.\n\nObviously, these aren't the only things. If your revenue growth is super strong and you can outrun your dependence on margin buy driving revenue 200% per year like APPS, then you're good! But I think APPS is going to level off around a channel of $60-$75 until it can prove that revenues will jump again in 2022.",

PLTR, is valued at 41B with 1.43B revenue and -35% profit margin. Autodesk has a mass market offering with off-the-shelf software and some large, customized deals. Palantir, instead, depends on highly customized deals, so it can't scale for the valuation the market is giving it. It doesn't matter if the customer is the government. That's a mirage for retail investors.\n\nPalantir doesn't have a shitty product, but somehow this stock became a meme here, most likely because of the weird CEO, and now there are a bunch of bagholders hoping for a miracle.",

        "body": "User of Autodesk here.\n\n1. My company has used Autocad/Inventor for years. Pretty much stuck with it now since almost all of our drawings and documentation are in Autodesk. While other systems can open files and view them, it does not allow for manipulation. Changing now means a lot of wasted time in the future. Wasted time to update or redraw drawings is just wasted money. What I am saying here, they probably have very high retention rates\n2. To address the growth. They update the software frequently and eventually stop supporting the old revisions. Just like other software companies that have been successful for years. When considering the point above, I wouldn't expect to see a steep drop off of users without a Catalyst... new game changing software or some form company mishap\n3. Further on growth. There are levels you purchase and those come with different addons. These are FEA analysis, CAM, simulation, and a few others. Someone may not buy them upfront and add them on later. Also, there is a subscription support available as well for continuous revenue stream.\n4. Odd to say almost anyone can use Zoom and only engineers with undergraduate degrees or better use Autodesk. Not true. I have 5 users in my company. I am the only one with an actual 4 year degree. With new graduating classes from a plethora of universities each year and an expanding economy, demand is there for new seats. \n\nI can't say that the price will go up or down based off anything as I haven't followed this company as a potential investment. I just don't expect any major moves and certainly not based off the musings presented as DD. Earnings may disappoint and a drop will follow. Don't expect it to be a steep and sustained drop. Based of the 5 years chart, ASKK has seen sustained and controlled growth. \n\nUp 400% over 5 years. That has stalled in the past year which may give some credibility to the lack of growth affecting the price. The last year has been a lot of wait and see in industry. I have no positions yet but after considering the above DD, my counter points, and a little chart observance, I think I am going to do a Put for earnings and a Leap Call. Going to go look at the option charts now.  Not sure I will buy in, just depends on what I find. Good luck Apes",

That's by design - they're niche software and they only exist to extract huge amounts of money from tiny user bases, and the added features over time seem more about breaking compatibility with old versions than moving the product forward and improving productivity.\n\nBig software trends that engineering/scientific has been late to adopt even though they stand the most to gain:\n\n-shift from single threaded to multithreaded optimization (workstations now can have up to 256 threads, not 4)\n\n-massively parallel processing for tasks that support it, completing tasks in a fraction of the time as CPU computing\n\n-API to allow integrating functionality into 3rd party apps or integrated systems, locally or remotely\n\n-Support for virtual environments and virtual desktops (already old tech now) which lead to cloud deployments with scalable performance for huge, distributed teams, and more recently to the insane supercomputer-class instances available from some of the big cloud vendors that allow institutions to completely bypass the hardware acquisition and IT infrastructure process, and solve problems that might take days or weeks on a workstation in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe best thing that could happen I think would be if some of these legacy scientific companies could get acquired by actually competent software/infrastructure companies with vision like Nvidia or Microsoft, and they get dragged into the 21st century. As is, none of those dinosaurs are going to be the Nvidia of 2030 because they're still trying to be the Microsoft of 2002.

They have steady great growth and pricing power which will help in inflation. Plus they\u2019re very well shielded from tech disruption. Those 2 have made up 75% of my portfolio for the last few years. Only downside is - I can\u2019t find others like them. \n\n1 dilemma I\u2019m facing: Autodesk will announce earnings tomorrow. It generally follows Adobe (very similar almost exact companies - doppelg\u00e4ngers), I think there\u2019s a good chance it could set the stage for a breakout to new highs similar to Adobe. But there\u2019s also a decent chance it could go down double digits - which normally I\u2019d get excited about. But now, I don\u2019t really have cash to double down if it\u2019s cheaper. \n\nThat\u2019s what I like about great companies - even if they\u2019re overvalued - just keep buying it like a subscription and it will work out.\n\nAlso agree with Disney.\n\nOh and like I mentioned, also Adobe. But with Adobe I feel like I\u2019ve been playing the overpriced game - for the last decade I\u2019ve been wanting to buy it in a big correction thinking it\u2019s too expensive. A decade!

I personally use AutoCAD electrical all the time, and most companies that work with anything related to electric design also use autoCAD electric. \n\nSo what\u2019s the problem? It not very easy to learn and it can be quit impractical sometimes. \n\nI do think the company is already very engraved into the industry. At least for electrical engineering, it\u2019s as important and relevant as Microsoft Office. All our designs were done using AutoCAD and no one uses anything else\u2019s for that sector\n\nThe earnings call was actually pretty good but the CEO changed the outlook, lowering expectations. \n\nDid I sell? No, Bc I really don\u2019t see anyone else competing with AutoDesk is some segments while some other players are getting fragile and will die once the industry solidifies",
