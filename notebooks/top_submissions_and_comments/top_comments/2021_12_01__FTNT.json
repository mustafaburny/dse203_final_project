As someone who works in the industry and is very involved in selling and engineering this gear, the more I think about it the more I realize that Cisco didn't do enough to curb their competition like we see in other industries. Disney buys out all the major IPs and forces out any competition dominating the market. Same with EA, Amazon, you name it. All of these industries have just 1 or 2 big names as competition, tops. Cisco has DOZENS of big name IT manufacturing competitors. I think youre totally right, had they started buying out competitors or somehow put more effort into offering an even wider array of products (hard to do, tbh. They run the gamut on this stuff) they could be the 1 name in IT. But they're not. Juniper, APC, Fortinet, Adtran Cradlepoint, the list goes on and on and on for market participants that eat into their market cap.",

While I haven't actively managed anything in the past two years, I have consistently outperformed S&amp;P 500 for the 5 years prior. \n\nI've always had at least 50% in VOO, about 25% in well managed companies (AMZN, MSFT, C, 3M) and a rotating cast of opportunity buys (BA, OSK, FTNT, QCOM and a few others). I bought Boeing after the 737 fiasco, not at the bottom, but around 130. I bought QCOM when there was a lot of press about AAPL dumping them ( stock dropped like 40% when AAPL represented around 10% of their client base). OSK and FTNT I purchased due to some short term contracts that were signed, with the chance of them getting extended.",
