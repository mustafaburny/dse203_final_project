As someone who works in the industry and is very involved in selling and engineering this gear, the more I think about it the more I realize that Cisco didn't do enough to curb their competition like we see in other industries. Disney buys out all the major IPs and forces out any competition dominating the market. Same with EA, Amazon, you name it. All of these industries have just 1 or 2 big names as competition, tops. Cisco has DOZENS of big name IT manufacturing competitors. I think youre totally right, had they started buying out competitors or somehow put more effort into offering an even wider array of products (hard to do, tbh. They run the gamut on this stuff) they could be the 1 name in IT. But they're not. Juniper, APC, Fortinet, Adtran Cradlepoint, the list goes on and on and on for market participants that eat into their market cap.",

You won't know how you'll feel until it happens, and you won't be in the right frame of mind to make decisions after it has. This could very easily turn into a trade where you lose 100%. Pick a point, say 50% or whatever you're comfortable with so you can live to die another day.\n\n-Determine where you're going to take profits. This can go the other way too. You wake up to check on your option and it's up 100% just a couple weeks after opening the position. You're once again in a position where you aren't able to make unbiased decisions, and it can just as well go to zero still. These ones are the most demoralizing.\n\nWrite both your stop loss and take-profit point down on a physical piece of paper. It's more effective when it's staring you in the face. Good luck.",

A completely different and legit way to think of a PMCC is that the long is something I expect to recoup for 0 net gain, it's just there to anchor the short legs...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've recently been diving into PMCCs and have taken this outlook. I'm not particularly buying a LEAPS expecting it to be profitable when expiry comes around, I'm buying it for the privilege of selling CCs against it and extracting my profit from it one contract at a time. Any value still remaining near/at expiry is just an added bonus.",

Also loaded on what was a speculative position last year with higher conviction now - bought quite a few CRSP at what I believe to be the bottom at the 78 range - currently avg at 102+-.{Not even mentioning my stupid PLTR,BB position - gambles going wrong atm, believing in the hype and the reason I bought hasnt changed still hence why i havent sold}\r  \n\r  \nAlthough I have sizeable losses here these positions have elevated my positions amazingly.\r  \n\r  \nHolding a sizeable position with xxx% returns on AMD and NIO and very bullish on SE - recently added to my position at 280\r  \n\r  \nbought into the AMC hype with a 14 avg and sold of 80% at around the 60 mark\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSquare shouldve been scalped and rebought 205-280 range and back is ridiculous but oh well\r  \n\r  \nsold JD into strenght to buy into my weaker positions - had a big position before. still bullish but seeing more upside elsewhere atm.\r  \n\r  \nI dont have any us mega caps- I know winners stay winners usually but I am looking for hopefully bigger returns albeith I run risk of big losses, clearly, as well - such as sizeble position in a clinical trial biotech AGTC - currently at a big loss aswell but that was expected.
