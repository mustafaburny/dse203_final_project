FloraCal gaining more and more recognition as well, even white labelling for a few high end brands such as Cookies.\n* Looks like the MI expansion will come online a little later than I thought, they say the growth will be more in Q4 / going into 2022.\n* Doubling their Florida cultivation and retail stores and introducing their whole suite of brands (instead of just flower right now) is the short term goal (max 12 months), but they have much bigger long term plans in terms of taking on the state market.\n* Waiting on more guidance coming out of NY before acting.\n* Nothing on AZ nor MD that I can recall.\n* Charlie is in it to win it, long game.",

This follows a rebound yesterday when tech booked major gains (Nasdaq rallied 1.8% and is now on track to break a four-week losing streak).\n\nAnother post-pandemic low in initial jobless claims yesterday does appear to have helped. Goes to show that just when you don\u2019t see any catalysts for a rally, investors come in and bid things up. This tends to happen in bull markets. We\u2019re still in a bull market. Probably will be for a little while.\n\nCryptos have even bounced a bit. On that note, hope you listened to the [weekly podcast with Jacob Ma-Weaver](https://contrarianpod.com/content/podcasts/season3/regulatory-risk-facing-cryptocurrencies-jacob-ma-weaver/) on crypto regulation. One thing we didn\u2019t even speak about was the IRS. Yesterday the Treasury department came out and said there would be stricter tax reporting requirements. So regulation is coming for cryptos. Whether that removes their utility is another question.\n\nToday we have purchasing manager surveys out at 0945. . That\u2019s it for economic data releases. No major earnings reports either. May be a quiet day. May see more buying, as tends to happen in bull markets. Oh wait, I already said that. \n\nAnyway, have a great weekend.",

        "body": "&gt;I wouldn't buy anything below the 200-ma and certainly when its below both the 50 and 200.\n\nEvery single stock I bought in May 2020 was both below their 50 and 200-day MA. Almost all of them I sold over at 100% profit in less than 2 months. You might say that was a special time. With that logic and if you actually know how a moving average filter actually works, you should know that price of a stock on a random  day in Sep 2019 has an effect on that 50 and 200-day filter curve you see today (on 05/07/2021)! That means all these 50 and 200-day MA curves are severely skewed due to that rapid fall and rise of all these stocks.\n\n&gt;but people much, much smarter, and with a LOT more money, have already put in their bets\n\nMost of the volume we see in stock market is due to trading activities by institutional traders/investors. Some are betting on bullish speculation and some are on bearish speculation. Most of the major stock prices are currently above both 50 and 200-day MA on a yearly chart. Now tell me the people who are betting bearish are less smart and have less money? Go and look at the option open interest on SPY. Billions of dollars are betted on both sides. So, the bearish side is less smart, poor and they do not follow these indicators. Is that what you are trying to say?\n\n&gt;Why would u want to buy a stock below the 200-day MA on the daily, and especially on the weekly?\n\nAll these indicators changes their level based on whether a chart is daily, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, monthly, 3 months, 6 months or yearly and so on. The shape of a chart also changes based on the frequency of the data points such as 1 min, 5 mins, hourly etc. play around with the frequency and duration, you get many different charts. All of them are real chart based on true stock price but they all will look different, all the TA indicators will look different. I would not even look at these MA indicators to buy a stock so that question was invalid.\n\n&gt;Use it as a place to enter and exit a trade is all I'm saying\n\nI entered SPY calls this week when SPY was below both 50 and 200-day MA on both daily and weekly chart. I sold them and make profit when SPY was above 50 and 200-day MA. Which is exactly the opposite of you are referring me to do. \n\nLet me tell you one thing, stock price do not follow any predefined pattern. Once the market closes and the chart is established whether it's a daily or weekly or monthly you can then draw as many pattern as you wish by changing the variable like timeframe and frequency. If a stock price closes above it's 50 and 200 days MA line on both weekly and daily chart. Nobody, I mean nobody in this world can guaranty that that stock price will close higher on the next trading day. Period. A trend is only a trend while it last but the truth is no one knows how long it last. SPY was going up on Wednesday and then it started going down on the same day. What is the trend here up trend? downtrend or dance trend? \n\nTA does not work, ever. Worked, never with any amount of certainty. Give me one indicator that is only 51% correct but that 51% is consistent. If you can give me that indicator then I will bet $1000 in each trade. That tiny difference will make me billions within few years even if I start from just few thousands.",

Not even close to what Microsoft went through for its monopolistic activities in the US. The US media fear mongering on China is pretty toxic. 19 forward P/E. 64% revenue growth last year and good guidance for this year. Insane growth. EPS miss due to a one time fine by the government.",

No one could even think of such a plan. \n\n1. As far as Jack Ma is concerned. A Chinese company helping Chinese people.Chinese government doesn\u2019t care.What Ant group was doing was shadow banking in tech. It was offering loans to buyers and sellers without credit rating check and minimum 25% reserve requirements. So when foreign investment comes in into Chinese markets it can create boom bust cycles in China to avoid subprime mortgage like crisis in China and this they realized and nailed it.\n\n2. All GDP numbers can be verified by import export data of United States/other countries \n\n3. Their auditing is done by Ernst &amp; Young. So blame US company if they screw up.\n\n\nAs far as your other points are concerned that is western media propaganda.\n\nIf you understand the scale of BRI. It is mind boggling \nAlso remember news is written by average to below average people.They also have families to feed. Before you go around regurgitating media talking points. I would recommend reading a book \u201cFake News Factory\u201d by David Sedgwick.",
