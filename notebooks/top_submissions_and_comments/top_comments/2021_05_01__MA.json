SQ looks to have a double bottom on the daily chart and the 50 MA has held up these past few weeks which makes me think a minor beat on earnings would at the very least not drop below $240 in the very near short term. You never know obviously but the risk imo isn't substantial if one wanted to swing trade a call even holding through earnings for unexpected results. For holding stock I don't see it worth it atm as I see an entry at around 225 to be feasible as it tends to fall thru it's 50 MA for a few days before pivoting back up. The chart basically fuckin looks like the NASDAQ. W shaped recovery lol. Think it won't get that close to it's recent low of $202.

They sent our practice a cold call email with the features and it seemed cool looking, so I tried it out. I tend to try lots of demos mostly just to see what is out there, but I never really have plans to make a full switch because we like ECW. It was more curiosity than a desire to switch, really. If it had been a platform that could have integrated directly into our EMR, that would have been better. \n2. We pay a quarterly licensing free for ECW and had/have some setup costs with new features. Overall, the expense is roughly $15k + $5k per provider, per year. I think the biggest hurdle is that it isn't using practice data, but insurance claim data. In theory, that should be the same, but it is definitely not in practice. We are also rather unique in that we don't participate with Medicare, so we have very few MA patients and wouldn't be able to use this for 95% of our patients. That point was probably my biggest reason for not adding one extra tool, even though it is free. At some point, there is just too much data and you can't expect employees to navigate it efficiently, so we stick with basic measures and just try to do really well on them. \n3. Nobody else has offered to pay us to use a service, so that is unique. Athena has a free EMR version, but it is ad-supported so our visit notes would look like they're sponsored by a drug company, which isn't a good look! The financial incentive selling points seem to be the ability to easily qualify for Medicare Meaningful Use, but we don't participate so that benefit doesn't help us. \n4. I have had more pitches for a direct contracting service in the last two months than I've had in 14 years, so I feel like a ton of companies are trying to jump on what they are as easy money. We are a part of an ACO, but are not subject to capitation. I think FFS is going away, but not until something like Medicare for All is passed. Not sure of the timeline there, but I'd expect 2023 to be the point where smaller primary cares actually start moving towards something like that. Our ACO has put December 2022 as their \"you must promise to at least consider a capitation model\" deadline, but we are not required to switch at that point. \n\nLastly, because we don't take Medicare, I don't think we are exactly Clover's target market right now and may not be the best perspective on their sales pitch. All the commercial insurances are already doing their own similar thing, so they'll be competing with existing products from BCBS/Cigna/UHC/etc. if they ever mean to expand past Medicare.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I respect the approach of KWEB and index investing and it makes sense, just feel like I have enough friends in China that I have confidence in a few specific targets.",

However, those founders also hold BABA / HKG:9988, because the VIE has an exclusive contract to the profits of Alibaba. If you look up their 20-F SEC filing, you can see the exact number of shares owned by Jack Ma, Joseph Tsai, etc. \n\nThere is no such thing as \"Chinese Alibaba stock.\" It does not exist. It is only listed outside of China via the VIE structure. As such, the VIE is essentially Alibaba's main / only source of capital. Also, both the NYSE listing (BABA) and the HKEX listing (9988) are for the same Cayman Islands VIE. While the VIE does absolutely introduce a degree of uncertainty, Alibaba needs their foreign shareholders just as much as the foreign shareholders need Alibaba. It is in their best interests to keep the peace and keep shenanigans to a minimum.",

They\u2019re hoping to get bought by someone bigger.\n\nYahoo finance has, as of april 14th, FAMI having a 2% Short interest. The share offering accounts for the dip in price. So, theoretically, the short interest went from 2% to 130% and it didn\u2019t affect the price. \n\nNot to mention this wasn\u2019t a company the was overvalued or failing to begin with, which is usually what draws short attention. They\u2019re just a tiny mushroom grower in China. Why would financial institutions target that?\n\nWhich brings me to the biggest factor for me, China. Every company in China is owned by China. They just allow business owners to think they own their company. Just ask Jack Ma. Or you could if he wasn\u2019t still missing after 3 months. IF he shows back up I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be much more pro-CCP. But I\u2019m sure when he\u2019s replaced , the new guy will certainly be. \n\nMy philosophy is this: if there are inconsistent signals and it\u2019s the CCP, stay the fuck away.",
