Something about them is no longer working. \n\nSecondly, MRK\u2019s press release for their phase 3 trial of [Islatravir](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) is set to begin soon after their presentation at the AIDS 2020 virtual divulging that the Phase 2b results proved that their drug has higher efficacy and safety from the analyses. \n\nThirdly, MRK has a proven track record for putting up great [earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-earnings-surprise-streak-could-161004767.html), and most analysts are bullish already about them for their earnings coming out 7/31. And will be even more so in the near future thanks to their EIDD-2801 exclusive rights from RidgeBack Therapeutics for an antiviral for covid until others produce a sustainable vaccine, and more so because they\u2019ll likely make up the shortage for HIV meds with current meds and their upcoming Islatravir. \n\nFuthermore, MRK just got [FDA approval](https://www.mrknewsroom.com/newsroom/news-releases/news-details/2020/FDA-Approves-Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-First-Line-Treatment-of-Patients-With-Unresectable-or-Metastatic-MSI-H-or-dMMR-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx) to use Keytruda for first-line colon cancer. Which will only drive their earnings. \n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t share the seeking A article, but it goes into further detail about why antivirals will be very important in the coming months since vaccines are still projected to be at least 6 months out, if not longer. If you want to see the SA article just google \u201cAntivirals Rather Than Vaccines for COVID-19\u201d\n\nAlso, the EIDD-2801 candidate they have rights to from RidgeBack is currently in quite a few trials, but one of the more pertinent one is in South Africa where they\u2019re needing 50 HIV positive people to see if it can help prevent covid in them, but also they\u2019re secretly hoping by sheer luck that the same drug can help manage HIV at the same time it prevents covid. \n\nSticking with my originals 7/31 $85-$90c, and 10/16 $90-$95, but I\u2019ll also add 1/21 $100-$105c since there are many analysts setting $100+ fair values for eoy.\n\nEdit: TL;DR\u2014 MRK $85+ calls cause they make the good drugs for bad things and it make printer go brrrrrrrr.",

        "body": "i worked for a tech company that made an absolute killing during the rebound from th 2008 crisis. Since then we've been directionless, milking what they started back then all the way until now when the well looks like it is in the process of running dry. in the past 3 years, we have had major reorgs every year. Yes, our innovation was major reorgs. My group being truly one of the few groups that could move the company into the next era of technology was getting a $16m yearly budget. We were spending $50m on CES peddling the exact same thing with different fixings year after year.\n\n\nAnd on more than one occassion, where i needed a tool or some random other thing, and had to play politics with a different group. Or needed help on something that we had expertise elsewhere in but wound up having to fight it on my own, i was reminded how in large companies, every business unit sees itself as their own profit/loss center and essentially wound up alienating the rest of the company because they either didn't want to take on the slightest inconvenience or they just didn't give a sh$t. we had 3 different groups coming up with the same bloody invention to show you the lack of communication!\n\nIIRC, google is still extremely strongly driven by  their search engine and then ad revenue. In the end, companies spend years upon years entrenching themselves to be the next greatest thing in the special sphere such that branching out is hard.\n\nRant aside, of the 3, I find Amazon to be plain amazing. Google is taking losses on things like Waymo because they are looking at the future. Many companies can't and won't \"roll the dice\" without some short term payout, which is why M&amp;A is so prevalent in the tech space. Let the small company take the risk figure it out and then we'll just buy them. No CEO, business unit leader etc wants to have the negative  balance due to \"taking a  chance\" or pushing the innovation boundaries on something that might be not 100% a slam dunk.\n\nGM had the EV1 before tesla even dreamed of being formed. Heck i don't think Elon was a paypal when they released it. They had a 160 mile range in 2003 (maybe not a cheap 160 miles, but 160 miles the same). It wasn't a slam dunk so they decided to kill the program and destroy all the cars.\n\nMicrosoft, Palm and Blackberry were the only smartphones around long before android or apple even considered smartphones. i was using a stylus to click my 2 pixel wide start button while the apple guys were using their fingers to navigate.\n\nYou couldn't blink without happening across a motorola phone in the mid-2000s. Samsung who?\n\nGE decided if they weren't top 3 in a particular segment, cut it up and sell it off.\n\nWere there mainframes that weren't IBM in the 90s?\n\nDell/IBM were #1 and #2 in the early PC days.\n\nthe list goes on and on of companies that were there at the start with a technology and just slept on it. in most of these you'd find complacent ceos protecting the bottom line at the expense of innovation as the start of the fall.\n\nAnyway, i don't remember why i went on that rant. if it makes no sense in this context, apologies.",

That business alone will be worth billions. \n\nVehicle to grid is similar but much more decentralized. People can plug in their vehicle and earn some extra cash simply to use their car as energy storage. Same with robotaxis. Tesla can skim off the top and still outcompete Uber/Lyft with no labor cost. \n\nYes a lot of these come from the same product but that's *exactly why* Tesla is worth so much.

        "body": "I have some money tucked away for the Snowflake and Palantir IPOs.  No idea what the tickers are yet or potential dates, but thanks to a bunch of people on Reddit I now have google alerts set up to help me track them.\n\nSPCE - I keep a few shares in a nonretirement account because I think they are in a really good position to make commercial space travel possible and hope to use it some day.  I keep some in an roth account for swing trading - just sold for a small profit and watching for the next drop to buy back in.\n\nOther than that, I have a list of EV related stocks I'll be researching this weekend.  They've been on my watchlist for a few weeks and I'm not sure what the sudden run up is.  I'm guessing at least some of this is a by product of TSLA going up, but I won't know till I've done some research.  Here's my EV watch list:\n\nNIO - Recent approval for 10billion Yuan line of credit.  I think I might have seen some actual car news on them recently.\n\nBLINK - Charging equipment.\n\nPLUG - Hydrogen &amp; fuel cells.  \" Its fuel cell system solution is designed to replace lead-acid batteries in electric material handling vehicles and industrial trucks for some distribution and manufacturing businesses.\"\n\nSHLL - Acquisition company that will get Hymillion into the market.  From what I saw on their website, Hymillion already has EV trucks on the road.  Missed it in the $10 range.  It's coming down, but I'm waiting to see if it comes down more.\n\nAPTV - I think they are parts &amp; safety for EVs.\n\nDRIV - EV ETF.  Might be the best play for me so I can get a slice without all the tracking &amp; research of individual companies.\n\nEKAR - EV ETF.  Gotta compare the ETFs.\n\nKARS - EV ETF.  Gotta compare the ETFs.\n\nKNDI - \" Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. engages in the development, manufacture, and trade of vehicles. Its products include electric cars, tricycles, and tractors. \"\n\nNVDA - Chips.  Recent contracts.  Clearly I have some reading to do since that's all I can say.\n\nNXPI - Semiconductors\n\nTEL - \" TEL is the world's largest maker of passive electronic components (75% of sales) led by a leading share (20-25%) in connectors (50% of sales). TEL's biggest served markets have longer cycles, such as auto (30% of sales) &amp; telecom equipment (19% of sales). TEL also produces components for telecom &amp; energy networks (14% of sales) that protect/connect cabling.\"\n\nNKLA - nothing to say, just keeping an eye on it.\n\nForbidden topics because $5 rule...blah, blah, blah...  I know it's to prevent pump &amp; dumps, but these are companies I am legit interested in for investing.\n\n\"Single\" - That single seater is hideous, but they have other designs that look good.  Gotta check and see what they're up to right now.  Starting watching this at about $1.60 / share several weeks ago when they release some new shares that were costing the purchases something like $2 / share.  Considered buying then for swing trade, but had just failed on some other trades and wasn't ready to take the risk.  Now it's close to $5 / share.\n\n\"Werk Hors\" - Actually about $15 now, but I'm pretty sure I saw it banned on this sub since it crossed the threshold by a mod that called it trash.  Could've been a different sub.  In case you don't know this one - \"engages in designing and build performance battery-electric vehicles and aircraft. It develops cloud-based, real-time telematics performance monitoring systems. The firm operates in two divisions, Automotive and Aviation.
