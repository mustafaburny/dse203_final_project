        "body": "I\u2019m going to reiterate my [MRK](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hkpyve/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of_july/fww5ouh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) comment with some additional research. \n\nFirst off, there\u2019s currently a huge [shortage ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) of HIV meds where basically what happened is part supply chain disrupt, but also the two drugs they were using proved to be ineffective for HIV patients because of covid. Something about them is no longer working. \n\nSecondly, MRK\u2019s press release for their phase 3 trial of [Islatravir](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) is set to begin soon after their presentation at the AIDS 2020 virtual divulging that the Phase 2b results proved that their drug has higher efficacy and safety from the analyses. \n\nThirdly, MRK has a proven track record for putting up great [earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-earnings-surprise-streak-could-161004767.html), and most analysts are bullish already about them for their earnings coming out 7/31. And will be even more so in the near future thanks to their EIDD-2801 exclusive rights from RidgeBack Therapeutics for an antiviral for covid until others produce a sustainable vaccine, and more so because they\u2019ll likely make up the shortage for HIV meds with current meds and their upcoming Islatravir. \n\nFuthermore, MRK just got [FDA approval](https://www.mrknewsroom.com/newsroom/news-releases/news-details/2020/FDA-Approves-Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-First-Line-Treatment-of-Patients-With-Unresectable-or-Metastatic-MSI-H-or-dMMR-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx) to use Keytruda for first-line colon cancer. Which will only drive their earnings. \n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t share the seeking A article, but it goes into further detail about why antivirals will be very important in the coming months since vaccines are still projected to be at least 6 months out, if not longer. If you want to see the SA article just google \u201cAntivirals Rather Than Vaccines for COVID-19\u201d\n\nAlso, the EIDD-2801 candidate they have rights to from RidgeBack is currently in quite a few trials, but one of the more pertinent one is in South Africa where they\u2019re needing 50 HIV positive people to see if it can help prevent covid in them, but also they\u2019re secretly hoping by sheer luck that the same drug can help manage HIV at the same time it prevents covid. \n\nSticking with my originals 7/31 $85-$90c, and 10/16 $90-$95, but I\u2019ll also add 1/21 $100-$105c since there are many analysts setting $100+ fair values for eoy.\n\nEdit: TL;DR\u2014 MRK $85+ calls cause they make the good drugs for bad things and it make printer go brrrrrrrr.",
