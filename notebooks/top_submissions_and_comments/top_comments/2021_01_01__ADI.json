        "body": "I think this is a great take. And don\u2019t just limit your search to major processor suppliers.\n\nWould also look into companies that supply all of the peripheral chips for auto and consumer electronics (think TXN, ADI). Your average BOM includes 1 main processor, and many, many peripheral chips.. Peripheral chips are typically cheaper, less competitive, built on more stable processing nodes, and have high margins.\n\nOne other company of interest related to semiconductors is TER. Wide moat tester supplier for just about every one of these chip makers. The need for comprehensive test solutions is growing (arguably) faster than the semiconductor market itself, especially as INTC and AAPL are reaching their 5-7nm process nodes. \n\n- An engineer in the semiconductor industry",

        "body": "Some of the issues have been raised below about the key areas of ADI in these posts. The whole analogue and Power converter market is becoming a lot cheaper with other vendors like MPS, Torex, On Semi, ST, and others who play in the Power management market at lower margins than ADI (\\~25-45% vs 70-90%). On the analogue front the acquisition of Maxim will make ADI is a bit unique as they'll command many of the precision analogue components that other vendors don't make, but this market has always been quite small as its focused on industrial customers, not consumer. For consumer applications the analogue circuitry is often a custom ASIC or a highly attuned (readily available) IC for a \"specific task\" and these ICs are made by many vendors. Also Processors have become much more powerful &amp; cheaper over the last 20 years so the maths is done in software not analogue. \n\nPersonally I would invest in component tech stocks that will be riding the EV Market as it is set to grow massively over the next 20 years by focusing on those that make the Power transistors/modules that power the EV vehicle. Terms like \"SIC transistors\" or \"GaN transistors\" as designs move away from IGBT transistors for more efficiency which are only made by a small number of vendors. Every electric car, van, bus, truck will use SICs (currently IGBT in many EV vehicles) for the Power Inverter, and many will use GaN (or SIC) transistors for the Battery chargers (&amp; dc roadside chargers). Also the use of GaN for the step down Power supplies in the vehicle to create the 12/24/48V Bus from the internal Battery which is typically 400-800Vdc. The top Semi companies that make SiC and/or GaN are Microchip, Infineon, ST Microelectronics, On Semi, &amp; Cree (Wolfspeed). Infineon and ST are the top 2.",
