Please also note that there were 400-450k Shares to borrow on IBKR, and only 45k (Last i checked) has been returned. That leaves 350-400k borrowed which is still the vast majority. \n\nMy guess, is they are actually doing Due Diligence of their own and have realized we've been bandying around the IBKR numbers, so their trying to mask their movement a little. With that said, at the end of the day only 45-50k has been been returned to IBKR leaving a very significant amount left over. They haven't really begun to cover.\n\nFinally, if you're going to sell your shares, and are cognizant of the gamma squeeze for the love of god sell deep ITM covered calls instead. Gets you out with guaranteed profit (and ekes you an extra percentage point or two), while simultaneously not hurting the upward momentum of the stock for Friday since the Market Makers will need to hedge before it ends above 9.",
