As I\u2019m starting off with a weak source of money i\u2019d prefer a safer strategy, for now. I managed to get hold of 0.02 ETH and a share of SDC.\n\nI have recently picked up an interest in investing and am thinking about starting in the coming days, on trading 212. Ive selected the FAANG companies, Microsoft, Tesla, Shopify, Salesforce, Nvidia, Adobe and Vanguard emerging markets etf. I\u2019m not sure about the percentages.\n\nis this a good pie and what percentages should i use?",

        "body": "There is a reason.  Once a company is no longer owned by the founders, it becomes what I call a \u201czombie\u201d public company.  Once the majority of shares are owned by funds (retirement, hedge, etc.) instead of owners and founders, the focus shifts to quarterly returns, innovation dies, growth rates slow, and the value of the company is \u201cmonetized\u201d back to the funds until it is worthless.   Salesforce just turned that corner.  Typical patterns include heavy advertising, annual or twice annual layoffs (Jack Welch style), cuts in R&amp;D funding, tight delivery schedules, service failures,  attempts to turn support into consulting (a poorly built product now needs you to pay for support), higher product complexity (it becomes a complicated mess due to rushing the delivery schedule, and saying yes to every possible customer, who basically turn your solution into garbage).  Fully monetized companies then show up in bankruptcy after years of neglect and lack of innovation.  Think Sears and JCPenney.   Oracle is on it\u2019s way, as well as most \u201cold tech\u201d.

Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money.

But if you're only considering one or the other then it is going to come down to which you believe has a better business model and is more likely to continue to increase their dividend payout.",

        "body": "MSFT wasn't  a computer company. It was a software company. IBM was a computer company.\n\nThe brilliance of MSFT was in - and this seems weird today - realizing that a company could make money just selling software. A ton of money. More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",
