Walmart recently revealed their new service \u201cWalmart plus\u201d which is like Amazon prime except with same day delivery instead of 2 day delivery. This is something east for Walmart to implement since they have stores around the nation that can deliver products to customers from the store to your home in the same day. It is impossible for companies like Amazon to do this because of their lack of physical stores.\n\n2. Since Walmart has a strong online store and will sell tons and tons of stuff online and in store around the Christmas season, it is a very low risk stock. The recent PS5 and Xbox Series having a lot of stock on Walmarts web store lately has gained them a lot of sales and led to a lot of new exposure to their online store driving up Salesforce other products. \n\n3. For all you speculative trader out there: A huge investing firm BlackRock recently bought $8,000,000 in Walmart Call Options. That is a massive amount of options especially for a firm that usually buys stocks not options. If you don\u2019t trust advice let $8mil speak for me.\n\n4.Walmart is a huge part of the retail store market which goes up with vaccine news. This means that if they\u2019re is new news about a vaccine Walmart will go up. \n\n5. Walmart is currently in a good position to buy, it is up a small amount over the past month, week, and day it never goes red for very long. The stock is resistant to the volatility of the rest of the market and people are starting to notice that and put their money in\n\n6. Below is a video that goes in depth into why we need to buy Walmart\n\n[Video Outlining Walmart Buy](https://youtu.be/SMnO-rw-0UM)",

        "body": "There\u2019s tons of competition this is an emerging space I would say where what this category of software is not fully defined and tons of people are converging in the same space from different directions.\n\nThe Problem?  In large businesses you have tons of data from different systems and lots of inefficiencies.  It is very hard to have a single source of truth and front line workers attempt to game most systems that measure them.\n\nThe Solution: I like the title Execution Management Systems (coined by Celonis), but no one yet agrees.   This emerging class of software attempts to combine data, analyze it, and allow you to automate and take action from one central system.  It also allows you to set different business priorities and based on those may recommend different actions.\n\nThe competitors:\n\nAnalytics tools:  You have Tableau, Domo.  Primarily built on reporting they need to extend into automation, and process mining and AI recommendation engines.  I\u2019d say they have a ways to go expect Tableau with Salesforce could have many of the pieces.\n\nData Warehouse Tools: Palantir is somewhere between this and analytics tool with an AI component already well developed.  These tools work to store and analyze data and also usually have some automation with the systems they interact with.  Snowflake is the big name here.\n\nERP/System of Records: These systems mostly approach the problem by trying to do all analytics , AI, automation, within their platform.  You\u2019ve got Salesforce, Workday, SAP and Oracle here.\n\nSystems of engagement: a set of tools that usually are a front end for other systems of record.  Notably ServiceNow trying to be a universal front end to business systems.\n\nProcess Miners:  Celonis is the big name and growing fast.  They approach the problem with unique tech that analyzes how processes flow through these systems.  I think process mining is a critical piece you need to execute the insights and automation and a lot of the players above don\u2019t have too much of that piece.  \n\nRPA:  UIPath and Automation Anywhere.  They started out just automating on the front end.  Now they\u2019re trying to add other components to be a universal execution engine.  \n\nMiddleware: Boomi but notably Salesforce Mulesoft.  They need to add analytics, AI and process mining to get to where this space is going.\n\nEveryone knows this Execution System/Universal Truth is where the future is at.  No one has every piece of that figured out.  But everyone sees while there will always be a place for a system of record (like an ERP/HCM and CRM tools) this new kind of software will be what guides those tools (the one tool to rule them all so to speak).  \n\nDespite what Palantir claims they aren\u2019t the universal leader but they are like a top 3 choice.  This space is crazy fragmented and no one even knows what to call it yet.",

Who gives a fuck about fair valuation and EPS.\n\nTSLA doesn't, NIO doesn't. XPEV doesn't. PLTR doesn't. DOCU doesn't. CRM doesn't. You know what, most of NYSE, NASDAQ &amp; TMX don't give two shits about EPS.\n\nI've had Quantum$cape when it was traded under the SPAC which I can't name cause its banned. I'm up 100% on both my stonks and my warrants.\n\nAnd if you were holder in the SPAC you would have got a fat 300 page investors relations booklet that showed the distribution of shares. Which explicitly shows that VW of America owns a fat wad of shares that they cannot sell for first 180 days. Same with many big boy investors.\n\nAnd that the warrants are restricted until 2025. And that only a small % of shares are available for public float. and a bunch of other important shit.\n\nBut also youre retarded for thinking that this should be considered a negative\n\nQuantom$cape hasn't even proved they can meet the manufacturing demands of their committed sales 4 years from now.\n\nIf Quantom$cape runs into problems with meeting demand, I'm going to be filthy rich. Because IF it has issues getting batteries out of their factories, that means their fucking tech works and it is flying off the shelf.

EG they have CRM, Marketing software, sales software and CMS. And they have managed to build out this broad product offering while keeping the product quality fairly high. This matters because as they go upmarket more, they are going to meet customers who want more consolidation in the tools they use and not to have different providers for everything. They've also managed to keep revenue growth fairly high for a number of years which is a good sign.\n\nThe bear case is exactly what you alluded to, they are in a very competitive space and since the product is so broad they have a lot of competitors. EG Zendesk and Salesforce are quite different but both compete with Hubspot.\n\nSo, it's a tricky one but I definitely don't have as strong a conviction about them as others on the list.",

I took a bath after the tech crash and the Bush years from 2001-2009 were terrible with slow growth.  I do somethings myself now and I also use a money manager through the bank.  He has made terrible choices because he believes in resources and financials, which lost me a lot.  I only use him because I get access to some private equity funds which perform fairly well and I should have made him dump all the oil.  My own little group I invest in, I did good the first 5 years but the buy and hold I was doing petered out and I should have shifted assets sooner like you said.  But I sold a bunch of stuff in February as I felt a drop coming and got in voo, salesforce, tesla at some nice low levels, where my bank guy did shit.

        "body": "It\u2019s pretty true. I have a BS in Economics and an MA in applied economics and an MQM (Masters in Quantitative Management) as well. And the first question people ask when they find out what I did in college is about the economy and stocks. And it\u2019s a dumb question and they don\u2019t even realize it. Like I spent years learning about scarcity and a bunch of basically applied calculus and statistics. \n\nUnless I work directly for a brokerage I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to make an informed decision any one way or the other, and even then it would only be a best estimate and one with enough of a likely chance to not be correct that it would be pretty irresponsible to give an opinion on it. \n\nI can fully do the math behind it sure, but the stock market has proven time and time again that it\u2019s irrational and not really predictable with any algorithm. There is a reason that economic theory even says throwing a dart at a chart of stocks and picking where it lands is just as likely to be accurate than if you picked it based on extensive amounts of DD and research. \n\nBut I just point people towards index\u2019s, tell them if they aren\u2019t retiring in the next 5 years don\u2019t be afraid or worried that the stock market drops every now and then etc etc. \n\ntl;dr Economists don\u2019t study the economy they study scarcity. I\u2019d be extremely skeptical of any economist claiming to know what the market will do or that they have figured out the stock market. We exist to do small scale data analysis, or to advise large scale economic moves aka monetary/fiscal policy, we aren\u2019t adept at guessing small movements within certain markets. And if we\u2019re in a spot where we can then we are also in a spot where the sec would have something to say if we profited off it.",
