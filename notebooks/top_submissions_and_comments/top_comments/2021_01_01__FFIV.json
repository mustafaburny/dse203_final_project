Some companies that have their hand in just about everything would include Palo Alto, Fortinet, Cisco, and Check Point. Others would include Carbon Black, Forcepoint, Proof Point, Qualys, Splunk, Imperva, and F5. I honestly am inclined to just dump money into Microsoft and stop trying to pick the next cybersecurity winners. Microsoft has a significant advantage over a lot of companies because a lot of people just next/next their way through Windows first setup so they can easily collect data to improve their endpoint products (Defender ATP is competent enough), Azure is an attractive alternative to AWS, and they're even dipping into things like the SIEM market with Azure Sentinel. I don't think Microsoft's offerings are necessarily better than anyone else's, but they just seem like they're always a few good decisions away from taking other people's lunch money. For whatever it's worth, I've been in the cybersecurity industry for a while and I don't have any stock in any of the companies previously mentioned",

For simplicity sake let's say that all the remaining stocks of a company are in my hands, I bought it for 90$, it crashed to 30$, and they usually offer a higher price, ets say 50$ but that's still a loss for me, can I legally refuse? I mean I don't see why not, since I bought part of the company, there is no contract saying im obliged to sell it back to them, so can they 'force' me to sell it, or what is the law regarding this?",
