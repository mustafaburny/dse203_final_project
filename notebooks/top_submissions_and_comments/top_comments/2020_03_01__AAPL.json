The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of.

        "body": " \n\nDebt Threat: Corporate debt is at a record level of $10 Trillion. AAPL has a Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.21, and that was reported before the market took a crap. Over half of \"investment quality\" bonds are now rated BBB, the the lowest investment grade rating available. Corporate cash holdings have dropped to $1.69 Trillion. The US Debt-to-GDP Ratio is 107% .\n\nConsumer Debt is at a record high of $13.95 trillion. Meanwhile, the Prime Age (working age) Employment Ratio has not returned to pre-recession levels. If you look at personal savings rate by income quintile, only the top 20% are saving more than 4%. the bottom 60% aren't saving anything at all. this is largely because the majority of income growth has been in the top 20%. Even the average including the top 20% is only 8%, still historically low.\n\nThe equity market cap-to-GDP ratio is at an all-time high, above 200%. The Price-to-Earnings-Growth Ratio (PEG) is at it's highest ever.\n\nIn other words, spending and prices have become decouples from actual productivity and earnings. With high debt, low savings, and low credit ratings, both consumers and corporations face default if they have a minor hiccup in revenue.\n\nNote: These numbers rely on the best available data, based on large numbers of tests, available from the WHO and academic sources. they could change as more information comes in from other countries.\n\nDisease threat: In China, the In China, the overall CFR for COVID-19 was 17.3% for cases before they improved standards of care (access to sophisticated medical equipment and trained personal); it then dropped to 0.7%. The much heard 2.3% Case Fatality Rate is an average between these two. This explains the variance in CFR, and why countries such as South Korea, which had preparation and foreknowledge, have a lower CFR.\n\nThe disease has a 1 to 14 day incubation rate. This explains the variance in apparent asymptomatic rates (diseases in incubation appear asymptomatic). Hundred of thousands of tests have been conducted in South Korea; the WHO reported that China produced millions of tests. Some cases, such as the first Italy, have shown several weeks of no symptoms before becoming severely ill. This makes it difficult to control the spread.\n\nThe data from both China &amp; South Korea seem to support that about 80.9% of cases are mild, 13.8% of cases become severe, and 4.7% become critical. The remaining 0.6% may be asymptomatic. The sum of severe &amp; critical cases is 18.5\u202c%, close to the 17.3% early CFR in China, suggesting that those people would die without significant supportive care. This care includes: oxygen production and breathing apparatus to support respiratory failure, IVs &amp; vasopressor medication to support septic shock, and dialysis to support kidney failure. The median time to recover is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease.\n\nThis suggests that about 20% of those infected will need about 4.5 weeks of intensive care. The hospitalization rate for the flu is only 1%.\n\nThe overall CFR rate (including all ages and comorbidity statuses) for seasonal flu is about 0.1%. The CFR for COVID-19 ranges from 0.2% for peole in their 20s &amp; 30s, 0.4% for people in their 40s, 1.3% for people in their 50s, 3.6% for people in their 60s, 8.0% for people in their 70s, to 14.8% for people over 80.\n\nCFRs vary by comorbidity. For those with no comorbidity (otherwise in good health), the CFR is 0.9%. Remember that the flu is only 0.1% overall, which lumps in those with comorbidities. Those with diabetes have a CFR of 7.3%, those with hypertension have a CFR of 6.0%, those cardiovascular disease have a CFR of 10.5%.\n\nSo, the fatality of the disease ranges from twice as deadly as the overall rate for flu for the healthiest people, to 148 times as deadly as the overall rate for those over 70. It's significantly more likely to result in hospitalization, and that hospitalization will be longer.\n\nThe disease appears to have an R0 of about 2.5 without \"intense quarantine and social distancing measures\". most epidemiologists, and other relevant experts, don't think the world could maintain for the 6 months to a year necessary to develop a vaccine. Current estimates by epidemiologists range from 20% to 70% of adults being infected within a year, depending on control measures. Washington State Department of Health officials stated that they expect to see more cases of COVID-19 in the coming months than cases of flu.\n\nQuarantine and Control Measures Impact: If we want to prevent that millions of people being infected thing from happening, we could do this. The effect on productivity and demand would be tremendous. Additionally, transaction costs go way up; it's difficult to conduct business when you're in different quarantine zones. Their are also multiple legal and political hurdles.\n\nDisease Impact: 20% hospitalization of 20% infected of 209.1 Million adults in the US is 8.4 Million needing about 4 weeks of intensive care. 20% hospitalization of 70% infected of 209.1 Million adults in the US is about 29.3 million people requiring about 4 weeks of intensive care.\n\nA 1% fatality rate of 20% infected adults is 289,940 dead in the US. A 2% fatality rate of 70% infected adults is 2,927,400\u202c dead in the US.\n\nNormal annual fatalities in the US are 2.8 Million. These death amount to between a 10.4% increase and 104.6% increase in deaths for the year.\n\nIf we choose to control it, the control measures will directly impact production and reduce demand in an immediate fashion.\n\nIf we allow the disease to run rampant, and it actually does, the deaths and hospitalizations will pose significant disruptions; massive resource will be allocated to medical requirements, people will take time off work to care for their family members or stay in hospital, deaths will result in a significant increase in empty housing, municipal property taxes will decline (increasing the likelihood of default on municipal bonds), assets such as stocks &amp; bonds will pour into the market either because the owner is dead or they need to pay for medical expenses.\n\nWith high debt and low savings, consumers and corporations are ill prepared to endure such an impact to production and revenue. Since we are close to full employment, have such high valuations compared to production, and have a high level of government debt already, we are primed for inflation if the government decides to print money to save these entities. In a worst case scenario, the government's credit laying could lower, and t-bonds would be dumped on the market.\n\nHowever, these are all just possibilities. the chance of the worst case scenarios happening is still low; it could be contained in relatively small areas. The full potential threat may not become apparent to the non-epidemiologist for six months or so, when we have significantly more cases and their impact is directly visible. Actions such as the additional rate cuts could raise prices in the meantime.\n\nPossible high risk long play: INGN is down to $ 47.67 from $67.59 about 8 weeks ago. They produce lightweight portable oxygen concentrators. They could have an increase in demand of orders of magnitude, in a market with a high barrier of entry (FDA regs, IP, expertise). However, they could face supply chain problems.",

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of.

The cash flow growth is 11% on average and the dividend yield is almost 5% right now.  Its trading at historically low RSI levels on the monthly (this is where it was before it rocketed 300% the last time around).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith that said, this is my set up.

I am sure that we will see a considerable uptick in cases within the next two weeks across North America. If the Fed lowers interest rates this week, it will be a critical error to do so simply to quell a bearish market.\n\nI think that while investors cry at the Fed and markets rise in the early hours of the 2nd, buy month-long puts in manufacturing and tourism sectors.

Aside from the usual bug schedule (which cisco is no better/worse than anyone else) their hardware is rocksolid, it really comes down to the software for the API on the devices, or the software of tools to manage it.\n\nCisco is only a leader in the market when you look at the entire breadth of their portfolio because: No one else is spread as thin.

Furthermore, if you expect the price to go down further you would be good to buy a put contract on Cisco. \n\nIf you want to hang on to your shares of Cisco because you expect them to go up, but want \"insurance\" against that, you could also buy a put contract in case the price goes down.",

Cisco has slowly gone up.\n\n\nLets say your required holding period is 1 year. That means if you hold the stock for 1 year and the stock doesn\u2019t budge in price. If you sell you gain the 15% in the discount plus 4% from the dividend you gained as well. Historically, the stock has gone up as well, which also increase your gains.\n\nSo, continue to buy your company stock.\n\n\nNow there is some people I bet at your work, just like mine, that have bought their company stock for 20+ years and never sold. Doing this increasing your exposure to that one company. If the company tanks, your stock will be worth a lot less and you could be out of a job.\n\n\nHowever, if you go with selling right after your lock out period it\u2019s a great way to use that discount to generate more money for you. \n\n\nRelax investing is a marathon not a sprint.",
