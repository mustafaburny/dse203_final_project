They were originally organized as an Israeli corporation in March 2014. From the SEC.gov website, \u201cwe have developed and are in the process of commercializing our products of an advanced robotics system that enables remote, real-time, pinpoint accurate firing of small arms and light weapons. Our commercialization efforts are focused inside and outside the United States, however we are focused primarily on the United States market. Our system was designed with input from veterans of Israel\u2019s elite special mission units. Our system was designed with input from veterans of Israel\u2019s elite special mission units. We expect to derive most of our short-term future revenues directly or indirectly from government agencies, mainly the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD). In addition, we intend to offer our products to other governmental agencies around the world, including the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and equivalent authorities of various countries pursuant to contracts awarded to us under defense and homeland security-related programs.\u201d [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682110/000121390017007249/f1a2017a1\\_dukeroboticsinc.htm#a\\_002](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682110/000121390017007249/f1a2017a1_dukeroboticsinc.htm#a_002)\n\nOn July 1, 2020, UAS Drone Corp. (OTC: USDR) announced the completion of its acquisition of Duke Robotics, Inc., the purveyor of an innovative military UAS drone with advanced stabilization technology, pursuant to which Duke Robotics became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAS Drone Corp. At the time of the acquisition, Duke Robotics was worth far more than USDR. How did they have the money to acquire Duke Robotics? I noticed that over the past 3 weeks that this stock has been pretty stable. I believe there to be a partnership with USDR and that is why it\u2019s stayed \u201cunder the radar\u201d as not to alarm that their products (war related) were being purchased. They were also awarded two awards by the Department of Defense, so there was some cooperation there, and\u2026.\n\nDanny Rothschild (Major General, Res.) served on the advisory board at Duke Robotics and in the past has served as Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, and Chief of Intelligence Research and Analysis. He is chairman of the board of trustees of the Afeka Tel Aviv Academic College of Engineering, chairman of the Israeli Board of the America-Israel Friendship League, and member of the board of governors of the Hebrew University Jerusalem.

They were originally organized as an Israeli corporation in March 2014. From the SEC.gov website, \u201cwe have developed and are in the process of commercializing our products of an advanced robotics system that enables remote, real-time, pinpoint accurate firing of small arms and light weapons. Our commercialization efforts are focused inside and outside the United States, however we are focused primarily on the United States market. Our system was designed with input from veterans of Israel\u2019s elite special mission units. Our system was designed with input from veterans of Israel\u2019s elite special mission units. We expect to derive most of our short-term future revenues directly or indirectly from government agencies, mainly the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD).

At the time of the acquisition, Duke Robotics was worth far more than USDR. How did they have the money to acquire Duke Robotics?

Your level of self righteousness is so high. I changed subject? Should I just ignore my plans for my money just to prove that you're right or something? I had 175k equity in a home worth 400k. I have 50k saved up from the refinance for ANOTHER down payment on another 300k home RIGHT NOW. FUCK NO am I putting 50k in stocks right now you piece of shit. You just tried to tell me to put it all in stocks as thats what BUFFET would do. Really man. HAHA, let me guess you have 5k and its all in stocks. Yeah thats about right.

        "body": "On July 1, 2020, UAS Drone Corp. (OTC: USDR) announced the completion of its acquisition of Duke Robotics, Inc., the purveyor of an innovative military UAS drone with advanced stabilization technology, pursuant to which Duke Robotics became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAS Drone Corp. At the time of the acquisition, Duke Robotics was worth far more than USDR. How did they have the money to acquire Duke Robotics? I noticed that over the past 3 weeks that this stock has been pretty stable. I believe there to be a partnership with USDR and that is why it\u2019s stayed \u201cunder the radar\u201d as not to alarm that their products (war related) were being purchased. They were also awarded two awards by the Department of Defense, so there was some cooperation there, and\u2026.\n\nDanny Rothschild (Major General, Res.) served on the advisory board at Duke Robotics and in the past has served as Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, and Chief of Intelligence Research and Analysis. He is chairman of the board of trustees of the Afeka Tel Aviv Academic College of Engineering, chairman of the Israeli Board of the America-Israel Friendship League, and member of the board of governors of the Hebrew University Jerusalem.
