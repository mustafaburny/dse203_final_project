        "body": "On July 1, 2020, UAS Drone Corp. (OTC: USDR) announced the completion of its acquisition of Duke Robotics, Inc., the purveyor of an innovative military UAS drone with advanced stabilization technology, pursuant to which Duke Robotics became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAS Drone Corp. At the time of the acquisition, Duke Robotics was worth far more than USDR. How did they have the money to acquire Duke Robotics? I noticed that over the past 3 weeks that this stock has been pretty stable. I believe there to be a partnership with USDR and that is why it\u2019s stayed \u201cunder the radar\u201d as not to alarm that their products (war related) were being purchased. They were also awarded two awards by the Department of Defense, so there was some cooperation there, and\u2026.\n\nDanny Rothschild (Major General, Res.) served on the advisory board at Duke Robotics and in the past has served as Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, and Chief of Intelligence Research and Analysis. He is chairman of the board of trustees of the Afeka Tel Aviv Academic College of Engineering, chairman of the Israeli Board of the America-Israel Friendship League, and member of the board of governors of the Hebrew University Jerusalem.

Their recent demo for autonomous through the streets of Tel Aviv dealing with pedestrians, construction sites, turning etc is very impressive. \n\nMost recently I heard that Tesla seems to have trouble with things like bus ads and stop signs sitting in truck beds, and I wouldn't even try autopilot on the PCH or anything windy, just watched a video from yesterday where it wasn't able to stay within the lines for most of it.
