        "body": "I have been involved in this alternative asset class for a few years now and I would highly recommend staying away from Wealthsimple because it is expensive and you will not own any crypto-assets with them as I will detail below. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin and Ethereum.",

Active management (picking the winning stock and/ or timing the market) is usually a losers game so avoid it with majority of your hard earned money. 5-10% play money is fine, but not more.\n5. Fees, taxes, and inflation cut into long term returns so be cognizant of it.\n6. Stay the course once you have developed your plan.

The company\u2019s core product, QuantumCloud, creates one-time encryption keys locally that cannot be broken or stolen.\nAlthough quantum computers can reverse-engineer any calculations, Arqit says it uses physics to create random numbers used as encryption keys. Since there is no math involved, quantum computers can\u2019t attack them. This solution, Arqit says, is currently 1,400 times faster than post-quantum algorithms.\n\u201cQuantum-based encryption is now a reality and offers encryption which, backed by the laws of physics, is demonstrably unbreakable,\u201d analysts at Equity Development wrote in a research note on Arqit in July.\nThe company has already signed more than $130 million worth of contracts, including with the UK Government, the European Space Agency,\u00a0BT Group\u00a0(BT.UK) and\u00a0Sumitomo Corporation\u00a0(SSUMY), and has a pipeline of $975 million worth of deals. It has also signed a collaboration deal with\u00a0Northrop Grumman\u00a0and plans to launch its first quantum encryption satellites in 2023 via Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Orbit.\n\nBlockchain technologies could add another area of growth for Arqit as advances in quantum computing could place the encryption that underpins bitcoin at risk. \n\n\u201cThe customer base is growing rapidly because Arqit is unique in solving the most existential threat to our data, and we see a lot of upside in defence, telecoms, robotics and fintech,\u201d Williams says.\u201d",

People didn\u2019t eat out or travel like they used to. Companies were going under and we all know a few people that went to work one day only to find the doors locked and be told the company was no more. That made everyone worry about losing their job, or having the company they worked for go under.\n\nIn some ways it was positive as people seemed less phony, and people weren\u2019t trying to show off or look better than others.

I m in a wait and see approach with them.    \nThe keys to Macy's being a winner for me are:  \n1) Negotiating down rents.  \n2) Increase their product assortment and maintain slightly better on hand inventories to avoid customers from walking.  \n3) Everyday at market pricing (atleast online) and then have actual sales.   Their sales gimmick worked years ago but not in todays internet ago.  \n4) Clean up the appearance of their stores and make them much easier to shop.  Current layouts are horrible.  \n5) Vendor paid shopping spaces need to be enhanced and grown.  This is what many others (Dicks and Best Buy) have done and it basically gets the manufacturers to prepay the overhead (rent and utilities) and despite slightly decreased margins, you know it is all profit.  Plus it makes the vendors vested in the operations.     \n\n\nMy immediate concern is their assortment has gone much lower end and it appears they are having greater difficulty maintaining inventory levels compared to competitors.  This is not because of sales, but because they are lower on the manufacturers priority list, especially in those items where they are merely the conduit for online sales.",

The majority has to verify every single block is valid for a new block to be added.  It's backed by an ever increasing difficulty in a growing network.\n\nA 51% Attack is unlikely to occur within a healthy large scale blockchain with a high hash rate.  Now, there was a one month period seven years ago where 51% of the Bitcoin hash rate was controlled by one mining group, but think how much is grown in 7 years.  Plus, there was no attack, as the mining group was vested in supporting the blockchain.  They self limited and the community today has a loose agreement to limit.\n\nEstimates today put the cost of a 51% attack by a malicious actor around $5.6 billion for the hardware alone.  That would also depend on the availability of said equipment.  There's another way to do it with synthetic hash rates and mining pools, but the general consensus is this method is highly unstable and would last mere minutes.  Other smaller networks have been attacked, but, if I understand it correctly, this has typically resulted in more of a DoS style outcome rather than a corruption of the chain itself.  I'm sure some smaller blockchains have been successfully and fatally disrupted.  That all being said, yes, a 51% Attack on any high profile token would be devastating to crypto as a whole.\n\nAnalogs to being locked out of a wallet or defrauded by some means can/do happen with fiat currencies everyday.  I mean there's just so many Nigerian princes out there...\n\nThe good news personally is if you take my initial investment dollars (which I've already recouped) I'm up about 1700%.

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

There has been an incredible amount of speculation that they may be implementing a method of making digital games Non-Fungible in order to retain value of the product and increase revenue stream for the vendor and the developer.\n\nIf existing platforms (Steam, Epic, XBox, PlayStation) and existing publishers wanted this to happen, it already would have happened. \nAllowing resale of digital games isn't technically difficult, it just isn't in the interest of anyone involved in the process. Steam already have trading of digital assets, if they wanted to extend that to trading steam keys for games, and publishers signed on, they could do it themselves immediately.\n\nBut why would the publishers want that? They have eliminated the second-hand market, which is making them more money. They have no interest in reversing that.\n\nAnd GME can't 'do' it on their own, they don't have any rights to the games, the publishers do. \n\nThey are offering a (vapourware) technical solution that isn't needed to a market that doesn't want it.\n\nIf a brand new company appeared, without the GME name or history, suggesting they were going to make money with their NFT digital game resales, how much do you think they would be worth?\n\nTheir valuation is based entirely on crossing the meme streams of short squeeze and blockchain.",

        "body": "Gas was super expensive. Over $5-$7 a gallon (Cali) so a lot of people wanted electric cars and that industry took off from pipe dream. Oil industry was booming. Commodities in general did well. Gold got to 2k an ounce. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot now because we have more or less stayed in touch with that but it was a big jump. (Learn: once things go up, they kind of don\u2019t come back down in any real sense. Maybe by 30%. But not all the way back down.) People were going into abandoned homes and taking all the copper plumbing and wires to resell. They even started taking the huge aluminum poles holding up highway lights. (They\u2019re doing the same thing now with catalytic converters. Should tell you something). They even stole a metal sculpture we had in a park up the street. \n\nSuicides for 50 year olds skyrocketed. Age discrimination is real. Super real during a recession. \n\nFacebook got super popular then. You\u2019d see people posting about offers of \u201cgleaning\u201d fields and pictures of thousands going out. Don\u2019t know if it was true or not. Occupy Wall Street took off because of FB. It was way smaller than blm though. The social media companies got better at manipulating people since then. There was also a \u201cmove your money\u201d movement-pull it from big banks to credit unions. It wasn\u2019t successful. Banking is sticky apparently. Even if you have a shitty bank. Lots of \u201cfriends\u201d on FB gaming the system back then too thought they were being smart (like they are with rent moratoriums now) playing cash for keys, etc. thinking they would let their house go back when they didn\u2019t need to and they\u2019d come out ahead. The only people that come out ahead in these scenarios are the people on the winning side of asset distribution. \n\nForeclosures yes\u2026but oddly after a pretty short while you couldn\u2019t buy them. Obama, the banks and hedge funds made a deal for them to be bought en masse. Banks just wouldn\u2019t talk about short offers anymore, so not a lot of people benefited from these affordable assets except Blackstone (Blackrock? Can\u2019t keep those fuckers straight) People in new build areas suffered with builders going bankrupt and leaving developments mostly not completed. Even with a 800 credit score and 20% down it could be hard to buy. \n\nThe election gave people hope, but Obama didn\u2019t have the justice department prosecute a single fucking crooked soul except for the Wamu guys. Within a year Wall Street was making huge bonuses again. \n\nCredit lines were cut. Thought you had a 20k credit limit and we\u2019re paying your bills? Didn\u2019t matter. Banks suddenly cut your limit to your balance (just like Wells Fargo just did). Worsened your credit score, inhibiting your ability to leverage into a cheap home. \n\nThings recovered. Mostly people forget. Some smarter people have lived all these years since like you can\u2019t trust anyone still and be ready to cover your ass. The FIRE movement was born-with emphasis on FI part of it. Prepping got real and more mainstream. \n\nI can\u2019t remember any more anecdotes but there were a lot on WSB with GME when it began. People recounting what their parents went through, so it had a generational effect. I was young, but not as young as you I guess I remember these things. I also talked to my great grandma about the depression a lot when I was little. I was intrigued for whatever reason. She was young but had stories. Rye whiskey was drunk more than water after the WWI. (Michael Pollen?) The army had an excess of alcohol fuel after the war they pushed on the population. During the depression alcoholism skyrocketed.! Now it\u2019s fentanyl and dope. A high population is controllable with every generation. Same patterns get repeated over and over again.",

        "body": "&gt; but can you ELI5 how the adoption of said technology should push up the price of a coin like BTC?\n\nOne example might be the ION 'decentralized identity' system that Microsoft released the open-source code for recently. \n\n&gt;Decentralized identity networks for example - like single-login services that Google or Facebook provide, except you control the account keys, and can still use the service even if you get banned from Facebook or whatever.\n\n&gt;Or graduation credentials, or a digital driver's licenses you can get instantly verified as valid while on vacation in Europe from the US. That's just some of the non-money-moving examples of what's already being built on top of these networks.\n\nOr maybe instead of giving your dentist office your driver's license to photocopy (which they'll probably eventually improperly dispose of, if past history is any indication), you use something an app on your phone to authorize your dentist to view your driver's license on the blockchain (essentially). Since it's on the blockchain, you don't need to worry that say, your identity info is going to become inaccessible if Amazon legal decides Amazon hosting servers can't send data to your locale anymore (maybe a country you're visiting).\n\nWhen they want to look view the data, the key you gave them lets them view your license. When you stop being their customer, their key stops working, so you don't need to worry about your personal data being mishandled and lost.\n\nWhat happens with these networks is identity providers run ION nodes. Making updates on the ION network are essentially free, but in order to borrow the BTC network's security guarantees, ION needs to pay the BTC network in BTC for every letter they want to write to the ledger. Thousands of people can make changes super quickly and for essentially free on ION, and then at set times, the ION nodes will write a 'checkpoint' to the bitcoin network's public ledger. \n\nOnce that checkpoint is there, anyone on earth can check the public BTC blockchain and use math to verify that a particular identity info change from an ION node is valid and can be trusted. Anyone can pull up data from any ION node on earth, compare it against the checkpoints on the BTC network, and verify \"yup, this is all legit, no hackers inserted fake changes to try and fool us.\"\n\nThere's a *lot* of really interesting security stuff that becomes easy using the public-private keypair that comes 'free' to every crypto-account user.\n\nAnother example might be Microsoft's anti-piracy system, 'Argus' that runs on top of ETH network and is aimed at being used for incentivizing piracy reporting.",

        "body": "A lot of people are investing in crypto-ETFs without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual crypto. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. That is a pretty big risk even though they can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage wallets, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can easily confirm their legitimacy and I have been stacking free Satoshis for a few years now.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not completely insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your crypto\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

If you read the book Superforecasting - and you all should - Tetlock lays out the necessary elements of a prediction so that we can asses their accuracy. One of those keys is time because it gets around the exact discussion being had \"Burry has predicted 11 of the last 2 recessions.\"\n\nIf he put a time limit and a confidence level to these we could actually start to score them. Instead he just says \"X will occur,\" and recycles it until X does occur, so he's both right and wrong. I have to assume he is doing this intentionally and he is by no means unique but it makes evaluating his 'expertise' incredibly hard.",
