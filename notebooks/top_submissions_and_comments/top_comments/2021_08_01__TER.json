        "body": "This has to be posted again, because bears atill haven't learned:\n\nThis economic data looks grim, I think to myself. This is the right move. I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.\n\nI come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&amp;P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.\n\nI hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. \"What am I-\"\n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he asks.\n\n\"Huh?\" I respond, confused.\n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he demands, louder this time.\n\n\"I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-\" WHAM! One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.\n\n\"It's priced in,\" he says coolly. \"So why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nDizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&amp;P has climbed back to 2850. Impossible, I think to myself. \"Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!\" I manage to answer. WHAM! Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.\n\n\"Repeat after me: stocks only go up,\" Powell demands.\n\nI say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&amp;P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary guh escapes my mouth as it falls agape.\n\nPowell frowns and continues, \"I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nI feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, \"GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-\" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&amp;P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.\n\nThe first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" I say.",

        "body": "1. A long term analyses of global diversified equity indexes vs actively managed funds aiming to beat those indexes will also demonstrate the same point. The overwhelming majority of actively managed funds do not beat the index they are benchmarked against after fees. That includes global equities. \n\n2. Following on from point 1, the comparison is valid and depends really on which index the active fund is benchmarked against. Many, many active funds aim to out perform \u201cX\u201d index and the data shows they fail to do so, after fees, over the long term. To your point if an investor was considering an activity managed fund that tracked global stocks - Janus Henderson Global Equity Fund that comes with a 0.85% TER - the evidence suggests he or she would have great returns by investing in a global equities tracker with a TER of 0.15% and get the same exposure but 5x cheaper. It does not matter to the investor if the manager, on paper, actually achieves their goal if the investor is still worse off!\n\n3. Your point about volatility. It\u2019s a metric, for sure. But it\u2019s importance is down to the investor and their risk tolerance. If reducing volatility was an issue the traditional thing to do would be to reduce equity exposure and increase bond exposure. As a comparison of active funds vs index trackers, sure it may be important to some people but long term investors will only care about the performance and their gains.  \n\n3. RE rising tides. You are exactly right. Active funds are let off the hook in a long term bull market. Again why pay them extra fees when they\u2019re playing in easy mode. Again, how do you know who will steer the ship through troubled waters? You don\u2019t, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s a guess. The data supporting index trackers goes back to the turn of the century, evidenced by data collection and the miracle of modern computing.",

Please let the community know what you have decided and why, I would be interested to know. From where I am standing, both seem perfectly fine as a core equity investment for your portfolio.\n\nSWDA is high on my list as I know that I like MSCI's approach to index construction (frankly, I am just less familiar with SolActive so simply haven't done DD yet). Further, I believe that any passive investment in the stock market should be cap-weighted so that disqualifies TGGB (once again, I am looking at indices for benchmarking purposes, as I actually may like equal-weighted better to invest in).\n\nEqual weighted has its obvious merits, but note that such a weighting scheme works best when there is some mean reversion in share price. The last decade, betting on mean reversion has been a losing strategy as large firms (e.g., US tech) just became bigger and bigger. There are some fundamental reasons behind this (e.g., ineffective competition regulation, tax avoidance, bargaining power of large firms vs suppliers, consumers and the government) that are the driver of this, which may not subside soon.\n\nApart from the weighting scheme:\n\n\\- Both have same TER\n\n\\- SWDA allows securities lending, which may introduce unwanted risk to you. TGGB does not.\n\n\\- SWDA is massive and TGGB, with EUR 300m in assets, is rather mid-size. This may impact liquidity and the breadth and liquidity of any derivatives referencing the EFT. Also, if TGGB may not grow to the potential the manager wants it, they may discontinue the product. \n\n\\- Both don't seem to have a large replication error, but not that TGGB only has about 1 year of realized performance to prove that.\n\nGood luck choosing!",
