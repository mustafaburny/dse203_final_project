Talk to the people with mastery.\n\nNo, this is experience in managing the security of real world systems using real world constraints. In the real world, nobody let users manage their own crypto keys, because users will make mistake (or just be unlucky) all the time.\n\nIf the average user has 1/10K chance every day of mishandling its cryptographic key, and your system has 1M users, it means that on average, 100 users are going to mishandle their cryptographic key every day. For a typical bank issuing debit cards, this is business as usual, and something that is easy to manage every day, because they are an authority who can re-issue their own cards at will. In a cryptocurrency scheme that trust users with the handling of their own crypto keys, that's 100 users every day who will lose everything.\n\nCryptocurrency schemes are secure only under a very narrow and superficial view of what \"being secure\" means.",

        "body": "Many stocks are a fraud and pyramid schemes too, it depends. I got suckered into both the Y2K and the cannabis legalization hysterias and made some money at first but then lost about 40% before I got out.  One of my stocks went to zero after Apple cancelled its contract with them.   Re-watch THE WOLF OF WALL STREET and pretend it is 2019 and they are hawking cryptos instead of mostly worthless penny stocks.  My making mistakes earlier in my life, including being taken in by a few scam artists, I came to guard my rational thought and caution when it comes to investing.  It is also like the old tortoise vs hare analogy. Or only fools rush in.  -- My first stock trade was a winner and I made $5000 in one day. I was 28 years old and I thought \"boy am I smart this is easy\" so I kept playing and ended up losing $50,000 because I ignored all the warning signs and had blind faith.  Even blue chips can sometimes be a death trap.  Enron and GE were two I owned at one time. Thank God I sold them. Enron went to zero.  Then, in 2008 at the pits of the economic collapse, I had no money except $250,000 I had borrowed against my home. I saw the market down 70%. It was like the reverse of the crypto craze all the \"experts\" on CNBC were saying \"stocks are worthless, could all go to zero\". I thought \"that is a glaring buy signal\". So I took my whole $250000 and bought. What did I buy? I looked around at young people I knew and thought, what are the two things they will never surrender even if they are unemployed and so are their parents?  Apple and Whole Foods (cheaper than restaurants).  Well to make a long story short, I doubled my money on those two, paid off all debts, Amazon bought Whole Foods giving a %500 profit , but I kept buying Apple on every dip, especially when Steve Jobs died and the Street was writing off Apple, accumulating moreand more. Why? Because everywhere I went I saw that the iPhone was the #1 essential in peoples'  lives or aspirational brand.  I am now up 6 million on AAPl alone.  Then 18 months ago during the pits of the shutdown I went to the Caribbean to retire and realized the real estate market was dead because no one was traveling and there were no customers except for private islands.  So I started making lowball offers and got two cool condos at about 25% off.   The keys were timing. When everyone else is selling (unless it is for very good reasons) that is the time to buy,  but only buy something REAL with deep value behind it.  Also remember, avoiding losses is the same as making gains. So if in doubt go with capital preservation and income.  A safe undervalued dividend stock. Like four I can recommend right now: T, VZ, VIAC and SWKS. Those were the four best bargains I could find and even if they go down (which they have until very recently) you get paid to wait and every dog has its day. PLus I don't need the cash so I can afford to sock money away in a dividend paying dog which is temporarily out of all St favor.  But Apple, that is the perfect investment.  Because nobody makes more money than they do or products that people are so devoted to and dependent upon, and I see no real competition for Apple for at least a decade so I can sleep well at night.  But cryptos?  Wouldn't touch any of them a ten foot pole because just like those penny Y2K stocks, they are not real, with no book value, so they could go to zero.  Don't think it cannot happen to you just because other people are bowing at the crypto altar.  And if a severe sell-off comes, remember you want to be the first to cash out, not the last.",

Additionally, it seems like you\u2019re selling a cash-covered put and not a leveraged put. That\u2019s a VERY capital-intensive position. The airlines might not be margined with your broker. I know Fidelity isn\u2019t margining AAL, which I found out when they took $1,700 for a 17P. Very annoying. \n\nYou might consider buying a further OTM put to cap the capital requirement and give yourself some efficiency. \n\nYou can achieve the same results on an un-leveraged covered strangle with a lot less and less risk. For example, if you own 100 shares of DAL and you sell a 20 delta strangle, you are net long 100 deltas. However, if you\u2019re selling a CSP, you are synthetically long the second lot at your break even, so from a capital standpoint, it\u2019s actually more like 180 long deltas. Ignoring that, you can buy a ZEBRA, which will give you 100 long deltas for probably 1/4 the amount of capital as the cash-covered strangle. You could sell 2 ATM puts, or buy 2 ATM calls both of which will give you 100 deltas. If you wanted 180 long deltas, you could sell (3) 60 delta puts or buy (3) 60 delta calls.",
