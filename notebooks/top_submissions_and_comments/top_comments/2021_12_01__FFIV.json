Still say, if you have a speaker phone and would sit on the line to get to an IRS representative, it is worth your while. They may even give you advice on what to tell TDA in terms off how to structure/report it. They like these kinds of smart questions and also like folks who want to get their advice.

Most of the stuff about hedge funds have zero basis in reality. \n\nInvesting in the stock market isn't done through an app. It's a regulated financial transaction which is performed through a registered broker-dealer. That broker-dealer may offer an app to access their services. \n\nYou should choose your broker-dealer first based on their services and merits before ever deciding if you want to use their app. \n\nIf you already have a banking relationship - you can start there and see if your bank has a broker-dealer subsidiary. For example - Bank of America owns MerrillEdge. \n\nSince you have a 401k - is the 401k being administered by a broker-dealer like a Fidelity? That's another place to look to open your brokerage account.\n\nThe larger and more established retail broker-dealers are normally the ones to consider if you are new and unsure of the services that you need. For example - Fidelity, Vanguard, Merrill Edge, TD Admeritrade/Schwab, etc. \n\nLastly - make sure you understand the taxable benefits of considering IRA's and ROTH brokerage accounts first before opening a taxable brokerage account. See the Wiki on the top of this post for links to resources. Also - see the r/personalfinance wiki for things to consider before you invest other income.",

        "body": "Exactly, you just buy CFVI from your broker (Fidelity, Ameritrade  etc.), just like any other stock. A SPAC (CFVI) can only combine with a single entity (that's why it's called an initial business combination vs. combinations) - in this case, they are combining with Rumble, so that's what you're going to get once the conversion is final (i.e. your CFVI shares will disappear and get replaced with Rumble ones). Unless the deal falls through (it is very rare, but it can happen - the Perishing Square SPAC is a good example), you will end up with Rumble shares in 2022.\n\nA word of advice (which you are free to ignore) from someone who has been investing for 20+ years: do a little bit of research on how SPACs work, even if it's a 10 min video. You're about to put hard earned money into something you don't understand the risks of. A 'sure thing' can end up blowing up 37 different ways - if nothing else, at least you will have learned something useful. Hope this goes your way!",

They may even give you advice on what to tell TDA in terms off how to structure/report it. They like these kinds of smart questions and also like folks who want to get their advice.

I'm the kind of dummy who checks his funds every day (only started a Fidelity account last week, so I'm still just familiarizing myself with the whole process and learning about my options) and it can stress you out to no end watching everything fluctuate.

        "body": "Looking for some advice and willing to be very aggressive in about a 3-4 year time span. Thoughts? Details below:\n\n  \n1) **Current allocation:** 9k in Vanguard, 3k in work-sponsored/matched account with Fidelity (they match 3%), then a couple hundred in Marcus HSY, Coinbase (BTC and ethereum) and roundups/20 weekly to Acorns.\n\n  \n2) ***Willing to be really aggressive***, as I will only have about **three more earning years before entering med school** (hopefully !)\n\n  \n3) Looking to **buy a house/condo where I land for med school,** so really just being aggressive about maybe having $ down for that is my main goal. My range here is about 300-450 k total without interest consideration. Maybe pay down my MS1 year loan interest as a plus.\n\n  \nI understand the value of diversification, but feels like my non-Vanguard accounts are just earning interest on small amounts, when my vanguard account has accrued 40% since I opened it three years ago. Better to just pare down to my company sponsored/matching 401(k) with Fidelity and my personal vanguard (mostly ETFS)?  \n**TL;DR:** willing to be very very aggressive with my portfolio and fear I am spreading too thin with current allocation - advice?",
