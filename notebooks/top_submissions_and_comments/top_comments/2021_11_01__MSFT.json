        "body": "I was in Silicon Valley at the time and 90% of my clients were in the tech business.   To give you an example every Cisco client I had in late 99 and early 00 were so certain that their stock would hit $100/sh that year that they often would refuse our recommendation to sell some Cisco to diversify away from tech because they all had huge amounts of still restricted options coming due every quarter.  I had one client at the director level (between VP and Sr VP) that earned 50,000 fresh options every quarter.   He did instruct his advisor to immediately sell all CSCO after exercise and reinvest it all away from tech.  By mid 2001 CSCO was at $12.   I had another client that was CEO of one of the tech darlings and had taken over and been given 2 mm shares for doing so.   One Monday I had a meeting with him in his office and he said he had been in LA over the weekend and did a private sale for one millon of those shares at $115 million dollars.  During that meeting he got a call from a member of the BoD that was reaming him a new asshole for selling half his stock.  My client simply told him that he had been hired to bring up the stock price from single digits to its current $115 value and hung up.  Twelve months later the company declared bankruptcy.  So at least he got out with his part.   Remember Microsoft lost 67% and Amazon lost over 90% of its value, so it wasn't just companies with no profits that fell, but everyone.  By the way Cisco still has not regained its $77 price in spring of 2000 and yet still successfully is the backbone of the internet and employes thousands of people.\n\nToday we don't have just a tech bubble as we had in 99, we instead have an everything bubble.",

Google win (is priced more cheaply)\n- YoY Revenue growth: 41% vs 22%. Google win (has been growing consistently faster) \n- Operating Margin: 30.3% vs 42%. Google win (very similar companies, Google has more room to improve its margins, while MSFT is already at a very high level and in alignment with FB)\n- Moat: Google has search, Android and YouTube with very strong moats (i.e. 20 years horizon). Microsoft has already been losing market share on Windows. office suites, and gaming for a while. On Azure it's growing at a similar rate to Google Cloud for the past couple of years. Overall Google wins with a far stronger hold on its market\n- Innovative upside: Google has a few bets in its arsenal that could potentially become huge such as self-driving cars, drone delivery, and even the hardware business (e.g. the new Pixel lineup is finally considered competitive vs the iPhone, which could become a huge business as Apple has proven). Microsoft has been consistently failing to expand to new areas.\n- Regulatory risk: That's the only place where a Microsoft investment is better position vs Google, precisely because of Google's strong hold of its markets.\n\nI'm happy to hear counter arguments, but overall it's hard for me to find MSFT as a more attractive investment than Google on almost all fronts. This is a clear sign for me that MSFT is (relatively) overvalued for what it offers right now.",

It would be hard for me to pay attention at work and school since my mind would just be focused on trying to chase gains and praying that my portfolio wouldn't be red. Then, I eventually lost like $4k in total. It was initially hard to stomach the loss but I had to just accept it as a learning lesson. \n\nI also just wanted to say I fully agree with you on the LEAPS in safe companies. 80% of my portfolio is stocks and 20% LEAPS. LEAPS are great ways to control more of a stock with less money and I make sure to only buy LEAPS on great fundamental companies (NVDA and AMD) but am planning to buy some SPY GOOGL and MSFT LEAPS that you mentioned as well.\n\nI just want to say that I actually sleep better now and my quality of life is MUCH better. I realized I just couldn't handle the stress of 90%+ swings in my portfolio without being glued to it or worrying \"IS IT TIME TO SELL?\" LEAPS and shares remove all of that because they don't really have an \"expiration.\" Shares are unlimited and LEAPS are like 2-3 years out so there's no rush to feel like: THE STOCK HAS TO RALLY 20% in a day, all you have to do is choose companies you have high conviction in and let them naturally make their way up.",

Then we had the computer revolution with Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Intel, and about 100 other players that pulled us through the 80s when rates were hiked way up.

Invest.\n2. Diversify.\n\nOver the last 40 years, the investment in infrastructure and basic research has been whittled away by the Republican party.

Pick any of the top ten companies in the country or world and you are likely to dominate the average. We have known for 50+ years that Exxon has its hands in government pockets. Easy pick. We\u2019ve known for 30 years that Microsoft would rule the PC world. You could have waited 20 years \u201cjust to make sure\u201d before increasing and you would destroy the S&amp;P.

        "body": "We are talking multiple years here if not decades. Companies like Exxon. a.) They are in a dying industry and have been unsuccessful in pivoting away from fossil fuels to alternative sources of revenue. b.) They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",

        "body": "Good video, I've not seen them before but they've got a good tools there and seem very competent. \n\nI think for me, they're using data from too long ago to justify their opinions.  Using a 5-year average of price/earnings is ok, because it normalizes the value of the company to their earnings at the time, and shows where wall street is pricing the company over time.  Using 5-year averages on earnings, or revenue only is dumb unless you think the company is going to regress on it's revenue.  \n\nAt one point they're averaging FCF for the last 5 years and comparing that to current market cap.  That just simply doesn't work when FCF today is nearly double what it was 5 years ago, and it's not only still growing - but it's still accelerating.  The fact that MSFT had 34B in free cash flow in 2016 is completely irrelevant to the stock's price today, where they have 56B in FCF.   \n\nThe way these guys are coming up with their valuations are as if MSFT isn't growing any more - it's more useful when looking at mature dividend companies, but it's not really a good way to value a company that is going to aggressively grow for the next 5-10 years.",
