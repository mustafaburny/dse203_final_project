Google win (is priced more cheaply)\n- YoY Revenue growth: 41% vs 22%. Google win (has been growing consistently faster) \n- Operating Margin: 30.3% vs 42%. Google win (very similar companies, Google has more room to improve its margins, while MSFT is already at a very high level and in alignment with FB)\n- Moat: Google has search, Android and YouTube with very strong moats (i.e. 20 years horizon). Microsoft has already been losing market share on Windows. office suites, and gaming for a while. On Azure it's growing at a similar rate to Google Cloud for the past couple of years. Overall Google wins with a far stronger hold on its market\n- Innovative upside: Google has a few bets in its arsenal that could potentially become huge such as self-driving cars, drone delivery, and even the hardware business (e.g. the new Pixel lineup is finally considered competitive vs the iPhone, which could become a huge business as Apple has proven). Microsoft has been consistently failing to expand to new areas.\n- Regulatory risk: That's the only place where a Microsoft investment is better position vs Google, precisely because of Google's strong hold of its markets.\n\nI'm happy to hear counter arguments, but overall it's hard for me to find MSFT as a more attractive investment than Google on almost all fronts. This is a clear sign for me that MSFT is (relatively) overvalued for what it offers right now.",

It would be hard for me to pay attention at work and school since my mind would just be focused on trying to chase gains and praying that my portfolio wouldn't be red. Then, I eventually lost like $4k in total. It was initially hard to stomach the loss but I had to just accept it as a learning lesson. \n\nI also just wanted to say I fully agree with you on the LEAPS in safe companies. 80% of my portfolio is stocks and 20% LEAPS. LEAPS are great ways to control more of a stock with less money and I make sure to only buy LEAPS on great fundamental companies (NVDA and AMD) but am planning to buy some SPY GOOGL and MSFT LEAPS that you mentioned as well.\n\nI just want to say that I actually sleep better now and my quality of life is MUCH better. I realized I just couldn't handle the stress of 90%+ swings in my portfolio without being glued to it or worrying \"IS IT TIME TO SELL?\" LEAPS and shares remove all of that because they don't really have an \"expiration.\" Shares are unlimited and LEAPS are like 2-3 years out so there's no rush to feel like: THE STOCK HAS TO RALLY 20% in a day, all you have to do is choose companies you have high conviction in and let them naturally make their way up.",

        "body": "This is a tricky question. I own the usual suspects AAPL MSFT GOOG AMZN etc. But I wouldn't call them value today. Given they are already at trillions in valuation, I think the upside is limited in the short term. What I mean by that is that I don't expect AAPL to double to 320 in the next 2 to 3 years. \n\nSo with that, here are my 5 I consider to be value *today*. These are not the hold for rest of your life, but I think have decent upside or downside protection for the next 3 to 5 or so years. I don't expect any to be a 10 bagger or anything like that any time soon. \n\nAlso, I have been wrong before and there is a fair chance, I am wrong with one or all of these. :) Would love to hear your thoughts.  \n\nVIAC: I think this is severely undervalued. Sure cable is dying, but I believe the speed at which is overestimated. VIAC has strong content; many of the top TV shows are VIAC. Nickelodeon is must have for kids with Paw Patrol, Blues Clues, SpongeBob etc. Pluto TV is expected to bring in 1 billion dollars in 2021. They are selling hard assets and I think getting ready to be acquired. \n\nFor fun, read about Archegos if you don't know. \n\nT: this one is an odd ball. I think it is what Burry would call an ick investment. Almost made me hold my nose when I bought some last week. T has lagged the market for many years. Their dividend cut after Warner spinoff didn't sit well with existing shareholders. But I think T offers good downside protection at today's prices. Partly due to the spin off of Warner where T stock holders will get 71% of the new co. I think in terms of content DISC + Warner can compete with NFLX and Disney. \n\nVRTX: I will start by acknowledging that there is always a lot of uncertainty with bio tech companies. VRTX has a strong monopoly in cystic fibrosis and it is growing (although at a slower rate), it has strong free cash flow and has a rock solid balance sheet, and has a decent pipeline. VRTX focuses on rare diseases, so the pipeline drugs are longshot. But thats the risk. The market is currently discounting the pipeline all together it seems. If any one is successful, this has the potential to go to the moon (as they say). Patience is the name of the game with VRTX though. It will be 2023 to 2024 for any of the pipeline drugs to be successful. \n\nLMT: Solid industrial play. Good dividend.  They had a poor Q3, causing a price drop. This is a buying opportunity in my opinion. \n\nMKL: I only recently learned about this. I have a very small position, but I am reading and understanding them more. In short, they have been called mini Berkshire. The management has said all the right things and follow the Buffet investing philosophy in my opinion. Not many know about this company, so adding it to the list. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts about these.",

        "body": "I'm fully aware, but when the shitty half of a sector sells off, the good half does too. As far as I can tell, the only sector that is THAT ridiculously hyped right now is the EV market. I'd like examples of other things that are bad, but that's all that sticks out to me right now.\n\nYes, rising interest rates are going to kill growth stocks in general, and some of those companies are big parts of SPX. Companies that are relying on that easy money for survival are going to have a hard time, some might go under. It's still not even CLOSE to a dot-com situation.\n\n I'd agree that Tesla is FOR SURE the poster child of a dot-com-esque company in 2021. but honestly even the extreme example of Tesla isn't even that bad. Despite the insane valuation, Tesla is a profitable company. A ridiculous number of companies in dot-com era were non-profitable on low revenue, with no pathway to viability EVER.\n\nYahoo (one of the companies that actually SURVIVED), peaked at a valuation of $140 billion. The previous year they reported net earnings of $50 million on $200 million in revenue. That's a P/E of 2800. Tesla right now is sitting at a P/E in the 300s.\n\nMany of the companies in the Dotcom era were in SUBSTANTIALLY worse shape than Yahoo, and they were absolutely everywhere. Pets .com literally spent 20x their revenue on advertising. 90% of an entire sector was legitimately worthless. That's why Microsoft, Amazon, Cisco, etc sold off so hard. Not because they weren't viable businesses, but because they'd ridden the ride up as a secondary member of the Dotcom companies. Amazon actually makes money, and the reason their earnings aren't higher rn is largely because of Capex. If the shitty EV companies go under as a result of high interest rates or whatever, it's not like electric cars won't get made. GM, Ford, etc will be able to make them, preserving much of the utility of the companies that provide materials and infrastructure for the overvalued EV companies to operate.\n\nI'm not saying that everything in the market is fine or that interest rates aren't going to hurt some sectors pretty hard, but I think the post I originally replied to DRASTICALLY overstated companies' current valuations vs the Dotcom bubble. And remember, Yahoo was the google of the era, trading at a PE of 2800. Google, the google of our era, is trading at a PE of 28.\n\nI hope this provides some perspective.",

It doesn't really matter how good an amd gpu is their driver support is terrible and if a 700 dollar gpu that performs like a 1500 dollar gpu sounds good, which it should but in reality it doesn't matter because the drivers are crap and real world performance always lags benchmarks. \n\nOn the cpu front. I'd only use amd cpus on a workstation. The higher core count per dollar is nice but my 5950 system with a 2080ti never ran as well on 2k as my 9900k system with the same gpu. Both have ram tailored for the system and adequate cooling using msi mobos. This is in cod warzone which is heavily cpu dependant. The 9900k is at 5ghz both use noctua 2 tower coolers. And 32gb of b die ram. The amd system has memory tailored to the infinity fabric frequency as well so don't give me that frequency crap. The issue with the 5950 is I get frequent stuttering and lag fps drops. Not network related. If I spin 360  between the downtown and airport runway while on the hill ill lose 50fps. Dropping from 150 to 100 around the time I'm looking at array. 1440p same settings as my 9900k but fir whatever reason my 9900k system doesn't have these stutters when replicating. \n\nI'm buying more intc for the long haul, alder lake might be good.

Releasing a GPU that performs at the same level as 2 year old, 2-generation old NVDA graphics card for the same price doesn't seem that great.\n\nAlso, people aren't buying 16-series NVDA cards any more, they've moved on to the 30- series or at the very least the 20-series. [You can see the popularity of different GPUs](https://benchmarks.ul.com/compare/best-gpus?amount=0&amp;sortBy=POPULARITY&amp;reverseOrder=true&amp;types=MOBILE,DESKTOP&amp;minRating=0) here, no one's buying this stuff any more.\n\nTo me, this is just another example of INTC being woefully behind in the GPU space.  People want to buy the latest GPUs to play the latest games...and Intel with this move has shown that they aren't even in the stratosphere as NVDA/AMD.  Woof.",

Am I wrong? \n\nProblem is this is the wrong way of looking at TSLA. It'd be like looking at Apple in 2007 and saying \"ppfffttt look at how many phones motorola sells even if Apple sells 100% of the worlds phones then they can only reach X valuation\". Problem is smart phones opened whole new revenue streams that previously didn't exist for cell phone manufacturers. \n\nTSLA is similar. Either Tesla is going to find new ways to make money for a car company, such as charging for self driving, sell his AI chips, selling batteries to other manufacturers, etc etc or it'll crash down to earth. Only time will tell if they will succeed or not (I missed the boat on Tesla so I don't own any) but looking at the company's growth prospects as the number of cars they may or may not sell is missing the entire point.",

I really prefer Motorola flagship phones with a metal frame that come with a completely bone stock android meaning they\u2019ll be the first to get updates. My last androids were from the Moto z series that worked with the moto mods, really wish they kept going with that experiment, the possibilities were endless.

        "body": "Eh. I own all 3 stocks so I'm somewhat neutral. Amd won't catch nvda on the gpu front. Except for a few circumstances nvda always will outperform. It doesn't really matter how good an amd gpu is their driver support is terrible and if a 700 dollar gpu that performs like a 1500 dollar gpu sounds good, which it should but in reality it doesn't matter because the drivers are crap and real world performance always lags benchmarks. \n\nOn the cpu front. I'd only use amd cpus on a workstation. The higher core count per dollar is nice but my 5950 system with a 2080ti never ran as well on 2k as my 9900k system with the same gpu. Both have ram tailored for the system and adequate cooling using msi mobos. This is in cod warzone which is heavily cpu dependant. The 9900k is at 5ghz both use noctua 2 tower coolers. And 32gb of b die ram. The amd system has memory tailored to the infinity fabric frequency as well so don't give me that frequency crap. The issue with the 5950 is I get frequent stuttering and lag fps drops. Not network related. If I spin 360  between the downtown and airport runway while on the hill ill lose 50fps. Dropping from 150 to 100 around the time I'm looking at array. 1440p same settings as my 9900k but fir whatever reason my 9900k system doesn't have these stutters when replicating. \n\nI'm buying more intc for the long haul, alder lake might be good. Time will tell. I love amd as well but I think they'll be stretched thin trying to batter the monoliths of 2 industries.",

So competitors tried to copy the size and shape without really understanding where the world was heading under their nose.\n\nI think that analogy is playing out right now in autos.
