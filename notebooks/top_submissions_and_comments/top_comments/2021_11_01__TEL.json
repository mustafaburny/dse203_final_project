        "body": "Eh. Fine.\n\n1. Pat Gelsinger. Finally a hungry engineer is at the helm of Intel. A CEO that invests in the company's future rather than focus on stock price with dividends and buybacks.\n2. Bottleneck. Nvidia and AMD have the same bottleneck. Both have TSMC manufacture the chips for them. Any issue with TSMC and both of them will suffer.\n3. Apple and Intel are only two of the companies that have joined in as TSMC customers. This reduces the amount of chips TSMC can produce others, AKA Nvidia and AMD. Intel does not have this limitation as they produce only chips for the GPU at TSMC. Nvidia's crap GPU supply vs demand is just an example. What use is quality product if you fail to produce enough of it?\n4. Intel is making its first ever gaming GPU. Completely new market. Whether it is top tier GPU or an okay GPU, it doesn't matter. It is a brand new market and it will be taking market share from AMD and Nvidia. I don't have high expectations for this GPU even though I plan to buy it, but I am excited about Intel doing it.\n5. Intel is releasing Alder Lake now, AMD is due to release Ryzen 6000 in the second half of 2022 (maybe first  half, based on rumors). But right afterwards Intel is rumored to release Raptor Lake (rumored Q3). Intel is pushing full force to 5 CPUs in 4 years.\n6. EVs. Pat Gelsinger's view of the automotive market of the future is such that most of the vehicle cost would be the cost of the chips and as such he is maneuvering the giant to set foot into chip manufacturing for vehicles (part of the Irish plant will start producing car chips for other companies). I honestly can't even estimate how much money they can make from getting into\n7. Massive investments into fabs as chips demand will not go down but will only go up. Other than $20bil in the US, Intel also invests $95bil in fabs in Europe (With Germany, Italy and Spain trying to attract Intel).\n8. Yes, Intel is losing data center market share to AMD. But it also recently started cooperating with Google to produce data center chips that will become an industry standard.\n9. The biggest complaint about Intel's CPUs is their power consumption. Intel has a patent since 2020 to reduce the power consumption of their CPUs. It isn't used in Alder Lake, but rumored to perhaps be in Raptor Lake (gen 13) and reduce the CPU's power consumption by 25%.\n10. Raptor Lake will still support DDR4 so upgrading from Alder Lake will not require upgrading the motherboard as well. To me it is a symbol of change in Intel's mindset that what ever they throw the consumers will buy.\n11. Intel has been taking VPs and senior directors from AMD as well as other companies to to push further into gaming support and not just throw out a  GPU. Their goal is to support developers as much as possible.\n12. Mobileye. Mobileye already has robotaxis going around in different cities in the world (they have a driver just in case). In 2022 they are planned to add them in Berlin and Tel-Aviv as well.\n13. Insider activity. In the past 3 months 46k shares were bought more than sold, in the past 12 months the number is already at 201k more bought than sold. For Nvidia? 0 bought in the last 3 months and 314k sold. 1.272mil more sold in the last 12 months. AMD? 0 bought in the last 12 months. Not a single insider wanted to buy AMD shares in the last 12 months. 1mil shares were sold in the last 3 months alone, 2.97mil were sold in the last 12 months.\n14. To go up, Intel doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to not mess up. To go up AMD and Nvidia need to execute perfectly. One misstep by Nvidia and AMD and they will shed quite a of their value. I invested in Intel before Alder Lake was released, and I didn't have high hopes for it. I only hoped it will match Ryzen, was far from expecting it to bear Ryzen in Windows 10 as well. Imagine what will happen if Raptor Lake is released and it beats AMD's brand new CPU? Now imagine what happens if Raptor Lake doesn't beat it but isn't too far off from it while being cheaper (let's face it, Intel will always be cheaper)? Intel won't lose a lot if it doesn't beat the next AMD CPU, but AMD will lose massively if Intel does.\n\nPretty sure I could come up with more if I really try to.",

Other large supplies of ours are not even American such as Yageo and TE Connectivity aren't even headquartered in the US and manufacturer the bulk of their product in their home country. It's been a big issue for my portion of the defense industry the past couple of years because these factories in China are also sourcing a large portion of counterfeit electronic components on the market.\n\nI know we're not the only defense manufacturer using Chinese components because I've seen several news articles and reports from the DOD claiming this is a problem.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/10/us-military-reliance-china-foreign-suppliers-expos/\n\nPanasonic and Murata (Japanese) used to produce critical components of our products, but have since stopped selling to us because they don't want their products used in munitions.

A lot.\n\nSo we just go along for the ride, explicit &amp; deliberate \"value\" assessment be damned.  \n\nRemember Buffett - who had forever preached \"I only invest in what I know\" leading him to famously avoid tech - was just all of a sudden \"oh hey I'm making Apple by far my largest holding\"?\n\nApple is obviously an absurd cash machine and deserves a massive valuation, but is there any real reason it should be \"worth\" 2.6T instead of, say, 1.8T?\n\nNo.  But that's where the market movers have gone, so just join the ride there or wherever and make money alongside them.\n\n[This pretty much sums my entire point in video form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbBD7VIJ4cc&amp;t=48s).",

        "body": "Going to post this here because I don't have anywhere else to post it.  It's related and I hope some of you can find value in it.\n\nThe people saying \"this isn't a big deal\", I think that's disingenuous.  The people saying \"panic!\", that's also disingenuous.  The fact is, we don't know.  I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XtJQzkeAaY) to be very helpful.  He summarizes the potential issues with this new 'nu' variant:\n\n1. It may be more transmissible than other variants, including delta.  That would be shocking because delta is already highly transmissible.\n2. It may be able to get around the vaccines we already have.\n3. It may result in more serious illnesses in those who are infected.  This one is not a serious concern at the moment.\n\nDo note that in this new variant there's 30 mutations to the spike protein, which is why we're concerned that there may implications for vaccine efficacy ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html)).\n\nIn terms of investing, I don't encourage anyone to sell off right now.  That's silly.  Stick to your plan.  This was not meant to be a gloom and doom post.  But at the same time, the folks saying \"this is nothing\", that's not accurate.  It might be!  There's been scares before, obviously.  But at least inform yourself a bit before making statements that not only relate to finance and investing, but also to public health.\n\nFurthermore, at least in my case I'm a little scared.  I remember the feeling of the original Covid outbreak.  At first it was some obscure story in China, then Italy, and next thing I know I was told I was going to have to be working from home and could only go out to buy groceries.  I guess I'm a little traumatized.\n\nFor people who think life is clean and perfect all the time, I'm sure this will look like fear mongering or whatever.  So be it.  But hey, I'm scared right now.  I've got a trip back to the USA to visit my parents for Christmas.  I haven't seen them in 2 years.  I'm worried about what this means for my travel plans.  It's normal.  It's human.  Pretending like there isn't a problem when there is one doesn't solve anything.  There's a reason governments are taking this seriously.\n\nAnyway, it may all blow over, I fully acknowledge that and I hope it's the case!  But just pretending like everything is fine isn't the reality of what we're seeing right now.  I imagine I can't be the only one feeling this way.\n\nSo, best of luck to everyone, stick your investing plan and take care of yourselves!\n\n\\-shorty",

We can now address them without nuking the economy. \n\nIt's up to leaders to make good decisions, which are generally sorely lacking, but they can hardly claim ignorance now.\n\nWhat we have learned is that lockdowns don't work but social distancing does. \n\nMarkets aren't stupid, there is a reason we had a V recovery in March. Most businesses are more able than ever to react to a digital first commerce strategy. There is no reason for the economy to tank.\n\nThe only real reasons behind the market crashing are growth. Is growth slowing? Well China is beginning to flash some pretty big signals and as tapering takes it's toll you'll see normal economies slow too. With slowing growth comes P/E ratios under focus. There are a lot of companies that are overvalued BUT there are also a lot of companies which are at like 50% of this years ATH... There are absolutely bubbles in EVs and such but other areas I'd say are fair valued.\n\nOverall we're just entering a time where you need to modify the way you appraise value and what sectors will be more robust against repeat waves of pandemic. It's sort of like being in a war-time market. \n\nSo, all that being said the broad sell off is a big over-correction because of the short trading day and market Thursday close. By Wednesday the headlines will read \"Markets shrug off virus concerns. Fund managers confident businesses can navigate new strains.\" \n\nThe only real areas of struggle will continue to be big events, big sports events and such. Some regions will have them, some will not. Downtown core commercial property will continue to face headwinds but rents just need to fall. This virus is with us literally forever, it will become another seasonal cold/flu/infectious disease and you'll hear about new variants each year. Pharama will start making broad spectrum covid shots that you'll get with your other myriad. Every country will do deals with pharma so they can maintain critical supply. \n\nThrough all this society will, by and large, ignore issues of health, diet, nutrition, and underlying diseases like diabetes, smoking, lack of exercise. Society will also ignore age and treat all people, including children, at the same risk level as an 85 year old. This irrationality will make people more aggressive, combative, and you'll see more political factions in every nation, especially 'freedom parties'. The only way these are neutralized are with open policies but those are by and large against government directives. Truth is they are welcoming the greater control, digital ID, travelling surveillance, contact tracing, immunization databases. These are all useful for maintaining the elites control, and so these ideas will continue.",

But he wasn't really an agent, although he obviously helped them.  He was a \"journalist\" but his job description was mostly to \"entertain\" American visitors.  These Americans were carefully vetted before being invited to Russia and upon arrival he did things like get them drunk, make Russia look really good, and try to get them in slightly compromised situations.  Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.  That was the majority of KGB \"spy\" operations.\n\nWhen it comes to Evergrand, cui bono? China.  So whether intentionally carrying weight for China or just useful idiots victimized by CCP intel operations, NYT is carrying water for the **CCP who desperately wants to unload assets before the rest of the world catches on**.  This is the exact **same play they ran for the pandemic** when they vacuumed up PPE across the globe while denying human to human transmission.",

This is literally what the market does every month now. Except, it's not doing what it's normally doing on the daily candlestick chart... it's trading flat when it's normally trending down right now, which is actually kind of weird and strong.  \n\n\nAnd the reason for that is because most of the retail numbers are actually pretty good and most of the macro indicators are really good. Jobs from July on were just revised up by almost \\*700,000\\* jobs. In these earnings reports, there's some mention of inflationary troubles for some companies, but there's also significant news about how companies are starting to bring prices down to move volume, which is expected... inflation, it turns out, likely is actually transitory... just not \"transitory is like a month\" like all of the ADHD newb kids think.  \n\n\nOil's going down. At the port, shipping container backlog is down 25%. There's just a TON of great macroecon data.  \n\n\nFor retail, margins suffering in the short term doesn't result in market insolvency in the long term, and the big drag on the market was V... Visa has a ton of issues, almost none of which have to do with retail or inflation and everything to do with the fact that their business model is being disrupted by BNPL and Visa's starting to lose vendor interest.  \n\n\nIf you actually zoom out the graph, the market's actually still on a very strong upward leaning bullish streak for the month... these Bear theses need major work.",
