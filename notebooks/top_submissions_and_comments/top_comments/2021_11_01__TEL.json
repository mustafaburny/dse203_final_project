        "body": "Eh. Fine.\n\n1. Pat Gelsinger. Finally a hungry engineer is at the helm of Intel. A CEO that invests in the company's future rather than focus on stock price with dividends and buybacks.\n2. Bottleneck. Nvidia and AMD have the same bottleneck. Both have TSMC manufacture the chips for them. Any issue with TSMC and both of them will suffer.\n3. Apple and Intel are only two of the companies that have joined in as TSMC customers. This reduces the amount of chips TSMC can produce others, AKA Nvidia and AMD. Intel does not have this limitation as they produce only chips for the GPU at TSMC. Nvidia's crap GPU supply vs demand is just an example. What use is quality product if you fail to produce enough of it?\n4. Intel is making its first ever gaming GPU. Completely new market. Whether it is top tier GPU or an okay GPU, it doesn't matter. It is a brand new market and it will be taking market share from AMD and Nvidia. I don't have high expectations for this GPU even though I plan to buy it, but I am excited about Intel doing it.\n5. Intel is releasing Alder Lake now, AMD is due to release Ryzen 6000 in the second half of 2022 (maybe first  half, based on rumors). But right afterwards Intel is rumored to release Raptor Lake (rumored Q3). Intel is pushing full force to 5 CPUs in 4 years.\n6. EVs. Pat Gelsinger's view of the automotive market of the future is such that most of the vehicle cost would be the cost of the chips and as such he is maneuvering the giant to set foot into chip manufacturing for vehicles (part of the Irish plant will start producing car chips for other companies). I honestly can't even estimate how much money they can make from getting into\n7. Massive investments into fabs as chips demand will not go down but will only go up. Other than $20bil in the US, Intel also invests $95bil in fabs in Europe (With Germany, Italy and Spain trying to attract Intel).\n8. Yes, Intel is losing data center market share to AMD. But it also recently started cooperating with Google to produce data center chips that will become an industry standard.\n9. The biggest complaint about Intel's CPUs is their power consumption. Intel has a patent since 2020 to reduce the power consumption of their CPUs. It isn't used in Alder Lake, but rumored to perhaps be in Raptor Lake (gen 13) and reduce the CPU's power consumption by 25%.\n10. Raptor Lake will still support DDR4 so upgrading from Alder Lake will not require upgrading the motherboard as well. To me it is a symbol of change in Intel's mindset that what ever they throw the consumers will buy.\n11. Intel has been taking VPs and senior directors from AMD as well as other companies to to push further into gaming support and not just throw out a  GPU. Their goal is to support developers as much as possible.\n12. Mobileye. Mobileye already has robotaxis going around in different cities in the world (they have a driver just in case). In 2022 they are planned to add them in Berlin and Tel-Aviv as well.\n13. Insider activity. In the past 3 months 46k shares were bought more than sold, in the past 12 months the number is already at 201k more bought than sold. For Nvidia? 0 bought in the last 3 months and 314k sold. 1.272mil more sold in the last 12 months. AMD? 0 bought in the last 12 months. Not a single insider wanted to buy AMD shares in the last 12 months. 1mil shares were sold in the last 3 months alone, 2.97mil were sold in the last 12 months.\n14. To go up, Intel doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to not mess up. To go up AMD and Nvidia need to execute perfectly. One misstep by Nvidia and AMD and they will shed quite a of their value. I invested in Intel before Alder Lake was released, and I didn't have high hopes for it. I only hoped it will match Ryzen, was far from expecting it to bear Ryzen in Windows 10 as well. Imagine what will happen if Raptor Lake is released and it beats AMD's brand new CPU? Now imagine what happens if Raptor Lake doesn't beat it but isn't too far off from it while being cheaper (let's face it, Intel will always be cheaper)? Intel won't lose a lot if it doesn't beat the next AMD CPU, but AMD will lose massively if Intel does.\n\nPretty sure I could come up with more if I really try to.",

        "body": "&gt; in fact im fairly certain all of our parts are manufactured on US soil\n\nDown to what level though? Not many of the basic electronic components everything else is built from are made in the US. American companies like Vishay, Microchip, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx either operate factories in China or contract foundries in China or Taiwan. Other large supplies of ours are not even American such as Yageo and TE Connectivity aren't even headquartered in the US and manufacturer the bulk of their product in their home country. It's been a big issue for my portion of the defense industry the past couple of years because these factories in China are also sourcing a large portion of counterfeit electronic components on the market.\n\nI know we're not the only defense manufacturer using Chinese components because I've seen several news articles and reports from the DOD claiming this is a problem.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/10/us-military-reliance-china-foreign-suppliers-expos/\n\nPanasonic and Murata (Japanese) used to produce critical components of our products, but have since stopped selling to us because they don't want their products used in munitions. When that happened the government fronted a lot of money to a couple American companies to produce an alternative since none existed.",

If you dig more into what they do and have planned, you'll see that they're highly undervalued for a defense contractor.",

But he wasn't really an agent, although he obviously helped them.  He was a \"journalist\" but his job description was mostly to \"entertain\" American visitors.  These Americans were carefully vetted before being invited to Russia and upon arrival he did things like get them drunk, make Russia look really good, and try to get them in slightly compromised situations.  Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.  That was the majority of KGB \"spy\" operations.\n\nWhen it comes to Evergrand, cui bono? China.  So whether intentionally carrying weight for China or just useful idiots victimized by CCP intel operations, NYT is carrying water for the **CCP who desperately wants to unload assets before the rest of the world catches on**.  This is the exact **same play they ran for the pandemic** when they vacuumed up PPE across the globe while denying human to human transmission.",

Except, it's not doing what it's normally doing on the daily candlestick chart... it's trading flat when it's normally trending down right now, which is actually kind of weird and strong.  \n\n\nAnd the reason for that is because most of the retail numbers are actually pretty good and most of the macro indicators are really good. Jobs from July on were just revised up by almost \\*700,000\\* jobs. In these earnings reports, there's some mention of inflationary troubles for some companies, but there's also significant news about how companies are starting to bring prices down to move volume, which is expected... inflation, it turns out, likely is actually transitory... just not \"transitory is like a month\" like all of the ADHD newb kids think.  \n\n\nOil's going down. At the port, shipping container backlog is down 25%. There's just a TON of great macroecon data.  \n\n\nFor retail, margins suffering in the short term doesn't result in market insolvency in the long term, and the big drag on the market was V... Visa has a ton of issues, almost none of which have to do with retail or inflation and everything to do with the fact that their business model is being disrupted by BNPL and Visa's starting to lose vendor interest.  \n\n\nIf you actually zoom out the graph, the market's actually still on a very strong upward leaning bullish streak for the month... these Bear theses need major work.",

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

        "body": "&gt;...one of them was to outright buy 100 shares of SPY, since I'm comfortable owning those shares, and then selling calls on it on a regular basis.\n\nThis is called buy-write. It's not the wheel, which alternates between put-selling and CC selling. \n\nYou can take advantage of the leverage options provide by synthesizing long shares through a deep ITM call, or a backspread like a ZEEHBS or ZEBRA. If you want to buy and hold the shares, that's a totally legit strategy. I personally don't like covered calls. It's weird to me that they seem so popular. The return is incredibly low and you constantly have to defend them, if you want to keep the stock. Not worth the time and effort IMO.",

        "body": "Purchasing shares to cover a short position can work, but it can also work against you. It's a very capital-intensive way to cover the position in any case. I've done it before both successful and not. A more capital-efficient way of doing this is cover the short with a deep ITM long option or a ZEBRA. I prefer ZEBRAs, especially long-dated.\n\nYou are always going to get a lot of sanctimonious knee-jerk responses about selling calls from people who have no idea what they are talking about. As someone who has sold naked calls for years, it's risky and it's a lot harder to make money than by put-selling. There's also a lot of value to balanced delta in my opinion. \n\nMost of the time lately they are either challenged or at an unrealized loss, but rarely ITM, depending on your entry delta. You usually get a month or two out of the year where they are the only thing that pays. It's easy to not be stupid about it. Don't trade meme stocks and don't sell 400 naked puts on a $20K account. The last few months have been rough, because a lot of stuff is up significantly more than volatility had priced in. Vol is just way under priced right now. I have strangles on MSFT, CVS, WMT and XRT that have all blown way past my short call strike. I'm inverted on all of them. At the same time, a lot of stuff has tanked and gone way past my short put strikes.",

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",
