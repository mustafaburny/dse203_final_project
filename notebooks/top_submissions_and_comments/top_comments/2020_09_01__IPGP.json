While I\u2019m personally excited and will be upgrading my pc at the earliest chance, I am not sure how their gaming revenues will be impacted.\n\nIf I put my investor cap on, NVDA should know that their new graphics card would be released in September which means next quarters results includes the sales of that card and future quarters.\n\nThey guided to 4.4bn revenue which would account for ampere release which is up from 3.86 this qtr. however I expected more from NVDA with a new graphics card and data center growth expectations. \n\nStill I think nvda is great even at this price\nIf they can eventually rake in 20bn annually, they\u2019re not far off, at 65% margin and 4.5-5bn opex then they can achieve 8bn ebit not too far into the future\n\nthat\u2019s 43 times pre tax earnings and I think their growth runway is long so that figure should come down over the years\n\nI would say even 50x-60x forward earnings is fine due to how expensive other companies are.\n\nI\u2019m more optimistic on their growth than fang stocks and ma/v.\n\nYet ma is trading at almost 50 times and visa almost 40 times.

I think you could possibly see this happen with Amazon and Facebook, but I think it\u2019s unlikely to happen to the others. Anyway, this action was not catastrophic for the telecom sector. If anything, the breakup of the monopoly enabled innovation and increased the TAM of telecom companies. If it was just Ma Bell in town, think how long they would\u2019ve resisted DSL or cable internet and tried to keep us all on dialup.\n\n\nWith IE, the problem was that they used their platform (Windows) to monopolize the browser space. I think there\u2019s an extremely compelling case to argue that Google and Apple will be in trouble with this and be forced to spin off their app stores, but this will not cripple them \u2014 the vast majority of revenue does not come from App Store monopolies. Microsoft stock has been on a rampage since then, as well.\n\nTLDR: long term investors should not fear antitrust action under current regulations.",

I think you could possibly see this happen with Amazon and Facebook, but I think it\u2019s unlikely to happen to the others. Anyway, this action was not catastrophic for the telecom sector. If anything, the breakup of the monopoly enabled innovation and increased the TAM of telecom companies. If it was just Ma Bell in town, think how long they would\u2019ve resisted DSL or cable internet and tried to keep us all on dialup.\n\n\nWith IE, the problem was that they used their platform (Windows) to monopolize the browser space. I think there\u2019s an extremely compelling case to argue that Google and Apple will be in trouble with this and be forced to spin off their app stores, but this will not cripple them \u2014 the vast majority of revenue does not come from App Store monopolies. Microsoft stock has been on a rampage since then, as well.\n\nTLDR: long term investors should not fear antitrust action under current regulations.",
