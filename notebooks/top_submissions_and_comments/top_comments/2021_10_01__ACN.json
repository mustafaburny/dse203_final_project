        "body": "very startup has an origin story, a tale that illustrates its core principles. For Wealthsimple, that meant promoting low-fee, passive investing.\n\nAfter selling his first business about a decade ago, Wealthsimple co-founder Michael Katchen constructed a simple portfolio of exchange-traded funds using Microsoft Excel, then told the friends with whom he cashed out that this approach was the best way to invest their money.\n\nThe underlying premise: It\u2019s tough to outperform the market over the long run, so for most people it\u2019s better to invest in a mix of low-cost ETFs and ride the wave.\n\n\u201cThe feedback I got from my friends was, \u2018Mike, we\u2019re lazy. We love the system, but can you just please do it for us?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Katchen told The Globe and Mail in 2016. \u201cAnd they became the first 10 clients of Wealthsimple.\u201d\n\nThe concept proved popular with the millennial crowd, attracting billions of dollars in assets to Wealthsimple\u2019s so-called robo-adviser, and the company went so far as to buy Super Bowl ads preaching \u201csimple automated investing.\u201d In no time, Wealthsimple had so much buzz that people started to wonder if it would take down Bay Street\u2019s old guard.\n\nLately, so much of that seems like a past life. The company\u2019s automated platform still exists, but Wealthsimple is now advertising a day trading app for retail investors. And it\u2019s not just stocks \u2013 it is heavily promoting its new cryptocurrency business, which allows users to swap a slew of crypto assets.\n\nThe new strategy seems at odds with Wealthsimple\u2019s founding principles, particularly so with crypto, which is highly volatile and has some of the highest trading fees around. In a recent speech, Gary Gensler, the new head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, called the crypto market the Wild West, \u201crife with fraud, scams and abuse.\u201d China recently made all crypto transactions illegal.\n\nDespite the hard pivot, Wealthsimple has said little about its change of heart. When asked about the new strategy, no one was willing to be interviewed. Instead, the company sent e-mails explaining that it is diversifying to target different client segments.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to help everyone achieve financial freedom, no matter who they are or how much they have. That mission hasn\u2019t changed. We are a fast growing company building a full financial ecosystem for our clients across their savings, investing, spending, tax and crypto needs,\u201d Mr. Katchen wrote.\n\nAs for crypto\u2019s volatility, which prompted the SEC chair to call it a \u201chighly speculative asset class,\u201d Mr. Katchen does not believe that disqualifies it from inclusion in a well-rounded portfolio. Wealthsimple, he wrote, is \u201cvery comfortable recommending that our clients put their money in diversified, low-cost portfolios, while also supporting them if they wish to invest in particular companies or promising new technology.\u201d He also said that Wealthsimple is the first crypto platform to be regulated by a securities authority in Canada.\n\nWhat is happening at Wealthsimple is playing out in a similar fashion across the robo-adviser industry. Once-popular rivals in the United States, including Wealthfront and Betterment, are facing existential crises of their own. For all the billions of dollars that robo-advisers manage, it often isn\u2019t enough to turn a profit. Betterment\u2019s CEO stepped down last December, and its new leader acknowledged that an initial public offering likely was not possible until the company started making money.\n\n\u201cThese businesses operate on very tight margins. They just have extremely low fees, therefore they have to achieve pretty large scale before they\u2019re profitable,\u201d said David Goldstone, head of research and analytics at Backend Benchmarking, which tracks the robo-adviser market, in an interview.\n\nEven if a robo-adviser brings in tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue by charging around 0.5 per cent annually, the company has to spend heavily to attract new clients. \u201cThere was an industry-wide underestimation of how much it was going to cost to acquire customers,\u201d Mr. Goldstone added.\n\nCompounding the problem, the old guard woke up and launched robo-advisers of their own. In the U.S., Vanguard and Charles Schwab now dominate the market, with assets worth US$210-billion and US$60-billion, respectively, at the end of 2020. Betterment, the largest independent robo-adviser in the U.S., managed US$28-billion at the same date. In Canada, Bank of Montreal launched its SmartFolio robo-adviser in 2016, and Royal Bank of Canada followed suit in 2018.\n\nThe incumbents aren\u2019t simply more competition \u2013 they have a structural advantage, because they can cross-sell their robo-platforms to existing clients, lowering their customer-acquisition costs.\n\nTo adjust, Wealthsimple started diversifying in 2018 with a high-interest savings account, then added Wealthsimple Trade, which allows users to buy and sell stocks. In the fall of 2019, the company acquired software maker Simpletax. And a few months later it launched Wealthsimple Cash, a hybrid of a no-fee chequing account and a high-interest savings account.\n\nThe pivot to crypto started in August, 2020, when Wealthsimple\u2019s users were permitted to start trading Bitcoin and Ether. This past June, trading expanded to 14 additional crypto assets, including Litecoin and Dogecoin.\n\nWealthsimple does not break down its assets by division, but retail trading and crypto are what makes Silicon Valley salivate. Last fall, Wealthsimple raised $114-million in a funding round that valued the company at $1.4-billion. In May, it raised another $750-million, boosting its valuation to $5-billion only seven months later.\n\nRetail trading app Robinhood and crypto trading hub Coinbase recently went public in the United States, and their financial statements illustrate just how explosive retail trading revenue growth can be, particularly in crypto. At Robinhood, crypto brought in US$320-million in the first half of 2021, compared with just US$10-million in the first half of 2020.\n\nTo understand what that could mean for Wealthsimple, simply look at the fee schedule. The company\u2019s robo-clients often pay 0.5 per cent annually, while crypto traders pay 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per transaction (although Wealthsimple must split that fee with other parties).\n\nStock trading and crypto are also popular with younger users, which has always been Wealthsimple\u2019s target market but proved to be a tough nut to crack.\n\nEven though the company attracted billions in assets, it was a tiny fraction of the total wealth-management market. Switching rates, which measure the likelihood that someone is willing to leave their main financial institution, remain stubbornly low. In 2020, management consultancy Accenture pegged the switching rate for a primary financial account in Canada at only 4 per cent.\n\nYet as the company grows, it seems inevitable that it will move further from its roots \u2013 some of which are still exposed on Wealthsimple\u2019s website. In a section promoting its robo-adviser, the company writes: \u201cHistory shows that when you try to predict the future \u2013 by picking stocks, for example \u2013 rather than investing in a highly diversified way, you are more likely to underperform the market.\u201d",

They are available on all QC clouds, and are really driving applications research. The trapped Ion approach offers NxN connectivity with low overhead for error correction, high gate fidelity further reducing overhead, high coherence time (hours to days). \n\nI think the main selling point is that, while silicon or photonics approaches require low operating temperatures (0,x-4K) and massive overhead for error correction, they get away with laser cooling in a vacuum chamber and have shown 13:1 error correction working on trapped Ion systems. Personally I believe that they are on a strong path to be the first player to leave the NISQ era.

For your risky portion - maybe 20% if you can't lose too much for your house deposit? Idk you gotta figure that number out for yourself - you can look at individual stocks or more growth-focused ETFs. If you want exposure to crazy tech growth look at the ARK ETFs and they probably have a product that will give you that.\n\nCongratulations on your income.

Someone (who I think was from HOOD but it was many months ago so I can\u2019t recall details, but it wasn\u2019t Vlad) said \u2018short squeezes are illegal so trading had to be shut down.\u2019  It was a few weeks later the Vlad came out with an interview giving a more coherent reason (though given timing still might be only a half truth) about the under capitalization related to settlement delays Etc. Also another somewhat sketchy thing, not sure if it\u2019s like this now, but when I signed up for HOOD back in about 2018 I got options level 2 approved with about three clicks. I was like, that\u2019s crazy, because with SCHW and Fidelity I had to fill out applications, show trade experience, prove I had funds, etc. and I am pretty sure they would have given me options level 3-4 had I requested it. That\u2019s frankly derelict in my opinion.",

        "body": "They're a local company for me and they've been making their car/motorcycles for years. People really love them for in-town commuter cars. The problem is the price, of the car, and of the stock. No idea how good an investment it is, but this company is a real company with a long history of building real products, and selling every one they can make.\n\nIt's a three-wheeled car that is licensed as an enclosed-motorcyle in some states, so the fees are lower and regulatory requirements are lower but it doesn't need a motorcycle endorsement.\n\nThe downside is, they've never shown an ability to grow very fast. Their management team is operationally competent but seems rather unable to achieve the growth that the customer interest suggests they could meet. Now that they're public, they won't be able to keep their insular team forever; they're eventually going to have to add some real professionals who can take their growth to the next level. This is a very promising long-term investment, but don't expect to see it pop again in the short or medium term. If you bought it on the prior meme-interest you might wait a lot of years to see those prices again. But they are absolutely a solid little company.\n\nThe fundamental analysis on Fidelity (by S&amp;P) gives their financial health a \"0/100\" oddly, but the balance sheet shows a lot of cash and very little debt, which is consistent with the local reporting, so I suspect that 0 is an error where they just didn't finish the analysis.",

Small periods of sideways movement or short term dips are fine, but sustained downward movements, or big moves down with a new resistance level that is made out of titanium steel is a disaster for a wheel.\n\nAs already noted in another reply, SPY isn't ideal for Wheels for pretty much the reason you already said: since SPY is well diversified, on average SPY is less risky and less risk means less reward. The risk premium on SPY is therefore relatively low.\n\nUsually the best Wheel stocks are dividend paying blue chips, like AAPL, MSFT, JNJ, BLK, XOP, etc. Most people can't afford to wheel those stocks, though, so you need to find lower cost stocks that still have solid growth potential in the short term. Not meme stocks, that's a volatility play. You want steady and predictable, not boom or bust.",

Also, Microsoft nor other PC vendors (except for Samsung maybe) are not building their own ARM processors at the moment. Qualcomm is the only player right now and they didn't have great offerings lately, particularly for WoA. AMD is rumored to join Samsung but only for mRDNA 2 GPUs, not CPUs which would be built by Samsung, and their mobile CPUs pale compared to Qualcomm.",

Buying the stock at it's price right now, (around 8 bucks), seems like a screaming steal. You can be conservative with it, and just ride it from $8 to $12. The only real problem is that I do think we're headed for a major correction which is going to see huge megacaps like AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA all down 20 to 25 percent off their all time highs, and what does that mean for a tiny company like HYLN? Could HYLN drop all the way to say 6 bucks a share if the entire market tanks?\n\nThat's really my only hesitation in loading the boat on HYLN. I will say this though, if the market does indeed tank, and HYLN drops to $6, it will be time to buy as many shares as I possibly can stomach.
