Okta's products are significantly better, but Microsoft is bundling theirs into existing license agreements.\n\nSailpoint is likely the big play for security identity in the near future, with their focus more on the governance aspects.  Microsoft will eventually bundle them out as well, but not for a few years at least.\n\nPANW has acquired some good cloud-based security solutions.  It really depends on how well they integrate, which today is not at all.  They do have a SASE solution, which is likely to be a big wave in \"cloud security\" over the next few years.\n\nI think CRWD is basically Carbon Black of a few years ago.  Endpoint solutions come and go all the time in the security industry.\n\nHonestly, I think maybe the best security stock is Fortinet, but that's not really a cloud play specifically.",

        "body": "I work in Cyber and these guys are not the key players anymore.  The core areas that FEYE focuses (Threat Detection, Threat Intel and Incident Response) is highly dependent on talented people.  In the Cyber-biz , the most talented players usually end up at the best companies (i.e., sexy pre-IPO companies, and public companies that are executing well and rising stock price) and when a company's stock spends an extended amount of time bouncing between $10-$15 (like FEYE), the talent departs for places where they will make more money.  There are exceptions of course, but this is generally true in tech and cyber even more so.  Talent drain creates a death-spiral from which recovery is difficult and rare.\n\nSure they might get bought for their installed base which would pop the stock, but failing that, there is no catalyst for this company to benefit from the current situation.\n\nThe hot public companies (PFPT, PANW, FTNT,CRWD) will stay hot until they are not cool any more.  For now those are the cool ones.",
