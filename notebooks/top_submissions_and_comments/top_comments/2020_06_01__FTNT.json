And as that Chinese electric car company grew and took 1/3 of the 1 billion person Chinese market, my ETF kept buying more on the way up.\"\n\nAlthough in that same vein, getting ahead of the tech curve might be one of the few ways for someone outside of the professional investor/institutional world to realistically get ahead. The trick is having the fortitude to hold for 1-2 decades. The financial crisis in '08 blew me out of so many hilariously good positions, like SBAC because the iPhone was just invented and 3G means more cell phone towers... It's not always rocket science. Anyone with some specialized insight into the future, whatever it may be, should consider putting a small well thought out speculative position on and leave it be. Small enough to not hurt if it goes nowhere, but big enough to care enough to check up and manage every few months.\n\nWow, just looked up an email from over 10 years ago. These names are probably in the mainstream investing language now, but wow... 10-100x if they were held. And it wasn't complex quant investing or anything, just looking ahead, positioning, and waiting.\n\nQuotes from the email circa 10 years ago: \"NVDA... They are also making a leap into scientific computing, where there's a lot of money to be made. They're the first major player to enter that arena to fight Intel and AMD in a long time, and their architecture is much more suited to scientific computing than the traditional CPUs that currently rule the top 100 supercomputer list. I think I'll see how that works out before selling NVDA\"\n\n\"I might want to put some money in AMD as well. They're here to stay and may still be undervalued...\"\n\n\"Universal Display Corp and LG Display (PANL/LPL) are also the leaders and partners in OLED screen development, which is bound to catch on eventually. Lower power use and much better image quality mean that it's just a matter of time before more devices adopt this new display technology and it becomes a new standard. I actually expect Apple to eventually partner up with LG (I think LG is their main LCD supplier) and use and use an OLED display on either a new product or a new Iphone version, which will kick OLED production into overdrive.\"\n\nFood for thought... MicroLED is likely going to grow 1000x over the coming decades. AR and LIDAR sensors for AR will probably not just be used for face unlock and will get some killer apps, the next Snapchat or TikTok might be AR based. Self-Driving is going to be powered by thousands of companies, not just NVIDIA and Waymo. Quantum computing? AI providers in the military contracting space? Clean cargo ship tech to get in front of green regulations? It's endless, and so many people know about these little niches of information that very few others do. Even mundane spaces see world changing innovation every day. Getting in front of a curve is inherently speculative but it is also entertaining, educational to follow through development, and can be extremely profitable.\n\nThat's my appeal for pulling a few pennies out of the ETF pile and doing some a little different, especially if you have a \"wheelhouse\" that you know a little bit more about.",

And though it's taking steps to reduce its reliance, their HDD/SDD sales currently account for over half of its revenue. Many of their SSD customers also happen to be their competitors, who are actively developing their own storage controllers. \n\nMRVL faces stiff competition in the networking and SSD hardware sectors, including such heavy hitters as Western Digital, Toshiba, Broadcom, and Intel. Though it recently (2018) acquired Cavium which extends its reach in the networking hardware market.\n\nManagement faced its share of controversy prior to 2016. It has since been replaced, however, and its acquisition of Cavium seems to indicate they're taking positive steps to gain strategic advantages, primarily in the networking market. \n\nI personally wouldn't consider them the \"next Apple stock\". They have a very long uphill battle to establish a secure market foothold, let alone establish market dominance. They don't have much diversity either, so any downturns that affect their product lines will hit them particularly hard. \n\nThey do seem to be poised for long term growth, but with a notable level of uncertainty.",

So if people can't find much besides a \"short the shit out of this company\" report, it might be more important for management to attempt to keep the stock afloat, whether it's in their own self interest or not.\n\nIf you try to short Intel it's a bit of a different story considering there are 40 analysts covering it and an ungodly amount of brand recognition. If one analyst comes out with a short and 39 say Intel is fine, it's unlikely the short piece actually does anything. But if you have three analysts covering you, which is very common for small-cap companies, one short piece can actually fuck your shit up. \n\nAlso since companies often use their equity as collateral for a loan, the higher stock price could afford more reasonable loan terms, which could help the company's actual business.",

        "body": "&gt;This is a cool chart, definitely not arguing against that. But it does seem to be a bit misleading because now that most places allow fractional shares to be traded there is no longer the incentive for companies to 'forward split' their stock (like if stock is $200 per share but they prefer $50 per share they would do a 1 to 4 split so a person holding 5 shares before the split now has 20 shares but they are still worth the same amount of money total). This was important to do when people had to buy full shares and they wanted the average person to be able to afford a single share but now that we can buy 0.00001 of a share this really no longer matters.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I would say that that is what the chart is really showing, For instance, Intel and Bank of America are on the same column (Market cap) approximately but Intels PPS is much higher than BoA, I would think initially that this is because BoA is much older than Intel and therefore took part in stock splitting for a lot longer than Intel did. I am sure there is more useful info that someone with a degree in finance or more experience than me with trading stocks could get out of this than what I pointed out but it is definitely something that the chart shows.",

Their website and app allow them to sell directly to consumers. Nike is one of the best brands in the world. People are willing to pay a premium for their products. \n\nBABA (Alibaba) - 20%\n\nJust bought this yesterday. This company is a massive growth and profit engine. Sales grew 46% per year on average over 5 years. EPS grew average 42% past 5 years. Profit margin 29%. I used to drop ship from Alibaba to Amazon and was amazed by this company. It's basically the world supplier. \n\nULTA (Ulta Beauty) - 18% \n\nUlta is one of the few retailers that Amazon won't destroy. Women like to try on makeup before they buy it. Ulta is a first stop for women when buying every day makeup. Their revenue and EPS growth have been steady and solid. \n\nDIS (Disney) - 18%\n\nDisney+ has been a huge success and could catch up with Netflix. Disney owns so much great content and they're making it exclusive on Disney+.\n\nATVI (Activision) - 15%\n\nCOD Warzone has been a great hit. Several coworkers have been talking about it. I think investors are over estimating how much Q1 earnings were positively impacted by coronavirus. I think future earnings will be higher than expected because of Warzone. \n\nINTL (Intel) - 4% \n\nIntel may have a bad reputation with PC chips, but half their revenue comes from data centers. Their data center group grew 43% YOY. Cloud computing is the future. It gives any crappy computer access to super computer processing. Data centers are a highly profitable business. Intel has a 30% profit margin. With a p/e of 12, Intel is highly under valued.  I'm adding more to this one.",

And as that Chinese electric car company grew and took 1/3 of the 1 billion person Chinese market, my ETF kept buying more on the way up.\"\n\nAlthough in that same vein, getting ahead of the tech curve might be one of the few ways for someone outside of the professional investor/institutional world to realistically get ahead. The trick is having the fortitude to hold for 1-2 decades. The financial crisis in '08 blew me out of so many hilariously good positions, like SBAC because the iPhone was just invented and 3G means more cell phone towers... It's not always rocket science. Anyone with some specialized insight into the future, whatever it may be, should consider putting a small well thought out speculative position on and leave it be. Small enough to not hurt if it goes nowhere, but big enough to care enough to check up and manage every few months.\n\nWow, just looked up an email from over 10 years ago. These names are probably in the mainstream investing language now, but wow... 10-100x if they were held. And it wasn't complex quant investing or anything, just looking ahead, positioning, and waiting.\n\nQuotes from the email circa 10 years ago: \"NVDA... They are also making a leap into scientific computing, where there's a lot of money to be made. They're the first major player to enter that arena to fight Intel and AMD in a long time, and their architecture is much more suited to scientific computing than the traditional CPUs that currently rule the top 100 supercomputer list. I think I'll see how that works out before selling NVDA\"\n\n\"I might want to put some money in AMD as well. They're here to stay and may still be undervalued...\"\n\n\"Universal Display Corp and LG Display (PANL/LPL) are also the leaders and partners in OLED screen development, which is bound to catch on eventually. Lower power use and much better image quality mean that it's just a matter of time before more devices adopt this new display technology and it becomes a new standard. I actually expect Apple to eventually partner up with LG (I think LG is their main LCD supplier) and use and use an OLED display on either a new product or a new Iphone version, which will kick OLED production into overdrive.\"\n\nFood for thought... MicroLED is likely going to grow 1000x over the coming decades. AR and LIDAR sensors for AR will probably not just be used for face unlock and will get some killer apps, the next Snapchat or TikTok might be AR based. Self-Driving is going to be powered by thousands of companies, not just NVIDIA and Waymo. Quantum computing? AI providers in the military contracting space? Clean cargo ship tech to get in front of green regulations? It's endless, and so many people know about these little niches of information that very few others do. Even mundane spaces see world changing innovation every day. Getting in front of a curve is inherently speculative but it is also entertaining, educational to follow through development, and can be extremely profitable.\n\nThat's my appeal for pulling a few pennies out of the ETF pile and doing some a little different, especially if you have a \"wheelhouse\" that you know a little bit more about.",

If one analyst comes out with a short and 39 say Intel is fine, it's unlikely the short piece actually does anything. But if you have three analysts covering you, which is very common for small-cap companies, one short piece can actually fuck your shit up. \n\nAlso since companies often use their equity as collateral for a loan, the higher stock price could afford more reasonable loan terms, which could help the company's actual business.",

I'd anticipate we'll see Intel come roaring back starting in 2021.\n\nJim coordinates chip makers into a well oiled machine. \n\nHopefully AMD's architecture and practices that Jim left in place have legs to keep up with whatever Intel develops.",
