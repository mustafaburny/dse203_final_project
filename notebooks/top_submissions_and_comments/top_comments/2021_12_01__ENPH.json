You won't know how you'll feel until it happens, and you won't be in the right frame of mind to make decisions after it has. This could very easily turn into a trade where you lose 100%. Pick a point, say 50% or whatever you're comfortable with so you can live to die another day.\n\n-Determine where you're going to take profits. This can go the other way too. You wake up to check on your option and it's up 100% just a couple weeks after opening the position. You're once again in a position where you aren't able to make unbiased decisions, and it can just as well go to zero still. These ones are the most demoralizing.\n\nWrite both your stop loss and take-profit point down on a physical piece of paper. It's more effective when it's staring you in the face. Good luck.",

Also loaded on what was a speculative position last year with higher conviction now - bought quite a few CRSP at what I believe to be the bottom at the 78 range - currently avg at 102+-.{Not even mentioning my stupid PLTR,BB position - gambles going wrong atm, believing in the hype and the reason I bought hasnt changed still hence why i havent sold}\r  \n\r  \nAlthough I have sizeable losses here these positions have elevated my positions amazingly.\r  \n\r  \nHolding a sizeable position with xxx% returns on AMD and NIO and very bullish on SE - recently added to my position at 280\r  \n\r  \nbought into the AMC hype with a 14 avg and sold of 80% at around the 60 mark\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSquare shouldve been scalped and rebought 205-280 range and back is ridiculous but oh well\r  \n\r  \nsold JD into strenght to buy into my weaker positions - had a big position before. still bullish but seeing more upside elsewhere atm.\r  \n\r  \nI dont have any us mega caps- I know winners stay winners usually but I am looking for hopefully bigger returns albeith I run risk of big losses, clearly, as well - such as sizeble position in a clinical trial biotech AGTC - currently at a big loss aswell but that was expected. Lets see what happens here. stock at all time lows.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nfor example although im sitting at a 10avg with my SKLZ position the downside is limited here imo, and potential huge hence why I have been adding to my position lately a lot bellow 10\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI do recommend people look into CPNG and let me know their thoughts. I am torn between adding to this position or keeping it small.",

Also loaded on what was a speculative position last year with higher conviction now - bought quite a few CRSP at what I believe to be the bottom at the 78 range - currently avg at 102+-.{Not even mentioning my stupid PLTR,BB position - gambles going wrong atm, believing in the hype and the reason I bought hasnt changed still hence why i havent sold}\r  \n\r  \nAlthough I have sizeable losses here these positions have elevated my positions amazingly.\r  \n\r  \nHolding a sizeable position with xxx% returns on AMD and NIO and very bullish on SE - recently added to my position at 280\r  \n\r  \nbought into the AMC hype with a 14 avg and sold of 80% at around the 60 mark\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSquare shouldve been scalped and rebought 205-280 range and back is ridiculous but oh well\r  \n\r  \nsold JD into strenght to buy into my weaker positions - had a big position before. still bullish but seeing more upside elsewhere atm.\r  \n\r  \nI dont have any us mega caps- I know winners stay winners usually but I am looking for hopefully bigger returns albeith I run risk of big losses, clearly, as well - such as sizeble position in a clinical trial biotech AGTC - currently at a big loss aswell but that was expected. Lets see what happens here. stock at all time lows.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nfor example although im sitting at a 10avg with my SKLZ position the downside is limited here imo, and potential huge hence why I have been adding to my position lately a lot bellow 10\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI do recommend people look into CPNG and let me know their thoughts. I am torn between adding to this position or keeping it small.",

Now that companies are doing better, getting strong revenues... it doesn't really matter if the market does a hard correction. It isn't needed for there to have been a \"mistake.\" They communicate what is necessary to try to keep people calm, until the time comes for a change, and then the change is made. There is nothing in \"promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\" about stonks always going up. If they had tapered a year ago, as you seem to be suggesting, before employment had recovered then companies might not have done the same amount of hiring. That was the goal all along, and they've been saying that all along. If you've been listening to them. A lot of people have been responding with continuous cynicism, instead of listening, and those people are less prepared to rotate their investments on time.\n\nIt is up to each of us, as traders and investors, to be prepared for things like this, and to make sane choices.",

I personally contribute only to Roth because company matches to Roth 401k are considered traditional so if you have a Roth 401k you're already diversified.

That's actually what Comcast is legally feuding with them now about, they're saying that Disney is sandbagging with slow expansion of Hulu in foreign markets so they won't have to pay Comcast as much.

        "body": "Hey everyone:\n\nI currently have a large portion of my portfolio in TDB627. Over the last few years, I have been slowly selling this off to buy individual stocks. I would like to sell my units in this to buy  individual stocks and ETFs. My time horizon is 29 years.\n\nMy investing strategy is to buy and DRIP stocks/ETFs/etc that pay consistently growing dividends and also provide good long-term total returns (10% per year or better). I am also trying to diversify by having equal weighting in every sector.\n\nThe diversifying part is where I am having trouble. Right now, the sectors I don't have exposure to are: Energy, Consumer Discretionary, Basic Materials, and Healthcare. I have yet to find an individual company in these sectors that I like enough to buy stock in. I have found energy to be a particularly tricky sector.\n\nIs there an ETF that has equal-sector weighting, and has performed well over the long-term? Or would I be better served by buying an S&amp;P 500 or TSX60 ETF?\n\nThanks!",

They provided loans for various things to do with supply chain management.\n\nSteel Magnate Sanjeev Gupta was taking the loans from Greensill then aggressively acquiring companies and assets into his \u201cempire\u201d then immediately using those assets to acquire further loans from Greensill at values inflated wayyy above actual book value.\n\nIn effect he was buying companies, getting control of their assets, immediately securing loans against the assets and then using those loans to buy further companies / assets. etc. \n\nIt\u2019s funny because Gupta is still going but Greensill collapsed because the bigger banks it was using for its own finance decided it was being too risky and froze its accounts leading to its collapse.  \n\nGupta kinda did what you\u2019re asking about but it\u2019s all pretty dodgy and it appears as though he has gotten away with it, at least for now.",
