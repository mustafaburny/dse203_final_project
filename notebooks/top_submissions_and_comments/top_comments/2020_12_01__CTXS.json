Shopify has a smaller Global TAM and tons of cutthroat competitors.\n\nUpwork has a handful of competitors and in recent months they've reclaimed the mantle of software innovation - the examples top of mind are their cloning of Fiverr's structured marketplace, and their partnerships with Zoom and Citrix.\n\nI recently onboarded to Upwork for yet another company. This flow had multiple critical improvements compared to the experience I had 6 and 18 months prior. \n\nTheir web application is really getting better. I can see the innovation. Hayden Brown (their new CEO, spent a decade at Microsoft) is clearly focused on software excellence and this will be the global SaaS labor company.",

The word of the day for you fucking retards is GUIDANCE.  Chen needs to tell us what the revenue opportunity is with the Amazon partnership (aka IVY) HINT: IT IS HUUUUGE but also WHEN.  When will they make their first IVY dollar. If its in 2021, or even early 2022 watch your fucking butts boys rocket fuel for the quickest double this side of NIO.  \n\nMeanwhile on top of IVY, BB also has 1. a very decent cybersecurity platform  that contracts with major banks and government entities 2. a licensing portfolio that bring in hundreds of mill a year and 3. pending infringement lawsuits against FB and SNAP that if successful will result in a multi billion dollar award.  Everyone also likes their new president of sales from Citrix who is apparently starting to pull in real wins.   \n\nOP is correct, this stock should already be 30bill but boomers feel burnt and most people are still so fucking stupid they don't realize that BB exited the phone biz a few years ago (they license the phone to third parties).  Amazon is taking this partnership very seriously and it will soon be grabbing everyone's attention in a big way.  Open question is why Amazon or another company doesn't see the writing on the wall and buy BB for relatively cheap right now.  30B would get the job done.  Less than that and I don't think BB would do it.  I could go on but whatever, GLTA make money.",

        "body": "The key to hitting high dividend numbers long term is to invest in companies with dividends that will grow in market cap, and also grow their dividends.\n\nSo for example, if I bought Starbucks today at $98.82, and I look at the current yield (1.66%) I can expect to make about $1.70 per share via dividends next year.\n\nHowever, if I bought Starbucks in January of 2016 at $55 dollars a share and I still have the stock now, I can expect to make that same $1.70 next year, but at the much higher effective yield of 3.1% (1.70/55)\n\nSame concept with Apple: if I buy Apple today, my effective dividends yield for next year will be ~.7%, but if I bought Apple exactly 5 years ago, my effective yield next year would be 2.8%\n\n\nHowever if I invested in AT&amp;T five years ago, my effective dividend yield would actually be *lower* than it would be if I invested now, because even though their dividend yield is huge (7.17%), the company\u2019s value has down down 15%.\n\n\nSo basically if you are trying to retire in a decade or two, buy Microsoft not Iron Mountain.",

Also moving in to health care\n2. Microsoft - Dominant in the cloud. Sound leadership and growth under Nadella.\n3. Alphabet - Advertising revenue. The leader in AI, which I expect will be further monetized in the next 10 years\n4. Alibaba - Chinese Amazon. Invested heavily in EVs\n5. Apple - Apple products not going away. Huge potential to gain market share across the globe\n6. Visa/Mastercard - FinTech will be huge. Could even see them acquiring PayPal/Square\n7. Tesla - If this turns out to be true it won't be because of the cars\n8. Johnson &amp; Johnson\n9. Walmart \n10. NVIDIA",

        "body": "If you\u2019re looking for super long term growth, the best bet is usually blue chips (I prefer KO, PEP, JNJ, MSFT, etc.) They will fluctuate up and down (so don\u2019t fret about green days vs red days) but over a period of 10-20 years they should grow in terms of decent value. For reference I\u2019ve held a $300 investment in KO for 23 years, and it\u2019s now valued over $3000 (was $3600 pre-pandemic). With blue chip stocks, the usual idea is to reinvest your dividends automatically. That\u2019s how you get more shares and over time bigger dividends. When I started with like 12-14 shares, I\u2019d get a $3 check maybe, but using the reinvestment option (eventually) without any additional self-purchasing of shares I was up to 61 shares because of the dividend reinvestment. And now I receive a dividend on 61 shares instead of 12, so obviously now much more than $3 per quarter.\n\nSpread out among a few good stable blue chips, ones that have weathered crises like (recessions and viruses). You also might be interested in doing ETF\u2019s, they cover sectors mainly, and they\u2019re usually more stable since they cover multiple stocks - however with lower risk comes less return usually. An ETF you\u2019re sort of playing by an average of whatever is in that portfolio.\n\nJust like with a 401k, typically the sooner you start, the better, since you\u2019re looking for that exponential growth with dividend payouts.\n\nBest of luck!",

By the next day the stock had recovered and I missed my window to close thanks to my broker fucking me when I needed to sell, which seems to be disturbingly common.\n\nI remember calling them and telling them I wanted a broker, not a babysitter. The dude sounded completely annoyed like he was my dad and doing me a favor. He wasn't wrong in hindsight. I was like a chimp with a machine gun back then. I'm better now. But damn...let the monkey shoot his load if he wants.\n\nFidelity isn't a bad broker. But they're like strict parents. They're not quick to trust or forgiving if you throw a party and their risk department flags you as a retard. TD is like your friend's cool parents who don't really give a fuck. And Robinhood is the skeevy guy outside the liquor store selling fake IDs. That guy will hook you up with whatever you want. He's cool, but not really a friend.
