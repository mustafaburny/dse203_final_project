Nvidia and ARM are not Chinese companies. Why do they need approval from Chinese regulators?\n\nMa: According to the Ministry of Commerce\u2019s \"Guiding Opinions on the Declaration of Concentration of Undertakings\", as long as the aggregate annual turnover of undertakings in the world exceeds RMB 10 billion, and the turnover of at least two undertakings in China exceeds RMB 400 million in the previous year Renminbi, then it should be reported to the Ministry of Commerce of China for anti-monopoly review. Among them, 'acquisition' is a typical model of concentration of operators, while the global revenue and scale of business in China of NVIDIA and ARM far exceed the reporting standards and are automatically included in supervision. Therefore, it must pass the review of the Chinese anti-monopoly agency.\n\nIn addition, China\u2019s \u201cAnti-Monopoly Law\u201d clearly stipulates that the \u201cAnti-Monopoly Law\u201d shall apply to cases where monopolistic activities outside the People\u2019s Republic of China have an effect on the elimination or restriction of domestic market competition. Although this transaction between Nvidia and ARM is an overseas merger and acquisition, this transaction may have exclusion and restrictions on the Chinese domestic market. For example, this transaction may adversely affect competition in the domestic chip market.\n\nNothing is guaranteed...\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-nxp-semicondtrs-m-a-qualcomm-idUSKBN1KF193\n\nHere is China blocking QCOM's acquisition recently.",

By the fall, I was looking at huge capital gains and I decided to just hold out until the new year to sell that way I could delay paying the capital gains tax by another year.\n\nSo, I sold out of my position the first week of January.

In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",

        "body": "Nokia has some great upside, in my view.   I've been in since I saw it at $4 last year, thinking it is good to just hold in case it is a big 5G winner.\n\nHuawei is one of the big 5G equipment makers out there but they are [restricted](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-47041341) in parts of Europe and also in the US.  The restrictions in the US do expire this year, so if the new administration extends them, the news should cause all 5G stocks to go up just on that decision.\n\nThere is also the idea that once they get highly profitable again, they will reinstate the dividend which will likely cause the stock price to get a nice boost.  Their current P/E ratio is 46 so they really need to generate a ton of profits to get that down, but they have the potential.\n\nNokia also owns a lot of patents, but so do many others, and upholding them or enforcing them is probably very costly; it is not clear if the ones they hold are worth more than what everyone else has (Huawei, Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, ZTE, Ericsson, etc.)",

        "body": "&gt; Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. \n\n\nWhy? What math? 2020 is only year revenue went up. \n\n\n&gt; Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity.\n\n\nWhat rumors. There was the EV platform rumors but that\u2019s all. EV have sensors so sure. Automation as in self driving? Sure but QNX IVY isn\u2019t about self driving and would be very late to the game if it was. So industrial automation? \n\n\nCyber security with Cylance? It made $50m for them and cost $1.4b. \n\n\n&gt;FB suit\n\n\nHow much? \n\n\n&gt; SpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.\n\n\nSources. Links. Spacex - for what ? QNX rocket?  Zoom? For what? Data integrity when it already has a China backdoor? Qualcomm? For what ? \n\n\nBB has worked with some gov historically but specifically on what? \n\n\nSony partnership. Cool. Sony doesn\u2019t make cars. They made 1 and said they weren\u2019t selling it. BB also gets $5 a car fee. \n\n\n&gt; This all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.\n\nNobody wants to work there. They have lots of job postings for that reason. Would you rather work at BB and get paid less $ and get worthless options or work at GOOG and get valuable options and paid more $? \n\n\nThe way I see it is it potentially was overlooked and revenue is growing. That\u2019s the only possibility for it\u2019s up value to be real. \n\n\nStocks are overlooked all the time. \n\n\nMaybe no profit last 4yr because reinvesting and research expenses etc. and accounting write downs (non cash). But cash flow from ops is also negative I think, or not great. \n\n\nEV or not, car sales are probably not spiking any time soon so nothing changed on the sales front for BB IVY, unless these new deals are guaranteed revenue. We\u2019d have to know their details. \n\n\nTech price to sales is 5-10x. MSFT is at 10 P/S. Is BB on par with MSFT? \n\nBB was at 3-4 P/S and now is at 7.5 P/S which is more reasonable for them. (TTM - trailing 12mo) (https://ycharts.com/companies/BB/ps_ratio)\n\n\nP/S doesn\u2019t factor in growth of the future. If sales growth then the ratio will go down unless the stock goes down.\n\n\n If we can confirm based on the items above that BB sales will increase (which, without the details to confirm it I would argue yes; how much, unknown) then there is room for BB price to increase. \n\n\nBB price is fair to increase a bit from its current price as well to perhaps 8.50x P/S. That would put the stock at $14.11. \n\n\nThrow in some growth there and in a year it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to see **$18.43 share price. **\n\n\nAgain this assumes the initial above points are all vetted and the revenue is strong.",

I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns. I've never seen such an iron conviction before. Folks of today are not afraid of drawdowns or volatility.

The EV market is growing and is the future. Or do some research and buy a winning EV battery company. I hold a few positions including XL fleet Corp who has a great niche product to fill the EV market gap. I like XL and hold over 1000 shares and plan on holding 3-5 years for some good gains, especially now green energy biden is in the WH.

It bothered me that this stock has never been hardly over $60 in its whole life, and I've been using Nokia phones since they first came out. How does a phone company that was once number one in the world never have more than a $60 value in the market? Answer: the iPhone, and when it debuted in 2007, it sent 90% of NOK's value down the toilet. Virtually destroyed the company. What can it do now? What brings it back from the dead? \n\n5G. It's the new mania and it's going to take a lot of companies to the top again. Nokia is the leader of 5G technology thanks to their association with Qualcomm (the undisputed masters of 5G right now), and usually...well, in most cases, the one leading the group is always ahead. AT&amp;T had to delay their 5G slightly when it was ready to go in June 2020 (thanks, COVID =P) and they cover only about 17k cities and towns, (and you just know for them to say it like that, it's hardly a huge slice of the market and they know it \\^\\^) so guess who's lagging behind already? Meanwhile, NOK keeps gobbling up contracts around the world as of 2020, and there's already a whole host of positive news in this month alone.\n\nNOK is a great play, and don't be too surprised to see it get to $60 again.

I remember one day QCOM went up by more than 100 points. I made more on QCOM that day than my annual salary. By the fall, I was looking at huge capital gains and I decided to just hold out until the new year to sell that way I could delay paying the capital gains tax by another year.\n\nSo, I sold out of my position the first week of January.

In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",

Most people outside of finance had never heard about an \"ETF\". We were also seeing 6.5% CD rates in 2000. We didn't have iPhones back then, but my Lexus had a \"car phone\". Enjoyed the ride up in 1999, and saw much of that money erode come 2000. However, since I still had a job, I was able to continue to buy in 2000 when things were going down. Made my first $1M after 2 drawdown periods (1999 and 2008); $150k invested over 12 years (I'd try to put in $1k/month most months, and a bit extra when I could) turned into $1M.\n\nThere's just so much more information and knowledge available now, and the folks of today don't seem to have a problem with holding through drawdowns. I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns. I've never seen such an iron conviction before. Folks of today are not afraid of drawdowns or volatility. Additionally, between all of our corporations, we're pumping in billions of new dollars every single week into the market now.\n\nTimes have changed, and you're kidding yourself if you haven't seen the change.",

This hasn\u2019t mooned yet and it\u2019s due for a run like BTBT. A lot of people don\u2019t know about EBON right now just like they didn\u2019t know about BTBT. It\u2019s going to be huge. A lot of people compare CAN to EBON but CAN has 150mil float (hard to move fast) and they don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline in terms of catalysts like EBON does for q1 2020. CEO is bullish and bitcoin at 28-29k is huge for them.\n\nBloomberg also released an article recently, calling them the next \u201cQualcomm of bitcoin mining hardware\u201d on December 26th. I made 4x my money on BTBT because I knew it was lagging behind mara/riot in terms of market cap to hash power.\n\nMy play now is EBON and I am extremely confident this unknown play is going to be the play for cryptocurrency. A bitcoin mining farm and crypto exchange in the pipeline is HUGE especially when they also are a market leader in terms of computing power for their bitcoin mining hardware (plus the patented exclusive rights to asicBOOST) \n\nBitmain planning to IPO at 50b and EBON has the chance to 4x or beyond just like BTBT. A lot of these plays are unknown and you just need to go in early. Don\u2019t go in the popular stocks that everyones talking about because most of the time, they just fail. We got a great stock here and we\u2019re early. Good luck to all. Bullish. BTC nearing 30k ATH hit 29600 and now around 29100-29200.",

        "body": "Ok, try my best:\n\nx86 and ARM are two different CPU architectures. AMD/Intel are based on x86 architecture.\n\nWithin the chips are CPU cores (hence u see 4-core/6-core/8-core CPUs etc). In (current) x86 architecture, all the cores are the same.\n\nIn ARM they are hybrid cores where some of these cores are power-hungry powerful cores for high-performance and some are lower power cores but more power-efficient. \n\nTraditionally more power = more performance (a simplified view) but there's a diminishing return and also in a battery-powered situation, this doesn't really scale.\n\nThe majority of pc/laptops/electronic devices don't always need to use powerful cores all the time. So when you have a hybrid architecture you can save power and only use the efficient cores when you are doing light tasks and then turn on the high-performance cores when you are doing demanding tasks.\n\nApple has been producing their own chips based on the ARM architecture and with the recent release of M1, they showed that CPUs can be both powerful and also energy-efficient in a mass-produced, everyday machine. This is especially true when you design the software (e.g. the OS) to distribute tasks accordingly to the right hybrid cores in order to improve performance per watt. i.e. optimising the software to take advantage of the chip design.\n\nTaking an assumption that AMD/Intel can not keep up with the pace of innovation that Apple is doing with producing their own chips, and that they will for the near-future stick with the x86 architecture, they will need to do something to mitigate this performance per watt difference between Apple and themselves. \n\nI'm thinking that AMD/Intel will also go down the route of Big.Little design employed by ARM while sticking with the x86 architecture. \n\nIntel I believe, is releasing a new CPU based on this architecture in the coming year. AMD I think is waiting on software to take advantage of this hence my comment on there is a dependant variable on Microsoft if they can optimise Windows for Big-Little Architecture and also ARM.\n\nIf MSFT spends more time on ARM optimisation you might see laptop manufacturers start using ARM chips from companies such as Qualcomm with their Snapdragon chips vs AMD/Intel chips (an example of this would be Microsoft Surface Pro X laptop).\n\nCircling it all back, this might have an effect on the future growth of AMD. How much, positive vs negative, that's for anyone to guess....\n\nHope that helps but also caveat disclaimer; there's a lot of \"if then therefore\" simplified logic in there.",

The new 480 chip might make samsung not even bother. Even apple's modems will likely be the otherside of snapdragon vs A13. Qualcomm will be reaping massive returns in automotive by the time apple has something that's not as shit as the Intel ones they had been using. Qualcomm will still earn $9-18 an iPhone even if Apple is using 100% their own parts. They settled the 4.5bn lawsuit because they didn't want to admit stealing source code from qualcomm and giving it to Intel (and still failed), pretty red flag that they have to resort to that. \n\nBroadcom is definitely worthy of owning for a broad 5G portfolio. QCOM has my heart and is just making so much money. QCOM sets the global standards, owns the relevant patents and is so incredibly positioned for 5G take off it's insane. Most people think of 5G as faster cell service for smartphones when it's not for that at all. Once retail investors understand this, they'll be hoping on qualcomm. \n\nI think we will see significant investment in 5G infrastructure in the coming US infrastructure bill, telcoms and companies like Ericsson rely on that.",

This was a big reason that I felt that RMO was more future-proof. They've stated they can transition their current battery packs from lithium-ion to solid-state in a short period of time. The number of people that haven't been able to differentiate between battery cells and module packaging is really overwhelming.\n\nQS product is solid-state battery cells, which is what stores potential energy from the configuration of a solid electrode and electrolyte, instead of liquid.\n\nRMO product is battery packaging, modules, and applications, which is what takes the battery cell tech, finds solutions for applying it to end-products, and manufactures them for those end-products.\n\nThese two companies are literally two different markets and aren't even competitors.",

At my school, most of the Computer Science students work their ass off to get a job at Google, Facebook, Apple (these three are top preferences), Microsoft, Amazon etc. Most of the Computer Engineering students who are into hardware prefer Nvidia, Apple, Intel (top three preference), AMD, Qualcomm etc. That\u2019s more around Bachelors and Masters students. I continue until PhD (in computer science and engineering), and I can say that most PhD students work on AI and ML as these are hot topics. Google is the absolute top pick for AI/ML job after graduation, and for people into hardware, Nvidia is the absolute top pick. Even students who had papers published in top conference papers have extremely difficult time getting in. And I assure you that the scenario, at least for PhD, is similar across all universities. I know no one in my friend group or among my PhD colleagues who have ever even considered Tesla, even though they consider it as a top innovative company.",
