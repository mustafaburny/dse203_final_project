The market cap of this company is extraordinarily low right now. There probably someone within 5 miles of my location who could straight up own a global movie chain tomorrow for less than half a billion. \n\nLitterally any big dog investor in the movie buisness or elsewhere can save this company with one reasonably large purchase/partnership. \n\nI see people retiring off OTM options on this company. It's not a matter of if. It's when. Timing is key here and it may not happen till 2021. But it will happen. Mark my words!",

I was considering whether to buy in again, here are some notes I wrote down.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCineplex Before Covid\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-75% Box office Marketshare, dominant player in Canada\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Box office revenue/patron growing with premium offerings\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n-Consistant earnings/cashflow growth even though attendance declining, seemed to be recession proof industry\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n-2008 had 63.5 million in attendance, 2009 back to 70 million\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Food service revenue/concession revenue per was patron growing\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Strong marketing and loyalty program, over 10 million members. Hard to replicate useful for cross promotion with other businesses\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Media revenue grew to 196.8 million. Marketing segment was growing\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-AMC theatres contract Cineplex to manage and enhance digital marketing/signage 630 locations\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Alternative offerings, playdium, rec room, top golf to diversify\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-High dividend yield to wait. Very cash generative business\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCineplex after covid\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Social distancing will limit capacity to at least half?, but even then is it enough distancing.\nIf mask mandatory, it will be a very unpleasant experience. Uncomfortable, eyeglasses fogging etc.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Attendance was already declining, now less people will want to go to watch movie\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Even if they go will they be likely to purchase concession and spend as much as before\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Media/Marketing revenue will also be down\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Over 70% revenue from box office and food service which will suffer greatly\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-New box office movies delayed. Cineplex offering cheaper tickets to get people to go\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Debt increasing, dividend will not be coming back, cashflow will have to be used to pay down debt\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Likely be a slow recovery, alternative offerings will also not perform well\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Real risk of bankruptcy, or damaging the balance sheet so much that recovery takes long time. If restructure current shareholders will lose.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Don\u2019t bank on litigation payout to solve problem. Business is burning cash, debt increasing and lease obligations are heavy \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-Raised $275 convertible debt.  To pay revolver and for future working capital.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOverall I wouldn\u2019t buy into Cineplex again at this time, so many other companies to buy at a discount without the likelihood to lose everything, other businesses that are not as affected by covid.",
