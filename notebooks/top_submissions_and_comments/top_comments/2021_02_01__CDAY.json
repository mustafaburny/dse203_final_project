We also intend to focus on prospective target businesses that have unseen potential for revenue growth and/or operating margin expansion with high recurring revenue and cash flow, defensible intellectual property and strong market positions within their industries, such as The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation (\u201cDun &amp; Bradstreet\u201d), Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (\u201cFNF\u201d), Black Knight, Inc. (\u201cBlack Knight\u201d) and Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. (\u201cCeridian\u201d). We believe that a prospective target business will have the potential to benefit from a recovering economy, presenting an opportunity to invest.",

You can quibble about quality and use cases, but you'll find a metastore, some columnar storage, a fast/parallel MPP and maybe a batch engine alongside. If you're sitting there thinking CLDR is \"hadoop\" your information is from about 2012 and needs updating. \n\nAnd *that* is the real problem the company has. Its executive team simply do not understand what it is they sell and do not know how to communicate it to the market. What's a Salesforce? CRM on the cloud. What's a Snowflake? DWH on the cloud. What's a DB? DE/DS on the cloud. Easy, punchy, clear, accessible.\n\nWhat's a Cloudera? Well apparently \"We deliver an enterprise data cloud for any data, anywhere, from the Edge to AI.\"\n\nIf anyone knows wtf that means in today's market then I'd love to know, and I *worked at the company when that slogan was coined*.\n\nDig into the on-boarding experiences and how you're supposed to use this stuff and it just gets worse and worse and worse. They're not a cloud stock yet - they still do 80-90 percent of their business on prem in traditional form factors; this isn't a bad thing (e.g. they do actually turn a profit) but if you tell investors you're all cloudy then don't return cloud numbers then.... duh.\n\nIf and when CLDR decide to clean house and turf out their useless marketing function and hire a few product leaders who aren't just ex-Yahoo rejects out of their depth then they could easily be a force to be reckoned with. Until then they're probably going to spin their wheels praying for IBM to swoop in and buy them out at a price where not everyone is underwater.",

By comparison, the 2001 Microsoft antitrust case had only 20 AGs. \n\nBefore the legal case, my logic for being a Facebook investor was simple: its network effects, even if they were getting weaker over time in their core social media products, were strong enough to let them print money in the near/medium term and they could use that cash to wisely acquire new social media networks to sustain their network effects over the long term. Meanwhile, my attorney girlfriend noted that Facebook might be the single biggest antitrust target for the government compared to the other FAANGs, primarily because of their acquisition strategy. Through into that growing discontent from the general public + politicians on **both** sides of the aisle and Facebook and it's clear Facebook had a big target on its back (which is too bad because - hot take - I actually like grown-up Mark Zuckerberg). The case was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nRe: VR. Also agree with you there. It's like how I feel about Gamestop  justifying a $20B+ market cap: that would only happen if the company did a total 180 and went into e-commerce or downloading games. Sure, it's possible, but unlikely. A coal miner could launch CRM software and wreck SalesForce, but the chances of that happening are exceedingly small. VR is worse than those two examples because it isn't yet clear that VR will be a major industry with big profits for key players; we know e-commerce/software downloading/CRM are all high-demand services.\n\nThat's not to say that there won't be small divisions within large companies that end up being big earnings drivers in the future. It happens. So it's important to not dismiss out-of-hand any currently small division or business just because it's currently small. But as an investor, I'd need a stronger justification (and a fair price) before I'd make an investment in anything based on VR.",

        "body": "Here is a post, that I can't get through due to my lack of karma. Enjoy the small book and your future prospects. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook, my crayon chewing friends. I love you all, but WSB is not always about confirmation bias. The GME MOASS did not occur last week, and it's *easy* to say in retrospect that it didn't happen, but hindsight is 20/20. So if your gut is wrenching, and you're thinking about hitting that sell button to stop the bleeding let's talk about some **expectations** and realistic choices. I'm bullish about GME as a company long term. **I've been following this story since August 2020**, and the Ryan Cohen factor has me bought in. **Without Ryan Cohen, I would have absolutely sold everything at $200**. Also, imma try to keep this short and not write the neo testament cause you fuckers can barley read as it is.\n\nDisclaimer: **THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.** I have literally no idea what I'm talking about and really prefer the green crayons, cause they taste like salty moss covered rocks. I know nothing John Snow.\n\nJust a starter lesson. A B H. Always Be Hedging\n\nDid you buy GME? Did you ride with us from &lt;$100 to $480? Did you sell nothing? Bro, you need to hedge. I personally sold 1/4 of my GME at $190 &amp; $300. Cause it could go the other way. While betting it all on 00 and it hitting is awesome, if you hedge, you still get to buy a couple G&amp;Ts and some coke from the stripper in your lap at the end of night, instead of going back to your hotel room worried about the cost of breakfast tomorrow.\n\nAs Robert Downey Jr once said ...\n\n&gt;\"You went full retard man, never go full retard.\"\n\nGetting out right now, is ok\n\nLook, you can get out right now. It's possible that GME continues it's sell off. We had a huge push in hype from \\~$20 -&gt; \\~$38. This was the Ryan Cohen board seat(s) announcement. Then again -&gt; \\~$60 then again to -&gt; $85 and then the after burners started to kick in. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Likely, the shorts allowed the price to almost 3x in that time, and purposely got out of their most fucked positions. And, they absolutely re-shorted at $300 &amp; $400. Pretty fucking good deal for the shorts. Cause they've made a shit ton off of that trade. I understand #holdtheline and #imnotselling and fuck wall street &amp; the SEC. Especially the SEC. But the goal my apes is to make fucking money. And a key thing most of us did not do while the price hovered around $300 for a couple days was FollowTheFuckingTrend. AKA, once the RH bullshit happened, and momentum got fucked, we could of all gotten out to get back in later. It's a thought know, but if you cut off huge swaths of buying power, a stock is going to fall.\n\nSo if you're down, and you can accept that before it gets better or we **go to fucking Andromeda** your investment may halve, then awesome. You're a true \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd18. But, if this shit has gotten cray for you. Sell, it's ok. No one even has to know. GME could go to $40 or to $30 a share. And then you could buy back in. It's OK to decide you'd rather take a loss and use that capitol for some other trade than take all your cash to burn on the pyre of retardation. But you would get some sw33t WSB karma for doing so.\n\nIf you do choose this route, **read up on the wash sale rule** so you don't fuck your taxes. Again, this is not financial advice, I'm not sure why washing anything has to do with taxes.\n\nThings could pop off cause of good news / whale / long HF\n\nLook, the short data seems fucked. Check out this post\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbxb9i/why\\_i\\_highly\\_doubt\\_some\\_posted\\_s3\\_si\\_numbers\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbxb9i/why_i_highly_doubt_some_posted_s3_si_numbers_and/)\n\nLikely the short interest is still as high as ever. Even though there are millions of us. Not everyone of us is a GME bull. Bears exist on WSB, and bears also visit everyday but don't subscribe. We are but passengers in the night waiting for people with REAL FUCKING MONEY to make this shit move. Portnoy of whatever the fuck that dude's name is, is not real fucking money obviously. So good news could come out. Ryan Cohen could increase his stake. Some firm could provide a ridiculous price target for GME. Things could get popping, but it would have to be HF, whales, trading houses getting in and getting in big.\n\nOfficial short data out from FINRA Feb 9th, 1 days away\n\nThe official report of what the short interest is in GME at the end of Jan comes out this day. This will reveal if the media has been full of bullshit, 99% chance they have been, or not. This could be another catalyst of buying as it'll show you, what you already know. GME is shorted over 100%. But now there are shorts at \\~$300 &amp; $400, Instead of only at \\~$60. Harder to bust, but still bustable. And, busting makes me feel good. (Hopefully someone gets this reference)\n\n[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)\n\nQ4 Earnings Call 2021-03-25, 44 days away\n\nIf you are committed to GME as a business and are looking for that sweet short squeeze cherry, this is a big fucking day. We all expect GME to have their first positive earnings QTR in 7 freaking QTRs. It will be huge if they beat expectations. Everyone made sure to buy from GME before Jan ended, right? I bought $250 bucks worth of games. Can't wait to not find enough time to play any of them. This could have big money pile in, fucking the short. It's the event that all of us autists holding April calls are waiting for sweet tendies. If you're a \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd18, there is no reason to not wait until this event.\n\nGME annual Board meeting 2021-06-11?, 124\u00a0days away\n\n*FYI idk when the fuck this meeting is. last year is was June 12. So I'm assuming 2nd Friday of June for this year.*\n\nStill only in for the short squeeze eh? Well this is the other catalyst. This is the meeting where, perhaps Ryan Cohen may give Sherman \"the pedigree\", \"the spear\", \"the Figure Four Leglock \", \"the Macho Man\" RIP and becomes CEO. This is a huge fucking deal. The other thing that may happen, as they need to shake out 3 board members at this meeting is a share recall. RC and GME insiders, may have all purposely lent their shares to be shorted. This could be a moment where they all tell their brokers they don't want to lend their shares anymore. Then good news happens, etc, snowball squoze.\n\nThe great beyond, unknown # of days away\n\nAt this point the squeeze didn't happen. You've effectively held your shares for \\~35% of a year if you are still \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd18. You have two choices. Sell and put the capital into something you have more conviction in. Or become a long term investor in GME and make it to at least the 1 year mark so you get long term capital gains tax. Again, this is not financial advice, after what happened Jan 6th, I'm not sure I would be long on the capital? What am I talking about? And $GME could be like TSLA. A slow, arduous burn over time. Many things would have to go right over the next 2+ years, but they could \\*shrug\\*\n\nTake this as you will, but realize for those thinking they we're going to 10x in a week's effort ... sometimes it's that easy, sometimes its not. Remember **$CRM** on 2020-08-26? Yah, those people's lotto tickets printed fucking hard as hell. But if everyone knows the game, then it's probably getting late. Unless you are some electric car company that defies all rational valuation.",

That way, you don't get scared when Citron decides to say $PLTR is going to 10, and you don't hold $CHK all the way to delisting.\n\nThe key thing in my trading is keeping track of a stock for a solid month or two before buying in. With some companies, you can't really do that because they're volatile or they simply are too new. But, if you've watched the price long enough, you'll get an intuition on how the stock reacts to good and bad news, and be able to automatically know when's a good time to buy or not. \n\n$CRM for example, I've been watching for a few months now. They had their initial price drop all the way from $280 to the $215-225 range, and after a few weeks of sitting there, I knew that it 1. wouldn't go down any more, and 2. that if I wanted to buy in, then this would probably be a good time to do so. If it went down to $200, then it would've dropped $80 from their peak and I'd only have lost $15-25 per. share - those odds seem pretty good because dropping $80 in total isn't likely, and even if it went even lower, then I wouldn't be losing all that much. Realistically, the company will recover: I have good feelings about their software platforms and I've done a good amount of research on the company to know that they won't be leaving any time soon. So with all that information: 1. cut loss at $200, or even lower if you're feeling risky; 2. buy-in from $215-225 (and there will be multiple opportunities to buy because their next catalyst will be Feb. 25 - not sure on the outlook of their Slack acquisition yet, so I'll need to check if it's still looking good); 3. low price target: 250, medium: 265, high: 280, really high: 315. \n\nBut, it's also easy to be very optimistic about companies and stocks right now given our market. I've only started since last year, but this is the way that's worked for me. Even if I'm totally wrong in my analysis, I think it's a general rule to *really* identify what you're going to be stopping at if it goes up or down, because then you won't be subject to your emotions telling you to get out when the going's good.",
