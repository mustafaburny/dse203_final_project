Especially in a low interest rate environment, there's a reason why most of the bank stocks were and are still lousy investments ever since 2008. NIM is everything in the lending business. I'd stay away any business whose outlook prospers on a change in interest rate and the housing economy, because those factors are outside of the company's control.\n\nSeriously, some of you have the weirdest DDs that maybe you're just thinking too hard. If you want to go with high growth, high risk company in finance, you have a better chance to double, triple, maybe even 5x your money with digital payment companies like Paypal and Square that sit well with Millennial &amp; Gen Z. If you want to invest in stable growing financial company with lower risk, Visa and Mastercard are the choices in the digital era.",

Consider making some placements spread out to different sectors, finacial should be in there for example. I have been taking position in BAC for banking\nAnd either Visa or Paypal for another pairing with BAC. \nBAC has been really cleaning up thier books and setting up for long term sucess precovid, post covid, you have buffet giving it attention amd some $. If you watch the headline you can see Buffet is shifting his portfolio. I dont always like his picks honestly. 50/50 at best but BAC will be a great risk to reward ratio on placing money in a longer term asset(aka Buffets M.O.) specifically in the financial sector. Paypal could deflate most but could also inflate in price most in my opinion. \n\nConsumer. Get one at least. Every suggests the \"this\" version of amazon. Stick with Amazon. Jeff Bezos isnt running those knock of Amazons. Pick Amazon if you like amazon. In lomg term portfolio management you need to care about your companies leadership. Im day trading you dont even need to care about what ticker tag you are trading. \nAmazon. Nuff said. \n\nI would take a 50/50 split of AMD, and Nvidia right now to cover semiconductors. \n(Your already heavy tech or id do full positions in both)\n\nIf you do a consumer defense stock, id do walmart. They are pishing thier ecommerce and puttting thier leadership equity into that direction. I think they see Amazon and know what needs to happen to survive if a new commerce age comes. Great Amazon pairing to, as if one drops the other may get an increase due to thier respective market share. \n\nIf you are not going to manage yoyr portfolio a few times a week I wouldnt get any more in depth than that. \n\nSplit picks into secotrs and you account will take sharp downswing less often. More important to keep your money than to make alot. If you cannot keep what you make you will only borrow it mistakenly thinking you had ownership.",

        "body": "Looking at market cap, PayPal is indeed bigger than Square. However, I like to search out for the up and comers that could supplant the firmly established big boys and make some noise. PayPal has been around longer and is integrated into the bigger retail companies (in-store and online). You responded to my post that kind of laid out what services Square offers its customers (mainly small and medium sized businesses.) They provide an all-in-one ecosystem that powers the day to day operations of a business; this includes payroll, financing, inventory and point of sales. PayPal does not offer (all) these services. \n\nThink of it like this. If you want to open up a small business, would you rather hire one company that can handle all major aspects of your business? Or would you rather go through the painstaking process of finding separate vendors for each major business operation (i.e.): \n\n   1. Use QuickBooks for accounting/payroll \n   2. Use Excel or some other software for inventory management\n   3. Apply for a loan at a local/regional bank\n   4. Use a normal cash register\n\nWith Square, you can literally do all of this with one service. https://squareup.com/us/en \n\nVenmo is indeed big, but CashApp is bigger. Both are money makers and both can monetize on their users' financial data. CashApp also has cryptocurrency integration which Venmo does not. Both companies win here. \n\nForgot to mention, but SQ also acquired Wix (a Shopify rival), giving them a potential play for online payment integration (PayPal's monopolistic domain.) \n\nIn this digital age, whoever can collect the most data wins. I believe SQ is better positioned for that. \n\nBuy LEAPs, shares or further out options and you'll be raking in $$",

It has been an interesting ride for sure, and I made some money, which was great.\n\nThe thing about Tesla is, I\u2019ve grown to really dislike Elon Musk, and the \"cult of musk\". It doesn\u2019t matter how many times I hear him speak, he doesn\u2019t sound like he is intelligent to me. His speech pattern, the things that come out of his mouth....it sounds like faux intelligence, and scripted. Which makes sense, he is not a scientist, an inventor of anything noteworthy...he grew up wealthy, and was good at financing products and calling himself a co-founder(PayPal). \n\nOn top of that, there is something really dishonest about trying to manipulate the market via social media and \u201chype tweets\u201d. \n\nThe neurolink presentation was a complete underwhelming flop. A pig with a chip in its brain that can listen to iTunes? \n\nLet\u2019s build a colony on Mars you say? Tunnels under L.A. you say? 1 million \u201crobotaxis\u201d with no jurisdiction permission approval, and no working proto-type.\n\nThis is the reason Tesla was banned from entering the S&amp;P 500, and a company that makes hats and silly buttons/shirts (Etsy) was included. \n\nI am happy I bought Tesla and made a bit of money, no doubt, but I don\u2019t believe they will live up to the hype with a measly 300,000 units of car sales in 2019 (Toyota did 10 million last year), 10 exploded Space X failed launches, and a pig with a chip its in brain. Oh yea, and battery tech that China already has in production with two companies. \n\n Tesla, is a bubble, that when it bursts, is going to leave a lot of investors with empty bank accounts in the future.",

Similarly, whether you consider these companies to have an astronomical overvaluation or not is up to your discretion as an investor.\n\nIn my eyes, I effectively see three high-level groups of tech securities in this current market:\n\n1) The high growth blue chips, companies such as $MSFT, $AAPL, $AMZN\n\n2) The high growth emerging tech with actually pretty incredible numbers and guidance, companies such as $ZM, $PTON, $PYPL, $AMD\n\n3) The high growth emerging tech that are operating at a loss as of latest earnings, with relatively promising prospects. Companies such as $NET, $CLDR\n\nThe thesis from my perspective is that all of the companies above stand to gain from COVID, with no exceptions. However, some investments are safer than others, driven by fundamentals on profitability, growth, debts, etc.\n\nI agree that a market cap of 100B+ for a video calling company ($ZM) appears ludicrous, but they are generating a lot of money and growth, within a macro trend that is definitely here to stay.\n\nThe bullishness stems from the fact that:\n\na) Macro consumer trends in the coming COVID winter, and also in a post COVID 2021-2022, move money to these industries and give way for growth. The above companies not only facilitate how we do business globally, but also lifestyle and culture.\n\nb) With the Trump administration's plans, and the Federal Reserve's actions on inflation, the US equities market is a very favourable investment for growth, driving demand up, which manifests itself in valuations you claim to be astronomical in nature.\n\nSay that you are an entity/individual looking to grow your wealth passively with an investment. Where would you put your money, knowing that the interest you receive by lending to other entities will yield very low performance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nMy thesis is that we are in a justified bubble, which won't pop until the Federal Reserve decides to drive inflation down. I really don't believe this is happening this year, which is why I'm holding my positions and considering to buy this dip.",

So the payments functionality can be separated from the the store of value functionality. And I agree the later is many magnitudes more valuable.

In my opinion its real value is that its one of the only monetary systems that is entirely isolated from government influence, and not controlled by any one entity, including other cryptocurrencies that are essentially \"owned\" by one company or group. Bitcoin can have value to society just by existence as an alternative to keep governments and centrals banks in check. It could potentially be an even larger asset than gold, and it wouldn't even have to \"take over\" the dollar or anything at point.",

Yes I'm happy they've had a huge run up for the past couple years. Yes I'm sad that I sold half of my position when I had 100% return. No, I do not plan on selling more. Yes SQ is fantastic, and yes I hold a similar amount in PYPL as well. \n\nNo, I do not think SQ or PYPL will surpass visa as the king of payment processing.

(If it's even a bubble). I\u2019m holding my calls because it keeps going up no matter what. When we have a red day or negative news I tell myself: \"Stonks go up\" and either by EOD or the next day, it goes green without fail.\n\nBut at the same time I\u2019m starting to get worried about a bubble- but what will trigger it? \nMoney is practically free, poor people who are getting devastated by the virus with no stimulus never invested in the market anyways. If anything the average person with spare change can now throw their money into the market easier than ever before with RH.\n\nI understand the subprime crisis was undetected, so what could possibly be undetected now? \nWhat will pop this? Am I missing something? Give me a reason not to hold my tech calls.\nSometimes I feel like the market will pop is because doubling my money in months doesn't sound right, this isn't supposed to happen.

Visa and mastercard are likely the only finance companies related to consumer spending that have an actual moat due to their ability to process payments immediately in a way that literally every other bank (large or small, old or fintech) is required to utilize their channels to have payments process.\n\nYes, SQ is a bank now. Yes I'm happy they've had a huge run up for the past couple years. Yes I'm sad that I sold half of my position when I had 100% return. No, I do not plan on selling more. Yes SQ is fantastic, and yes I hold a similar amount in PYPL as well. \n\nNo, I do not think SQ or PYPL will surpass visa as the king of payment processing. Visa is a giant, and could simply reveal their own p2p lending platform if any of the minor banks manages to cross their moat....it still hasn't been crossed yet.",

But customers won\u2019t cancel their service.  \n\n\nPer the Boeing comp... how many of you have flown on a plane recently? How many have a trip booked? I work in sales at a top 5 tech company in San Francisco. They have already told us we will not be having business travel the way we did before due to companies like zoom and the opportunity to work better and engage remotely.  \n\n\nThat industry is changing rapidly as well and not in the direction of Boeing. A company with MASSIVE overhead costs that literally cannot stop burning cash and will need to revamp its revenue models moving fwd.  \n\n\nAre they undervalued. Probably. But it\u2019s in line with the risk involved in that industry. Did you guys see today that United got rid of all change fees? Desperate much?  \n\n\nPoint being, these are unique times. And you certainly can\u2019t comp a hyper growth, perfect positioned saas company against a legacy company in an industry that is at risk of bankruptcy with an uncertain future.",

Nice sugar rush, but they're still sitting on $35 billion of real estate that's probably overvalued. Like walmart, the pivot to e-tail isn't cheap and sidelines years of expensive investments.\n\nCVS has a negative current ratio, and is completely upside down if you eliminate goodwill.

For NFIN think they explained this / it makes logical sense - the parent company started Triterras and were its first customers giving it critical mass of traders at launch and their share of revenues has fallen from 100% to 11% today (in 14 months) with it being no more than 15% for the full year and falling meaningfully thereafter....as long as its falling and is single digit number in a year or so i dont think this is cause for concern.... Point noted re no PIPE though - potentially its a bad signal....but maybe they just didnt need one (business is net cash, cash generative and profitable).... not seen anyone flag no external (ie non-sponsor) PIPE as an issue at LCA or Utz.",
