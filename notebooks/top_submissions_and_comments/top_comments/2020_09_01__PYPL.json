Especially in a low interest rate environment, there's a reason why most of the bank stocks were and are still lousy investments ever since 2008. NIM is everything in the lending business. I'd stay away any business whose outlook prospers on a change in interest rate and the housing economy, because those factors are outside of the company's control.\n\nSeriously, some of you have the weirdest DDs that maybe you're just thinking too hard. If you want to go with high growth, high risk company in finance, you have a better chance to double, triple, maybe even 5x your money with digital payment companies like Paypal and Square that sit well with Millennial &amp; Gen Z. If you want to invest in stable growing financial company with lower risk, Visa and Mastercard are the choices in the digital era.",

Consider making some placements spread out to different sectors, finacial should be in there for example. I have been taking position in BAC for banking\nAnd either Visa or Paypal for another pairing with BAC. \nBAC has been really cleaning up thier books and setting up for long term sucess precovid, post covid, you have buffet giving it attention amd some $. If you watch the headline you can see Buffet is shifting his portfolio. I dont always like his picks honestly. 50/50 at best but BAC will be a great risk to reward ratio on placing money in a longer term asset(aka Buffets M.O.) specifically in the financial sector. Paypal could deflate most but could also inflate in price most in my opinion. \n\nConsumer. Get one at least. Every suggests the \"this\" version of amazon. Stick with Amazon. Jeff Bezos isnt running those knock of Amazons. Pick Amazon if you like amazon. In lomg term portfolio management you need to care about your companies leadership. Im day trading you dont even need to care about what ticker tag you are trading. \nAmazon. Nuff said. \n\nI would take a 50/50 split of AMD, and Nvidia right now to cover semiconductors. \n(Your already heavy tech or id do full positions in both)\n\nIf you do a consumer defense stock, id do walmart. They are pishing thier ecommerce and puttting thier leadership equity into that direction. I think they see Amazon and know what needs to happen to survive if a new commerce age comes. Great Amazon pairing to, as if one drops the other may get an increase due to thier respective market share. \n\nIf you are not going to manage yoyr portfolio a few times a week I wouldnt get any more in depth than that. \n\nSplit picks into secotrs and you account will take sharp downswing less often. More important to keep your money than to make alot. If you cannot keep what you make you will only borrow it mistakenly thinking you had ownership.",

Elon is not stupid enough to have the short-sighted vision of Tesla as a product (car) company. TSLA is a $1TN **energy** **conglomerate** by 2025-2030. For as long as the talking heads are talking about automotive sales and the \"competition\", it's just more time for me to gather up those shares.\n\n*edit: original cost-basis is $30-something but I've, of course, been adding and becoming less-diverse as the stonk was headline-driven to the ~$180)\n\n\nedit2: For anyone interested, Peter Thiel's Zero to One is an excellent read on how to interpret modern tech markets, and if you read it in 2013, you'd have incredible returns (1000%+), an incredible hit-ratio, with the ability to identify exponential-growth tech stocks with such precision that you'd think the person had a crystal ball.",

I can remember being one of those people and not being very happy... WinQuik will only have a handful of winners and you'll actually win legit prize money.\n\nWinQuik is also monetized with microtransactions (personally hate MTs as a gamer, but they're good for the bottom dollar as an investor) that are essentially power-ups that can help you with questions, so those that really want to win can buy these to get an edge, but it's still possible to win without them.\n\nYou can also challenge other people 1v1, and someone speak up if I'm wrong, but IIRC, you can wager money on these challenges (can't remember if its directly money or tokens or something from microtransactions).\n\nAll cash pay in and out is secure via PayPal.\n\nWinQuik will also be using ads and sponsors for revenue and prize money, they already had Burger King signed on just for the beta, speculation is with their ties to the sports world the NFL and ESPN may follow.\n\nThis doesn't even touch on the ensemble of hosts they've acquired. No, its not Leo D or Matt Damon, I dont know why people think that A-list celebs would host a trivia app anyways, but these are legitimate personalities from the NFL, Discovery Channel, Food Network, contributor to NASA and SpaceX, the list goes on.\n\nAnd this is only WinQuik, the first app. ClickStream also recently acquired a major stake in GOOO. theres some DD out there in the r/CLIS sub, but speculation is that they are looking to create a sports book/gambling website/app after the successful launch of WinQuik.\n\nTLDR : buy $CLIS  = \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

In my opinion its real value is that its one of the only monetary systems that is entirely isolated from government influence, and not controlled by any one entity, including other cryptocurrencies that are essentially \"owned\" by one company or group. Bitcoin can have value to society just by existence as an alternative to keep governments and centrals banks in check.

Visa and mastercard are likely the only finance companies related to consumer spending that have an actual moat due to their ability to process payments immediately in a way that literally every other bank (large or small, old or fintech) is required to utilize their channels to have payments process.\n\nYes, SQ is a bank now. Yes I'm happy they've had a huge run up for the past couple years. Yes I'm sad that I sold half of my position when I had 100% return. No, I do not plan on selling more. Yes SQ is fantastic, and yes I hold a similar amount in PYPL as well. \n\nNo, I do not think SQ or PYPL will surpass visa as the king of payment processing. Visa is a giant, and could simply reveal their own p2p lending platform if any of the minor banks manages to cross their moat....it still hasn't been crossed yet.",
