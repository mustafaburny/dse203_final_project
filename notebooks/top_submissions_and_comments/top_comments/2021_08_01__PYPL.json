That school also feels that Venmo is a juggernaut so the existence of competition doesn't bother them.\n\nI've had a small position and my thesis was a bit of each, but I held through earnings with the intent to sell if it popped.  That didn't happen so I had to make a new plan.  I still intend to sell, but now I'm looking to do so into strength when people realize the earnings sell off was a bit much.

To add what PayPal did on a whim 3 quarters ago without dropping a dime. And PayPal\u2019s most recent quarter had 1.5 billion BNPL TPV. For an annual run rate of 6 billion. For free. No dilution.
