It looked attractive at that valuation but I didn't realize that the high valuation was dependent on their crazy revenue growth which was a one-time thing, even if they're going to continue growing slowly from that new plateau.\n\nIt's in the red for me right now but I've decided that I will hold and see what happens thanks to this paradigm shift that me (and the CEO) have mentioned.\n\nI'm normally conservative as well.  I was actually between HPQ and LOGI.  HP is the boring conservative play (which you might like, I like it too), but LOGI just has an amazing balance sheet, no debt, good product and it's a Swiss company which is attractive for diversification.  It's clearly not a Tesla.\n\nI normally avoid growth stories like the plague.  I thought this one was something of an exception as the multiple isn't *that* high, and all the numbers look pretty good.  In hindsight I probably would have avoided it because it feels like more of a gamble than I had realized, but given that I'm holding what is only a small position in my portfolio, I will let it ride.\n\nNot sure if I will add a bit more to average down.  Will wait and see for now.  As I said I'm normally conservative, so I appreciate your points.  Definitely feels like a slip-up for me.  Even if it recovers it's definitely out of my comfort zone.",

They are a long standing large cap company.  Also, it is one of those stocks you can expect to be around for another 10 years. They have a large market share of a growing market. Most importantly, they have the financial backing of the US legislature AND the US military, which will ensure their existence and success for 10-20 years.  \nAlso, HPQ is another one where my bear case is undervalued with a dfcf analysis. They said last call they expect higher growth this year, and it would be even more except for supply chain issues.\nI therefore invest in both. They are both undervalued in part due to chip supply concerns. If chip shortages recover, Intel will have slower growth and HPQ will have better growth and vise versa.  So, in at bargain prices on both, and feel well-protected from future threats.\nAs a side note. AMD doesn't concern me. My bear case would include AMD market share capture, but the entire chip market is projected to grow for quite a while. As stated, Intel is still undervalued in my bear case.",

Other than numerous applications in the chemical, medical and solar industry, what interests me most is the use of silicon in the battery storage industry to improve the Li-ion battery performance. As per UBS, energy storage industry could grow to 426 billion in next 10 years. HPQ's tech potential has already generated NDA's with battery manufacturers and advanced material companies. In addition, HPQ has received firm order for Si nano powders from major car manufacturer.",
