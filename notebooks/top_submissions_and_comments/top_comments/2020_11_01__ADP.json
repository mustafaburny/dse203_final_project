        "body": "&gt;One strategy for covered calls, if you have say 1000 shares, is to only sell 5 covered calls at various points OTM (eg. one 2.5% otm, two 5% otm, three 10% otm) and only enter covered call trades on up days when IV gets higher. It maintains a strongly bullish position on shares, but also lowers your average cost of ownership assuming your shares don't get called away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can totally sell covered calls.  if you are mechanical about it and want to sell a 30 DTE every 30 days, then you will most assuredly have to sell your shares at some point.  But if you are smart about it, and sell CC's when the stock had a good run up over 3-5 days, and only THEN sell a CC, you can probably do that 7-8 times a year (maybe more depending on the underlying) and the assignment risk goes down.\n\nI know this because I mechanically sold CC's on my stock and wasn't even thinking about it.  I owned ADP and two months ago I sold a CC because my prior option expired and on the next day it's \"time to sell another one.\"  I sold a CC on ADP when it was extremely down, and then it SHOT through my strike price so quickly I almost didn't have time to react.  I have missed out on a lot of profit as a result.  \n\nI could have simply waited and been more smart about it and held onto the shares.  But I messed up.",

I'm a millennial and I played it really early on, and it was really popular among a smaller crowd at the time. And it wasn't really marketed towards kids at that time (I was in college as were most people I knew playing it). It wasn't until it started moving towards its full release that it started to get uber popular with kids, partly through gamimg becoming a bigger thing on YouTube I think.\n\nEven Fortnite might have had that cycle with some people. I was subbed for UT4 and got into the Fortnite beta, played it and didn't care (this was before it got BR). Maybe there were people younger than me who liked it and stuck with it and eventually it evolved.",

Once the majority of shares are owned by funds (retirement, hedge, etc.) instead of owners and founders, the focus shifts to quarterly returns, innovation dies, growth rates slow, and the value of the company is \u201cmonetized\u201d back to the funds until it is worthless.   Salesforce just turned that corner.  Typical patterns include heavy advertising, annual or twice annual layoffs (Jack Welch style), cuts in R&amp;D funding, tight delivery schedules, service failures,  attempts to turn support into consulting (a poorly built product now needs you to pay for support), higher product complexity (it becomes a complicated mess due to rushing the delivery schedule, and saying yes to every possible customer, who basically turn your solution into garbage).  Fully monetized companies then show up in bankruptcy after years of neglect and lack of innovation.  Think Sears and JCPenney.   Oracle is on it\u2019s way, as well as most \u201cold tech\u201d.

Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money. Seagate was dismissed in 1997, sue again and paid [$45 M to R+ as late as 2000](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/seagate-to-pay-rodime-45m-to-settle-suit-2000-01/).   R+ only exists as a shell company and its share price soared on news of the patent settlement.

This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",

So many of the mom and pop shop venues are probably going to close due to $0 cash flow this year. As long as LYV can make it out alive until restrictions are lifted... the only competitor in there way will be pretty much AEG and they can continue its pre-COVID momentum.

E\nWhat won't surprise me if the stock drops to $20 - $45 and I'll be a buyer.\n\nV and MA: Should also accelerate growth once a vaccine is available and transactions are lifted.

And the first question people ask when they find out what I did in college is about the economy and stocks. And it\u2019s a dumb question and they don\u2019t even realize it. Like I spent years learning about scarcity and a bunch of basically applied calculus and statistics. \n\nUnless I work directly for a brokerage I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to make an informed decision any one way or the other, and even then it would only be a best estimate and one with enough of a likely chance to not be correct that it would be pretty irresponsible to give an opinion on it. \n\nI can fully do the math behind it sure, but the stock market has proven time and time again that it\u2019s irrational and not really predictable with any algorithm. There is a reason that economic theory even says throwing a dart at a chart of stocks and picking where it lands is just as likely to be accurate than if you picked it based on extensive amounts of DD and research. \n\nBut I just point people towards index\u2019s, tell them if they aren\u2019t retiring in the next 5 years don\u2019t be afraid or worried that the stock market drops every now and then etc etc. \n\ntl;dr Economists don\u2019t study the economy they study scarcity. I\u2019d be extremely skeptical of any economist claiming to know what the market will do or that they have figured out the stock market. We exist to do small scale data analysis, or to advise large scale economic moves aka monetary/fiscal policy, we aren\u2019t adept at guessing small movements within certain markets. And if we\u2019re in a spot where we can then we are also in a spot where the sec would have something to say if we profited off it.",

        "body": "&gt; IMO it really validates the risks related with EM investments and the risks that are attributed to investments in Chinese markets\n\nActually if you read the piece the exact opposite conclusion is reached: that with this move China actually **derisked** its economy and therefore arguably made it safer for investors. It was not a \"move on a whim by Xi because he got his sensitive feelings hurt by Jack Ma\" like so many Western publications argued. Like the piece says:\n\n&gt; [Regulators think that] there are many deficiencies of the current Chinese financial system, but that does not mean \u201cBigTech\u201d gets to do what it wants, even if we can acknowledge their contributions to society.  TL;DR: we like innovation, but let\u2019s not overhype the magic of \u201cbig data,\u201d and anyway, you\u2019re still operating in financial services, and so that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be regulated, like it or not.  That\u2019s because if we the regulators don\u2019t step in, and something goes wrong, who will pay the price?  Society will, the citizens will. Don\u2019t you guys remember the Great Financial Crisis of 2008?  A few parties won, yes, but all the rest of us? We lost.  We were all set back.  That\u2019s not happening again, not on our watch!\n\nWhen regulators think like that, I think that's a system worth investing into IMHO, because they think long-term and they think greater-good which ultimately leads to a stronger economy, not something to be scared by...\n\nThe only argument that can be made, I think, is that they acted too last-minute and that is scary in itself but it is also actually somewhat reassuring because they're not afraid to stop something as iconic as the world's largest IPO when they believe it can ultimately be detrimental to society. They didn't mind losing face and that is a positive sign for China.",

At least that's my read on the situation and it makes more sense than the PRC destroying one of their own most profitable companies because of a grudge.",

Then in this speech he called all the banks \"pawn shops\" for loans and basically made fun of the biggest govt backed banks (who he had sold shitty debt securities to). Essentially he offloaded a shit ton of liability from ANT's (like paypal/venmo in china) loans onto the chinese government aka the chinese people.  So now the govt has to deal with all that before it potentially explodes in their faces, and they have to teach jack ma a lesson because he essentially sold them bags of dogshit and then bragged about it publicly while laughing in their faces",

        "body": "To add on: selling covered calls is a pretty easy way to make some extra money on non-meme stocks.\n\nBasically, you're selling your shares at strike+premium, e.g. if you sell a $10 call for 1.5, you're basically selling your shares for $11.50 each. You're solidly in the green as long as the share price stays below strike+premium. If it looks like it is going to blow past your strike, and you want to hold the shares, you can usually roll to a higher strike for a net credit by adding some time. Collecting the premium also gives you some downside protection if the stock starts to drop.\n\nA basic strategy that is very popular among wealthier people is to own shares and sell monthly/quarterly strangles. E.g. own 10k $MSFT shares and sell 100 calls at +15% and 100 puts at -15% each month. Basically, getting paid to buy the dip and renting out your shares for cash.\n\nYou can easily get 10-20% monthly returns holding shares on stable companies this way, but you'll sometimes miss out on the massive rallies, so it's not suited for anyone in this sub. You'll also get screwed in the event of a covid-type crash if you've done this on margin, but if you're holding shares, you'd be screwed short-term anyway.",

        "body": "What kind of price-to-sales multiple will GME have in the next 2 years? Currently at 0.13\n\nIf GME successfully grows their e-commerce business to \\~50% with same day delivery (currently being rolled out now), the products they sell could reasonably provide a 1x sales multiple. (Compare other e-commerce P/S - OSTK 1.2   CHWY 4.2)\n\n4 new revenue streams for GME will include: Monetization of customer data, digital downstream revenue from MSFT Xbox platform, online advertising revenue, and PC hardware sales. All 4 offer good margins.\n\nAll of these new revenue streams and e-commerce growth represents a very big change (almost 'tech' like) than that of the former business model of purely B&amp;M with mostly just gaming product inventory. The real big money to influence a major share price rise is in the customer data. If leveraged properly, GME has a true 'tech' side to their business model.\n\nGME looks to grow revenue YoY, estimating 6-7bn for 2021, and 8bn+ in 2022 with a P/S of 1, we are looking at a 8bn market cap in 2022. Share price of $120+\n\nYou could compare with BestBuy, which has a P/S of 0.8. Give GME the 0.8 P/S and they reach a market cap of 6.4bn (assuming 8bn yearly revenue in 2022). That's $99/share and an 800% increase from current market value.\n\nMost investors are not aware of what the company has to offer, hence why the reference Blockbuster so much. There is a reason we have seen larger stakes being taken by bigger players. Just last week we saw some more big boys jumping in. Wells Fargo, Jefferies, Hussman all taking positions. When GME shorts flip to longs (will happen eventually) they will drive up the share price.\n\nIn the next 2 years, if the street decides to view GME as a e-commerce/digital data business within the gaming/PC industry, valuations can run high and P/S multiples could run even higher.",

They have almost the same weighting so if either of them takes market share from the other, there will be practically no change in the overall value of the index. \n\nSimilarly with FAAMG. Despite their apparent differences, those companies compete with each other in many ways. For example Twitch (Amazon) versus Youtube livestreaming (Google). Or Amazon Web Services vs Google Cloud Platform vs Microsoft Azure. If one of these companies takes a fall, the others are likely to pick up their market share in some capacity.\n\nYour example only works if all these large companies are unseated over a short period of time by companies outside the S&amp;P 500.",

Why nobody mentions this is beyond me, arguably one of the most important high margin revenue streams GME can benefit from.\n\n**E-Commerce omnichannel business model** that offers same day delivery and is continually improving. This is the \"beat AMZN' part of the business model.\n\n**PC hardware sales** ($40bn/yr and growing TAM)\n\n**Online ad revenue.** From website + App\n\n**E-sports experiences**. Currently partnering with gaming pros and streaming on twitch. Will **build brand recognition**.\n\nMassive **reduction in SG&amp;A.**\n\n**SKU optimization**. Better inventory and inventory turnover.\n\n'Digital everything' is not as strong of a bear thesis as it was 2 years ago. Especially considering GME has the MSFT partnership to share digital revenue.\n\nGaming industry TAM is growing YoY.\n\nCompetent management team. Finally.\n\nBigger firms/institutions are taking a position in GME. So far as of end of Q3 we have had new or increased stakes from: Senvent, State Street, Russell, Wells Fargo, Hussman and finally Jefferies taking an sizeable position in Call options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a $700MM company. This is not the old GME where you simply buy and trade in videogames. It is very undervalued at current market price of $11\n\nI think GME has potential to be valued at $2-3bn valuation within 12 months ($32-47)\n\nWhen it finally appreciates in value after a few good quarterly earnings then there should be a slow squeeze. You have to be patient with this play. It will most likely take 6+ months until we see good Q4 and Q1 earnings to convince shorts to capitulate.",

Facebook (the site) itself has been viewed quite negatively by the younger generation, and it might go the way of MySpace, if there\u2019s a newer and cooler social media platform in town. Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest is a success and can be big for them, but the VR market is still very niche. \n\nAmazon has a ton of upsides, especially during and even after COVID, where everything will move towards online, everyone already knew. Despite how big Amazon is, eCommerce is still only 16% of retail sale, so there\u2019s still room. Cloud is booming, and AWS is still king.\n\nI am the most bullish on MSFT. They have a good mix of the old stuff that have been steadily making them money for decades and are still here to stay (Windows, Office/365, .NET, SQL, Xbox) and the cool new stuff that has a lot of growth potential (Azure/Cloud, Surface, GamePass, Teams). On top of that, their recent acquisitions have been doing a lot better than the failed ones in the past. I think MSFT is very solid, and they are one killer product away from taking over Apple as the #1 company in term of market cap, again.",

Normally this would be their worst earnings of the console cycle, but the last one had forced store closures.  I'm thinking we see better numbers this quarter. And better than worst will be a surprise.\n\nThat said, I've been saying for months that I expect the stock to drop on EPS posting for Decembers ER, but I expect a huge rally during the call.  They will absolutely talk about console presales and interest.  That itself is pretty bullish.  They're sold out of preorders and will continue to be even after the next batch drops.\n\nThis will also be a great time to talk about other activities.  Is Cohen taking an active roll in the turnaround?  He is still invested, so this is still very feasible, and an official announcement that he is actively involved would be good for at least +2-3 bucks tacked onto the stock price.\n\nTalking about continued increase in website sales and how people are responding to the massive improvements is also a likely topic.  If they don't bring up the MSFT deal, there will absolutely be questions from investors about it.  If they start forward guidance again, we could see crazy movement on that as well.\n\n\nFinally, and rather amusingly, a lack of console supply is actually bullish for GME.  People start selling used consoles to gamestop starting the day they release.  Why?  I can't fathom a legitimate reason for this, but it happens.  Super demand and no supply means people will pay new console prices for used consoles.  There will be a massive profit margin on these for gamestop, and even better, when the console is an XBox, that console starts generating passive revenue for them as well.",

Similar with Amazon.\n\nThose are my big two but also feel super safe with apple, Microsoft, Facebook, visa as long term positions.\n\nLong term thesis is tech is the way with growth of AI and efficient solutions.

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

My baseless theory is this: its extraordinarily slim the violence is worse than what we have seen over the past 5 months. Even if there is peak unrest, how does that impact stonks? This year it hasn't that much. People are timid, but I largely think that is overplayed. Many companies reported great numbers for Q3. Whether the election is contested, biden wins, or trump wins, it doesn't really matter. The private sector is marching on. Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if people riot. Stimulus will pass whether its biden or trump. Even so, we know we have until next year to sort it all out. Im keeping some cash for buying opportunities, but I'm largely bullish. Don't let the media get your worked up into thinking this is the end times. It's not.",

I think if u want to go long on one of the big ones Netflix and aapl are the weakest in that list. At least split ur investment to msft and fb or something which are also a household names and would be around for a long time. Good luck with ur investments I hope it works out for u whatever u decide.\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d",

If you wait until the news cycle starts reminding us, then you've already missed a bigger bounce than you can reasonably expect from this year's biggest tech winners over the next few weeks.",
