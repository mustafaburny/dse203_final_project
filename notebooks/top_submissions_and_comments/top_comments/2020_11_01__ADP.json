        "body": "&gt;One strategy for covered calls, if you have say 1000 shares, is to only sell 5 covered calls at various points OTM (eg. one 2.5% otm, two 5% otm, three 10% otm) and only enter covered call trades on up days when IV gets higher. It maintains a strongly bullish position on shares, but also lowers your average cost of ownership assuming your shares don't get called away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can totally sell covered calls.  if you are mechanical about it and want to sell a 30 DTE every 30 days, then you will most assuredly have to sell your shares at some point.  But if you are smart about it, and sell CC's when the stock had a good run up over 3-5 days, and only THEN sell a CC, you can probably do that 7-8 times a year (maybe more depending on the underlying) and the assignment risk goes down.\n\nI know this because I mechanically sold CC's on my stock and wasn't even thinking about it.  I owned ADP and two months ago I sold a CC because my prior option expired and on the next day it's \"time to sell another one.\"  I sold a CC on ADP when it was extremely down, and then it SHOT through my strike price so quickly I almost didn't have time to react.  I have missed out on a lot of profit as a result.  \n\nI could have simply waited and been more smart about it and held onto the shares.  But I messed up.",
