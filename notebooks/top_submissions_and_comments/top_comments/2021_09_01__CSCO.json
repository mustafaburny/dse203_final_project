It's been frustrating in my experience, but I guess it just doesn't work particularly well for my niche.

        "body": "Depends what you're holding, depends on interest rates, depends on how reliable your broker is.\n\nIf you're leveraging individual stocks or even a portfolio of a few riskier stocks the result would probably be different. Imagine leveraging tech during the dotcom bubble. Even a tiny amount of leverage on a fairly typical 1999 tech portfolio of say pets.com, Cisco and Microsoft, probably wouldn't have ended so well.\n\nAnother thing you need to factor in is interest rates and expected returns. Margin debt is practically free with today's interest rates, but in the past you would have been paying 5%+ on whatever you borrowed. This may have still been low enough for you to make a small profit, but the 7-8% average market return you're back testing against could be higher than what we should expect going forward given how high valuations are and other proposed long-term risks such as the end of the current economic cycle.\n\nFinally you need to keep in mind your broker doesn't have to lend you anything, and almost all brokers reserve the right to reduce or remove your line of credit as they please. You need to account for the fact that in highly volatile markets your broker is likely to significantly increase margin requirements and they could even remove your ability to borrow against certain assets entirely.\n\nMy guess is you're running a simulation with a dataset highly biased to some of the strongest market returns and lowest interest rates in history. If you assume these things will continue going forward, sure, it's a no brainer. But if the market is flat for a decade and interest rates rise just a few percent you're not going to look so smart. That said, generally a good way to increase returns is to increase risk. So you probably should expect slightly higher than average returns with this strategy, the question is whether it's worth it after you adjust for the risk and volatility of such a strategy.",

Yes, Zoom does the job.\n\nBut it has no ecosystem like MS has with Teams and Office.  Cisco is in everything and, if your tech dept can afford it, then they offer some truly amazing solutions.  \n\nZoom, to me, is inferior not solely of personal experience but because it's going to be increasingly harder to convince IT managers to use a Chinese based video conf solution as cybersecurity becomes a greater concern and all the while there's plenty of more trustworthy US based solutions. \n\nThis is why I also agree it'll be an acquisition target.  It's too familiar a name and concept to just drop off.  I mean, Radio Shack and Compaq computers are still a thing.  I see Zoom living on as an existence similar to theirs.",

Those components are built in factories instead of pulled out of the ground like oil and gas. The energy sector has already been defined to be related to extraction and refinement of those fuels. Also, the previously mentioned companies all vary quite a bit in terms of what they produce, making it unreasonable to have them grouped under the same sector.\n\nI don't follow the industry, I just looked at some of the top holdings from a renewable energy ETF but that's my guess.",
