        "body": "I moved out of vanguard a while ago because of their outdated UI and no 2FA option that wasn't SMS based. I can't imagine how a huge financial firm still offers SMS based 2fA without realizing how huge of a security flaw it is with sim swapping. At least fidelity and Schwab offer an authenticator-like app with symantec VIP. Vanguard has been behind on the times for a while now and shows no signs of getting with it.\n\nWith all of the great brokerage account options out there, there's very little reason to use Vanguard. Don't get me wrong, I love the Vanguard funds, but you can access all of their ETFs in many other platforms. For example, you can literally buy fractional shares of Vanguard ETFs in Fidelity for no extra cost at the same expense ratio as you get in Vanguard. That's something that you can't even do in Vanguard itself!",

They\u2019re facing some increasing competition, mostly by Microsoft with their defender ATP tool that\u2019s included in some of their enterprise license bundles for M365. \n\nThat said the space is still saturated with companies using legacy endpoint security vendors like Symantec and mcafee. Those companies will likely be shifting over to Defender ATP or crowdstrike in the near future (1-3 years, most license agreements for enterprise security tools are at max 3 years or 5 if the company capitalized hardware along with it). \n\nAnother factor, as companies continue going to the cloud for their needs, that will also be a forcing factor away from legacy on premise security solutions. \n\nAlso, the threat environment is driving companies to shift away from legacy solutions to crowdstrike and others. Their recent marketing play is in the antiransomware space, a threat which they are very effective at stopping. \n\nTLDR: CRWD has a lot of runway for growth, some competition heating up; for the foreseeable future it will continue growing at breakneck speed due to increasing needs for a variety of reasons, and an evolving cyber threat landscape.",

        "body": "Here is the article:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn Ontario government task force is calling for the province\u2019s securities regulator to be dramatically transformed, proposing an independent tribunal to hear cases and a broadened mandate that includes making economic growth a priority.\n\nThe Capital Markets Modernization Task Force, which was launched by the Ministry of Finance in February, has also proposed rules that it hopes will allow smaller, independent investment dealers to better compete against their larger rivals in the banking sector and has urged the government to ban a specific, exploitative type of short-selling.\n\nThe proposals are among 47 recommendations touted as the first wide-scope review of Ontario\u2019s capital markets since 2003. The full list of proposals is scheduled to be released Thursday but is not final; the task force, chaired by Walied Soliman, the Canadian chair of law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, is seeking public comment before it puts forward its final list in the fall.\n\nAmong the more sweeping proposals are major structural reforms to the Ontario Securities Commission, the country\u2019s largest. Currently, the organization is run by about a dozen commissioners who play three roles: setting policy, functioning as a board of directors and adjudicating cases of alleged wrongdoing.\n\nThe task force has called for that system to be dismantled and has proposed creating an entirely new capital markets tribunal \u2013 one that would be completely separate from the OSC and report directly to the Minister of Finance. It has also proposed a slightly less drastic option, which would create an adjudicative tribunal within the OSC.\n\nOntario\u2019s securities law stipulates that the roles of OSC chair and chief executive officer be filled by the same person. The report says those roles need to be split, as is expected of the corporations the OSC oversees.\n\n\u201cIt was time for the Ontario Securities Commission to evolve to the governance standards that it holds our issuers to across this province,\u201d Mr. Soliman said in an interview.\n\nAnother big-picture proposal is a rejigging of the OSC\u2019s mandate. As it stands, the commission is responsible for enforcing securities laws, but the task force has raised the idea of expanding its mission to include the \u201cfostering of capital formation and competitive capital markets.\u201d Such a move, it said, would \u201cinstitutionally and culturally\u201d shift the organization to consider economic growth, which would help it reduce \u201cfees and anti-competitive behaviour.\u201d\n\nThe task force has also floated a number of changes that it said will \u201clevel the playing field\u201d between smaller, independent market dealers and the behemoths in the banking sector. It has singled out the practice known as \u201ctied selling,\u201d in which banks use preferential interest rates or incentives to compel companies to raise capital through their own affiliates. Although this is already banned by federal banking law, the task force said it heard from dealers and issuers that commercial lenders \u201ccontinue to engage in these practices.\u201d\n\nThis raises the possibility of forbidding such \u201cexclusivity arrangements\u201d and requiring a senior banking officer to attest that no such bundling deals have been struck. The task force also asked market participants how they would feel if, by law, a specific percentage of all underwriting arrangements across the province were required to be performed by \u201cnon-bank-owned investment dealers.\u201d\n\nMr. Soliman said many of these proposals are in response to a decline in the number of smaller investment dealers. He said that when bank dealers were asked about tied selling, they denied offering such incentives \u2013 in which case, Mr. Soliman said, the proposed changes won\u2019t affect their business.\n\nHe said the province needs to sustain independent dealers because small companies and entrepreneurs are not able to get an audience with bank dealers. \u201cWe would not have had a cannabis capital market in this province if we didn\u2019t have small dealers,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of the larger financial institutions were interested in getting involved in cannabis issuers because of cross-border legal issues.\u201d\n\nHis group is also seeking to stamp out a sophisticated financial trick used by some institutional investors, a type of trading that was highlighted in a Globe and Mail report in November on the collapse of the cannabis sector. Hedge funds anticipating a new cannabis deal would short the issuer\u2019s shares before the deal launched, knowing an offering in the works would be available at a discount. They would then cover their positions by purchasing large portions of the financing and, in effect, instantly earn a discount percentage.\n\nThis practice \u201charms the corporation, its shareholders and the uninformed investors trading against the short sellers,\u201d the task force report states. The report proposes that any market participant that has previously shorted securities of the same type as offered under a prospectus should be forbidden from acquiring those securities under the prospectus.\n\nThe task force has also urged the government to give the OSC new powers to help it collect unpaid fines from market wrongdoers. Similar to changes enacted in British Columbia, it has called for new laws that would allow the regulator to freeze assets in the early stages of an investigation and force fraudsters to pay their OSC fines before they are allowed to renew their driver\u2019s licence or licence plates.",
