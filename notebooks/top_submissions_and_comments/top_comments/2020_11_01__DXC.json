I believe the P/E reflects CSIQ's slow growth being a slightly more mature company (founded in 2001) whilst its competitors came around 5 years later. Also, if you look into these renewable ETFs like TAN, they favour SEDG (10.98%), ENPH (9.61%) and FSLR (7.70%) more against CSIQ (3.71%). It's the same story if you look into ICLN.\n\nThat's a just few areas of concern for me as a current investor in CSIQ.",

They're solid companies set for excellent growth. \n\nCSIQ managed entire projects from end to end without the client having to do much, or they have the choice of managing it themselves and they can buy all the products from them starting with the proven highest efficiency solar panels to the inverter and battery.\n\nENPH has a nice website and a good product. Micro inverters allow you to check in each panel individually. That does cost a bit more, so they have a product that'll put two modules in one to control two panels at a time. Eventually, I think they'll make inverter panel racks, like a server rack. It's a different product that not a lot of other companies offer, and that gives them an edge.\n\nI don't like SolarEdge because their product, the array inverter, is not unique. Sure they're doing well, but every company that offers panels also offers inverters. They're not set for the future IMO.\n\nI'm also eyeing JKS and NIO. They're both Chinese, and China is setting itself to grow in this area. JKS is growing due to being the highest manufacturer for solar panels. NIO is entirely dependent on how the government supports them IMO.",

        "body": "I'm not sure whether CSIQ will have an edge against the other US solar stocks because investors tend to go for younger companies with better growth rate i.e. ENPH and SEDG. I believe the P/E reflects CSIQ's slow growth being a slightly more mature company (founded in 2001) whilst its competitors came around 5 years later. Also, if you look into these renewable ETFs like TAN, they favour SEDG (10.98%), ENPH (9.61%) and FSLR (7.70%) more against CSIQ (3.71%). It's the same story if you look into ICLN.\n\nThat's a just few areas of concern for me as a current investor in CSIQ.",

They're solid companies set for excellent growth. \n\nCSIQ managed entire projects from end to end without the client having to do much, or they have the choice of managing it themselves and they can buy all the products from them starting with the proven highest efficiency solar panels to the inverter and battery.\n\nENPH has a nice website and a good product. Micro inverters allow you to check in each panel individually. That does cost a bit more, so they have a product that'll put two modules in one to control two panels at a time. Eventually, I think they'll make inverter panel racks, like a server rack. It's a different product that not a lot of other companies offer, and that gives them an edge.\n\nI don't like SolarEdge because their product, the array inverter, is not unique. Sure they're doing well, but every company that offers panels also offers inverters. They're not set for the future IMO.\n\nI'm also eyeing JKS and NIO. They're both Chinese, and China is setting itself to grow in this area. JKS is growing due to being the highest manufacturer for solar panels. NIO is entirely dependent on how the government supports them IMO.",
