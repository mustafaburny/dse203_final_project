The bigger retailers wind up bigger and stronger after this and I think you're going to see an increasing amount of retail stores be treated like hybrid store/\"last mile fulfillment centers\" - Target and Walmart are already doing this, to great success. I think ZBRA is something that may benefit from this (an increasing amount of \"ship from store\", \"drive-up pick-up\", etc) Target uses Zebra products for this, I believe Loews and others do, too.",

DIS is more than parks, and streaming is really what was moving the stock price even before the crisis. Good streaming results outweigh the known loss of park revenue, go figure.\n\nToday I bought a bit of JPM, MCD and ZBRA, companies I already owned small amounts of before the crisis.
