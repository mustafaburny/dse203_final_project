Microsoft being the clear winner, you still would've suffered through a 60% loss and taken over a decade to recoup.

        "body": "&gt; The most likely scenario is we see 3 to 4% inflation next year as the fed tapers and then we are back to dealing with low growth after all the demand pull forward we have seen and people accumulate debt over the next year and feel poorer. Earnings growth will be a bit harder as companies will have some really hard comps and market multiples come in a little.\n\nThis. And I've made the argument before, the only reason we were able to successfully raise interest rates in the 80s is because an entirely new industry (tech) came online and fueled the growth of the US (and world) economy for the next 35 years. Seriously think about this:\n\n- Volcker jacks rates up to 16-20% from March 1980 to May 1981. This stops inflation, but causes a recession that is one of the contributing factors to Carter losing his reelection bid.\n\n- Apple IPO is December of 1980. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\n- Microsoft IPO is March of 1986. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nAnd those are just the biggest. We also had companies like Intel, Oracle, Cisco, Dell, and others coming online in the 70s and 80s. And then that led right into the 90s and 00s with Google and Amazon, followed by Facebook, etc.\n\nAll of this to say, if the fed raises interest rates drastically, it's going to lead to a recession. And unless we have some industry that is going to lead the way forward for the next 30 years of economic expansion, I don't see how the fed will be able to stand their ground before dropping rates again. Maybe clean energy or biotech could do it, but I don't think we have enough momentum in either of those sectors right now to sustain us through a recession like tech did.",

        "body": "Tesla is supply constrained - meanwhile other companies in the market have *spare* or *convertible capacity.* This will be an issue in keeping market share. \n\nBesides, you're missing my point. It doesn't matter whether Tesla had a bright future, I never denied that they have effective tech, an effective product and solid manufacturing potential. Tesla isn't going to collapse as a business. However, you can have great companies which are massively over-valued (think Cisco in dot-com era) and Tesla is one of these companies.\n\nTesla's current valuation doesn't make sense. In terms of EVs, VW is just a few % points behind Tesla in global market share (and has an equally bright future in this market) but is valued at 1/6 the value **despite having extensive market share in ICE markets**. That is absurd, Tesla made $31.5bn in revenue in 2020 whereas VW made $258bn in 2020. Fundamentally, the current valuation of Tesla is wrong. That's the problem with Tesla.",

Intel and Cisco's solutions can't. Intel and Cisco's solution have no micro-optics integration capability where as POET's platform does.

Have you seen their solution for co-packaged optics? It is a steam-punk monstrosity with coper cooling tubes everywhere?!\n\nIntel is a giant. As is Cisc,o who got a lot of their photonics ability through their Luxtera acquisition. The technology Intel and Cisco have is good, but also has some fundamental flaws that POET's platform improves upon.  \n\n\n(Nerd answer: Photonic devices depend on a high coupling of light. POET's waveguides are low (light) loss. Intel and Cisco's solutions are high loss in comparison. POET's solution can work with a wide variety of light, from visible to near infrared. Intel and Cisco's solutions can't. Intel and Cisco's solution have no micro-optics integration capability where as POET's platform does. Perhaps most importantly, Intel and Cisco's solution can't scale, where as POET's can.)  \n\n\nUltimately POET's platform is cheaper and better.\n\nAnd as to the POET/Lightwave Logic comparison, Lightwave logic is focused on one part of the total solution: the modulator. LWLG polymer modulator is very promising. I think they're a good company.",

        "body": "It's interesting and I don't have any basis on which to dispute.  I will say it's decidedly micro and anecdotal, whereas I'm taking the most macro view: Fastly has the most advanced tech that's respected by the most tech heavy players.  That has to be worth something.  \n\nI'd certainly be bitter if I did buy and hold, but I was selling tranches of FSLY on the times it was surging above $100.  I did however rebuild positions as it was falling to and through $70.  I thought it had a least one more run to $100 in it.  \n\nIf Roberts' prognosis is true, then it's been a heck of a turn.  \n\n Fastly was ready and able to solve the world's problems when COVID came along.  Seems pretty quick to be deemed irrelevant.  \n\nAnd what's even more crazy is their death was essentially triggered by Trump having a tantrum after social media users embarrassed him into thinking he was about to have a million person rally when in fact it was just 6,000 people.  \n\nHe made up that bizarre threat that tiktok was a national security threat... yet somehow this \"threat\" would be allowed to continue for 90 days as long as it was force-sold to the a Trump-supporting Walmart heirs.  That's a whale-sized pile of crimes and corruption right there.  \n\nInvestors speculated on what percent of Fastly's business might be impaired.  5%?  12%?  \n\nThe shocker came: China had abruptly killed 100% of their Fastly-Tiktok business.  Not just the US part.  All of it.  They'd either stolen or replaced FSLY's tech, all because of the tantrum threat.  \n\nI listened as Fastly management responded.  It sounded unpaniced and measured.  They talked about \"reserving the capacity\" in case Tiktok were to switch back.  At first that sounded ok.  But once it became obvious that wasn't going to happen, it sounded like they were still pining for that lost lover.  That was somewhat concerning to me.  Move on, and tell us what big client bases you're going to attack instead. \n\nThey did seem to recognize what the market was ruffled about, which at the time was Cloudflare's claim of distinction around security.  They acted seemingly appropriately by folding in Signal Sciences pretty quickly, so I was feeling somewhat comfortable about that.  \n\nHowever it's been quite awhile and I haven't seen or heard much from Fastly. They don't seem to have turned people on to the compute-on-edge, which feels to me like it might have huge potential.  \n\nWorse, when they've had hiccups, like with Tiktok or the large one hour outage this spring, it sounds like customers are flipping away from Fastly and the customer continues to do just fine without them (?)\n\nI think I read that after Amazon cut over when Fastly had the spring outage, they haven't bothered to flip back. If true, that doesn't speak too well of Fastly being essential.\n\nStill, if we think of NET and FSLY as Coke and Pepsi, there's always going to be a market for both.  I can't see Fastly just ceasing to exist, except through buy out of course.  I'd guessed some old blue chip like Cisco or IBM or Intel might buy them.",

I don't think that's the case and I think that's just too optimistic to be honest.\n\nOn 2000, you should read on how it unfolded. It was not the case where rate hike was announced on TV and the next day everything went down. It was somewhat of a long grind. Before the crash less popular names were going down but people didn't care because memes of that day were holding up. But then memes started going lower and lower but again there was a bit of a struggle and some equities would go up but then down again. It certainly was not a meteor strike or WW2.\n\nYou also reference that many memes of that time were unprofitable and that is true. Today, many of tech darlings are very profitable. But how about SPACs? These very popular companies with no revenue are sometimes valued at 20 P/S. How about Gamestop or AMC? Dying companies priced like tech growth equities. Also, how about Cisco? Cisco back in 2000 was very serious company making money and they still are. And yet Cisco's price has not returned to the 2000s peak 20 years later (feel sorry for Cisco dip buyers of that time). Same with Intel.\n\nYou also reference 0% interest rate. So lets think about that. In the past every crash was amended with lowering of interest rates. So say something happens now. What will the Fed do? The interest rate is already 0% so nowhere to go or \"the Fed is out of bullets\" as some people say.\n\nFinally, on \"_If you're going to panic when we drawdown 10 or 15%, you shouldn't be investing, plain and simple._\" Let me add this too, if you think that trees grow to the sky you have no business investing.",

        "body": "Firm's market cap climbing to $1 trillion\n\nOne trillion dollars.  \nThat's how much at least one analyst believes Cisco Systems Inc. will be worth in a few years--and you'd be hard pressed to find anyone to disagree.  \nThe San Jose-based networking behemoth's stock closed March 14 at $131.75 a share, slightly down from its March 10 one-year high of $141.88 (The entire Nasdaq slid 4 percent on March 14.)  \nThirty-seven investment banks recommend either a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" None recommend a \"sell\" or even a \"hold.\"  \nOn any given day the volume of Cisco shares traded is the equivalent of every man, woman and child living in California--having hit 33 million as recently as March 9.  \nGeorge Kelly, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York who took Cisco public a decade ago, is one of the Cisco bulls. Cisco's stock is trading at roughly 120 times Mr. Kelly's earnings' estimate of $1.13 per share.  \nThe multiple, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a number that places a value on a stock. It is a ratio of the price of the stock to the profit of a company expressed per shares outstanding.  \n\"A low P/E usually signals investors are uncomfortable,\" Mr. Kelly said.  \nAs a reference, in 2000 Cisco's multiple of 120 compares to Microsoft Corp.'s multiple of 55 and Intel Corp.'s multiple of 42. Yet their values are below Cisco.  \n\"One of the reasons investors value Cisco so highly right now is that, unlike Microsoft, Cisco doesn't have the uncertainty of a Justice Department settlement--it's a much cleaner situation,\" Mr. Kelly said. \"Second, Cisco has had a tremendous track record of continuous upside surprises. And Cisco is viewed as opening several new markets, the biggest of which is optical, which is expected to be an explosive market.\"  \nPerfect returns  \nPaul Weinstein, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, believes a $1 trillion market capitalization (stock price multiplied by shares outstanding) is within reach in a few years. He said Cisco's stock has increased 1,000 times, a perfect 100 percent annual return since it launched its IPO in 1990.  \n\"We humbly submit that over the next two to three years, Cisco could be the first trillion dollar market cap company--and don't think they wouldn't love it,\" Mr. Weinstein wrote in his \"strong buy\" recommendation.  \nAs of March 14, Microsoft's market cap stood about $510 billion, compared with Cisco's $465 billion, which is threefold the annual revenue of the state of California.  \nMichael Neiberg, lead analyst in the communications equipment sector for Chase Hambrecht &amp; Quist in New York, said Cisco is turning a lot of investors long-term.  \nRecommended  \nTechnology  \nRedwood City-based Jasper Therapeutics drops nearly 19% in Wall Street debut  \nTechnology  \nIonQ sets sights on new growth targets after going public  \nTechnology  \nTesla is launching a lottery with a $10,000 prize to encourage workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19  \n\"If you had picked a price point to sell \\[high\\] at anytime in the past 10 years, you would have been wrong,\" he said. \"They have such an impressive track record of growing ... that the financial community isn't thinking in terms of a multiple of what they're earning this year, but what they will be earning three or four years down the line.\"  \nAn opposing view  \nThere are market watchers that are dubious, however, about the high valuation assigned to a large-cap company like Cisco.  \nJeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School, wrote this week in The Wall Street Journal that the high valuation assigned to large-cap technology stocks--Cisco is at the top of his list--are unsustainable.  \n\"History has shown that whenever companies, no matter how great, get priced above 50 to 60 times earnings, buyer beware,\" Mr. Siegel wrote.  \nHis statistical research concludes when companies reach big-cap status--ranked in the top 50 by market capitalization--their ability to generate long-term double-digit growth slows dramatically.  \nYoung bucks in a different field  \nLooking at multiples of high-flying valley gazelles that compete with Cisco is almost meaningless.  \nTake Juniper Networks Inc. The firm has rapidly gained a 15 percent market share in the high-end routing market, cracking a lucrative niche dominated by Cisco.  \nJuniper posted its first profit for the fourth quarter of 1999 of 3 cents per share. Extrapolating that performance out to a 12-month period would conservatively give the company a profit of 12 cents per share. But with its stock price closing March 14 at $245 a share, the upstart company can boast a P/E ratio of 2,042.  \nIs its stock more valuable than Cisco's? In a word, yes. At least Wall Street believes so.  \nBut both Messrs. Neiberg and Kelly note that what Wall Street is valuing is relatively short-term growth--the explosiveness of these new valley firms.  \n\"For the early adopters and early movers, Wall Street is willing to assign these values,\" Mr. Neiberg said.  \nBut he added that what Wall Street is betting on is extremely rapid growth for a year or two. As the rapid growth slows, the multiples will fall into a more earthly range.  \nComparing P/E ratios of other industry giants in different technology spaces may be tempting to investors, but Mr. Neiberg is wary of mixing two different dynamics.  \n\"Both \\[Microsoft and Intel\\] are benefiting from the PC revolution,\" Mr. Neiberg said. \"But they are in a much more moderate growth phase. The more rapid growth is to interconnect all those computers, and Cisco is the standard bearer for all that interconnection.\"  \nYou can reach Mr. Taylor at dtaylor@amcity.com.",
