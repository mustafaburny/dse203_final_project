Wuppose ylu pay something over 48 months and each payment does not get adjusted to inflation, you are effectively paying a little bit less each month. \n\nNow, in a country with a 30% inflation rate average each year that won't help because they alredy take that into account and bump up the prices of everything by a lot if you want a payment plan instead of paying up front. But in the US where the inflation is not always present in everybody's mind you might br able to save a little bit with payment plan sjch as buying a house, etc,since eachpenny is worth a little bit less each months. Of course, that's assuming both salaries and your investments do not lose to inflation, wich is a pretty damn big if.",

My point is if you would do it for 10k and obviously you were making a profit you were comfortable with by doing so, padding like 5k ok whatever to the guy doing 4th br but this guy is 5xing the cost which is an 500% increase ... thats just wrong imo.",

Basically they were targeting small accounts they thought couldn't take legal action and just pocketing the cash. There wasn't much they could do anyway as x.com wasn't FDIC insured. X.com was notorious for fraud to begin with. It was one of the early havens for CC scammers.\n\nIts crazy the shit Muskavites believe. The hyperloop err I guess just loop was a lolcow. Watching that first presentation where he went on about how easy it is to make a vacuum powered train and compared it to an air hockey table was fucking hilarious. Dumbfucks believed him too thats really the best part. Now he says he'll have a Mars base by 2024 and you lot of smooth brains eat it up.\n\nIts crazy how something that was just financial news 20 years ago is now a conspiracy.

Also has a heap of dirt thats slowly seeping out. From his paypal knockoff blatantly pocketing money and shutting down accounts to him being a serial domestic abuser its really looking bad for him. I cant imagine the type of scumbag that would support a child abuser for some profits in the stock market. A the Grimes situation melts down its sure to shed a new light on Elons past. Im sure well start seeing articles about how he abused his ex wife for mourning their child dying of SIDS and similar issues with Elon. Its only a matter of time before his bubble pops. He probably should have kept his face out of Teslas business.",
