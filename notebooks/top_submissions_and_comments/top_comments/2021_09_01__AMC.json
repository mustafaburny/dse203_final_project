I strongly believe we will be retesting the $60-$65 region in the coming weeks and potentially breaking out above the prior ATH after that. The test of this region will provide further clues are to where this market is going. My target for the next leg up if we breakout above the prior ATH is around $300-$400. Mental stop loss below $40 (sorry permabulls I\u2019m not riding this into the grave if the trade goes south).\r  \nGME\r  \nGME is at the end of a HUGE flag, high and tight. It is the biggest I have ever seen in my trading career. According to Bulkowski\u2019s research, these technical patterns boast a 93% success rate once breakout is confirmed (not confirmed yet). This pattern is easier to see on the log scale and I\u2019ve drawn 2 potential breakout points around $230 and $270. Volume is drying up and we are going to breakout soon. My target for the next leg up if we breakout above the prior ATH is between 4k-8k. Mental stop loss below the last point of support below $145.",

I bought the dip in GME after the January fuckery because the DD was solid and institutions got involved. I bought AMC in may because I believed theaters could make a comeback in some way, and then the \"meme stock crowd\" piled on to AMC overnight on twitter lol and took the stock from 12- 72$. I'm holding both because it's so fun to do so. I have significant gains but with everyone rallying and the media talking shit, and the \"glitches\" we keep seeing, and all the crazy stuff people keep finding, I think GME is going for a ride of its own probably up to a high place.

Because people overbid by like 30k, and the prices are also like 100% higher than a few years back, and still rising. The house sellers get a bonus when someone overbids. Also all house sellers are in cahoots, its a fucking bunch of criminal scum. Also rich **assholes** keep buying houses and new houses that are gonna be built and rent them out for insane prices.\n\nAnd even if you have a good job, you have to give like 30% or 52% away, depending on the scale you are in. There are points where its better to earn less money, because after a certain amount, you go from paying 30% to 52% tax, so even when you make more, youll get less on your bank account.\n\nIf GME and AMC dont squeeze i really dont know how to make my life worht living.
