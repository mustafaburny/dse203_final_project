        "body": "The problem is, intel is getting left behind in PC/laptop  processors by aapl. Apple is on a league of its own, and someone like nvdia or Qualcomm will create the M1 equivalent for PC.\n\n\nAnd the other problem as someone who works in Silicon Valley, in this industry and has a lot of friends in Intel is: \n\nIntel has been bleeding talent left and right for the last 5 years. \n\nIntel pays very low compared to Silicon Valley standards, that\u2019s partly because there is so much competition for talent from nvidia, apple, Qualcomm who are all killing it.  And as a big chunk of compensation is tied in RSUs, Intel cannot compete with salaries as these companies stocks have done extremely well. Apple\u2019s stock has gone up 300% in 5 years and if 30% of your compensation is RSUs, then you are basically getting 30-40% yoy raises for 5 years straight. No way Intel can keep up with that.\n\nIntel pays like 30-50% lower for a comparable position at apple. You just cannot retain top talent with that kind of a pay disparity. Anyone I know, who is talented enough and can leave Intel, has left Intel. \n\n\nIntel is seriously at the danger of becoming IBM of chip makers. Especially now, with amazon working on its own server chips, google working on its own, Microsoft is rumoured to be working on their own silicon for azure. Apparently Qualcomm is going to compete in PC processors. Intel is increasingly looking its in a death spiral. Google, Amazon, Microsoft can pay intel\u2019s top people 2x and poach them left and right. Because these companies are swimming in money form their other businesses.\n\n\nOne thing they have going for them is their fabs. With the increased attention to on shoring chip manufacturing, they should leverage that and start manufacturing chips from competitors for domestic consumption, especially like the defence industry. They have a healthy head start with chip manufacturing infrastructure and know how. They should lean into that. The days of them competing to make the best processors in the world is over.",

On top of that they have to compete to get contracts. The downside to this is that the number of contracts can be sporadic and unreliable. To my knowledge there isn\u2019t much, if any, advantage to choosing Ericsson versus Nokia components. Further, BofA recently came out with their 14 moonshot technologies report that said 5G will be the shortest cellular generation before we move into 6G. Also, the S&amp;P has risen 26% in the last year (98% in last 5 years) and Ericsson has risen 3.9% in the past year (54% in last 5 years) so it\u2019s significantly trailing the market. If you are dead set on 5G, I\u2019d suggest looking in $FIVG because they own holdings that have performed greater than Ericsson. Take a look at $FIVG holdings like apple, google, or semi companies like $AVGO, $QCOM.",

MS is not throwing money at laptop CPUs, maybe some custom designs like they already did with AMD (Xbox) and Qualcomm (Surface Pro X) though that's usually overrated. It would take years just to build a CPU from scratch. It took Google about five years to release a mobile CPU and it's just a modified Exynos. Also, Google and Apple need their own CPU for their own reasons, I don't see a reason why MS would need its own CPU and go against partners (Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Samsung).",

Slow down your trades and take a pause and regroup . Invest in undervalued with good growth and hang on or just go with an index ETF .it is boring letting your money grow on its own but its also much easier and generates much less transaction fees along with its easier to file your tax return each year .\nThat trading mentality takes a while to control but it can be done . \nI would rather hold smaller portions of 25 stocks then large portions of 3 stocks.\nI don't don't think about diversification in the same way others might . I use 5 stocks as a minimum per sector \nAmd Nvidia ON intc qrvo as an example for semi conductors.  Pick any sector and find your favorite 5 \nIt takes time to do this .\nI'm sorry though that after 15 years your still negative on your account. \nI'd wait until next year before investing in anything \nLet this market get extremely oversold and then  after your break and time to regroup and come up with a new longer term strategy use the next 3 years to implement that new strategy. \nTrading is about being disaplinned number 1 \nSwing trading longer term trades and disaplinned with wider parameters . \nLong term investing also disaplined and like swing trading wider parameters .\nAfter 15 years of trading I'll assume you grasp the basics. \nSo stick to daily weekly and monthly charts and learn to look at quarterly or even years charts .\nThe patterns are the same the entry and exit points are the same . The difference is how long it takes for the pattern to set up and develop and how long it takes before the move is complete. \nUse the next several months to take in your 15 years of experience and re design it on paper by writing it all down without even looking at a chart. \nThen just learn to wait and be bored .\nThe waiting is the hardest part ! \nGood luck no matter what choice you make",

Early August there was a crazy AMD bull run that caused a big spread between the stock values and conversion ratio (as much as a 40% upside of holding Xilinx shares when AMD hit 120). Idk exactly what the catalyst was at that time, but I imagine the WSB hype added to the push (+good Q2). The stocks have been moving very similarly apart from that bull run. \n\nIts impossible to say how aware of the full picture the average retail investor is, but my guess is that they've barely heard of Xilinx whilst AMD is more of a household name. \n\nCheck out this link for ratio movement over time: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio",

AMD is a ant company compare to Intel, Samsung and TSMC. On top of that China SMIC is growing like a weed. This is why Lisa Su is trying to close the deal with Xilinx. She knows they need them to survive. It is though to be in semiconductor business. PLTR on the other has a huge moat it is national security business with next to zero competitor. However, the big issues with PLTR is that it is not a new company and yet its grow is extremely slow. They need to get more commercial clients if they plan to grow.",

My 2nd largest position is in AMD.\n\nMy plan is to try to milk whatever mini-bull rally happens prior to November 2nd. I see October 20th or 21st as the last chances to exit before everybody starts to get really nervous about November 2nd. Starting Monday, I only have about 8 or 9 more market days for half this portfolio.\n\nThen I might be jumping 100 percent to cash. This of course will be a temporary move, but I'm expecting November and December to just be months that most stock enthusiasts would like to forget. So, it's going to take a lot of discipline for me to hold out for the real lows that I'm expecting (at least 25 percent of all-time highs).\n\nBasically, I think when I buy back in either in November or December, I will load the boat with XLNX shares over AMD shares, but who knows if the spread will be as big then?

They are gaining market share, but the lack of supply actually saves their rival at the moment. Similarly they'd have no problem selling more CPUs in the laptop/desktop market, chips for the PS5 or hugely in demand GPUs (even though nvidia still has an edge there). \n\nThey'll also buy Xilinx, which adds some nice synergies with the FPGAs. I feel like they most of all need to work on their software and GPUs, but they kind of already have the product range that nvidia would like to achieve by purchasing ARM (which so far doesn't seem to happen).",

I've traded the stock back and forth since February, and I can tell you that the stock was mostly not doing much of anything for long stretches, and then it finally had a big breakout, that pushed it above $100. This happened in this most recent 6 month period, so it seems like AMD is this outstanding performer in the most recent 6 months, but for 4 of those months, it didn't do much of anything.\n\nI still love AMD by the way. One of my favorite stocks going forward.\n\n(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",
