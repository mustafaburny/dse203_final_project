You\u2019d think all of the posts of people getting into AMD, TSLA, SQ, DKNG etc... early only to regret selling for a measly 20% gain, would be a lesson for future investors to just hold onto their assets and not trade so damn much. \n\nBut I still see the same exact horror story being posted on this sub daily. Someone getting into a high quality company early and then selling early. Only to see it become far more valuable months/years later.",

Or MSFT/TSLA/LMND right before it they took off after trading sideways for a while. \n\n The best performing portfolios tend to belong to those who have died or those who\u2019ve forgotten they even had a portfolio. Not those who actively trade. \n\n\nLastly you don\u2019t know whether or not a company will suddenly do a complete 180 like AMD when Lisa Su took over or MSFT when Satya took over.

My favorite this year is  SQ I bought during the march dip @ 43$ sold at 90$  Flipped the profits into Square 6/2021 leaps back in July and of course paper handed those as well and sold at a small loss.   Disney Leaps?  Yup had those too right after Covid.  OF course fucked them off as well and couldn't stick to the course.

I've recouped all that and I'm actually up 20% all-time since I stopped doing that and switched to long term options (12 to 18 months). Less exciting for sure but so much safer and passive. Also, red days become your friend: just DCA your position on red days. Sleep like a baby at night.\n\nMy next major position will be INTC. This sub and most of reddit has written them off. But INTC still generates in a month what AMD does in a year. No way INTC doesn't hit $60 before Jan 2023. IV is probably the lowest among the tech stocks. Gonna load up to the tita on $60c Jan 2023 leaps. \n\nSee y'all in summer 2022 on my yacht. Good luck to everyone. I hope y'all win too.",

This flow had multiple critical improvements compared to the experience I had 6 and 18 months prior. \n\nTheir web application is really getting better. I can see the innovation.

The word of the day for you fucking retards is GUIDANCE.  Chen needs to tell us what the revenue opportunity is with the Amazon partnership (aka IVY) HINT: IT IS HUUUUGE but also WHEN.  When will they make their first IVY dollar. If its in 2021, or even early 2022 watch your fucking butts boys rocket fuel for the quickest double this side of NIO.  \n\nMeanwhile on top of IVY, BB also has 1. a very decent cybersecurity platform  that contracts with major banks and government entities 2. a licensing portfolio that bring in hundreds of mill a year and 3. pending infringement lawsuits against FB and SNAP that if successful will result in a multi billion dollar award.  Everyone also likes their new president of sales from Citrix who is apparently starting to pull in real wins.   \n\nOP is correct, this stock should already be 30bill but boomers feel burnt and most people are still so fucking stupid they don't realize that BB exited the phone biz a few years ago (they license the phone to third parties).  Amazon is taking this partnership very seriously and it will soon be grabbing everyone's attention in a big way.  Open question is why Amazon or another company doesn't see the writing on the wall and buy BB for relatively cheap right now.  30B would get the job done.  Less than that and I don't think BB would do it.  I could go on but whatever, GLTA make money.",

Shopify has a smaller Global TAM and tons of cutthroat competitors.\n\nUpwork has a handful of competitors and in recent months they've reclaimed the mantle of software innovation - the examples top of mind are their cloning of Fiverr's structured marketplace, and their partnerships with Zoom and Citrix.\n\nI recently onboarded to Upwork for yet another company. This flow had multiple critical improvements compared to the experience I had 6 and 18 months prior. \n\nTheir web application is really getting better. I can see the innovation. Hayden Brown (their new CEO, spent a decade at Microsoft) is clearly focused on software excellence and this will be the global SaaS labor company.",

The word of the day for you fucking retards is GUIDANCE.  Chen needs to tell us what the revenue opportunity is with the Amazon partnership (aka IVY) HINT: IT IS HUUUUGE but also WHEN.  When will they make their first IVY dollar. If its in 2021, or even early 2022 watch your fucking butts boys rocket fuel for the quickest double this side of NIO.  \n\nMeanwhile on top of IVY, BB also has 1. a very decent cybersecurity platform  that contracts with major banks and government entities 2. a licensing portfolio that bring in hundreds of mill a year and 3. pending infringement lawsuits against FB and SNAP that if successful will result in a multi billion dollar award.  Everyone also likes their new president of sales from Citrix who is apparently starting to pull in real wins.   \n\nOP is correct, this stock should already be 30bill but boomers feel burnt and most people are still so fucking stupid they don't realize that BB exited the phone biz a few years ago (they license the phone to third parties).  Amazon is taking this partnership very seriously and it will soon be grabbing everyone's attention in a big way.  Open question is why Amazon or another company doesn't see the writing on the wall and buy BB for relatively cheap right now.  30B would get the job done.  Less than that and I don't think BB would do it.  I could go on but whatever, GLTA make money.",

E.g. if you loan out a security, and it pays a dividend while it is out on loan, the dividend will get paid to the short seller, but the short must contractually pay you that dividend. But now that quasi-dividend you receive is not going to be a \"qualified dividend\" for tax purposes. So Fidelity pays you a little extra in this case to make up for the tax hit.",

I should just wait till the 18th and execute right? 22.5 is nearly the redeemable value and I don't think we'll ever see it again tbh. How confident are we in the Q1 2021 time frame and should I even consider selling calls afterwards with Jan expiration? If so what strike seems safe? I'm pretty inclined to let it all ride after execution. Uncle Ackman's taking us to the promise land right? Stripe, Coinbase, Bloomberg, Robinhood, Fidelity all feels the same to me. Anyone else riding uncle ackmans mature unicorn ?",

The dude sounded completely annoyed like he was my dad and doing me a favor. He wasn't wrong in hindsight. I was like a chimp with a machine gun back then. I'm better now. But damn...let the monkey shoot his load if he wants.\n\nFidelity isn't a bad broker. But they're like strict parents. They're not quick to trust or forgiving if you throw a party and their risk department flags you as a retard. TD is like your friend's cool parents who don't really give a fuck. And Robinhood is the skeevy guy outside the liquor store selling fake IDs. That guy will hook you up with whatever you want. He's cool, but not really a friend.

They also don\u2019t have any emergency phone numbers for when your account is inevitably hacked. They don\u2019t charge any commissions... because they\u2019re frontrunning all of the trades.

Here are their margin rates: https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46376\n\nEven then, the rates are still pretty high compared to the rates on Treasuries and so you\u2019d mostly be betting on a decrease in interest rates. \n\nIf you REALLY want to leverage Teasuries, you should use futures. Very low implied financing. This is by far the best way for a retail trader to leverage Treasuries. The only downsides is that nominal contract values are pretty large so it gets a little difficult if you have a small account and you also have to know how to deal with futures in general i.e. they are quarterly contracts and not a real bond.",

Then you have the right to solicit the rest of the investor base to vote in a slate of directors that will do your bidding. \n\nHere\u2019s the fun part: the filing alone costs about $100k in filing fees and legal fees.

They charge $6.95 to buy shares, and charge $6.95 to sell the same shares. This will eat your profits for breakfast. You're paying for the software they sink a *lot* of money into. Just learning this now.)\n\nFidelity: Actually buying/selling. They don't charge to buy stocks. You can buy/sell stocks/options that are NOT available on Robinhood. Example: CBDD. Two days ago it was at **0.0001**. Today, it topped out at **0.029** If you got in at a low price and dropped $500 and sold at .029, you would have made like $800^^?^math profit.\n\nFidelity and RH for me.",

When CRSP formed as a company I scoffed at the idea because from a scientific perspective, we know the enzyme (cas9) that does the cutting to edit the genome will induce 1000s of cuts randomly throughout the genome, this happens even with high fidelity engineered cas9s too. I figured that without fixing this aspect of the system these random mutations would have serious effects in humans. We see this happen in cell culture and some times in mice too... I was a hater, and now I'm outside looking in. \n\nThat said, I think BEAM and EDIT have a lot of room to grow. BEAM's tech results in less off target mutations, so I like them a lot more. Their market cap is around 3B at the moment, and they just ran pretty hard Wednesday-Friday, so if they cool off a bit next week I'll look to pick up some shares.",

Bought more at 0.66, which I thought was too late but I'm over 100% gains now.  Now I'm just holding long and laughing as great deals keep getting announced and moving the price higher.  \n\nJust pay attention.. the things talked about today like FLT and PNG will take off eventually.  Be patient, and realize that it's gambling.  Buy a bunch of a cheap penny stock and hope it takes off.  Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.  If you want safe returns, don't play around with penny stocks.  \n\nMIR might go big, they're making a new class of pain killer that could disrupt the opiod industry.  Super cheap, might be worth a ton, but I've parked my money in there (and lost a bunch at this point) in the hopes their Phase 3 trials go great and this thing goes up 1000% in a year or two.",
