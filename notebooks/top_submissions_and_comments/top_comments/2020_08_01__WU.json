They view it as a store of wealth like a digital gold, not something that will ever overtake visa as a convenient way to purchase a cup of coffee. With that being said, it's arguable that bitcoin is actually easier to transact in than gold is atm. It's definitely easier to safely store and transfer Bitcoin than gold.",

You may get skeptical when you take a glance at their balance sheet but hear me out on this post. \n\nTo be a successful money transfer company, you must prefund offshore accounts in all countries where you do business. This means there is dormant capital sitting all around the world for this company and that's why they have been dragging their feet to get out of the hole. After Basel III, this dormant capital couldn't be claimed on the balance sheet as assets and they have struggled ever since. \n\nEnter the partnership Ripple in the summer of last year. They are a silicon valley company that utilizes a cryptocurrency to help solve this issue.  What they use is On Demand Liquidity (ODL) which allows them to execute transactions through cryptocurrency in real time to allow cross border payments to settle within minutes as opposed to the old way, which would take 3-5 days (with large fees). For example, A Purchase of XRP from USD and a sell of XRP to MXN (USD&gt;XRP--XRP&gt;MXN). This is important because this beats out the big daddy in the money transfer industry (WU) and ODL will allow offshore accounts to be depleted and will free up millions of capital for this company. At the time of writing, ODL is only handling 10% of the USD-MEX corridor (out of 10,000+ corridors). I think there is much room to grow for both companies but since I can buy Ripple stock, I'll invest in their partners.",

Also the connections they have to Chinese government as well as huge corporations related to EV, mining, infrastructure industries, tackling transportation and logistics, etc.\n\nChina's most sacred thing for a man is his status in society, look up Bruno Wu, his wife Yang Lan, her father Yan Mingfu, China's Blue Sky project.. connect the dots.",

They're also working with two of the largest energy suppliers in the fucking world to convert gas stations to include charge stations in exchange for a cut of the charge revenue.\n\nThat's the other part of their appeal. They're conducting their business in a very clever way, working with big oil so they can stay in the energy game with fossil fuels on their way out the door. Plus they fractionalize ownership of fleet vehicles to make it easier for companies to convert by the government mandated deadlines, they're working with the electric mine project and taking a 5-8% cut of some battery sales (usually 40% of the total cost of some EVs.)\n\nThey're laying themselves over every foundation of fast, efficient, cost effective green energy which is also going to box out competition. On the same note the McMahon's (Shane, founder) are very well connected in Asia and his mother is on the energy council in the United States. Bruno Wu (Chairman) is very well connected as well, and his wife is very powerful also, most recently as a board member for government ran Sun Media. \n\nThere are faster plays out there, undoubtedly, but in the market this one going up is about as sure a thing as you can get.",

Western Union has a very large slice of the market share and they are more profitable with fees from the old tech. They will continue to use the old tech until the other money transfer services begin to eat up their market share. Western Union is aware of the potential of this tech and they even had a rumor going around that there were going to buy out MGI (big reason why MGI exploded in the last few months).   \n\n\nTo answer your question, small companies will have to adopt and WU will hold out as long as they can until inevitably they will adopt too. A big barrier right now is that the crypto space lacks the liquidity needed to make this successful on a large scale. There just isn't enough liquidity for the biggest money transfer corridors (India, Philippians).",

IDEX leverages government subsidy funds to aid in the development of state-operated businesses and services into a transition into the electric vehicle market. IDEX is also working with its partners to transition China\u2019s current fossil fuel system into a system that will support it\u2019s New Energy Vehicle (NEV) infrastructure with the use of charging stations and advances in battery technology. Bruno Wu a Chinese media mogul is a pioneer in the blockchain movement in China and as China continues to grow its use of the technology I believe what IDEX is doing is only more relevant. With the extensions of government subsidy focused on state-controlled public transportation and commercial equipment (mining) The system, in which IDEX has setup will only grow over time as the Chinese NEV market grows into its goals.\n\nMilestone completed by IDEX\n\nIt\u2019s development and management of GT Dollar (used in Thailand in Malaysia worth $70 billion USD)\nSigning a three years exclusive contract with China\u2018s biggest electric bus operator, National Transportation Capacity Co Ltd (NTS).

Also, supply 5G and charging need to the market (upgrading China\u2019s current infrastructure.)\n\n---\n\n\nCatalyst comment:\n\nChina initiated its 3 year Blue Skies Program in April 2020 which aimed at delivering the following:\n\nInner Mongolia: Plan to promote the application (adoption) of 100,000 new energy vehicles throughout the region. (IDEX PR)\n\nListen to CEO Alf Poor discuss company operations in mining trucks in Inner Mongolia (source CleanTech)\n\n\nShandong Province: All buses will be replaced with new energy vehicles by the end of 2020. The broader target is for the number of clean energy vehicles to reach 500,000 in 2022.\nJiangsu Province: Plans to promote the adoption of 250,000 clean energy vehicles. By the end of 2020, charging infrastructure to support 200,000 electric vehicles will be in place. Ideanomics' MEG is actively involved in this effort through its charging station initiative with PetroChina in Nanjing \u2013 a major city in Jiangsu province.\nGuangdong Province: By the end of 2020, new energy buses in Guangdong will account for more than 75% of all buses, and all Pearl River Delta cities will commence electrification adoption plans in 2020. Taxis in the Pearl River Delta are mandated to use new energy vehicles, of which pure electric vehicles will account for no less than 80% and increase by 5 percentage points year by year. IDEX order\nHainan Province: Electrification of the entire island by 2030. Hainan has introduced legislation banning the sale of fossil fuel vehicles by 2030, to ensure the adoption of new energy vehicles within the island.\nSichuan Province: Legislation has been passed to ban fossil fuel trucks in city centers. The city of Chengdu has assumed a leadership role in the promotion and application of new energy vehicles in the logistics and distribution industries. From 2017, Chengdu phased in the gradual reduction of fossil fuel cargo vehicles into the city over three years. IDEX order w/ Unicorn, IDEX order 2\nGuangxi: The promotion of all new passenger cars as new energy vehicles. All passenger vehicles in national scenic spots and national tourist attractions must use new energy vehicles, through either replacement or conversion. Municipalities, enterprises, public institutions, sanitation, logistics, postal, and airport commuting areas are mandated to all procure only electric vehicles as fleet renewals occur.

See for example,\n* [Blockchain could improve transparency in Africa\u2019s commodity market](https://qz.com/africa/1401915/blockchain-could-help-africas-commodity-markets-says-ideanomics-ceo-bruno-wu/) - Quartz, September 2018\n* [Lessons to be learned from Ideanomics deal](https://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/bordonaro-lessons-to-be-learned-from-ideanomics-deal), Hartford Business Journal, July 13, 2020\n\nHere is what they say in their 2019 annual report:\n&gt;**Dr. Bruno Wu.** Our Chairman of the Board is an experienced investor, technology and media entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Dr. Wu has been actively involved with blockchain enabled and big data technologies since October 2011. After four years of investment and research, in 2015, Dr. Wu and Beijing Sun Seven Stars Culture Development Limited (\u201cSSS\u201d), an affiliate of Dr. Wu and a significant shareholder in our Company, proceeded to execute the strategy of becoming a leader in fintech and asset digitization services by aggregating AI, blockchain and other big data and cloud-based technologies, carefully sourced and selected on a global basis through joint ventures and partnerships. These partnerships focus on customizing and enabling actual business use case applications. Dr. Wu actively participated in the build out of a leading big data hub in Guiyang, China, particularly by endorsing the integration of AI and blockchain. Dr. Wu has committed to transforming our Company into a fintech and asset digitization services flagship, with multiple use case technology engines to be rolled out.\n\nNone of which is being promoted by the company a year later.\n\nThe real purpose of IDEX is to funnel money into Bruno Wu's other holdings. This is likewise revealed in their filings, some of which include:\n\n&gt;Effective on May 17, 2019, Ideanomics, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) entered into a Sale Agreement (the \u201cRed Rock Agreement\u201d) with Redrock Capital Group Limited, a Cayman Island based private company in which Dr. Bruno Wu, Chairman of Ideanomics, is the major shareholder...\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;On February 8, 2019, the Company entered into a convertible promissory note agreement with Sun Seven Stars Investment Group Limited (\u201cSSSIG\u201d), an affiliate of Dr. Wu, in the aggregate principal amount of $2,500,000...As of September 30, 2019, the Company received $1.3 million from SSSIG. The Company has not received the remaining $1.2 million as of December 31, 2019. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 the Company recorded interest expense of approximately $13,000 and $36,000 respectively related to this $2.5 million convertible promissory note.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;In September 2018, the Company entered a share purchase agreement with SSSIG and other persons for whom SSSIG acted as seller-representative (the \u201cSeller\u201d) to purchase common stock of Hooxi, an entity listed on the TSX venture exchange in Canada. The share purchase consisted of the following:\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt; On April 24, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% equity ownership in Shanghai GuangMing Investment Management (\u201cGuang Ming\u201d), a PRC limited liability company, for a total purchase price of $0.36 million in cash. One of the two selling shareholders is a related party, an affiliate of Dr. Wu. ...\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; In connection with our acquisition with Grapevine on September 4, 2018, Fomalhaut Limited (\u201cFomalhaut\u201d), a British Virgin Islands company and an affiliate of Bruno Wu (\u201cDr. Wu\u201d), the Chairman of the Company, is the non-controlling equity holder of 34.35% in Grapevine (the \u201cFomalhaut Interest\u201d)...\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;On September 7, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase FinTalk Assets with Sun Seven Star International Limited, a Hong Kong company and an affiliate of Dr. Wu... The purchase price for Fintalk Assets is $7.0 million payable with $1.0 million in cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock with a fair market value of $6.0 million. The Company paid $1.0 million in October 2018 and recorded in prepaid expense.",

All the time puppet CEOs and now its ALF who speaks shit and never delivers.\n\nSuccessful in a very short time?.. you must be day dreaming and definately dont meaning for successful invesetment. This stock popped in 2016-2017 during crypto hype and in june -jul 2020 fir Ev hype. Other than that same old lies by management.\n\nBy the way how much you guys get paid for sugarcoating chinese hustle scams and loot americans money?",

Yang, who had been frequently interviewed by Bannon\u2019s Breitbart, recently turned her attention to Bruno Wu-controlled Ideanomics (15). \n\n&gt;Yang published a negative research article that criticized the company\u2019s efforts, including abandoning plans for a $283 million fintech campus in West Hartford, Conn., a move Ideanomics said was due to higher than expected site remediation costs. Yang peppered her reports with such terms as \u201cspectacular failure\u201d and \u201cover promised and under delivered\u201d. The timing is interesting as her negative report on Ideanomics was published at the same time as Wu was suing Guo.\n\n&gt;Dumping on Chinese companies is a favorite tactic of Yang\u2019s and has sometimes ended in spectacular failure. As far back as 2014 she disparaged Alibaba and beginning in 2015 did the same thing to JD.com.\"",
