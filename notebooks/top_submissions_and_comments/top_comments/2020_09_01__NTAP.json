        "body": "I was invested in QCOM in 1998 and many tech stocks during the 1st DOT-COM bubble.  SEBL, NTAP, CREE...all good companie. CREE, NTAP and QCOM still exist and are doing very well.  SEBL was bought by oracl maybe 7 to 10 years ago.\n\nBut companies can do very well and still lose 90% of their stock value.  Every one of those stocks, and in fact the entire NASDAQ lost 90% of its value from its peak in the 2000 NASDAQ bubble.  Some of those companies have not seen their 2000 bubble stock prices despite running perfectly good companies and experiencing 2 more 'tech bubbles' in the preceding 20 years.\n\nNTAP has reached about half its 2000 stock price in the preceding 20 years, CREE about the same it looks like.  QCOM has done the best-- it just recently exceeded its 2000 all time high, but it took 20 years to do so, meaning if you bought the stock any time near its bubble peak and held through the crash thinking it would someday return a value, you would have been right.  After 20 years of holding,  in the last couple months you would have finally seen a small return, a much worse return than holding treasuries bonds, but not a loss I guess.\n\nThe point is valuation does matter, and a business can be a good business and run perfectly fine and in a great environment for what it sells, but if you buy at an extreme premium you may not see a return on your money, even after holding for 20 years and that company performing its business well .\n\nTSLA may very well be a great company, but it seems like it is priced like as if its going to be the only car company in the world with high margins to boot.  It feels very much like QCOM to me- in fact QCOM split 4-1 after a relentless run up and then immediately began to tank, bringing the market down with it shortly after.\n\nQCOM had a patent on a tremendous and pioneering technology that other companies had to pay (and still do) royalties on, this was challenged and won in many court battles.  A technology that would go in billions of phones eventually and was/is a very well run business.\n\n  I don't even know if the same could be said for TSLA honestly, they may be well run, but they don't have a patent that they can force other companies to use or pay on..but in any case, that's beside the point.  The point is that valuations really do matter.  The average investor in 2000 because people were so heavily weighted in technology lost 85% of their portfolio value.  That takes a long time to recover from.  You have to make 100% gain if you lose 50% of your money, then suddenly you realize you are almost 50 years old....don't waste time, it feels like you have forever, but it goes fast, I promise.",
