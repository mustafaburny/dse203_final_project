Analog chips have a long life cycle, sometimes 10 years plus, so these companies aren't in a constant technology cycle race. As a result they basically mint money off existing tech. \n\nNot as glamorous, but their chops go into everything. 5g, cars, phones, satellites, industry... basically all growing fields.",
