Creative Cloud is okay.. but its clunky and people don't like paying subscription and they don't like dealing with millions of passwords on an enterprise level etc. Adobe could be great.. but they need to do something big.... although every lawyer on the planet uses Acrobat and calls it Adobe. \"Do you have adobe?\"... Yet acrobat itself is kind of clunky as well.   \n\n\nBut who is their rival? If you look it up.. None of those companies have much to do with creating content: \"Adobe's top competitors include SAP, Salesforce, DocuSign, Dropbox, Getty Images, Shutterstock, Apple, Microsoft, IBM and Autodesk.

If you do any broad based index fund investing then you are undoubtedly invested in tobacco and alcohol companies.  Tobacco is linked to the 5 leading causes of death in America (likely same in Canada).  Alcohol is related to 50% of all fatal car accidents in America (likely same in Canada).  If you wear sneakers or any type of clothing you would be surprised what type of at best adult and at worst child sweat shops they are made from in third-third world companies. If you like green energy you would be surprised at how much oil is needed to make green energy products.\n\nTrust me NO ONE really can stand on a pedestal in this day in age.  Just matters what you accept and what you choose to not be cognizant of in your daily life.  Running a google search itself consumes energy (carbon footprint).  I doubt you are outside planting trees to make up for it.    \n\nBTW, sticking to this discussion.  How many water wells has Disney (part owner) and Nat Geo dug or paid for in Namibia vs. RECAF?  RECAF cares about making money, but as far as I know they have done more for the Namibian people then Nat Geo does/has despite the latter making millions of their story to sell articles. \n\nThe problem with the green folks is they are ALWAYS hypocritical.  How did those journalist get to Namibia to do the article?  They flew.  Did they plant trees or pay for conversion of methane gases in landfills to make their flights carbon neutral?  Nope.  \n\nJust keep in mind the old adage if you point one finger at someone there are 3 pointing right back at you.",

Allow me to pop your cherry and encourage any of you to proof me wrong. \n\n1. 60% plus of their loans are approved and financed by 1 shady ass bank (Cross River Bank) which also finances most of the loans for shitty fintech companies like Affirm &amp; CoinBase. \n\n2. 65% of their referrals also come form one company (Intuit - INTU) via their Credit Karma platform. At any point INTU can decide to go in to lending and destroy little UPST. \n\n3. 20% of UPST is owned by one hedge fund (Third Point) they invested in UPST back in 2005 and they also own a large chunk of Sentinel One which is going public in the next month.  So if you think they won\u2019t sell think twice.  Also with 20% ownership and only 50% of the outstanding shares able to trade prior to lockup well now you know how they drive to price so high.  \n\n4. Lastly it trades at 45X Sales in 2020 that shit was allowed in 2021 the market is gonna smell blood and decimate them.",
