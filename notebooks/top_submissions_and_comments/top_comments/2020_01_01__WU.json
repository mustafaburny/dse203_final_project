Ya'll jump to tinfoil hat conspiracy theories instead of thinking if it was actually possible.

On the opening of the Chinese market a drop is expected as investors will sell ( the market was closed since the start of the epidemy ). There is an obvious change on the customer sentiment and uncertainity on production as cities are closed, borders are closed for Chinese citizens and factories closed.\n\nThe Chinese society, as a consumer, affects indirectly all economies that export to China/ source materials/ parts from Chinese businesses and directly sell to an expected richer and richer Chinese middle class as a consumer.\n\nIn my opinion, which I stated before, the stock market is going to undergo a strong correction due to these reasons.\n\nAdditionally to my initial comment, as of now, and when the US having it's current state of debt, any harsh situation that'd affect the US job market could be the turning point into a recession. I'm not a doomsayer, but look at the increase on revenue of businesses on S&amp;P 500 and their increase on valuation. It's due for a correction. I'm not saying it will happen now, but certainly it can happen and this fact itself creates uncertainty in some investors. There are some pre-readjustment signs from Friday (even when it's early to say) the US stock market had its worst day since October 2017 (I don't know the exact date). Imagine that Monday will be worse out of the reasons I mention, the sentiment is going to change and stocks are going to be dropping to more realistic valuations.\n\nI'm not saying this will happen, I'm saying it might,so better check your open positions and real valuations based on fundamentals and how much they depend on China (ie: AMD, Tesla).\n\nIf you want my opinion, Monday will be the start of a readjustment and it will be way worse than Friday.\n\nLet's see tomorrow :)",

The patient\u2019s test result also turned negative, the doctor said.\n\nThailand has 19 confirmed cases for coronavirus infection - 11 are still hospitalized and the rest have returned home. The nation is also monitoring 311 possible cases in hospitals as of Sunday, according to a health ministry statement.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Chanvirakul said Sunday that the nation will repatriate more than 100 people from Wuhan on Feb. 4 after they pass medical screening in China.

Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits.

And it doesnt. I have the stock, and lost some money... just not all of it, but I also gain very little if im right.\n\n100 shares of AMD that go up 3$, means I gained 300$.

They are pretty much one of the few vendors that are going from cloud to client (all aspects of 5g into one standard architecture) also Lisa Su (amd) just joined the board and they are pushing this silicon one project (the next gen scale-able programmable routing asic that is ready for  5g+, quantum computing, 16k streaming, etc etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlittle dd for you u/5generic_name, not sure if its gonna actually come true of course!",
