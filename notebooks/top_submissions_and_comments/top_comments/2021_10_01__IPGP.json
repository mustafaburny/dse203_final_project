BABA being a $150 stock today is also because of uncertainty. No one in Wallstreet knows if Xi will simply break up the company. Wallstreet  again could care less about politics, you call me naive yet you reference YouTube as a place where you think anti Chinese sentiment is driving the equities markets. Are you listening to yourself? Wallstreet doesn't care what some random Youtuber with 200 subs feels about China. It's all about earnings reports and going through them with a fine tooth comb. However when a good company like BABA is being attacked by a whole ass country, smart money gets out and waits to see what shoe will drop next. No amount of great earnings reports can combat Xi deciding to simply shut down BABA. As far as you not wanting Chinese stocks in Western markets, be careful what you wish for, the only reason BABA's market cap is what it is today is because of Western money. If all Chinese stocks get delisted, they lose 95% of their value instantly. China alone will not be able to keep BABA's MC $500 bil+",

        "body": "Oh, it'll definitely be difficult, but the trend since the start of September has been down and being held down by its 10 and 20-day ma. Right now, investors are selling every rally. $420 would be a stopping point, but if Spy was going to go for it, then $412 would be the ultimate target for this drop. That'll reset a lot of stocks and create the buying opportunity to take this to record levels.",
