        "body": "I think a better question would be, what is wrong with our hiring and employment practices? \n\nFor perspective, I am an operations manager for a Fortune 500 company, and I oversee around 300-350 employees on average who make between $30-40/hr with good benefits. \n\nIs the problem that corporations are holding too close to archaic wage, hiring, and management practices? Or is the real problem that \"Working Class\" people are fed up with either underpaid, undervalued, or having their sense of job security taken away. I mean honestly how dare the working class want something better. \n\nMost companies have not worked to create good company cultures. What I have seen over my working career in many industries is that employees are often undervalued by their managers and companies. Employees are not given clear paths for progression and have been beaten down with wage stagnation to protect and promote stock growth. Even at $40/hr our attrition rates are getting rough due to labor and wage practices.\n\nCurrent hiring practices are also to blame. Why do we have three interviews for a job that pays minimum wage? If you think that is bad, try applying for white collar or skilled jobs, where it takes not only multiple interviews, but MONTHS of waiting to find out if you got the job or not. Automated software is also to blame. It often removes dozens of valid candidates from the hiring lists in the attempt to find \"perfect\" candidates. \n\nThen comes 2020. Large sectors of the economy are labeled \"non-essential\" and are told to go home. In an instant, millions of people were told they are not an important part of the economy and their jobs could be taken away arbitrarily thus reducing their feelings of job security. \n\nAll of these factors and more have contributed to a massive amount of unfilled jobs. HR departments won't scrap non-working hiring practices, CEO's won't raise wages to attract talent, and our Government has yet make a concerted effort to regain public trust. \n\nDo I feel annoyed that people took the last few months to evaluate their participation in the workforce and aren't at Starbucks filling my order? Or do I understand that many took the time to create financial stability in other sectors and leave jobs where they were either undervalued, underpaid, or the government took their sense of job security?\n\n I do not feel sorry for companies that fail to recognize a shift in \"working class\" values. \n\nAlso, for the person who decided to make money off of investing and replaced their income, Good for you! I am glad you found a way to make income that you enjoy.",

My wife rarely talks about her childhood but as I understand it, she literally grew up in a mud hut structure.\n\nHer mom and dad worked 70 hours a week and had to send her to go live with her evil aunt (her words) who treated her worse than her kids even though her mom was giving her like $15 of the $20 working a month to watch her. At dinner, her Aunt would give the kids a candy but not her type of stuff all the time.\n\nMy wife worked her ass off going to school 6 out of 7 days a week for 12 hours. She got scholarships to go to University in Canada and the US, she got a free ride to a PHD program.\n\nHer parents worked hard, saved almost every penny. Her parents got a free condo for growing up on the land the Chinese government is building on and they have 2 more condos, one they live in and one they rent. \n\nI get why Chinese people are stereotyped to be cheap and I believe it's a lot of what you said. They worked so hard for their money so they protect it by any means necessary. \n\nOn the other side of the coin tho, my wife did not go to a real university party until she met me at 24. She basically had no fun and her life was completely centered around work until than. I did the completely opposite, partied all the time and in the end we both make the same salary. However, she had to compete against tens of millions of other students while I was privileged compared to her with a middle class upbringing.",

        "author": "Away_Expression_1852",
        "body": "Let's say that you are absolutely correct and do a little theoretical even-handed math.\n\nSo for October 8th I went and looked at the 138 put for AAPL. The current price is 142.58. So the shift would be -$4 in a week. That's not unheard of for AAPL. That's delta .20 and that is selling for about 65. The put that is about 80 is the 139 put for AAPL and is delta .24. Okay.\n\nSo let's look at what this really means. You are willing to collect $80 to risk paying $13,900 as of this writing. As the price goes up (which you hope it does) that amount you're willing to risk rises but your premium, that $80, doesn't. Okay.\n\nSo here's the rub. If you are willing to sell these puts that means that you don't think the price will fall but if that's the case why not just the calls for the risk that you're putting up? Remember that you're making $80(26) for a risk of $13,900 at this time so that means that conversely you should be rationally willing to put *up to* $13,900 on the line in long options to profit $2,080 in one year.\n\nBut let's really dig into what these two bets would be rationally. Because you are doing this over the course of a year you have something on your side with the *calls* rather than the puts which is time. You can buy a 9/15/23 $140C  for approx. 2.4k so up to 5 about one year out from today with a target return on these slightly ITM calls of 17.3%. I am no wizard but I can promise you that if you did that, risking only \\~$12,000, you would make that money. That's a safe bet in my opinion. That's just one good day and boom, you made your money. But the thing I want you to pay attention to here is the number of trades you have to put on here: 1. One trade. One profit target. Set your limit and walk away. Nothing to manage.\n\nIn your other strategy you have to put on 26 trades. That's 26 chances for things to go against you and cost you however much in the case that you are wrong. Certainly you can close early and such and may be able to skirt death all year long but you're not guaranteed the $80 tag for the .2 delta and you certainly aren't guaranteed that you won't get assigned which will, at the moment, cost you $13,900.00. But there's something that you have to keep notice of; delta is not a \"number\", it is a concept, and it is anything but steady. Your .2 delta today could be .5 tomorrow and that's the problem in my opinion. You didn't detail to me an exit point for when things are going sour and it doesn't like you really thought that through. In fact I would pose that you did the opposite; you decided that the market would cooperate with you (exactly how you die in this game) and detailed not really a \"plan\" so much as a \"dream\". You told me your dream. You did not tell me a plan. You dream of getting $80 biweekly from selling these puts but there's no reason to believe that's anywhere near realistic because you're ignoring things like events throughout the year. What will you do during earnings? Or AAPL day for instance? Their expos? Releases of products? Disappoints and losses of landmark cases?\n\nI didn't type all of this to put you down. I typed it all because you need to really think about this at this depth (at least); you're not really \"thinking\" about it, you're suggesting it, kind of poking around with the bear, but not even aware that it's a bear. You act like it's a fluffy sheep. I recommend that you *think* about it. Do not take this as an attack. Do not mistake this as chiding. You will do what you want to do but please, *please* try to unplug yourself for a moment from your emotions and \"ownership of the idea\" and pretend it's your worst enemy asking you for advice. If you would say, \"Yeah, do that.\" it's a bad idea.\n\nAlways, *always* think of the inverse of your own ideas. If you're willing to put on 26 trades for a 17% profit over the course of a year why would you *not* be willing to put on 1 trade for a 17% profit, the same 17% profit, over the course of the *same* year?",

        "body": "I tend to disagree with the hyperinflation narrative. If you look at currencies that fail throughout history, it ultimately is due to loss of confidence in the structural integrity of the economy that begins the cycle. Usually the political and socioeconomic backdrop is incredibly compromised (Venezuala, Zimbabwe, Weimar) or is recovering from extensive printing to finance war debts (also Weimar, greyback/greenback, continentals). The CERB, CEBA, CEWA payments were to prevent mass unemployment, homelessness, basically general economic collapse. It wasn't enriching people or business, it was helping them keep their heads above water. \n\nIn my humble opinion, people are also giving way to much attention to the relationship between QE and inflation, of which there isn't much evidence. Keep in mind, all the money is ending up in the banking system, not the consumers pocket. The general result of this is asset inflation (higher stock prices, lower short and long term bond yields, higher leverage leading to higher real estate prices). The average Canadian/American doesn't have much access to this liquidity unless they take out a loan, but that is usually used to finance a home or vehicle purchase (both areas that are absolutely inflated).\n\nI think there are major deflationary backdrops in the global economy that have given developed nations the luxury of being able to print the hell out of their currencies without consequence. This won't go on forever, and we will return to more normal interest and growth rates, and a general market crash or recession can pull liquidity out of the markets too. I'm honestly not all that concerned about hyperinflation. High inflation over the short term? Perhaps, but not collapse of the USD. \n\nIn regards to the BTC argument, I will say this: there is absolutely no correlation between BTC and inflation. Literally almost 0. The highest correlation BTC has with another financial asset? The S&amp;P 500. It is a high risk speculative asset, not a store of value or financial safehaven. Please don't treat it that way, as you are likely to lose a lot of money on paper if/when markets correct. The number one pumpers of BTC that are feeding these false narratives have no financial or economic education other than googling \"what is M2\" and now they are apprently experts, and they also have the vast majority of their net worth in BTC...so obviously they are going to say whatever they can to get the asset to go up in value. Major conflict of interest, and if they were publically pumping the price of a stock this way, the SEC would have them in prison instantly and banned from financial markets for life. My honest to God advice is block Michael Saylor (proven conman and fraud), Dan Held, Pomp, and anyone else who constantly pumps BTC's tires and refuses to listen to any counter arguments from experts in the field. It screams narcissism and cultish behavior, and people are all too eager to listen because they think BTC=\"freedom\" (it doesn't) or the whole world becoming wealthy (it won't). Tread very carefully in this space, it is far from a guarantee. Disclaimer: I also dislike Peter Schiff, so hopefully that appeases some of you \ud83d\ude02. \n\nGood luck investing my friends :)",

If anything having the threshold there encourages people to overextend themselves to qualify. Dumping your life savings into your brokerage account or borrowing money to YOLO options is the last thing they want. The way you lock out retail is limit options to accredited investors, people with $1m+ or making over $200k a year.\n\nIMO they\u2019ll probably just make an example of the gamification brokers like Robinhood and WeBull, and continue letting TD/Schwab/etc go about business as usual.

See the conflict of interests? The hedge fund that seeks to profit off of shorting companies with thousands of workers to the ground (not all companies, they don\u2019t just short) is also the market maker that can manipulate all your buy orders coming in or sell orders coming in to skew the results in their favor and they don\u2019t have to report shit going through their dark pool where 35-50 percent of market orders go through. Also market makers can naked short if they need shares to fill an order when needed but is citadel really going to do produce synthetics of a company just so you can buy more of a company that they are actively shorting? No, they\u2019re gonna keep doing it till you get bored or panic stricken and drop your position.  This market is a fraud. Ken is a economic terrorist.",

I\u2019m highly certain it will be a green week. My only concern is the last 2 times we pulled back and I made this prediction we had clear sky above. The top is well defined now so that may add some pressure to take price lower in October. I\u2019d rather buy on Monday than liquidate tho.",

Keeping 5-10% of portfolio in cash. This is kind of where I'm at now as I have a decent investment horizon left and a sizeable portfolio so this allows me to take advantage of market corrections.\n\nConservative: for those less into risks or with a few years left in their investing careers before retiring and needing income, around 80/20 defensive to growth mix.

Wallstreet  again could care less about politics, you call me naive yet you reference YouTube as a place where you think anti Chinese sentiment is driving the equities markets. Are you listening to yourself? Wallstreet doesn't care what some random Youtuber with 200 subs feels about China. It's all about earnings reports and going through them with a fine tooth comb. However when a good company like BABA is being attacked by a whole ass country, smart money gets out and waits to see what shoe will drop next. No amount of great earnings reports can combat Xi deciding to simply shut down BABA. As far as you not wanting Chinese stocks in Western markets, be careful what you wish for, the only reason BABA's market cap is what it is today is because of Western money. If all Chinese stocks get delisted, they lose 95% of their value instantly. China alone will not be able to keep BABA's MC $500 bil+",

They need to work to stop losing money before spending a dime on R&amp;D before thinking about net profitability. \n\nDirect contracting is very close to zero margin business, and so is MA. How are they going to somehow turn this shit show net profitable in a year?",

My concern was a dive perhaps to the 200 day MA and I did what I had to do to protect myself. Obviously then both reclaimed the 100 day and look posed for a strong bounce come Monday. Either way, I will likely sit out until a clear upward trend is established, above 444 on SPY and I\u2019ll have no choice but to reenter.",

He should have been more diplomatic, that was stupid from his side. Sorry about youtube, i of course meant google not youtube. Wallstreet is nothing itself but a pit of money feeded by the investors from the entire world (not only america). Investors are scared by some american medias that spread shit on google non stop about china. I already wrote them to first clean up their own shit in their own country. I know some investors that dont go to america anymore and go e.g. to hong kong, this is surely what i will do if america keeps on going with such behaviour. China is not crazy, they wont kill their promosing businesses/economy. They currently have a big issue with their poor and they need to regulate, like every country in the world.",
