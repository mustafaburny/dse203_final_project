I could have made so much more if I wasn\u2019t worried about averaging up. I think a lot of that was due to RH and me being new but RH stats focus so much on cost basis and total % gain. I wanted those to be good and lost sight of what I was trying to do, make money.\n\nI\u2019ve since left them and make better decisions with my money. sometimes.",

By the end of that August week of 2019, I ended up losing over $375K. I took what was leftover to try again and kept blowing it, and blew it all the way back to $10K.   \n\n\nSeptember was rough, the feeling of depression and anxiety that you might be experiencing is what I went through, however, I was determined to try again. I took the money leftover to try again, and this time I played stocks that got shorted, and lost it again by the end of the year. \n\nI was able to find some money in accounts and put together a small account to try again, and I played earnings in Jan/Feb of 2020, and I had my single biggest gain on an ER Report, $375K in two hours on trusty 'ol $ENPH. I mitigated some risk, withdrew money, sold off a lot of my portions and made sure not to make the same mistake again. \n\nFor me, I learned how to read charts better, mitigate my risk to not play heavy in options, and not be caught up in trying to make up the money. It's about the learning experience, and each day, as long as you make money slowly, you'll be able to get back up. Getting up is the hard part, but putting pressure on yourself to get back resulted in multiple mistakes that have been costly.

So although the US market is extremely lucrative for solar, MAXN has a lot of different revenue streams outside of the US. For instance they own 20% of a very large Joint Venture with a chinese semiconductor company, and as of now most of their revenue comes from outside of the states.\n\nSecond point is that the hype (or lack thereof) won't matter much if they sustain growth and turn cash flow positive. A good example of this is Enphase, still within solar admittedly with a different core business: once they turned positive in EBITDA the valuation has absolutely soared (feel free to take a look at ENPH stock for the last few yrs).\n\nMAXN has over a billion in tangible assets and fairly limited debt, in my opinion it is a hidden gem at these valuations.",

Since you seem to be trying to program something in an algorithm to estimate the future I would say you need to look into analysts recommendations, for the purpose of estimating the future they are the ones that big business use, big fish use.  In general if a stock (Revenues or Profits) are growing faster than the market, a higher P/E will follow, as people assume that growth will continue for longer.\n\nDiscounted Cash flow will work also but you always have an issue with the Pt+1 (again, this is where Analysts Recommendations will play a role).  An interesting stock to study and you will only need to study its trajectory for two year is ENPH.  Good luck!",

Me being from the outside looking in, the business model of installing solar panels in individual homes seems inefficient. Why don't companies and state governments  prefer a central solar farm and having consumers get tax credits from buying energy from solar companies? When coal or petrol generators came out no one thought to put them in every single suburban home. I understand that people can save on bills and increase housing valuations but is that enough to try to generate power on your own?\n\nI like to think that renewable energy will be part of the future but I am hesitant to invest in a solar ETF like TAN if most businesses are organized in an unfamiliar way.

Pretty volatile stock with a price target around $190 and all time high around $205. Like you said, it seems to push past that target then drop in the afternoon almost like clockwork. Cool little profit for my first time ever flipping though. Might use it to pick up on your square play after I analyze it.",

Always, always do your own research;  never go blindly into a stock recommended on social media, always verify the info.  REITs may have some additional tax implications, so you may want a stock that pays dividends that you don't have to do a lot of tax calculations.  \n\nIn college you may want to check out financing courses, if it is too expense check Udemy  prices are quite reasonable on really good investment complete courses.

        "body": "Does Robinhood have a moat? What are they doing that's so special? Yeah the fractional shares thing and their approach to trading on margin was novel at the time, but it seems most of the big players offer similar products now. And this is the banking industry, experience and connections matter. RH clearly demonstrated their weakness in this area when they got owned by short sellers earlier this year. Ignoring the mechanics of what happened there, the end result was RH getting a bit of a black eye after the dust settled. And, their CEO's attempt at PR certainly didn't instill confidence that he knows how to handle similar scenarios in the future.\n\nHere's the other thing I don't think most people think about. 15 years ago, you start a new job and set up a 401k, what happens? Go go to the special 401k portal that's tailored to your employer's needs and everything kind of exists in this special, walled off, sort of ecosystem. But, that's not what it's like today. Now, for certain institutions like Fidelity, setting up your 401k eventually leads you into the larger portfolio of product offerings from Fidelity including howtos and guides on ETFs, fractional shares, margin accounts, etc. It's all there.\n\nIs Robinhood's marketing and start-up image enough to differentiate them from the rest of the pack? I'm an educated investor and not really their demo, but certainly the approach Fidelity is taking will pay off over time, no? Having an already established investment account would seem to create inertia that would be hard to overcome. Maybe RH focuses on the small fries -- the folks who are only putting in a few thousand dollars? That would lend itself better to a more mobile app centric sort of approach AKA an almost paypal or Zelle like experience, but then I don't see the justification in the market cap.\n\nKind of all over the place with this comment, but yeah, what's the angle here for RH? How do they not just become another small player in the somewhat already saturated retail investor space?",

You can ask if your job offers a stock purchase plan, I don't know about investing in a Roth at such a young age, then again I didn't really have that opportunity so it might actually be to your benefit.

That is one who tracks the S&amp;P500, Russel or some world wide index. I believe fidelity have their own, use Google or search this subreddit to find one. The reason they are so hard to beat, is diversification. A single company might fail or perform badly even under a economic boom. The market as a whole does not.\n\nAmazon &amp; Apple are too big too fail? So were Lehman or General Motors. Besides both of these stocks are their own counterexample. Apple was big in the 70s in personal computing. Yet, From 80 till the first iphone the company just burned money. Amazon only started to perform really well when cloud-services became huge. It did not perform poorly, but nobody really saw it for the monolith it is now. \n\nLastly, if you need the money in 6 months, don't invest in the stock market. The 40k might become 50k or 30k. In my country (west Europe) this can mean around a -50k/+50k difference in your mortgage (down payment requirement) are you sure you want that risk?",
