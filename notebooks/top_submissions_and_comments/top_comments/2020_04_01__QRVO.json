Those are the names to *not* bet against. \n\nNow go find the buyback kings (looking at you TXN) and buy puts on them all the way down. Anyone who used massive buybacks to paper over their huge executive comp? Puts. Anyone who borrowed (with their borderline bullshit BBB rating) to do their buybacks? Puts. Anyone who kept their BBB rating for years, despite having enough cash flow to pay down debt and get a better rating? Puts. \n\nThe BBB thing is a longer story and none of you will read it anyway, but it\u2019s a big deal that we\u2019ll start noticing in the coming months.",
