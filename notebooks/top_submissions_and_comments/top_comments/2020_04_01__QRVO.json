        "body": "Well, I would personally look over the 400+ stocks that reddit contributor \"Prayers4Wuhan\" initially posted and trim it down from there.  From the 400+ he listed, I only narrowed it down to 9 based on their current price and price target.  So, if you want to look at those stocks based on that and the overall reviews, that's entirely up to you.  I'm not a FA, so I'm not going to tell you what you should and shouldn't do -- that's up to you.  I would do your own research and go from there.  Honestly, I don't have all the time in the world, so I'm not going to research 400+ different stocks, but there are those out there who might.  \n\nPersonally, if I had to invest in the stocks listed, I wouldn't buy anything over $100 right now due to the volatility of the current market and most of us (investors/traders) would argue that we're going to see another decline sooner than later.  Best to buy the blue chippers/growth stocks when they go down a bit -- not NOW.  That said, of the 9 I listed, I would invest in the following:\n\nPWR, LKQ, FRT, UTX and QRVO.  \n\nThese are solid short-term stocks (especially right NOW).  I would honestly either hold any current cash you have and invest it in ETFs and save 50% of it to buy stocks in 2-4 months from now -- at least until we see some stability in the market and there's better news with the pandemic.  Good luck!  Special shout-out again to \"Prayers4Wuhan\" for taking the time to compile the entire list of stocks.  Cheers!",
