        "body": "&gt;e also bought some MAXN and I just never got around to transferring the money to my account to buy it.\n\nthank you. I only started with $10k a few years ago. I got some good returns with $ENPH, $SQ, and through long dated calls, just increased the returns really quick.\n\nI bought sunpower last year in the 20s and sold at the top right before the market pull back in january. \n\nI always found that maxn/sunpower tend to run in tandem. When sunpower started racing towards 30s, i knew that maxn wouldnt be far behind, and i wasnt wrong. From a charting point of view, it looks ready for the same breakout that sunpower had. \n\nSo i'm still trying to load in the 22s mark for when I can - right before the breakout.",

RH makes money buy selling your buy orders to high frequency trade hedge funds, who are then able to \"frontrun\" the stock, meaning they can buy the stock a milisecond before you do, thus raising the price your market orders get filled.

RH has history of being fined by the SEC, and countless lawsuits regarding not having the best user's interest in mind.\n\n7.) Glitchy Options display. RH falsely displayed losses for a young options trader who was actually in the green. He ended up committing suicide because of it.\n\n8.) If you care about margin %, Interactive Brokers and M1 Finance both have cheaper margin %\n\n9.) Not good for buying Crypto. You don't have access to your wallet keys, and you're not allowed to transfer your crypto to anew wallet, so you're forced to liquidate it if you want to move it elsewhere, which creates a taxable event.

Meanwhile, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have great back end infrastructure, but terrible, outdated UIs. I used to think what those companies did was the hard part, and Robinhood just put some paint on a pig. I joked it was a race to see who could fix themselves up faster. But it's been almost a year, and those old school websites are as bad as ever.\n\nVanguard's bad UI is somewhat on purpose, and Schwab bought TDA and Thinkorswim. But Fidelity is an embarrassment. Active Trader Pro is the single oldest and worst performing piece of software I've had the misfortune of interacting with in the past decade. Their mobile app is terrible as well, though I commend them for trying to introduce a nicer looking, but still barely functional Robinhood knockoff beta.\n\nBasically, good design is priceless. But since an investor's job is to put a price on things, I'll just say it's very valuable. Haters always said that Steve Jobs was just the pretty boy frontman, but there are a lot of computer companies and only one is the largest corporation on the planet by simply coasting on Jobs's designs. It's hard to write good code or build a brokerage, but it's almost impossible to create good design.\n\nBasically, leaps on $MLKN",
