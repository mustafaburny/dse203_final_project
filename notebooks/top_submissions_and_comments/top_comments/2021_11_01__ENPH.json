Even if we stopped producing green house gasses tomorrow\n- Europe is projected to hit their 2030 goals in 2040\n- most major corporations have net zero carbon emission goals targeting 2030-2050, but we\u2019re projected to hit 1.5 degrees warming before 2030\n- yes oil cannot disappear overnight otherwise everything would be disrupted, but OP is looking for stocks that will help reduce environmental destruction in the long term. \n\nMost people have yet to realize the extent young people and new generations will have to live significantly different lives, given even mild case warming scenarios. \n\nEnergy \u201cproducers\u201d I like: NEE, Vestas, BEPC, ENPH\n\nEVs: Tesla, Rivian, Nio (there are other car makers going fully electric but for OPs purpose I\u2019m only listing present day 100% EV companies I like) \n\nETFs: ICLN, QCLN, TAN (can always look at their holdings for more ideas) \n\nOther: Origin Materials\n\nI also think battery recycling is a huge thing for the EV space but will need a few years for a leader to emerge. \n\nDisc: Uranium gang is alive and well in this thread. Totally viable investment play as I agree it\u2019s probably going to play a big part in the future. That being said someone else can speak to it better than me.",

Not sure if 30 would sustain by then but it's a sell target, and I'd buy back if it dropped another 25-30% after that. I love MAXN for swinging, very predictable and often it moves a lot more than SPWR or ENPH.

I remain extremely bullish in ENPH, although short/mid term price action is pretty much impossible to predict.\n\nIQ8 is peerless in the semiconductor space, and signals ENPH's first foray into commercial solar. Growth in new continents (S. America and Europe) is barely starting, with India representing massive growth in the long term, and US residential adoption of solar is somewhere around 5%. I expect ENPH to continue to be an alpha generator for at least 5 more years, and hit &gt;$1000 / share, and IMO that is conservative. \n\nSPWR is very well position especially as they still own 2.5m shares of $ENPH. Not super familiar with MAXN, but I think they have some sort of very unfavorable distribution agreement until EOY '22",

The SPY was going up but the tech heavy high growth market was tanking. FSLY released bad news and it caused it's price to tank. NET had a sympathy crash as well, going from $84 to a low of $64 over a matter of days. If you were holding NET and were scared off by this movement due to emotions. FSLY on the other hand didn't recover. This fell because investors lost confidence with their revenue dependence being linked to one customer.\n\nSo in that case, getting out of FSLY if you don't believe in their ability to recover was a good move. But selling out of NET because of a sympathy dump is not a good move and is driven by emotions.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget all those fears of rate hikes in February and March when the 10Y treasury yield curves were spiking over 1.7%. Everyone was saying that inflation was run away, that growth stocks were dead because future money was worth less, etc etc. Well what happened? Good performing stocks still did great. ENPH, DDOG, ZS, NET, TSLA, DASH, AMD, NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, all those stocks are over their February highs. What got clobbered and didn't recover? Stocks that didn't perform (ie. CRSR, PTON, FSLY, FUTU, HOOD, etc).\n\nMost macro factors just move the entire market. Being able to take emotion out of it and discern what is actually due to performance and what is due to macro factors is important.",

But without panels - what is the need for inverters.\n\nA good play is $ARRY for unique solar exposure.\n\nWhy I chose $MAXN - For a solar panel manufacturer, they have existing partnerships that are far and wide, they are owned by total energies ( who want to expand to solar, and alot of projects are being won and total are using maxn as there supplier). ENPH and maxeon are seeing similar growth in Europe. Sunpower are acquiring plenty of companies and growing ( and have an exclusive north american agreement) which allows Maxn to provide.\n\nNot to mention, a new plant being made in USA, the Biden bill and general growth.\n\nI get your point, but for a panel producer they aint bad.\n\n\\- have the worlds most efficient panels, slimmest and longest life panels.",
