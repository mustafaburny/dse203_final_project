Im holding yolo style on this. Wont hold it longer than thurs (i think). expires next week.\n\nTRMB have two months out. I expect a run.\n\nTSM is both yolo weeklies and longs. This the play. with the drought (literllay no fn water in indonesia) and with the chip shortage... this will rocket. I love that this is not China per se. So they are compliant. I played last ER made a fortune in Jan. sold since becuase I know WS don't like chips to have fun if its not merican. played it right got lucky. \n\nINTC should be an amazing play rn (this can be arkx)ish that will par nicely in the coming weeks.
