        "body": "i like constellation software (CSU) for tech in canada due to mark leonard et al. and their capital allocation track record. they currently have a diversified portfolio of niche companies, more so than in 2008 but i think certain verticals will still be affected by the shut down and the share price may not be accounting for this. i want to add to my position on weakness shown in the next little while. they've recently done some acquisitions which is impressive in this stiffed environment. i like them a lot &amp; understand how they run their business. in terms of open text i don't know a lot other than they have a pretty good reputation too. constellation seems to have had better return on capital over the long term though.\n\ntyler technologies (TYL) would be a good one in the US imo. they focus primarily on solutions for governments &amp; constellation does this too, but they go beyond as well. TYL stock has held up insanely well so far. suppose the market is assuming their operations will flow through uninterrupted. remains to be seen though. charlie munger has mentioned them because daily journal operates in the same market- he refers to them as ruthless if i remember correctly.\n\ni'm not really a numbers guy i more study companies on how well they defend and hold competitive advantages and invest for the long term based off that. still learning!",
