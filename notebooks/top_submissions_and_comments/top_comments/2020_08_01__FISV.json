        "body": "I could talk your ear off about Square. I bought in towards the very beginning (around $10 a share), and have been consistently taking gains out along it's hyperbolic take-off.\n\nFor most of Square's publicly traded time, their payment receptacles at businesses were their big \"revolutionary\" product. Their biggest competitor to these products was \"Clover\" with company \"First Data\" (stock ticker FDC).\n\nIf I believe in a product, I often times research competitors &amp; invest a portion into the competitors as well. This was the case with Clover &amp; FDC.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall: FISV wanted a piece of the payment receptacle money as well, and ended up merging with FDC. This is why I own FISV stock instead of FDC stock now.\n\nSquare has since also developed their Cash App, and is raking in a lot from their CryptoCurrency purchases. Something crazy, like $300M profit, from last quarter alone. I can only imagine what CoinBase is making... but I digress.\n\nFISV is a long-established financial institution, and their acquisition of FDC definitely won some of my respect. After researching FISV (before the merger), I learned enough about their company to justify holding the stock, and I'm glad I did. I'm up about 30% since the merger occurred, but that is on top of all the gains I received from FDC. Gotta love compounding interest!\n\nAll of that having been said, I expect for FISV to continue to make substantial gains over the years, but not as fast as FDC was... since FDC is essentially only a piece of their portfolio now. \n\nHope that helps, and best of luck to you!",
