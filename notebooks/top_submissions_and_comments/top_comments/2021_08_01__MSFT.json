The announcement puts significantly more pressure on MSFT to acquire the NED vertical, especially considering the national security risks associated with this critical IP being vital to the $22B US Army IVAS contract. The Department of Defense has conducted a thorough review and I\u2019m sure they have identified that Microsoft not owning the rights to the \u201cMiracle *MicroVision* Display Engine\u201d represents a national security threat. It would make sense for the DoD to put pressure on MSFT to acquire this IP to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.\n\nor\n\nB) Microsoft gave MicroVision the green light to announce the relationship because MSFT is about to announce acquiring the NED vertical.\n\nEither way it is BAFF (*Bullish as F#cking F#ck*).\n\nAlso, MVIS is positioning itself to be a global leader in automotive LiDAR with best-in-class tech in terms of resolution, specs, and scalability. The IAA Mobility Summit in Munich is coming up in September and MicroVision is hosting the DVN Automotive LiDAR Conference and Expo in Frankfurt in November. Soon the whole world will see we have best-in-class automotive LiDAR.\n\nPosition: 13,450 shares at $7.46 avg, will be adding more JAN23 $42 LEAPS tomorrow. \n\nThis is the way.",

I used to have Proctor and Gamble and absolutely love them, but had to pull some money out last week, so they got sacrificed.\n\nWith AAPL and MSFT, I short 2 puts per week (and one covered call).  This week, for example, I shorted:\n\n* 2 MSFT $285 puts @ $1.35\n* 1 MSFT $290 call @ $1.51\n* 2 AAPL $147 August 20 puts @ $2.32\n* 1 AAPL $147 August 20 call @ $2.52\n* For DIS and AXP, because they've been a little more volatile, my options are a bit further away from the stock price and I'm rolling them forward getting about $100 per week in cash on each.\n* 1 WMT $145 call @ $1.20\n* 1 WMT $145 put @ $1.44\n\nIf you add up these numbers (counting only half of Apple), you get a little under $1000.  That's slightly deceiving because remember I have to close the old position in order to roll it forward.  So say Apple is trading at $149 come August 20.  I'm going to have to pay $200 to close it (and the $147 puts will expire as worthless).  So if I get, say, $450 for setting my August 27 options, I really only made $250 on that deal.\n\nBut I have a few other smaller stocks and I do a few vertical spreads.  It all comes out to about $1000/week.",

I don't expect a whole lot of price movement THIS earnings report, I anticipate a much larger move near Q3 ER if Q2 provides confirmation (43m to 44m in rev) that they are on target to hit their revenue projection this year (already raised once). At some point as long as AvePoint executes as planned,  the market will respond. \n\nI don't really see a way that the largest SaaS cloud partner for the world's largest software/cloud company growing at 25% to 30% CAGR continues to trade at 9X when similar companies are at least trading at 30% higher. AvePoint also has a great team,  Jeff Teper, VP at Microsoft on board,  Jason Beal from Palo Alto Networks, Epstein as former CFO of Oracle, Koenig as former head of global technology investment at Goldman Sachs who's first IPO was ironically MSFT. \n\nThey have been executing a parallel M&amp;A plan alongside the SPAC process according to CEO, I expect acquisitions soon and AvePoint to execute as planned. The downside here is limited its already at the low range of valuation with a $23 bull target (VRNS revenue multiple). I feel very confident holding this, there's a ton of far worse holds making zero revenue or going backwards. \n\nAvePoint has zero debt (as of now,  who knows if their M&amp;A strategy changes that)  and is in my opinion a strong play whether the economy remains open or shuts down again. Another shutdown will actually benefit AvePoint,  and as we all know,  most companies are either permanently adopting WFH models to save on real estate costs or moving to a mostly WFH model. With so many working from home with access to sensitive data there going to be far more foreign actors attempting to compromise those systems and gain access which will result in more reliance on companies like AvePoint (Varonis too).",
