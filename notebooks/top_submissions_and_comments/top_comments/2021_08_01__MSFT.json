The announcement puts significantly more pressure on MSFT to acquire the NED vertical, especially considering the national security risks associated with this critical IP being vital to the $22B US Army IVAS contract. The Department of Defense has conducted a thorough review and I\u2019m sure they have identified that Microsoft not owning the rights to the \u201cMiracle *MicroVision* Display Engine\u201d represents a national security threat. It would make sense for the DoD to put pressure on MSFT to acquire this IP to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.\n\nor\n\nB) Microsoft gave MicroVision the green light to announce the relationship because MSFT is about to announce acquiring the NED vertical.\n\nEither way it is BAFF (*Bullish as F#cking F#ck*).\n\nAlso, MVIS is positioning itself to be a global leader in automotive LiDAR with best-in-class tech in terms of resolution, specs, and scalability. The IAA Mobility Summit in Munich is coming up in September and MicroVision is hosting the DVN Automotive LiDAR Conference and Expo in Frankfurt in November. Soon the whole world will see we have best-in-class automotive LiDAR.\n\nPosition: 13,450 shares at $7.46 avg, will be adding more JAN23 $42 LEAPS tomorrow. \n\nThis is the way.",

Hell they were clearly dominant in search at the time of their IPO, and no other company small or large has ever adequately challenged their supremacy in search.\n\nPart of it goes to imagination. I'm the type of person who is always going to hedge towards the proven winners, the mature and late stage companies. I'm not in green energy or self-driving cars. I'm skeptical of all these battery companies and electric car outfits. It's not that I think they're all going to fail. There will be winners. I just have no competence to figure out who it's likely to be, or even to sort out a \"leading contenders\" pack. I'm also skeptical of the timeline. *Things always take longer than they take. Doubly so for new things.*\n\nI remember when Google bought Youtube thinking, rather clearly at the time, \"What the hell are they going to do with that, put ads in the videos? That'll kill their user base overnight.\" It seemed perfectly logical to me. Youtube was at the time still a bit of the new, weird and wacky artsy part of the web. There wasn't this constant business drumbeat of \"Be sure to MASH the like button and SUBSCRIBE to my bullshit\". It was just a bunch of people posting videos about things they liked. But they managed the transition to an advertising content model and even paid subscriptions now through YoutubeTV incredibly well. It happened over years, almost so [slowly as to be imperceptible](https://youtu.be/j8CWQILIBWU?t=121). It's been one of their greatest acquisitions.\n\nThis is coming from someone who used AdSense and AdWords pretty actively in those 2000 aughts, and made good money with it. I wasn't naive to Google's reach. I just didn't have the imagination to make the leap from artsy video hosting website to entrepreneurs, music videos everywhere and influencers business platform. It's easy to get these things wrong, especially if you're not a natural innovator/inventor type of person.\n\nThe Blockbuster people, experts in the video rental space, certainly missed Netflix ascension. Microsoft (and others) generously sat around and watched, giving Amazon something like a 6 or 7 year runway on Cloud computing before they realized how crucial it would become.\n\nI would say figure out where you land on the spectrum between inventor and late adopter, and play to your strength. Some people are cut out for venture capital and IPO's, some for cigar butts.",

While MSFT and AAPL will likely grow, I think your money would be better spent on a company that has good revenue prospects, large-ish market to take advantage of, and a clear path toward growth. Buying OTM LEAPS will get you more dollars the closer that contract gets to ITM and a deepish ITM LEAPS will give you moves similar to holding 100 shares but for notably less capital. That being said, options are like leverage in that you can spend not a lot and still get a ton of value so throwing a few bucks at a realistically striked LEAPS in AAPL and MSFT wouldn't be the end of the world either. Also a thing to note, if you buy LEAPS, you can sell shorter dated higher strike covered calls against them and whittle down your cost basis.",

I understand that at this point it's somewhat cringe-worthy and Q Anon like (sorry for anyone involved, it's just my opinion and you do you!), but when it happened it was a really cool moment.  Seeing all the solidarity, mass awards on WSB, billboards going up around the country.  I dunno.  That was cool.  I had loved Reddit for a few years and it was cool to see the Reddit community uniting like that.\n\nI was naive to think that it was truly about solidarity, and that there weren't people ready to bail and leave everyone else with the bag as soon as they saw the exit.  But still.  I think it was a significant moment in investing history, the true rise of retail.  It had already risen, I guess, but the GME squeeze was the definitive proof of \"here we are\".\n\nI dunno if that was really about taking down hedge funds or whatever, but to me it was about empowering myself to get into investing and take control of my financial life.  Before this I just listened to my dad and kept everything in a savings account, except for regular IRA contributions to a target retirement fund.  But at that moment I realized I didn't need to sit on so much cash, or listen to my dad.  It's my money.  It's mine to do what I will with it.\n\nAnd not only is it my money, it's my future.  It's my opportunity to make a better life for myself.\n\nAs of today I'm exactly $60 up on a relatively small (but not tiny) portfolio.  I made a lot of dumb decisions, like buying BABA and then having cold feet and selling for a loss.  Selling MSFT and AAPL for a loss because I thought they were in a bubble (facepalm).  Holding my cash reserves in foreign exchange only to see it get destroyed by Fed taper talk.\n\nBut hey, somehow, some way, I'm still breaking even.  I'm exactly where I would have been if I had just left things alone and never tried anything new.  Except now I have a whole lot more knowledge about the stock market, economy, and finance in general.\n\nI also have a new found confidence in my ability to take charge of my life.  I'm not a kid anymore.\n\nIn some ways that's sad, and I know old age is coming sooner rather than later.  Youth isn't forever.  But you know what's cool?  Learning about stocks these last few months has been like a whole new adventure.  Somehow, someway, I've felt like a kid again.\n\nGood luck to all, and thanks to everybody here in /r/stocks.  Thanks to the haters, too.  A small portion of you helped me reexamine my beliefs, and the rest of you helped me realize that you can't please everybody... nor do you have to.\n\n\\-shorty",

China at the end doesnt care much about capitalism or free markets,  xi has already made clear that rich should donate \u201cexcess\u201d to society, this is what socialism is at the end-redistributing wealth, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you think its good or not, western shareholders will be the losers. The entire vie structure is a scam, they are getting billions in capital from west without giving out any data or real ownership in their companies.",
