I try to setup my contracts at the start of the month for expiration at the end of the month but that's not a hard-and-fast rule.  I no longer buy and sell stocks unless they're assigned to me or called away.  I just use options for everything, and all dividends and option premiums are re-invested in developing new positions (no DRIP).\n\nMy experiences so far are that people are really impatient, myself included, and I can generate alpha by setting my prices on the contracts I write maybe 20% off the morning's bid/ask.  If it's going the wrong way, I don't chase the trade.  And if the market is illiquid enough I might be able to sell a contract to someone (or some bot) at a nice premium.  Lately I've been a big fan of selling puts in the mid-morning on stocks that are getting hammered (because of an earnings report usually).  My play this week was on CenturyLink and so far that's looking good.\n\nPersonally I don't believe in much of the mythology of the stock market, and believe more strongly in the random walk.  For every WSB guy who YOLO's $10K into buying risky calls and reaps massive gains, there's just a pile of people who blow their money because they're impatient or panicked and they are mashing keys without knowing what is going on.  Selling secured puts and covered calls is an awesome way to increase portfolio yield and smooth losses.  I am fine capping my upside.  I'm not expecting Altria or Realty Income to pop 25% after an earnings report, and the options prices reflect that.  So many of the contracts I write expire worthless, and it's just cash in my pocket.",

        "body": "Market orders remove liquidity and are sometimes subject to higher fees. \n\nSome limit orders add liquidity and some remove it. Eg a limit order above the \u201cask\u201d removes liquidity\n\nMarket orders are executed almost immediately; a limit order executes when the limit price is met. \n\nGenerally speaking, you should always use limit orders so you\u2019re completely in control of the price you\u2019re buying and selling at. The downside is that sometimes the limit price may not ever be met or it could even be skipped over. \n\nSlippage is a major concern with market orders. Slippage refers to the sometimes instantaneous change in price from when you send your market orders to when they\u2019re filled. Eg you place a market order of 10 shares @ 25.30 and the share price jumps a bit to 25.33. You thought you were paying $253 for your shares but you paid $253.30 instead (+$0.30 more). Doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but let\u2019s say you were buying 100 options contracts at market price $25.30 and get filled at $25.33 instead. \n\n100x100x$25.33 = $25,300 vs @ $25.30 = $300 straight **lost** down the drain, for no good reason, due to slippage. You could\u2019ve prevented it by setting a limit order to ONLY execute at a price or $25.30 (or **lower**)\n\nAs others have said, this is fundamentals 101, and you should do more reading/studying on options. You wouldn\u2019t buy a new computer if you didn\u2019t understand how the debit machine at the micro Centre works (and the sweaty neck beard guy keys in your order incorrectly and overcharges you by $1000).\n\nEdit: if you\u2019re selling that contract sell it at or below bid \n\n(I previously wrote sell @ midpoint of bid/ask spread which is wrong. I kept thinking \u201cbuy\u201d not sell. I am a bull after all)",

It's still hindered by transaction limits, lost keys, hacks, and encryption break by quantum  computing. etc.\n\nEven if block chain proves useful in the future, it's unlikely it will be any of the currently existing one.

Also, was there any way I could have known that this would be the likely outcome at the time of purchasing such options? At least E*TRADE didn\u2019t provide any heads up.
