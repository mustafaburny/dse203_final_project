Tesla is where motorola used to be, before apple butt fucked it to death with the iPhone. Kind of hoping the same thing happens here with the apple car. Tesla deserves it lol",

        "body": "Eh. I own all 3 stocks so I'm somewhat neutral. Amd won't catch nvda on the gpu front. Except for a few circumstances nvda always will outperform. It doesn't really matter how good an amd gpu is their driver support is terrible and if a 700 dollar gpu that performs like a 1500 dollar gpu sounds good, which it should but in reality it doesn't matter because the drivers are crap and real world performance always lags benchmarks. \n\nOn the cpu front. I'd only use amd cpus on a workstation. The higher core count per dollar is nice but my 5950 system with a 2080ti never ran as well on 2k as my 9900k system with the same gpu. Both have ram tailored for the system and adequate cooling using msi mobos. This is in cod warzone which is heavily cpu dependant. The 9900k is at 5ghz both use noctua 2 tower coolers. And 32gb of b die ram. The amd system has memory tailored to the infinity fabric frequency as well so don't give me that frequency crap. The issue with the 5950 is I get frequent stuttering and lag fps drops. Not network related. If I spin 360  between the downtown and airport runway while on the hill ill lose 50fps. Dropping from 150 to 100 around the time I'm looking at array. 1440p same settings as my 9900k but fir whatever reason my 9900k system doesn't have these stutters when replicating. \n\nI'm buying more intc for the long haul, alder lake might be good. Time will tell. I love amd as well but I think they'll be stretched thin trying to batter the monoliths of 2 industries.",

So competitors tried to copy the size and shape without really understanding where the world was heading under their nose.\n\nI think that analogy is playing out right now in autos. Every trad auto company still thinks the goal is to build a better EV than Tesla. The goal is to build a better robotic transportation device. A working EV is the bare bare minimum.",

This means it's also around the [AMD Radeon RX 5500.](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/msi-amd-radeon-rx-5500-xt-8gb-gddr6-pci-express-4-0-graphics-card-black-gray/6397797.p?skuId=6397797)..selling $205 at Best Buy.\n\nAll in all, I don't see this as a win for Intel.  Releasing a GPU that performs at the same level as 2 year old, 2-generation old NVDA graphics card for the same price doesn't seem that great.\n\nAlso, people aren't buying 16-series NVDA cards any more, they've moved on to the 30- series or at the very least the 20-series. [You can see the popularity of different GPUs](https://benchmarks.ul.com/compare/best-gpus?amount=0&amp;sortBy=POPULARITY&amp;reverseOrder=true&amp;types=MOBILE,DESKTOP&amp;minRating=0) here, no one's buying this stuff any more.\n\nTo me, this is just another example of INTC being woefully behind in the GPU space.  People want to buy the latest GPUs to play the latest games...and Intel with this move has shown that they aren't even in the stratosphere as NVDA/AMD.  Woof.",

        "body": "Did IBM really screw up? Could it be argued that IBM was reacting to Apple going public that year and was exploring microcomputers. The first IBM PC didn't come out till 1981 and the XT wasn't released til '83. \n\nIf anything - the deal between IBM and Microsoft was likely the death knell for Digital Research. I suspect that few redditors in this sub remember or have ever heard of CP/M. But in 1980, microcomputers were still a nascent concept. And DRI and Microsoft were private companies. \n\nThis event is actually considered an important watershed moment by computer history enthusiasts like myself but I don't think that at the time, an investment or trading decision could have been made. Back in the 80's and early 90's, the pace of change and competition in microcomputers incredibly fast. And there were a lot more players in both the software and hardware arena. \n\nIf I had to think back to the mid 80's following the deal with IBM/Microsoft - perhaps an investment in Intel could have been the forward looking investment. If you look at the Intel annual report in 1980 - there were hints of what may have been to come with the 8086 replacement. Link to that report for anyone interested - [https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/report/history-1980-annual-report.pdf](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/report/history-1980-annual-report.pdf) \\- however - Motorola was a strong competitor and when MIPS arrived on the scene - it could have been argued that Intel could have been threatened. \n\nWhenever I think about these scenarios - I'm reminded that it is very difficult to predict if a specific company will benefit from a singular event.",

It'd be like looking at Apple in 2007 and saying \"ppfffttt look at how many phones motorola sells even if Apple sells 100% of the worlds phones then they can only reach X valuation\". Problem is smart phones opened whole new revenue streams that previously didn't exist for cell phone manufacturers. \n\nTSLA is similar. Either Tesla is going to find new ways to make money for a car company, such as charging for self driving, sell his AI chips, selling batteries to other manufacturers, etc etc or it'll crash down to earth. Only time will tell if they will succeed or not (I missed the boat on Tesla so I don't own any) but looking at the company's growth prospects as the number of cars they may or may not sell is missing the entire point.",

I've worked close to the industry, spent many hours on-site at Intel, Microchip, and Motorola facilities across the US.\n\nMy thought is that you reprioritize/rearrange your existing production schedules. The tooling/recipes should already exist somewhere for the chips that don't need to be designed from scratch.\n\nYes, somebody's product would have to suffer a setback, but I imagine that chips for other less important purposes could easily be delayed. Each order is not necessarily of the same importance as the others.\n\nOf course, those customers whose orders that would be delayed (preferably on a volunteer basis) would need to be compensated. I'd offer those customers discounts subsidized by the fees I'd charge automakers for the production line jump.",
