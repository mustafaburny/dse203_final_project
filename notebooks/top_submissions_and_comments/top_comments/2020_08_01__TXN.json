Look at stripe - even they don\u2019t do their own processing and have some back end connection. For APMs they use another company called PPRO. I just hold for long term because this industry is growing overall with a huge push to be digital. And yes, it might be a long long hold but maybe worth the hold. \n\nAgain - this is no personal advise, I am just saying what I feel might be true.

But they might not grow as much with AMD looking better.\n\nThat being said a safer long term bet, as well as just a good indicator of the tech industry in general I'd look at the analog semiconductors such as ADI and TXN. Their stock maybe suffering from some overinflation as well, but the last five years both stocks have been generally moving upwards. With more Boomer ran industries such as Industrials/Automotive/and Medical industries are starting to invest heavily in \"electrifying\" their industries so analog semiconductors are now breaking into new markets at high rates. Also in the next couple years ADI will aquire Maxim, which is the combination of the second and third largest analog semiconductor companies. \n\nAlso even the Intel and AMD chips need supporting circuitry which analog semiconductors still use.\n\nAlso because how sales work in that industry, a decrease in semiconductors typically precedes a decrease in the tech market. \n\nFor short term gain I think semiconductors aren't the best play, these industries typically grow but can be hard to pin down in short term.\n\nI'm waiting for a pullback, because I don't think we are out of the woods of a recession yet.

They've recently announced that they are transitioning to their own ARM-based silicone, which is presumably Apple based and produced by TSMC (which is definitely an interesting investing proposition itself). \n\nThe sales figure you linked is for 'high-end PCs', which as I mentioned is quite a small market segement. \n\nSee, 2022 is not exactly a long time, particularly in the investing world. Have you thought about how many years of exciting rapid progress AMD is going to need to have from now-on to justify the price? \n\n\nWhat are you going to do if AMD's price stabilises as it attempts to gain datacentre share from Intel, and then in 2022-2024 Intel comes out with superior chips again and quickly snatches it back? AMD's share price would drop like a rock. \n\nMuch like Tesla, AMD is going to have to make great strides in market penetration in order to replace the dominant players, and that may take a while. \n\nBottom line, I think it's hyped.

        "body": "The only positive catalyst I could see for intel in the near term is the Chips for America Act, or the most recent semiconductor grants and contracts included in the NDAA.  Intel is most definitely hoping for a brand new, heavily subsidized (completely?) Fab from one of those, or at the very least have their R&amp;D costs heavily discounted.  That requires two big ifs though: if the funding levels in the bills stay the same and are passed, and then Intel is awarded the grant over Texas Instruments, NVIDIA, etc.\n\nUntil then, the advantage AMD has is in my opinion understated currently.  Any data center being built in the next four years would be fiscally irresponsible to buy intel over AMD for one huge reason: power consumption.  7nm and the soon to come 5nm chips from AMD will consume significantly less power than any of Intel\u2019s offerings, and when you are talking data center quantities of CPUs, even small amounts add up.\n\nDisclosure: Long on AMD since I built a computer with a second generation Ryzen in 2018.  Also, I\u2019m not an expert, and all of the opinions in this post are based on me, a dumb guy, doing my own research online and digging into the topic.  Happy to be educated further if anything I said in here is way off base.",

        "body": "&gt; You can't tell me you think Intel has a higher chance at failure\n\nHey look, I remember when Texas Instruments was the leading company in this space.  I watched it get outpaced and never once thought it would fail, and it hasn't - it's still in business and you can buy shares.  Nowhere do I claim that Intel goes bankrupt.  It will not.\n\nI also do not claim that Texas Instruments, holder of the shining crown for total dominance of hand-held calculator microprocessors in 1974, will swiftly reclaim the top spot in CPUs in 2021.  That's ludicrous.  What I do see is that, barring a really effective turnaround, Intel is headed towards the bottom of the pile where it will join TI.",
