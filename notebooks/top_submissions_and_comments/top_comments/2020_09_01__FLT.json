        "body": "The company is not in my watchlist and we are not long/short FLT. *Disclosure:* this post has some plugs about our platform :) \n\nSince there are way too many companies out there - one way to be efficient in due-diligence is by using [investment checklists](https://www.cognitivequant.co/post/improving-investment-outcomes-with-checklists) \\- checklists can help both in terms of deciding whether to continue investing your time in assessing a company and also help prioritize the various facets of due-diligence. \n\nHave a [look](https://i.imgur.com/QUHYQwv.png) at the investment checklist for FLT. As you can see, almost all of the quant metrics are really good. \n\nLet's first address the debt to equity ratio in your post above. Per se, I am not worried about the debt (from a quant perspective) - *if* the company is able to maintain its current FCF, it can easily pay off its entire debt in &lt; 5 years (plus as you can see from checklist it has good interest coverage). \n\nThe reason D/E is 1.5 in above post is likely because you are using the book value of equity. Book value of equity could contract for several reasons (share buybacks, negative other comprehensive income etc.). This can at times lead to an inflated looking D/E. \n\nAnd so it is good to look at leverage from multiple angles (D/E - we prefer market value of equity, debt repayment period, interest covg). \n\nThis means that the three areas I would focus on (if I were interested in considering investing in FLT), would be:\n\n**1) Fleetcor's legal proceeding risk**: We use AI and NLP to extract this within the platform - not reproducing here because it is quite large. But here's a fundamental sentiments [extract](https://i.imgur.com/o8Nk2KJ.png) that summarizes one of the key legal risk aspects. You can read more about FTC lawsuit [here](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/12/ftc-alleges-fuel-card-marketer-fleetcor-charged-hundreds-millions). \n\nThis also shows the importance of assessing qualitative risks - sometimes pure quant / value investors can miss legal and other underlying qualitative risks. \n\nIn addition, the passage of time can inure investors to such risks (till it materializes fully which may then result in steep decline). **Please note**: I am not taking a position one way or the other - just pointing out the risks and the need to consider it carefully.\n\n**2) Range of intrinsic value:** We can't value a firm well without understanding its business model, its growth prospects and risks. However, performance across the business cycle can help generate scenarios that can provide an initial cut on the valuation (more about the approach [here](https://www.cognitivequant.co/post/assessing-the-intrinsic-value-of-firms)). \n\nFrom this first cut ([primary scenario](https://i.imgur.com/ezJX2DG.png), and [sensitivity analysis](https://i.imgur.com/zJ4lKlk.png)), it does not look appealing enough to spend time assessing the company and the associated risks further. \n\n**3) Whether the customer concentration risk is meaningful:** As noted above, if the valuation above were more appealing - this would be something to spend time assessing -- both on whether the concentration is meaningful and also about the stickiness of the customer relationship if it was a material concentration.\n\n\\----\n\nOne final point - when looking at investment opportunities, it can be useful to consider counter points. A quick search on the FTC lawsuit lead to this quite negative [research report](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Citron-Exposes-one-of-the-Largest-Clean-Energy-Frauds-in-US-History.pdf) from Citron Research (they are very likely short FLT, so take that into consideration as well).",
