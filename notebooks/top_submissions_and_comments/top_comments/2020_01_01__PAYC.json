TSMC is effectively a factor of the R&amp;D budgets from apple, qualcomm, nvidia, amd, mediatek, marvell, broadcom, xlinix, huawei...\n\nif you have the vision to realize what AMD can and most likely will accomplish, you would buy in at these levels without hesitation. if you are running a fund... the big and smart money... you are not interested in day trading. they want a nice stock that will have consistent growth for a minimum of two years. a growth company. they want an industry that is expanding. they are not looking at the past, they are looking forward to 2+ years (\"TTM PE\" vs \"forward PE\"), to when earnings will be around $5/share (at this rate) from a dominant company with almost zero debit and the best track recordd of any stock over the last two years.\n\nall aboard!
