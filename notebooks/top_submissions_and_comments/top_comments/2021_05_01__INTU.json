These businesses transcend normal valuations techniques\".\n\nLots of people will disagree with this approach.\n\nMath is math. High P/E ratios are speculation about future growth potential. Tax software could be a very competitive industry and I can't think of any moats to retain an enduring advantage except the switching costs related to transferring the last years tax information.\n\nHopefully your right. Maybe not though. I don't know. I've looked into Intuit recently because I used Turbotax. I like the product but Intuit is valued very highly, the revenue is volatile between quarters, I can't see a sustainable competitive advantage. What if Apple releases tax software? My research stopped there.\n\nI'm going to sit this one out.",

        "body": "&gt;Turbo Tax thinned out the CPA herd, not the general accounting herd.\n\nSo, firstly, this is inaccurate because this is a failure to understand what tax accountants do. \n\nTax accountants do not just do tax returns, they also provide tax planning, estate planning, some level of finance management and various other activities. Secondly, [accounting has it's own internal issues](https://www.accountingweb.com/practice/growth/why-cpa-candidate-numbers-have-decreased-part-1) which greatly reduced the number of CPA applications but the number of CPAs or their job growth projection hasn't shifted negatively at all vs. the economy which would be evident if they were being replaced by-and-large.\n\nSecondly, TurboTax, if it provided tax planning services (nevermind that they company Intuit actually hires tax professionals and CPAs to represent their clients) that would actually thin all of accounting specifically in auditing because if properly placed you'd need fewer auditors which actually did happen due to better software and statistical testing methods. There's a lot wrong with this but the largest fundamental element here is that *most people who would require a CPA due to genuinely complex taxes use one*; it turns out that TurboTax isn't thinning anything at all but instead that the general populace simply doesn't have complex returns. [In the U.S. well over a third of taxable income simply went back to those who paid it; the number of people who pay taxes is not particularly high](https://www.statista.com/statistics/242138/percentages-of-us-households-that-pay-no-income-tax-by-income-level/) and if you look over the years ... Yatta yatta.\n\nI don't think anyone actually cares about accountants in general since the whole concept of understanding the complexity of what they genuinely do, especially when talking about tax accountants because not all of them are even CPAs, you can have various types including Registered Agents and CMA designations or CGAs all of whom play a part with, or even can do, taxes if properly designated. This is Reddit but it is hard to just note how deep the rabbit hole goes and realize that most people haven't a fucking clue.\n\nTheir entire perspective is the surface of the pond and they think they see the bottom.",

        "body": "Facebook is the best value in FAAG/MSFT. Lowest market cap = more runway left for appreciation. Best valuation with lowest P/E and P/Cash Flow. Has the most untapped revenue verticals (video, AR/VR, payments, Angie's List type of service referrals, hardware (Portal/Oculus), dating, WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nAdobe - a \"baby FAANG\" that has more room to run, market cap-wise, than FAANG. \n\nSalesforce - same reason as Adobe above, baby FAANG. \n\nIntuit - under the radar, category killer with tax and accounting software \n\nPinterest - scarce social media property that is adding e-commerce functionality with Shopify. \n\nWISH - WISH's global eCommerce marketplace has an affordable/entertaining mobile shopping experience. Its focus on value conscious consumers, unique array of unbranded product selection from global merchants, and data science driven approach is very sophisticated. In terms of upside, there is potential in local delivery/fulfillment, branded inventory efforts &amp; a subscription revenue stream. The Company is projecting positive EBIT in 2022. A modest 4x P/S multiple at that time should result in a doubling of the stock price from current levels.\n\nCronos (CRON) - big tobacco's Altria (MO), the largest tobacco company in USA, backs this company with 45% ownership and will likely plug and play its products like a light switch upon federal legalization into its huge point of service network of over 250,000 locations (i.e. convenience stores, etc) is the cannabis company that will likely be the ultimate winner. They are avoiding expensive growing methods by using a creative approach announcing that they will be introducing synthetic cannabinoids for the Canadian market for a 10 cents a gram:\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cronos-to-sell-lab-grown-pot-products-in-canada-this-year-ceo-1.1556188\n\nAside from Cronos, I think the ancillary cannabis companies are the way to play weed stocks because they don't contain cannabis and hence allow listing on the most liquid exchanges such as Nasdaq and institutional money can pour into these cannabis related names now/today as opposed to being shut out of other companies that contain cannabis because institutional money usually has mandates to not allow investing in something that is Federally illegal:\n\nHydrofarm (HYFM) - IPOed in Dec and a leading hydroponics manufacturer and distributor\n\nGrowGeneration (GRWG) - leading hydroponics retailer\n\nWeedmaps (SSPK) - unique, direct to consumer (DTC), cannabis play on the intersection of tech and cannabis. A type of Uber, Amazon, Yelp and Shopify all rolled into one for cannabis products. A SPAC that will turn into WeedMaps during sometime in the 1st half of this year. This one is special. \n\nTim Seymour's cannabis ETF (CNBS) owns a big position in WeedMaps and smaller positions in GrowGeneration and Hydrofarm:\n\nhttps://www.amplifyetfs.com/cnbs-holdings.html\n\nTwitter (TWTR) - is a unique social media equity that has achieved critical mass. It may have kinks in it in its current state, and yes, I think Dorsey being so egotistical to think he can be a co-CEO of both Square and Twitter is disgusting (as is his beard), but there is a user base there. It might shock people that the political user base only comprises a low teens % component of their total user base with the rest being news, sports and entertainment. Twitter has made some acquisitions recently of Squad and Breaker that really puts them into interesting territory of peer to peer browsing, audio and podcasting - things people should not overlook. \n\nCoinbase (COIN) - is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is gonna be huge because this is the first time we are going to be able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value.",

        "body": "I like how you think RKT is only home mortgage. You\u2019re comparing income between JUST Rocket mortgage and JUST UWMC Holdings. RKT owns intuit quickbooks, which is a highly regarded and heavily used business organization system. They also own intuit turbotax, which you\u2019ve probably used to do your own taxes because UWMC sure as fuck didn\u2019t offer that while turbotax has and will continue to be the nations easiest and most popular tax return website.\n\nEver heard of Rocket home? Rocket auto? Home insurance. Auto insurance. This company has so many avenues for profit, and you want to sit here and blindly call out RKT for being subpar in comparison to UWMC, when you have absolutely no idea how their product/service lineup encapsulates the market in those areas. I\u2019m going to get so many dislikes because nobody here cares about what\u2019s actually good, what\u2019s actually been working, what\u2019s actually been turning profits, etc. Just follow what Joe Shmoe said on WSB, that\u2019ll work out great for you! \n\n395 shares @ $16.58 cost basis RKT. Because I know what is actually smart to invest in, and I picked the perfect time. Glad you bought in at the top of this company\u2019s P&amp;D. Have fun bag holding when it never goes back up.",
