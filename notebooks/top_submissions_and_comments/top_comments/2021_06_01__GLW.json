I don't make a whole lot of money so it's a perfect set up for me. I max it out, buy some solid names at good prices and try to hold them.\n\nThe plan is obviously retirement. But if anything comes up before then, I can take out money with no penalties and do what I need to do, maybe a down payment on a house one day.\n\nIf there's one thing I wish I did more, was take some risks for high returns. But I don't think now is the time for that. I hate holding a stock with no dividend and just watching it bounce around so I go with dividend payers. \n\nMy positions are: SWKS, LMT, AAPL, CSCO, QCOM, KLIC, INTC, KMI. A bit tech heavy but I know they will be relevant for years to come.\n\nI also have a problem buying a stock \"early\" and selling it before it really takes off. Broadcom and Align technologies are the two that come to mind.",
