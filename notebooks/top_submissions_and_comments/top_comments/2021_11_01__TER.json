I think CGC will either sell their stake (at some point) or be okay with TER being part of a larger more sophisticated MSO\n\n1)I am pretty sure post TER/GAGE mergerCGCs stake gets diluted to like 14%. Still big but less important \n\n2)CGC is currently on track to take control of Acreage when federally permissible. Acreage already has operations in NJ. So 1 of them would have to give-up a highly valuable license if CGC was to take control of both TER/Acreage. \n\n3) Other large TER shareholder is Bruce Linton, ex-CEO of CGC while normally I would say this is bullish for acquisition here I think it is the opposite. There have been numerous articles written that Bruce wasn\u2019t to happy about being shown the door by CGC after STZ came in and doesn\u2019t like what they did to \u201chis\u201d company. I think ego comes into play here and he wants to stick to CGC and say boom I was part of this type of company again and I did it without Billions of dollars and it\u2019s better\u2026\u2026.Im also pretty sure CGC rubbed Berner (Cookies) the wrong way too at some point (this is grapevine but I thought Bruce wanted to buy Cookies, but STZ told him no)\n\n4)CGC has been burning fucking $$$ like it\u2019s Hawaiian Tiki night. They have consistently underperformed in the market, at a point lenders will start turning off the spigot/wanting more collateral. I think this would make selling the 20% attractive or them wanting TER to be part of larger more successful company (so on paper they can say our investment looks XX larger.\n\n5)Federal Permissibility offers no benefit in the \u201cnow\u201d to TER shareholders they would still have to make due with their limited footprint while being outmaneuvered by other Tier 2 MSOs",
