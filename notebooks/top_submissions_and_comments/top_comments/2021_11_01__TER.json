I think CGC will either sell their stake (at some point) or be okay with TER being part of a larger more sophisticated MSO\n\n1)I am pretty sure post TER/GAGE mergerCGCs stake gets diluted to like 14%. Still big but less important \n\n2)CGC is currently on track to take control of Acreage when federally permissible. Acreage already has operations in NJ. So 1 of them would have to give-up a highly valuable license if CGC was to take control of both TER/Acreage. \n\n3) Other large TER shareholder is Bruce Linton, ex-CEO of CGC while normally I would say this is bullish for acquisition here I think it is the opposite. There have been numerous articles written that Bruce wasn\u2019t to happy about being shown the door by CGC after STZ came in and doesn\u2019t like what they did to \u201chis\u201d company. I think ego comes into play here and he wants to stick to CGC and say boom I was part of this type of company again and I did it without Billions of dollars and it\u2019s better\u2026\u2026.Im also pretty sure CGC rubbed Berner (Cookies) the wrong way too at some point (this is grapevine but I thought Bruce wanted to buy Cookies, but STZ told him no)\n\n4)CGC has been burning fucking $$$ like it\u2019s Hawaiian Tiki night. They have consistently underperformed in the market, at a point lenders will start turning off the spigot/wanting more collateral. I think this would make selling the 20% attractive or them wanting TER to be part of larger more successful company (so on paper they can say our investment looks XX larger.",

It's related and I hope some of you can find value in it.\n\nThe people saying \"this isn't a big deal\", I think that's disingenuous.  The people saying \"panic!\", that's also disingenuous.  The fact is, we don't know.  I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XtJQzkeAaY) to be very helpful.  He summarizes the potential issues with this new 'nu' variant:\n\n1. It may be more transmissible than other variants, including delta.  That would be shocking because delta is already highly transmissible.\n2. It may be able to get around the vaccines we already have.\n3. It may result in more serious illnesses in those who are infected.  This one is not a serious concern at the moment.\n\nDo note that in this new variant there's 30 mutations to the spike protein, which is why we're concerned that there may implications for vaccine efficacy ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html)).\n\nIn terms of investing, I don't encourage anyone to sell off right now.  That's silly.  Stick to your plan.  This was not meant to be a gloom and doom post.  But at the same time, the folks saying \"this is nothing\", that's not accurate.  It might be!  There's been scares before, obviously.  But at least inform yourself a bit before making statements that not only relate to finance and investing, but also to public health.\n\nFurthermore, at least in my case I'm a little scared.  I remember the feeling of the original Covid outbreak.  At first it was some obscure story in China, then Italy, and next thing I know I was told I was going to have to be working from home and could only go out to buy groceries.  I guess I'm a little traumatized.\n\nFor people who think life is clean and perfect all the time, I'm sure this will look like fear mongering or whatever.  So be it.  But hey, I'm scared right now.  I've got a trip back to the USA to visit my parents for Christmas.  I haven't seen them in 2 years.  I'm worried about what this means for my travel plans.  It's normal.  It's human.  Pretending like there isn't a problem when there is one doesn't solve anything.  There's a reason governments are taking this seriously.\n\nAnyway, it may all blow over, I fully acknowledge that and I hope it's the case!  But just pretending like everything is fine isn't the reality of what we're seeing right now.  I imagine I can't be the only one feeling this way.\n\nSo, best of luck to everyone, stick your investing plan and take care of yourselves!\n\n\\-shorty",

We can now address them without nuking the economy. \n\nIt's up to leaders to make good decisions, which are generally sorely lacking, but they can hardly claim ignorance now.\n\nWhat we have learned is that lockdowns don't work but social distancing does. \n\nMarkets aren't stupid, there is a reason we had a V recovery in March. Most businesses are more able than ever to react to a digital first commerce strategy. There is no reason for the economy to tank.\n\nThe only real reasons behind the market crashing are growth. Is growth slowing? Well China is beginning to flash some pretty big signals and as tapering takes it's toll you'll see normal economies slow too. With slowing growth comes P/E ratios under focus. There are a lot of companies that are overvalued BUT there are also a lot of companies which are at like 50% of this years ATH... There are absolutely bubbles in EVs and such but other areas I'd say are fair valued.\n\nOverall we're just entering a time where you need to modify the way you appraise value and what sectors will be more robust against repeat waves of pandemic. It's sort of like being in a war-time market. \n\nSo, all that being said the broad sell off is a big over-correction because of the short trading day and market Thursday close. By Wednesday the headlines will read \"Markets shrug off virus concerns. Fund managers confident businesses can navigate new strains.\" \n\nThe only real areas of struggle will continue to be big events, big sports events and such. Some regions will have them, some will not. Downtown core commercial property will continue to face headwinds but rents just need to fall. This virus is with us literally forever, it will become another seasonal cold/flu/infectious disease and you'll hear about new variants each year. Pharama will start making broad spectrum covid shots that you'll get with your other myriad. Every country will do deals with pharma so they can maintain critical supply. \n\nThrough all this society will, by and large, ignore issues of health, diet, nutrition, and underlying diseases like diabetes, smoking, lack of exercise. Society will also ignore age and treat all people, including children, at the same risk level as an 85 year old. This irrationality will make people more aggressive, combative, and you'll see more political factions in every nation, especially 'freedom parties'. The only way these are neutralized are with open policies but those are by and large against government directives. Truth is they are welcoming the greater control, digital ID, travelling surveillance, contact tracing, immunization databases. These are all useful for maintaining the elites control, and so these ideas will continue.",

But he wasn't really an agent, although he obviously helped them.  He was a \"journalist\" but his job description was mostly to \"entertain\" American visitors.  These Americans were carefully vetted before being invited to Russia and upon arrival he did things like get them drunk, make Russia look really good, and try to get them in slightly compromised situations.  Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.  That was the majority of KGB \"spy\" operations.\n\nWhen it comes to Evergrand, cui bono? China.  So whether intentionally carrying weight for China or just useful idiots victimized by CCP intel operations, NYT is carrying water for the **CCP who desperately wants to unload assets before the rest of the world catches on**.

You do not touch the higher levels of investing until you have a firm understanding and success at the lower. \nThe lowest level is ETF investing, easy to learn easy to toss money at and make returns. Also builds a strong base to work from\n\n The 2nd is individual stock, once you really learned to analyze investment data. You can also work on the emotional side of your investments in this area like not panicking during a selloff or becoming to elated in your gains not to sell.\n\nThe 3rd level is learning the various trading options such as limits, stop losses and margins. Really it can be bundled into the 2nd BUT these things are generally more important for traders rather Investors.\n\nFinally we get to options, if you don't have a firm grasp and decent experience with the above then you need to stay the hell away from options. They are the ultimate trap to newbie investors who see dipshits on WSB gambling away there entire savings. HOWEVER, a reasonable experienced investor whom can make sound decisions in there investments in the previous level can  infact benefit from limited option trading (can never recommend an all in). \n\nI for one am sitting on some delicious AMD 87.5 leap calls that don't expire til next June.

By the time 7 nm is in production tsm will have released 3 nm. A few years ago intel was only one process node behind but now they are 2.\n\nMaybe the best example of this is my best friend who is not an engineer owning a ton of intel he bought the upward swing of the dip in 2019 and got it for 48. I convinced him to rotate that position into Amd and the best way to do that was xlnx based on price ratio of the two. He was able to get out at 57. He made 18.75% holding a stock for two years during one of the most historic bull runs ever and even an order of magnitude more historic for semiconductor stocks. He rotated all of it into xlnx at 120 and in a few months is up 79%. The delta between Amd price appreciation and intel might not always be that crazy and that fast but for the next two or so years I think most semiconductor stocks will outpace intel gains wise.",

They have technological advantage here. \n\nFurthermore with their new MI200 datacenter GPU they are challenging nvidia in this area as well.\n\nSo overall AMD is better choice, they have a good roadmap, rising margins, rising revenues, they are expanding to new markets (Xilinx) and so far they\u2019ve delivered their promises. \nDisclaimer: my biggest position is AMD shares",

Xilinx stock is at 191 and by far not a peanuts company.  AMD stock is still cheap compared to what it will be in 5 years or less.  Qualcomm is having big gains too.  I have all three plus others and my gains today is damn close to orgasmic.",

        "body": "There\u2019s more to it than just thinking it will hit my  call price. If the stock is at $100, I can buy $140 (or higher/lower, this is just an example) and if the stock goes up I can earn money along the way. Once your option is \u201cin the money (ITM)\u201d your options gain faster. A common strategy is to buy Leaps, which are a year or two out or more (expiration date). Do this with solid companies and look at their performance, price targets, etc. AMDs price target has, mostly, been pushed some where between $130-150. So I bought $130 calls when the price was around $125 (they\u2019ve crushed earnings all year and had big runs the last two ERs). I\u2019ve been in and out of calls with this stock for the past year+. There\u2019s a macro play with merger coming. This is not about gambling. It\u2019s knowing the stock, fundamentals, and preparing accordingly. Fully expect this to run more post-merger with Xilinx. Then will take it from there. Hope this helps.",

        "body": "&gt; And what use case are we seeing for these besides Shors algorithm? A probabilistic computer is not good for almost all the problems we have to solve today, so beyond needing one to help with your cryptography, what is the use case for the market? \n\nI've yet to understand why shor's algorithm even gets mentioned - Seemingly only around hype articles and investing spaces. I'm guessing because it's easy for the layman to understand the nature of the result: \"you get a prime factors and someone told me they're important to encryption\" that's *technically* true for one nature of encryption but absolutely false for symmetric encryption like AES-256. Now we do have Grover's algorithm which reduces the solve space of AES-256 to AES-64 but that's arguably marginal gain because of a dirty \"secret\". Quantum computers don't run as fast as classical computers, there isn't as many processing cycles per second on even the best machines so when you see only quadratic gains in solve time, forget it. It's exponential or bust because of this slow down that you have to overcome.\n\nPhysicists like me want them for simulating quantum physics. I know, pretty meta, but that's our motivation and frankly everything else is just frosting. You need 2^N bits on a classical computer or N qbits, the choice is easy. I believe a lot of \"killer apps\" could simply be built in this benefit of 2^N unitary matrix multiplication resulting in 2^N exponential speed up and 2^N state space.\n\nThe \"probablistic\" nature of these algorithms is already accounted for in the solve time. Circuits are developed so that \"incorrect\" solutions are attributed with both positive and negative probabilities so while your state space is 2^N, your output is completely deterministic and repeatable.\n\nMore tangibly I'd point out computational chemistry which leads into biology and pharmaceuticals.\n\nYou will be able to simulate high-temperature superconductors; the active sites of enzymes containing metal complexes or radicals, photovoltaic materials and inorganic catalyst behavior. Anything that needs precise modeling of electron orbitals is impossible to do classically. Projects like folding@home are monuments to how bad classical computers are at computational chemistry. It's tough to simulate anything without assumptions and simplifications that interfere with your results on a classic machine.\n\nOne example is how the transcription of genetic information encoded in DNA is regulated by histone proteins which exist in a regime where the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down. This forces you to calculate for every electron spin state in the system. Just the Fe ion has 151 electrons and 121 spatial orbitals and that's only one of nine catalytic steps to understanding gene switching. Enter quantum computers\n\nAnother example is how telomerase replenishment is significant to our understanding of stem cell maintenance, aging, and cancer treatment. Quantum computing would have advantage in simulating the catalytic active centers and preserve fidelity during the extension process. This is because the process relies on nucleobase pairing.\n\n \n&gt; noise problem\n\nAs for your purported \"noise problem\" I genuinely don't know what you're talking about. The world record for two gate fidelities, state prep, measurement and entanglement are all beyond acceptable for commercial use today, if someone used noise as an excuse... they used it as a buzz word to wave away impatient investors. The papers that have come out for QEC on logical qbits proves as much. It's getting increasingly frustrating watching companies flail in the space and spread disingenuous quantum hype and quantum excuses to pump their stocks up and while I'm not going to name names, they're everywhere and I hope they're self evident to the critical eye. Look for the humble, steady releases on arxiv.org not the \"we just made a computer 10 million times faster at everything but you can't independently benchmark it yet\" articles.\n\nIt's not the next Fitbit or iPhone, that's for sure but computing is shaping the future and specialized compute units have consistently been the answer. Look how Important companies like Intel, AMD and Nvidia are and they spend a lot of time just making specialized graphics cards, Xilinx just makes FPGA's and Bitfury, ASICS.\n\nWe're rapidly seeing cloud accessible commercial systems that are being leveraged by multiple industries to calculate the solutions to everyday problems. I would bet the first \"wow\"problem  will be chemistry based but it could be natural language processing, logistics, cryptology, or something unexpected. This isn't a video game, these research problems aren't time fungible so I can't possibly know which one will break through first.\n\nI guess my thesis would be, \"don't bet against this technology evolving and improving exponentially\"",

NVDA I think is riding a bigger tail wind from crypto, and IMO is more priced to perfection (disclosure they are above my sell target price), but they have done a good job with software offerings that are quite profitable too.\n\nAll the analysis from Fidelity etc say INTC is undervalued and a buy while they say stay away from AMD.

For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

        "body": "Purchasing shares to cover a short position can work, but it can also work against you. It's a very capital-intensive way to cover the position in any case. I've done it before both successful and not. A more capital-efficient way of doing this is cover the short with a deep ITM long option or a ZEBRA. I prefer ZEBRAs, especially long-dated.\n\nYou are always going to get a lot of sanctimonious knee-jerk responses about selling calls from people who have no idea what they are talking about. As someone who has sold naked calls for years, it's risky and it's a lot harder to make money than by put-selling. There's also a lot of value to balanced delta in my opinion. \n\nMost of the time lately they are either challenged or at an unrealized loss, but rarely ITM, depending on your entry delta. You usually get a month or two out of the year where they are the only thing that pays. It's easy to not be stupid about it. Don't trade meme stocks and don't sell 400 naked puts on a $20K account. The last few months have been rough, because a lot of stuff is up significantly more than volatility had priced in. Vol is just way under priced right now. I have strangles on MSFT, CVS, WMT and XRT that have all blown way past my short call strike. I'm inverted on all of them. At the same time, a lot of stuff has tanked and gone way past my short put strikes.",

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

        "body": "Purchasing shares to cover a short position can work, but it can also work against you. It's a very capital-intensive way to cover the position in any case. I've done it before both successful and not. A more capital-efficient way of doing this is cover the short with a deep ITM long option or a ZEBRA. I prefer ZEBRAs, especially long-dated.\n\nYou are always going to get a lot of sanctimonious knee-jerk responses about selling calls from people who have no idea what they are talking about. As someone who has sold naked calls for years, it's risky and it's a lot harder to make money than by put-selling. There's also a lot of value to balanced delta in my opinion. \n\nMost of the time lately they are either challenged or at an unrealized loss, but rarely ITM, depending on your entry delta. You usually get a month or two out of the year where they are the only thing that pays. It's easy to not be stupid about it. Don't trade meme stocks and don't sell 400 naked puts on a $20K account. The last few months have been rough, because a lot of stuff is up significantly more than volatility had priced in. Vol is just way under priced right now. I have strangles on MSFT, CVS, WMT and XRT that have all blown way past my short call strike. I'm inverted on all of them. At the same time, a lot of stuff has tanked and gone way past my short put strikes.",
