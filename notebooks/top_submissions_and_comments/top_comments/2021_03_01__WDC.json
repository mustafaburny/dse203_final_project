I definitely - *in no way* \\- think Dr Seuss was a racist, but the references and imagery are from a time when certain things were portrayed different from what is acceptable today. Blackface just doesn't cut it nowadays.  \n\n\nYou seem to mean well, but you've definitely come to the wrong place.
