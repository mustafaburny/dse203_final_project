Actually invest most of your free flow money into solid investments, and play with penny stocks with only a relatively small designated percent of your money.\n\nFor instance, my base portfolio (85%) is in JPM, T, XOM, CIM, TTWO, ABBV, SWKS, CAT, TCEHY, LUV, QQQ, and SLV.  They are slow and steady, for the most part, and should ensure some relative stability and a persistent upward trend over the years.  The remaining 15% is in various moonshots and scalping positions, and remains volatile but fun.",
