They also have a track record of producing the best revolutionary modems and chipsets out there, so I'm betting it'll happen again.

I'll take the dividend re-investment at these low prices (On the ones paying dividends, of course), continue to add to my positions on decent dips, and look back in, very likely, 12 months and be looking at all time highs again. \n\nIt was a story I told my brothers yesterday, on an anecdotal level, of course, but one that I do believe applies to many Americans:\n\nI had to run to CVS to get a prescription for my daughter yesterday, while I was waiting in line, I used my apple iPhone, on my Verizon cell phone, to call my wife to make sure we didn't need anything else. All the while, I went on Facebook to see what late / great breaking news there would be. When I finally got to the cashier, I used my American express credit card to buy the goods. On the way out, I happened to see some Cherry Vanilla Coke, of which I bought, and then left. \n\nMy point is that, if the common investor, like myself, can take a step back, specifically at these market prices, we really are getting unreal buys for the long term with companies that are well capitalized, well used and well positioned, when the corona virus goes away, to succeed in the future. \n\nBTW: I would order off of Amazon, but we all know they are focused on the medical / essential side of things. \n\nWorking under the presumption that the government is going to bail out the American worker, I think now may be the greatest investment opportunity we have had in a while for stock pickers. \n\nGood luck everyone!",

And if you go read a couple of posts that I made last Thursday and Friday, you will see that the trades in question follow my strategy almost to a \"T\". I average about $141/trade and I've found when I'm cautious, I get to keep my stock and all of my premiums......100% of the time FUCK-STICK. However having said that, I'm prepared to \"settle\" for $50 - $75 on a trade to protect a position.....remember, my AVERAGE is $141/trade. Now if you go read those posts, I was actually quite disappointed and actually quite critical of myself FUCK-STICK because on the JPM $93, we were at about $95 at the close of business on Thursday night. Thankfully we had a down day on Friday, but I was able to keep the stock and the premiums....but it was too close for comfort. And on the SWKS calls, again I had the 3/20 $90 written and at the close of business on Thursday, SWKS was at something like $92 - $93. Again, I was fortunate to be able to keep them but I don't trade on LUCK. if you are trading on luck, you are going to lose your ass and jump out of a window. The fact that I used luck this time was unsettling for me and forced me to take a step back, reevaluate my strategy and make the changes necessary on Monday to make sure I don't do it again (it's kind of nice to be able to report 100% dead on accuracy for a full 6 month cycle in an absolute blood-bath of a market.....even if FUCK-STICKS on Reddit don't get it). Now there you go FUCK-STICK. I actually re-capped that for you. I actually wasn't proud of either one of those trades, but do you know what? I can still say I haven't had an option exercised in more than 6 months. Again, that absolutely could change this week, and if it does, it's going to suck, but this week, I WILL be more careful. By the way, if I do this on 10 or 20 stocks, do you wonder how much money I'm actually going to make?\n\nOne other thing FUCK-STICK, I put my fucking money where my mouth is. I have been buying stock and have made purchases about every few weeks since the first of the year. My last purchase was CREE on 3/26. I absolutely don't give a FUCK what anybody thinks and just for the record, I have owned most of my stocks since about the mid 90's. This would be a good chance to work on your charting skills FUCK-STICK!!!!!\n\nCheers!",

        "body": "My rationale is relatively simple, pertaining to the stocks I own, AMZN, GOOG, FB, CVS, PFE, QCOM, SWKS, in that, should job growth decrease and, layoffs occur in abundance, how significant will the earnings of these specific companies be hurt? Do you retrench earnings back 10%, 20%, 30%, again, specifically related to these companies. Personally, based on what I have seen in the past, I believe it's more reasonable, than not, to assume those specific companies will likely see a decrease to the tune of 10% in earnings, given that they are, essentially, vital to the normal routine lives of a majority of the people, not only in this country, but across the world. So, using Google as an example, they had FY earnings of, about, $50 EPS in 2019. Their high was about $1525. Assume, for the sake of the argument that their EPS declines to the tune of 10%, or $5 EPS, making their prospective 2020 total $45. Using a fair multiple, of say 22X, that puts fair value of that stock at: $990 --- would you buy google at $990, or do you think there is further downside? The exercise can go on for the likes of CVS, where folks are going to get their scripts filled, one way or the other, and FB, where, I could argue, the more people are at home, the more people are using it and Instagram. Again, it's a numbers game. This is how I value stocks and, at least for myself, value how I will buy the stocks OR how I will buy puts / buy calls against and for them.",

        "body": "I'll give you two more pieces of information to chew on:\n\n1) All of the numbers I presented to you are from trades I am making weekly, or on an ongoing basis. Two trades I made this week might be worth looking at. On Tuesday, 3/24 I sold covered calls on JPM &amp; SWKS (I own both stocks).\n\nJPM (200 shares) - I sold the 3/27 Call at $93 for $0.72 and made $139 (plus or minus a few pennies for commissions). We closed today (Fri) at $91.13. I got to keep both my stock, and my option premium.\n\nSWKS (200 shares) - I sold the 3/27 Call at $90 for $0.74 and made $145 (plus or minus a few pennies for commissions). We closed today at $87.09. I got to keep both my stock, and my option premium.\n\nI think a fair number of people would look at that and say \"wow, you're a genius. You got to keep your stock AND you made $285 in 3 trading days, and you will get to do it again on Monday.\" And while I did get to keep my $285 and my stock, I looked at both of these trades as pretty close to abject failures....and here's why:  On Tuesday, I was expecting Wed/Thur/Fri to be either neutral, or down days based on the prior few trading sessions. Thursday surprised me by being a fairly strong up day and by the end of the day, I was out of the money on both of these trades. I was incredibly lucky that the market was down today. Had the market stayed neutral (or gone up) I would have lost both of my stocks. I would have generated a taxable event on both of these stocks, and because both of these stocks pay dividends, I would have lost about $270 worth of dividends. This, potentially for me, was a disastrous trade. I got DAMN lucky, and sometimes it's ok if you have just a little bit of luck on your side, but it is ALWAYS better to not need it. The question I ask myself is did I REALLY need to make $285? Could I have \"settled\" for $200? Or $185? Or $100? And the answer is that I could have easily settled for less option premium and less risk that I would have my stock called away. I kind of got cocky and stretched my own trading rules and nearly paid the price. When I do this next week, when I start asking myself questions about my risk/reward, I will likely answer those questions quite differently, and accept slightly less option premium for more comfort that I won't get my options exercised.\n\n2) All of the numbers that I gave you before, regarding my trades really include just my normal option trading strategies on stocks that I hold in my portfolio.....but once in a while, I like to jump out there and have a little bit of fun with what I call a \"FUN\" trade. On 3/24 Boeing was on a bit of a bounce from their low of about $90. Being down from $349 to $90, I see value in BA as long as I'm comfortable that they are not going out of business. So again, on Tuesday with BA at around $120, I jumped out there and sold 4/17 $110 PUTS for $16.00/share. I expected some form of stimulus package from the U.S. Gov't and upside to come. I was fully prepared to own BA at $110 (actually at $94 because I've already received $16 on my PUTS), and I still am if BA should  drop below $110. Well, within 24 hours, the Boeing CEO made a statement that they really don't need the $60 Billion dollars that they wanted entirely for free as long as the Gov't was planning to take an equity stake in the company.....and within two trading sessions, BA was at $180/share on its way to the moon. Now I was prepared to own Boeing at $94 and still will be if it drops below $110 on 4/17.  I could have stepped out there and bought a couple of hundred shares and made quite a bit of money, but that's not my game. I'm prepared to \"settle\" for what I considered a REALLY safe 24 day bet, and if I don't own BA, I can settle for my $1,600/contract. If BA is above $110 but below where it is today, I can potentially lower my cost basis even more by selling another put, or if BA is already past the moon and on its way up to mars, I can happily wave goodbye knowing I already squeezed what I wanted out of it with little to no risk. I use this as an entrance strategy, and truthfully I believe I will own BA before this is all over with and I believe I will own it for less than $90/share.\n\nI will post a snapshot of the trades I made above under my profile and will delete them within 24 hours just so you know I'm not blowing smoke up your ass.\n\nEveryone gets to select their own trading / investing strategy and mine happens to be a very conservative strategy using the most aggressive tools in the industry (options). LOL When I tell people that I trade options and it's \"conservative\", they have a really difficult time getting their heads wrapped around that. I also have friends that believe a 90% success rate with their trades is acceptable so when I say my goal is 100%, again they have a really difficult time with that conceptually. Nobody should ever set their goal to be a loser if you are not...but we all get to select a risk/reward strategy that works best for us.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!",

Then a month ago China goes on lockdown and I'm like \"okay, how do I bet against Apple's silicon vendors? Bet those wallstreetbets idiots know\". I buy one SWKS put contract, and a MSFT FD call because I was told it literally could not go tits up. MSFT call goes to shit instant, obvi, but the SWKS put starts creeping up in value. Then Feb 24 rolls around and suddenly my portfolio is raining tendies. Transferred as much cash as I felt comfortable losing into my brokerage account, and it been an obsession from that point forward.\n\nPersonal high score was 16k profit, down to 8k after the presser pump yesterday. HOLDING MY FUCKING PUTS.",
