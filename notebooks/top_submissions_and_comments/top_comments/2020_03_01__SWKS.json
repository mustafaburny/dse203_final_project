I bought the following CALLS on Friday, and plan to hold:\n\n5 LYB Jan 15th 2021 45 at $6.37\n\n20 GM Jan 15 2021 30 at $1.51\n\n20 XOM July 17 2020 40 at $3.64 - plan to close this one in the week ahead if we get a pop. (I bought it after I heard the president talk about buying some of the cheap oil in the market and filling up our coffers)\n\n12 Big Lots Jan 15 2021 20 at $1.45 \n\n5 XOM Oct 16th 2020 45 at $4.67. (May hold on to this one longer term as I believe we will see a bounce in oil in the coming months)\n\nHeavily considering buying July Puts on the SPY at the $200 range and Apple at the $225 range as well. \n\nMy positions are fluid and are aimed, generally speaking and specifically on the PUT side, to give me downside protection on the nearly $600,000 I have in long positions. \n\nNervous times, generally speaking, but, with a longer term horizon, likely 12 months, in mind, I believe we have MANY moats that will pull us out of this thing quicker and more robustly than we have seen in the previous bear markets--- lower oil prices, VERY low interest rates, a pro business FED and US GOVT AND, potentially most importantly, PENT up demand that will be fully unleased with a ripe garden of money, loans and oil that are there for the taking!\n\nWhile I lose about $30,000, give or take, per 2,000 point down day, I also add to positions for the long term, specifically, in Google, Amazon, Facebook, CVS, Cisco, QCOM, Pfizer and SWKS. \n\nI wish everyone the best of luck and will say, generally speaking, be greedy when others are fearful. \n\nI believe we are DAMN close to having a recession AND a corona virus effect fully priced into the market, outside of Apple, which I believe has significantly more downside.",

They also have a track record of producing the best revolutionary modems and chipsets out there, so I'm betting it'll happen again.

Are people, even with the corona virus, going to stop paying their cell phone bill / using their cell phone (Verizon)? Is 5G, which from everything I\u2019ve read, is going to be transformative, going to stop because of corona virus (Qualcomm / Skyworks)? I think the answers are simple, and, frankly, I\u2019m an investor, so these are special opportunities!\n\nAdditionally, no one ever picks the bottom correctly so start buying down. Long term, with these companies, you will be more than glad that you did.\n\nIf your concerned about the short term, I would recommend, like I am doing, buying the stock (at a price you like) and buy a put against it. If it goes up, great. If it goes down, which is likely in the short term, you profit without selling / losing your shares.\n\nKeep some cash on the sideline too, but always keep the long term horizon in view. There are ways to make money on a downturn AND ways to minimize the loss!\n\nGood luck!",

What I would tell for aspiring day traders is to keep it simple. On a day like today, 3/5/2020, it's likely we are going to see the market drop 1,000 points. When it hits that number, or close to it, by some calls on solid stocks. Similarly, yesterday, my brothers and I were buying puts when it hit the highs. The market has a ways to go until stabilization and I believe that April earnings are going to give clarity on the matter. I would stay away from travel / leisure stocks. Names like: qcom, swks, aapl, sbux, nke, fl, VOO, SPY are the easiest ways to buy puts and buy calls. Really, it comes down to doing a little bit of homework, following bond rates --- when the 10 year rolls below 1% that means folks are rolling money out of the market and into bonds and vice versa. Also, give yourself some time on the puts or calls. Good luck",

I'll take the dividend re-investment at these low prices (On the ones paying dividends, of course), continue to add to my positions on decent dips, and look back in, very likely, 12 months and be looking at all time highs again. \n\nIt was a story I told my brothers yesterday, on an anecdotal level, of course, but one that I do believe applies to many Americans:\n\nI had to run to CVS to get a prescription for my daughter yesterday, while I was waiting in line, I used my apple iPhone, on my Verizon cell phone, to call my wife to make sure we didn't need anything else. All the while, I went on Facebook to see what late / great breaking news there would be. When I finally got to the cashier, I used my American express credit card to buy the goods. On the way out, I happened to see some Cherry Vanilla Coke, of which I bought, and then left. \n\nMy point is that, if the common investor, like myself, can take a step back, specifically at these market prices, we really are getting unreal buys for the long term with companies that are well capitalized, well used and well positioned, when the corona virus goes away, to succeed in the future. \n\nBTW: I would order off of Amazon, but we all know they are focused on the medical / essential side of things. \n\nWorking under the presumption that the government is going to bail out the American worker, I think now may be the greatest investment opportunity we have had in a while for stock pickers. \n\nGood luck everyone!",

        "body": "My rationale is relatively simple, pertaining to the stocks I own, AMZN, GOOG, FB, CVS, PFE, QCOM, SWKS, in that, should job growth decrease and, layoffs occur in abundance, how significant will the earnings of these specific companies be hurt? Do you retrench earnings back 10%, 20%, 30%, again, specifically related to these companies. Personally, based on what I have seen in the past, I believe it's more reasonable, than not, to assume those specific companies will likely see a decrease to the tune of 10% in earnings, given that they are, essentially, vital to the normal routine lives of a majority of the people, not only in this country, but across the world. So, using Google as an example, they had FY earnings of, about, $50 EPS in 2019. Their high was about $1525. Assume, for the sake of the argument that their EPS declines to the tune of 10%, or $5 EPS, making their prospective 2020 total $45. Using a fair multiple, of say 22X, that puts fair value of that stock at: $990 --- would you buy google at $990, or do you think there is further downside? The exercise can go on for the likes of CVS, where folks are going to get their scripts filled, one way or the other, and FB, where, I could argue, the more people are at home, the more people are using it and Instagram. Again, it's a numbers game. This is how I value stocks and, at least for myself, value how I will buy the stocks OR how I will buy puts / buy calls against and for them.",

        "body": "I'll give you two more pieces of information to chew on:\n\n1) All of the numbers I presented to you are from trades I am making weekly, or on an ongoing basis. Two trades I made this week might be worth looking at. On Tuesday, 3/24 I sold covered calls on JPM &amp; SWKS (I own both stocks).\n\nJPM (200 shares) - I sold the 3/27 Call at $93 for $0.72 and made $139 (plus or minus a few pennies for commissions). We closed today (Fri) at $91.13. I got to keep both my stock, and my option premium.\n\nSWKS (200 shares) - I sold the 3/27 Call at $90 for $0.74 and made $145 (plus or minus a few pennies for commissions). We closed today at $87.09. I got to keep both my stock, and my option premium.\n\nI think a fair number of people would look at that and say \"wow, you're a genius. You got to keep your stock AND you made $285 in 3 trading days, and you will get to do it again on Monday.\" And while I did get to keep my $285 and my stock, I looked at both of these trades as pretty close to abject failures....and here's why:  On Tuesday, I was expecting Wed/Thur/Fri to be either neutral, or down days based on the prior few trading sessions. Thursday surprised me by being a fairly strong up day and by the end of the day, I was out of the money on both of these trades. I was incredibly lucky that the market was down today. Had the market stayed neutral (or gone up) I would have lost both of my stocks. I would have generated a taxable event on both of these stocks, and because both of these stocks pay dividends, I would have lost about $270 worth of dividends. This, potentially for me, was a disastrous trade. I got DAMN lucky, and sometimes it's ok if you have just a little bit of luck on your side, but it is ALWAYS better to not need it. The question I ask myself is did I REALLY need to make $285? Could I have \"settled\" for $200? Or $185? Or $100? And the answer is that I could have easily settled for less option premium and less risk that I would have my stock called away. I kind of got cocky and stretched my own trading rules and nearly paid the price. When I do this next week, when I start asking myself questions about my risk/reward, I will likely answer those questions quite differently, and accept slightly less option premium for more comfort that I won't get my options exercised.\n\n2) All of the numbers that I gave you before, regarding my trades really include just my normal option trading strategies on stocks that I hold in my portfolio.....but once in a while, I like to jump out there and have a little bit of fun with what I call a \"FUN\" trade. On 3/24 Boeing was on a bit of a bounce from their low of about $90. Being down from $349 to $90, I see value in BA as long as I'm comfortable that they are not going out of business. So again, on Tuesday with BA at around $120, I jumped out there and sold 4/17 $110 PUTS for $16.00/share. I expected some form of stimulus package from the U.S. Gov't and upside to come. I was fully prepared to own BA at $110 (actually at $94 because I've already received $16 on my PUTS), and I still am if BA should  drop below $110. Well, within 24 hours, the Boeing CEO made a statement that they really don't need the $60 Billion dollars that they wanted entirely for free as long as the Gov't was planning to take an equity stake in the company.....and within two trading sessions, BA was at $180/share on its way to the moon. Now I was prepared to own Boeing at $94 and still will be if it drops below $110 on 4/17.  I could have stepped out there and bought a couple of hundred shares and made quite a bit of money, but that's not my game. I'm prepared to \"settle\" for what I considered a REALLY safe 24 day bet, and if I don't own BA, I can settle for my $1,600/contract. If BA is above $110 but below where it is today, I can potentially lower my cost basis even more by selling another put, or if BA is already past the moon and on its way up to mars, I can happily wave goodbye knowing I already squeezed what I wanted out of it with little to no risk. I use this as an entrance strategy, and truthfully I believe I will own BA before this is all over with and I believe I will own it for less than $90/share.\n\nI will post a snapshot of the trades I made above under my profile and will delete them within 24 hours just so you know I'm not blowing smoke up your ass.\n\nEveryone gets to select their own trading / investing strategy and mine happens to be a very conservative strategy using the most aggressive tools in the industry (options). LOL When I tell people that I trade options and it's \"conservative\", they have a really difficult time getting their heads wrapped around that. I also have friends that believe a 90% success rate with their trades is acceptable so when I say my goal is 100%, again they have a really difficult time with that conceptually. Nobody should ever set their goal to be a loser if you are not...but we all get to select a risk/reward strategy that works best for us.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!",

I think the two biggest dangers are: 1) $CGC price collapses on delisting from nyse back to $TWMJF on otc due to funds that are not allowed to put their pensioners, clients, etc. money in a company trading otc. So $CGC gets stomped into the ground allowing STZ to create an option to buy CGC based on these depressed ass prices; 2) so CGC uses cash to buy a depressed MSO [which one - prices are still wide between some of the peers?], but CGC doesn't have its opex under control yet to operate itself profitably meaning the cash cushion it currently has available is required until CGC reaches profitability. Sooo I have a hard time seeing this as a possibility unless a sudden, multi-tiered plan occurs: CGC announces that: 1) CGC, ACRG, TER all enter into a fuck ton of IIPR sale-lease deals for more cash upfront; 2) CGC will trade back on otc; 3) CGC will acquire ACRG + TER; 4) CGC announces an all cash acquisition of said MSO; 5) In exchange of a shit-term deal with STZ acquiring CGC's shares via option in the future, STZ agrees to provide an upfront premium cash equity infusion of $2B now in exchange for another 25% (or w/e) of CGC to be converted into CGC shares under STZ's ownership upon federal permissibility - along with all of their existing ownership of shares placed into escrow until such federal event...prob with qualifiers allowing STZ to withdraw their option from escrow upon certain events occurring for their own protection, too...hmmm lmao",
