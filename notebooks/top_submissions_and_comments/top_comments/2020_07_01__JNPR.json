        "body": "I seriously thought about buying a Model 3 last year.  Ultimately I did not as I think I would have range anxiety on long trips.  But a number of friends have Teslas and each of them really like the car.  I also think that Tesla is going to be a viable car company long term and will do well in the future.\n\nThe problem is that the current price would only be justified if they were already profitable building and selling 5-6 mm cars per year and they don't do 10% of that and are not in any way profitable.   So anyone buying now is assuming they will find somebody that is a greater fool than they are to actually buy the stock from them at a price higher than $1500.\n\nIn 2000 I was young and stupid and financially had a great year.  Some of the companies I invested in that are still very successful and still leaders in their field were CSCO and JNPR.   2000 was the year of the internet and Cisco built all the routers for the internet worldwide.  Some ex Cisco employees had started Juniper and were building specialty routers that were pushing Cisco to improve.   All of that still is true and both companies are fabulously profitable and leaders in their field but today can be classified as old tech.  I paid $65/sh for CSCO and bought JNPR at $65, $83, and $115/sh.   Today CSCO is $48 and JNPR is $22 with no splits in the meantime.   Sometime you can be early and never recover.   That is where Tesla is now.   In 20 years 80% of the cars being sold will be EVs or H2 and every manufacturer will be making excellent products.  Tesla will be old tech and the 20 year olds now pumping Tesla will be 40 with 2 kids approaching college age and wondering about that $1500/sh stock they bought in 2020 that is worth $350/sh in 2040.",

        "body": "I have been investing in warrants for 5+ years and can appreciate your frustration, but would like to address some of your points on where my opinions differ:\n\n1. **Whether or not warrants are overvalued.** The claim that warrants are overvalued is only true on a case-by-case basis. You pay a premium to acquire warrants of high-profile SPAC teams (FEAC and CCXX, for example). Before the SPAC craze began in June, I used to think of the price of a warrant as the % likelihood that the team finds a deal (warrants that cost $0.30 = 30% chance of executing a combination, warrants priced at $1.10 = 110% chance of executing a combination).  That has changed now that everyone has been piling into warrants after being wooed by the 25 and 50-baggers following the Nikola and DraftKings SPACs. The most straightforward way to think about warrants is that they are a15% OTM call option that expires in 5 years. Paying under $1 for that chance is worth it, in my opinion.\n2. **Criteria for purchasing warrants**. My criteria are the following: (1) Time. I only invest in SPACs who have at least 4 months remaining to execute a combination. And generally, the further out they are, the cheaper the warrants are. (2) Size. SPACs that are larger than $150M have a 95% chance of executing a combination, so I don't touch any SPACs that have raised less than that. (3) great management team. Selfishly, I am mostly just looking for teams who have deep deal-making experience. I don't care if they were a CEO of a fortune 500 company, I just want to see them get a deal done. (4) Significant upside potential. Warrants trading between $0.50 and $1.00 that meet the above criteria are no-brainers for me. \n3. **Buying Pre- vs. Post- announcement**. This is all about risk appetite. Buying warrants post-announcement eliminates the reward of a 50-100% return upon announcement. Buying *commons* post-announcement is virtually the same thing as just investing in any other stock in the stock market. Ups and downs. I much prefer the riskier side, because considering 95% of the SPACs I invest in will find a company to buy (since I only buy &gt;$150M SPACs), the risk is mitigated but the opportunity is still significant.\n\nHere are a list of warrants I'm invested in, and why I bought them. Not investment advice, but hopefully a guide for a renewed way of looking at things:\n\n* **IPV/WS**: InterPrivate is a $241M SPAC with a terrific, deal-experienced management team with over a year left to find a combination. The warrants are going for $0.72.\n* **DFNS/WS**: LGL Systems is a $172M SPAC focused on the defense industry and is run by one of the co-founders of L3 Communications. The USA spends $700B on defense every year - meaning there are limitless defense companies. This one just has to find *one*. This is trading at $1.03.\n* **JIH/WS**: Juniper Industrial Holdings is run by two former Honeywell executives who have executed over 60 M&amp;A transactions during their tenure. It's also a $345M SPAC with over a year left to find a combination, yet the warrants are trading at a meager $0.97!\n* **GIX/WS:** GigCapital2 has over 4 months left to find a company and is $172M. This is their second SPAC; Gig1 combined with Kaleyra, which isn't doing great, but they still have a SPAC under their belt and a low % chance of failure. Only trading for $0.73!\n* **GIK/WS:** GigCapital3 has over a year left to find a company to buy and is the same management team as GigCapital2, and is $200M. A company doing another IPO while their other SPAC is still open is super risky, so I reason that GigCapital2 must be close to announcing a combination. This is trading at $0.56.",

The obvious bubbles are in ZM, Shop, TSLA and others that really are one trick ponies.  But think about the problems in 2000.  We had just had the internet millenial clock challenge so everybody and been spending a lot on hardware.  And the market simply projected that growth forward for years.   It didn't happen.  Are we making the same mistake now with services and the Cloud?  There has to be a point where, like hardware, the services are mature and the crazy growth comes back to single digits.  When/if that happens these crazy multiples will come way down.   I certainly could be wrong but if that happens in cloud and services we are going to see a real problem in AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and MSFT just as happened with INTC, CSCO, JNPR and AMAT in 2000.",

The flavors are designed to replicate alcoholic drinks like Fireball, Margarita, Moscow Mule, Malibu Coconut Rum, Amaretto, Kahlua. They also offer non-alcoholic ready to drink cocktails under the Beckett's brand names, available at Bevmo, and soon to begin trials at warehouse stores like Sam's or Costco.\n\nThey built a new plant with a high-tech bottling line, which just got its license yesterday. In addition to making their own drinks, they are expected to announce copacking deals to make cannabis drinks for their clients. Former NBA player Baron Davis is on board as an advisor, he helped grow and sell Vitaminwater.\n\nAs they expand their line of beverage offerings, they typically do a news release and a marketing campaign. They have recently updated their website to include 3 new drinks that have not yet been announced. It seems logical that they will soon do a press release to announce their new - Coffee Cask (Kahlua), Juniper Sky (Gin &amp; Tonic), and Mystic Dove (Paloma).\n\nTinley announcing these drinks, and commencing their marketing campaign should be a great catalyst.\n\n$TNYBF in the US, or $TNY on the CSE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's their corporate presentation.

        "body": "Ok so I\u2019m actually a professional historian. And there are two things to keep in mind which make this whole analysis BS. \n\n1.\t History tells us about the past. Not he future. This should be basic for anyone investing, as \u201cpast performance does not guarantee future performance.\u201d So anyone claiming to predict the future based off of this kind of analysis, is making shut up. Or at least highly unreliable. \n2.\tmaking comparisons over 800 years is very complicated. And also in many different places around the world. Context is important. And a lot of his data is it out of context just because you can\u2019t compare England in 1300 with Russia or Poland in 1800. \n\nAlso there are actual, historical factors which have contribute to lower interest rates, and one might say that these changes and factors have already been \u201cpriced in.\u201d  \n\n1.\tIn the Middle Ages, debt was expensive in large part because the supply of credit was highly limited. The Catholic Church made any interest bearing debt essentially illegal. That\u2019s why Jews were involved, they weren\u2019t Christians so the church allowed them to lend money at interest. As debt has been more freely available this has contributed to lower interest rates. \n2.\tin MA and early modern Europe there was a lot more uncertainty and constant warfare which also contributed o high interest rates. There was less information. If you are in Vienna and want to lend money to someone in Paris, wel it takes a week for a letter to get there. That increases risk and thus interest rates. As technology has improved, and the world generally more peaceful, some of those risks have been mitigated. \n3.\tThe rise of credit bureaus and credit scores is also important. We have a society with a greater degree of trust, in certain ways. The bank can determine who will pay their loans. That allows them to offer lower interest rates. \n\nAnyway this is not to dispute the data itself but it points to the fact that interest rates will not continue to lower indefinitely. It\u2019s not some universal historical or economic law, but reflects other macro historical and technological/societal changes.",

It seems to me their business is just too narrow compared with OKTA.\n\nI really like SEA, especially because of their payments and gaming segments. I like in Bangkok, been in Thailand for 10 years. The growth is jaw dropping. I went upcountry for 5 years and when I moved to Bangkok recently, my jaw literally hit the floor. Their infrastructure, construction, transport, use of technology. Thais are very much \"plugged-in\" tech-wise. I am not just talking about young people either. \n\nI like SE Asia as region in general for growth in the years to come. MELI is very compelling. I just worry about the instability of the region in general, but also love their payments segment which is driving most of their growth, I think.\n\nI am a fan of MA/V going forward. Not so sure about SQ. I don't really wanna invest. I am, however, looking to find a fintech plays that can capture the trend better than V/MA. I think MELI, and SEA, are decent plays on that.\n\nThe e-commerce here does cash-on-delivery by the way (and that is the most common payment method here, rather than card...even app payments haven't really kicked off here yet).\n\nI don't know much about the cloud stocks to be honest (CRWD, NET, FASLY). I do love the concept of telemedicine and I am invested in LVGO. I invested in TTD over a year a go and dumbly sold it during the crash..oops! Waiting for re-entry. It is probably the stock I am most bullish on. Selling it was just dumb-greed on my part - thought I could buy back lower/didn't think the stimulus would do much for the market. Hoping it will hit mid-300s again!\n\nLVGO still seems inexpensive, despite the big run up. I can't see it being hit much in another pull-back.",

I've been in wsb since 2014. First as a lurker and then I used to spend hours here daily. It became a big distraction for me throughout medical school almost causing me to drop out. Even this past year I'd stopped trading as I got married, graduated and started working as a medical resident, and in Feb dumped 3k in as markets tanked , yoloed it into 80, and tried yoloing it more losing a good most of it. Made me laugh. Some things never change. Couple years I took square/mu calls from 2k to 80 in a week. Did I withdraw? Ofc not. No lessons learned. \n\nI've also seen wsb turn into what used to celebrate losing culture as much as winning into a win-only forum that barely glorifies/pretends losses exist anymore. Anything that gets wsb publicised is wins, half the posts are fake or guys with mega accounts posting their play money Tesla calls so they can jerk off as college kids drool at their portfolios. What got me into wsb was that kid who made 50 grand back in 2015. We have ppl posting those plays every ten minutes here now. \n\nFrom March -may I spent a lot of time here and felt myself getting sucked back in as markets swayed but decided to kick the habit again and check out wsb a couple times a week, and remember why I'm not as into it as I used to be. I've talked to others much smarter than me who made millions, used to post here, got bored felt incomplete and found meaning elsewhere. \n\nAt the end of the day my stupid bets paid off like almost 200k of med school but the amount of money I had to hide/pretend I didn't have (which was complicated because unfortunately my parents had to be involved in my tax filing for certain reasons), and how desensitized I got to losing 10-20k in minutes opened my eyes to how I was changing negatively here and needed some introspection. While it helped pay for school, it almost lost me relationships as I prioritized trading over friends/family. Trading hours turned into checking when futures opened turned into checking Eurasian markets before bed turned into waking up to checking premarkets..... If you have an addictive personality like me, Just be careful. This community is humorous, supportive, and often welcoming when you feel others don't understand you. But be aware.  \n\nAs a medical resident now I'm making like 55-60k a year working 80 hour weeks, my schedule fucks me, my life is a constant stress, but I have meaning and happiness in treating patients that I never had before despite the laughable like $5 per hour salary.  Just encourage you to find meaning in something you do separate from this. \n\nTldr: no one will read this it's too long.",

On the contrary.\n\nAnd I am not saying T didn't fucked up things buying shit at gold price, but at the end of the day (or the year, or 5 years) the market is gonna put everyone's in place.\n\n\nAMD and NVDA are CLEARLY Overpriced.\n\nAnd MU is CLEARLY undervalued.\n\nYou can use whatever technique you want to calculate intrinsic value or fair value. There is no way, any of your calculations put MU under a fair price of  60$. And even others elevate that number.\n\nMay be it takes 1 month, may be one year. But MU is gonna be at 60$ soon.

Now, that's in a very small controlled environment which has super high airflow you can feel it blowing on your face when you work in it. Whole rooms are much harder to keep clean. We have trouble keeping out ISO 7 room at that level and they don't even test down to 0.1 microns. Testing stops at 0.5 microns for a whole room environments where we are concerned with bacterial/fungal contamination of drugs that will be directly injected into humans. \n\nwe've got retards spouting technical specifications designed by manufacturers to give the best number possible so they can tell consumers how good their filters are. in the real world, nobody uses HEPA filters for that purpose because they don't work. no medical professional thinks their hepa filter stops viruses. we aren't retarded regardless of what a manufacturer says we also have the data that shows they are full of shit because we are required by law to know these numbers.",

I think NVDA will hit saturation unless they show a real compelling reason for their ARM product.\n\nFor manufacturer I only know TSM. AMD is going to eventually use TSM once their global foundaries contract ends. MU seems like a stable stock to hoard dividends. I would probably do TSM because I know a bit about em. \n\nJust my opinion.",

I've been in wsb since 2014. First as a lurker and then I used to spend hours here daily. It became a big distraction for me throughout medical school almost causing me to drop out. Even this past year I'd stopped trading as I got married, graduated and started working as a medical resident, and in Feb dumped 3k in as markets tanked , yoloed it into 80, and tried yoloing it more losing a good most of it. Made me laugh. Some things never change. Couple years I took square/mu calls from 2k to 80 in a week. Did I withdraw? Ofc not. No lessons learned. \n\nI've also seen wsb turn into what used to celebrate losing culture as much as winning into a win-only forum that barely glorifies/pretends losses exist anymore. Anything that gets wsb publicised is wins, half the posts are fake or guys with mega accounts posting their play money Tesla calls so they can jerk off as college kids drool at their portfolios. What got me into wsb was that kid who made 50 grand back in 2015. We have ppl posting those plays every ten minutes here now. \n\nFrom March -may I spent a lot of time here and felt myself getting sucked back in as markets swayed but decided to kick the habit again and check out wsb a couple times a week, and remember why I'm not as into it as I used to be. I've talked to others much smarter than me who made millions, used to post here, got bored felt incomplete and found meaning elsewhere. \n\nAt the end of the day my stupid bets paid off like almost 200k of med school but the amount of money I had to hide/pretend I didn't have (which was complicated because unfortunately my parents had to be involved in my tax filing for certain reasons), and how desensitized I got to losing 10-20k in minutes opened my eyes to how I was changing negatively here and needed some introspection. While it helped pay for school, it almost lost me relationships as I prioritized trading over friends/family. Trading hours turned into checking when futures opened turned into checking Eurasian markets before bed turned into waking up to checking premarkets..... If you have an addictive personality like me, Just be careful. This community is humorous, supportive, and often welcoming when you feel others don't understand you. But be aware.  \n\nAs a medical resident now I'm making like 55-60k a year working 80 hour weeks, my schedule fucks me, my life is a constant stress, but I have meaning and happiness in treating patients that I never had before despite the laughable like $5 per hour salary.  Just encourage you to find meaning in something you do separate from this. \n\nTldr: no one will read this it's too long.",

On the contrary.\n\nAnd I am not saying T didn't fucked up things buying shit at gold price, but at the end of the day (or the year, or 5 years) the market is gonna put everyone's in place.\n\n\nAMD and NVDA are CLEARLY Overpriced.\n\nAnd MU is CLEARLY undervalued.\n\nYou can use whatever technique you want to calculate intrinsic value or fair value. There is no way, any of your calculations put MU under a fair price of  60$. And even others elevate that number.\n\nMay be it takes 1 month, may be one year. But MU is gonna be at 60$ soon.

Now, that's in a very small controlled environment which has super high airflow you can feel it blowing on your face when you work in it. Whole rooms are much harder to keep clean. We have trouble keeping out ISO 7 room at that level and they don't even test down to 0.1 microns. Testing stops at 0.5 microns for a whole room environments where we are concerned with bacterial/fungal contamination of drugs that will be directly injected into humans. \n\nwe've got retards spouting technical specifications designed by manufacturers to give the best number possible so they can tell consumers how good their filters are. in the real world, nobody uses HEPA filters for that purpose because they don't work. no medical professional thinks their hepa filter stops viruses. we aren't retarded regardless of what a manufacturer says we also have the data that shows they are full of shit because we are required by law to know these numbers.",
