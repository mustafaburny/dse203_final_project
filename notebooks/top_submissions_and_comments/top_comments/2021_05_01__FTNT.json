        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC, BTCX or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

The US could move all government bond settlements to a blockchain. Why would they do that? It's cheaper. You authorize half a dozen large banks to participate in the quorum and turn down all the government-run infrastructure except the bit that signs the keys of the participants.",

        "body": "You have to distinguish between exchanges and wallets. Some exchanges actually provide you with the coins, other just provide you with exposure to it and give you some kind of object tied to the price action but never the actual transferable coin.\n\nFor exchanges that allow you to buy the coins, just look at [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/) \n\nEtoro, Robinhood and a few others just allow you some exposure.\n\nFurthermore, exchanges give you acces to the coins, but they are never yours, they still can exert influence on them such as freezing the account and you will not be able to transfer or trade. The second part is much more relevant. These exchanges can be hacked and your coins can be transferred without your consent. In crypto we say, not your keys, not your coins. \n\nWallets are a bit tougher to explain, it's your personal bank account which is accessible through software.  I'll try to explain it buy using Cardano. \n\nA Cardano wallet is accessible through Yoroi and Daedalus and those two allow you to make transactions on the network (sending / staking). So your adress is where it is stored, but the software allows you to mutate the contents. \n\nNow.. if you are still reading :)\n\nWhichever is good for you depends on what you want. First you have to realise the fees.. \n\nEach exchange has fees, trading fees and transfer fees as well as minimum transfer amounts, this scheme varies. Depending on which coins you are interested in, you will find a subset of exchanges with their own set of values for this. \n\nSecond, some coins allow for staking (you can roughly translate this as a short term fixed deposit which gives you a return on investment). This can be done on some exchanges (Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken), but again, they facilitate, they take. There are some cases where it is preferable though, i.e. when you don't have the minimum required amount to stake.\n\nWell that's all for now :) If you want more info, send a DM or visit us at the cryptocurrency sub.",

Didn't pay attention to the jobs report coming out that Friday. Monday comes and SPX spikes. Rolled up my puts to 4025/4050 for more premium and to try to mitigate losses. Should have bailed earlier in the day at a $2k loss, but waited it out, ended up taking a $3.8k loss. Made it all back through the week and ended up +$300 by that Friday. But that is the only time I would have lost. But only because I didn't pay attention to upcoming market events.\n\nOpened a 0DTE 4100/4120 on 4/14. Was still stinging from the $4k loss a week before. Watched it dropping. Literally spend 2 hours in a gaming setup with fingers on the up/down keys and hand on the mouse adjusting my limits. Rode it from a $4k loss to $60 gain to $2k loss, roller coaster. Closed at a $159 loss with 45 seconds left in the trading day. Closed at 4124, so I would have been fine. But had $20k collateral riding on it and couldn't risk that for a $550 premium.\n\nThen monday, opened a 0DTE  4165/4175 spread. Panicked and sold at a $700 loss. Recovered right after I sold and closed at 4191. So would have been fine. That's what changed my thinking to letting it play out and trusting the deltas.\n\nsince 3/22, I've run 31 credit spreads and 16 iron condors. only had the 3 total losses above and 2 of them would have been gains if i had trusted the process.

The primer shortage caused a backlog and then 10 million new gun buyers wanted to feed their new toys. \n\nSuper Demand City and no Supply easy math. As far as timing..this thing still has some juice left in it I believe and that's because they've had some price increases and recently stated they are behind a billion dollars in orders.\n\nPrice Targets range from 35-49. A consensus buy across the board on most outlets.  I believe all time high was 52 and change..it has a serious shot at beating that.  I have personally spent a year watching and running with this stock.  Seriously hours daily researching this for over a year.\n\nThe negative is there is low volume to move this thing. It's insane. It has taken a big jump, but over 14 months.\n\nThe earnings probably hit 575 million in this report and might break earnings record. It was at 38 not too long ago.  I've owned this since last March at an average of 7.80. I have taken profits twice so far. I now have stock and 35 dollar calls to hit May 21st which are green and also some 40 dollar hail mary calls as well. Those could be dreamers, but I work in this field and it never ends.

This will only continue as more and more serious institutions start to get it and don't want china to control them. \n\n&gt;The ecological impact of running computers to support BTC is insane and currently unsustainable.\n\nEnergy consumption of Bitcoin is lower then our current monetary system (banks, visa etc) in relative terms. There's also a clear trend to sustainable energy usage since mining is location independent and is a way to profit off of otherwise unusable land and wasted energy (deserts/surplus of the power grid etc.)\n\n&gt;Nobody knows the exact origin of BTC, so nobody really knows if there is a back door to hack\n\nKnowing who Satoshi is is irrelevant in terms of hacking. The entire code of the protocol is public since it started. Bitcoin is an open source project and anyone can look at the code if they want to. There are no backdoors and there's no way to build one unless you want the whole world to see it. \n\n&gt;there are a number of early early adopters that hold a huge amount and can tank the market anytime they decide to sell their billions of dollars worth of BTC\n\nOnly point that's fair imo. Although there's something to be said that the market can tank it by now and it won't be the end of Bitcoin. Also I doubt these individuals would voluntarily trigger a market crash by selling billions at once. They obviously believe in Bitcoin's future or lost their keys otherwise they wouldn't have stayed committed to their holdings for this long. \n\n&gt;I think blockchain is a tech that is here to stay, but current versions are basically beta tests.\n\nSmart contract platforms and everything build on them are still in beta/early adopter territory but Bitcoin isn't. Banks and the biggest financial institutions don't adopt technologies that are in \"beta\" Bitcoin is a trillion dollar asset and on it's way to cross the chasm to the early majority.",

        "body": "Well firstly his ideas hardly addresses the points I illustrated. Interesting but full of conjecture and vague suppositions, typical for that kind of pitch \"people disagree with me but this is because they are stupid and are part of the machine\"\n\n If VCs where prone to believe every similar line of reason they read like Dan's they would invest after every one of thousands of hockey stick presentations they see. Here is one such gem based on emotional appeal to the outsider:\n\n\"The idea that Satoshi perfectly crafted Bitcoin on the first try is unfathomable for them to consider.\" \n\nTo which the first commentor correctly replies \"Because it's unfathomable that this is true\" and there you have the summary of the two sides of the argument.\n\nEven a brief browse through the Wikipedia entry for Bitcoin will tell you as much based on its history.\n\nThere are so many other problems with BtC but let's just choose one and let's also apply another line if reasoning: how secure is it in a physical sense? People are keeping their keys on physical media in safety deposit boxes at multiple banks because they are rightly concerned people can and would kill them for their Bitcoin or otherwise steal it. Many people who used services for their wallet have been burnt hard. We have laws about the fiet money proceeds of such crimes but people who own BTC do well to be concerned. Whose jurisdiction does solving a theft of Bitcoin actually fall under? Where exactly is Satoshi if he is even a real person? If he is not dead it's pretty dangerous to be him.\n\nThe truth is that BTC is flawed and will be changed/replaced as people solve problems with it. As such it will become obsolete or be updated and when that happens it will be vulnerable and Dans reasoning is flawed on this basis.\n\nI have no doubt there is utility for crypto. I just think investing in any particular technology as an investment asset will be demonstrated to be a huge mistake in 15 years when when we look back on the crypto bubble of 20xx. Many of the Dotcom companies had value there was still a bubble. Except now with crypto we have perfected this bubble. For Dotcom and firms pretended to have value and products or services. \n\nBottom line: Dan is invested",

        "body": "Yes, as a Canadian, there are multiple exchanges available to us such as Newton, ShakePay, NDAX, WealthSimple Crypto, and some Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

It ain't going to happen every again, risk adjustment across the board already occurred (look at the jump in clov to 17).\n\n\n\nSo in summary, it is about making bets, but not about parroting useless shite like you have done.

SQ looks to have a double bottom on the daily chart and the 50 MA has held up these past few weeks which makes me think a minor beat on earnings would at the very least not drop below $240 in the very near short term. You never know obviously but the risk imo isn't substantial if one wanted to swing trade a call even holding through earnings for unexpected results. For holding stock I don't see it worth it atm as I see an entry at around 225 to be feasible as it tends to fall thru it's 50 MA for a few days before pivoting back up. The chart basically fuckin looks like the NASDAQ. W shaped recovery lol. Think it won't get that close to it's recent low of $202.

Started off with the growth stocks, had some highs had some lows but I've settled into a more sustainable and hopefully less stressful portfolio and I would love if I could get some feedback.  See below for my tickers:\n\nMost of these are going to be long term positions but I'm planning on swing trading AMD, INTC, NVDA, Z\n\n* AAPL (9.77%)\n* AGNC (4.89%)\n* ALLY (2.05%)\n* AMAT (5.86%)\n* AMD (9.15%) \n* AMZN (8.75%)\n* FB (1.38%)\n* GOOG (12.37%)\n* HD (2.08%)\n* HRZN (4.4%)\n* INTC (2.94%)\n* LOW (1.67%)\n* MA (4.82%)\n* MSFT (7.72%)\n* NVDA (2.32%)\n* O (2.59%)\n* OMF (2.16%)\n* PSEC (6.25%)\n* QYLD (1.73%)\n* SHW (2.31%)\n* V (3.26%)\n* Z (1.53%)\n\nThanks for taking a look! Do I have too many tickers, should I sell some of those and move that money into something like VTI, QQQ, etc?",

They sent our practice a cold call email with the features and it seemed cool looking, so I tried it out. I tend to try lots of demos mostly just to see what is out there, but I never really have plans to make a full switch because we like ECW. It was more curiosity than a desire to switch, really. If it had been a platform that could have integrated directly into our EMR, that would have been better. \n2. We pay a quarterly licensing free for ECW and had/have some setup costs with new features. Overall, the expense is roughly $15k + $5k per provider, per year. I think the biggest hurdle is that it isn't using practice data, but insurance claim data. In theory, that should be the same, but it is definitely not in practice. We are also rather unique in that we don't participate with Medicare, so we have very few MA patients and wouldn't be able to use this for 95% of our patients. That point was probably my biggest reason for not adding one extra tool, even though it is free. At some point, there is just too much data and you can't expect employees to navigate it efficiently, so we stick with basic measures and just try to do really well on them. \n3. Nobody else has offered to pay us to use a service, so that is unique. Athena has a free EMR version, but it is ad-supported so our visit notes would look like they're sponsored by a drug company, which isn't a good look! The financial incentive selling points seem to be the ability to easily qualify for Medicare Meaningful Use, but we don't participate so that benefit doesn't help us. \n4. I have had more pitches for a direct contracting service in the last two months than I've had in 14 years, so I feel like a ton of companies are trying to jump on what they are as easy money. We are a part of an ACO, but are not subject to capitation. I think FFS is going away, but not until something like Medicare for All is passed. Not sure of the timeline there, but I'd expect 2023 to be the point where smaller primary cares actually start moving towards something like that. Our ACO has put December 2022 as their \"you must promise to at least consider a capitation model\" deadline, but we are not required to switch at that point. \n\nLastly, because we don't take Medicare, I don't think we are exactly Clover's target market right now and may not be the best perspective on their sales pitch. All the commercial insurances are already doing their own similar thing, so they'll be competing with existing products from BCBS/Cigna/UHC/etc. if they ever mean to expand past Medicare.",

If you look up their 20-F SEC filing, you can see the exact number of shares owned by Jack Ma, Joseph Tsai, etc. \n\nThere is no such thing as \"Chinese Alibaba stock.\" It does not exist. It is only listed outside of China via the VIE structure. As such, the VIE is essentially Alibaba's main / only source of capital. Also, both the NYSE listing (BABA) and the HKEX listing (9988) are for the same Cayman Islands VIE.

        "body": "Yeah, that original statement is completely wrong. Even in the US, 40% of in-person transactions are cash. In Mexico, it's 90%. It's 82% in Austria and Germany.\n\nThere is still so, so much room to grow for companies that provide credit, debit, or online payments. That's why I'm super bullish on V, MA, SQ, PYPL, MELI, etc. It doesn't matter how much of the digital payments pie each of these has when the pie itself is going to grow by huge amounts in the future. Cash is still king in most of the world, but it's trending towards digital payments each year.",

Check out Skyworks\u2019 growth in its earlier years when it was around $5. What makes you know more information about the current climate of the EV semiconductor business versus a company that has been in the business for 10+ years? Maybe they have data/contracts that are disclosed, that help support their claim of a secured $2billion in deals. Or maybe they are understanding the exponential growth in the EV sector within this next 2/3 years and have been ramping up supply and projections. \n\nI hear your argument but dont find it more valid then the information presented to me from this SPAC",
