There's a little box on on your accounts that will tell you which securities they are lending out.\n\nThere are some other nuances I'm probably forgetting. E.g. if you loan out a security, and it pays a dividend while it is out on loan, the dividend will get paid to the short seller, but the short must contractually pay you that dividend. But now that quasi-dividend you receive is not going to be a \"qualified dividend\" for tax purposes. So Fidelity pays you a little extra in this case to make up for the tax hit.",

I should just wait till the 18th and execute right? 22.5 is nearly the redeemable value and I don't think we'll ever see it again tbh. How confident are we in the Q1 2021 time frame and should I even consider selling calls afterwards with Jan expiration? If so what strike seems safe?

They also don\u2019t have any emergency phone numbers for when your account is inevitably hacked. They don\u2019t charge any commissions... because they\u2019re frontrunning all of the trades.

Here are their margin rates: https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46376\n\nEven then, the rates are still pretty high compared to the rates on Treasuries and so you\u2019d mostly be betting on a decrease in interest rates. \n\nIf you REALLY want to leverage Teasuries, you should use futures. Very low implied financing. This is by far the best way for a retail trader to leverage Treasuries. The only downsides is that nominal contract values are pretty large so it gets a little difficult if you have a small account and you also have to know how to deal with futures in general i.e. they are quarterly contracts and not a real bond.",

        "body": "This is fucking gold....oh my god. \n\nThis idea has a name - it\u2019s called a proxy campaign. You can google that. You need to file w the SEC and register (I don\u2019t know if \u2018group of 20-something trading fractional shares and derivatives\u2019 is a registered party, but fuck it who cares?). Then you have the right to solicit the rest of the investor base to vote in a slate of directors that will do your bidding. \n\nHere\u2019s the fun part: the filing alone costs about $100k in filing fees and legal fees. And now you\u2019re just getting started.....\n\nYou need to hire board reps, advisors, lawyers, marketers, etc etc. A normal proxy fight costs at least $1M and some have gone up as high as $20M to $30M.....oh yeah *and you can still lose it all too.*\n\nSo I\u2019d love to know where you all plan on coming up with the money to fight this and what your pitch to Fidelity, Blackrock, Vang, SIG and the rest of the top GME holders will be. \n\nThis whole thread is like when a child reaches up, touches the stove and gets burned. But instead of learning a lesson, they decide it\u2019s the stoves fault and decide that the best way to seek revenge on the stove is by burning themselves again, except this time with both hands.",

They charge $6.95 to buy shares, and charge $6.95 to sell the same shares. This will eat your profits for breakfast. You're paying for the software they sink a *lot* of money into. Just learning this now.)\n\nFidelity: Actually buying/selling. They don't charge to buy stocks. You can buy/sell stocks/options that are NOT available on Robinhood. Example: CBDD. Two days ago it was at **0.0001**. Today, it topped out at **0.029** If you got in at a low price and dropped $500 and sold at .029, you would have made like $800^^?^math profit.\n\nFidelity and RH for me.",

I figured that without fixing this aspect of the system these random mutations would have serious effects in humans. We see this happen in cell culture and some times in mice too... I was a hater, and now I'm outside looking in. \n\nThat said, I think BEAM and EDIT have a lot of room to grow. BEAM's tech results in less off target mutations, so I like them a lot more.
