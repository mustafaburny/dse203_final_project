Also moving in to health care\n2. Microsoft - Dominant in the cloud. Sound leadership and growth under Nadella.\n3. Alphabet - Advertising revenue. The leader in AI, which I expect will be further monetized in the next 10 years\n4. Alibaba - Chinese Amazon. Invested heavily in EVs\n5. Apple - Apple products not going away. Huge potential to gain market share across the globe\n6. Visa/Mastercard - FinTech will be huge. Could even see them acquiring PayPal/Square\n7. Tesla - If this turns out to be true it won't be because of the cars\n8. Johnson &amp; Johnson\n9. Walmart \n10. NVIDIA",

        "body": "If you\u2019re looking for super long term growth, the best bet is usually blue chips (I prefer KO, PEP, JNJ, MSFT, etc.) They will fluctuate up and down (so don\u2019t fret about green days vs red days) but over a period of 10-20 years they should grow in terms of decent value. For reference I\u2019ve held a $300 investment in KO for 23 years, and it\u2019s now valued over $3000 (was $3600 pre-pandemic). With blue chip stocks, the usual idea is to reinvest your dividends automatically. That\u2019s how you get more shares and over time bigger dividends. When I started with like 12-14 shares, I\u2019d get a $3 check maybe, but using the reinvestment option (eventually) without any additional self-purchasing of shares I was up to 61 shares because of the dividend reinvestment. And now I receive a dividend on 61 shares instead of 12, so obviously now much more than $3 per quarter.\n\nSpread out among a few good stable blue chips, ones that have weathered crises like (recessions and viruses). You also might be interested in doing ETF\u2019s, they cover sectors mainly, and they\u2019re usually more stable since they cover multiple stocks - however with lower risk comes less return usually. An ETF you\u2019re sort of playing by an average of whatever is in that portfolio.\n\nJust like with a 401k, typically the sooner you start, the better, since you\u2019re looking for that exponential growth with dividend payouts.\n\nBest of luck!",

It is a fundamentally different space than Dropbox though which makes a comparison hard.\n\nAmazon could absolute just copy snowflake, and pending potential anti-trust lawsuits annihilate them in the market.\n\nDropBox is different however in that it is a solid competitor in a crowded space. It has to compete with enterprise companies like Microsoft, and as such I think their growth potential is hindered.\n\nI say this as a paying Dropbox customer who loves their product. They\u2019re absolutely perfect for me personally and other smaller businesses who don\u2019t have have a dedicated IT department to run a Microsoft ecosystem for an entire office and instead just need quality could storage and collaboration.\n\nThey have established a niche, have demonstrated staying power and innovation. If it were for competitors like BOX, they might have enough market share to grow and bust out, but I just don\u2019t see it. For me, it\u2019s enough that they stick around as an independent business offering me a product for my personal needs.",

They made the account change without any notice, and after being down like 80% on my puts, bad news hit GM and I was only down like 30% and couldn't close the position because my options level was no longer sufficient. By the next day the stock had recovered and I missed my window to close thanks to my broker fucking me when I needed to sell, which seems to be disturbingly common.\n\nI remember calling them and telling them I wanted a broker, not a babysitter. The dude sounded completely annoyed like he was my dad and doing me a favor. He wasn't wrong in hindsight. I was like a chimp with a machine gun back then. I'm better now. But damn...let the monkey shoot his load if he wants.\n\nFidelity isn't a bad broker. But they're like strict parents. They're not quick to trust or forgiving if you throw a party and their risk department flags you as a retard. TD is like your friend's cool parents who don't really give a fuck. And Robinhood is the skeevy guy outside the liquor store selling fake IDs. That guy will hook you up with whatever you want. He's cool, but not really a friend.

If you are buying TSLA now you are up for a hard reckoning.\n\n\"At a time like this, when our stock is reaching new highs, it may seem as though spending carefully is not as important. This is definitely not true.\n\nWhen looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that\u2019s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl\u00e9 under a sledgehammer!\n\nMuch more important, in order to make our cars affordable, we have to get smarter about how we spend money. This a tough Game of Pennies \u2013 requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost, a factory process or simply the design, while increasing quality and capabilities. A great idea would be on that saves $5, but the vast majority are 50 cents here or 20 cents there.\n\nIn order to make the electric revolution happen we much make electric cars, stationary batteries and solar affordable to all.\n\nThanks and great working with you as always,\nElon\"",
