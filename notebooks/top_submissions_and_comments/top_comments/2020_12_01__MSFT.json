For perspective, $MSFT trades about $5b/day.\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt;Another mind-melter: $TSLA traded more today than the next 25 most active stocks COMBINED.\n\nAnd continued:\n\n&gt;Some asking what's past high water mark for a single stock. Not 100% sure but looking at Apple and Amazon, their all time highest volume days are a mere $43b and $31b respectively.\n\n\nSo... TSLA just traded at 3-4x of the **maximum** volume that AAPL and AMZN has seen. What a time to be alive.",

The big boys in QQQ have all recovered for the most part. Another crucial point is that QQQJ has more non-tech companies so if there is a rotation out of tech, it will suffer less than QQQ.\n\nI'm very bullish about this etf.

        "body": "It reminds me of this thought: *When does the breadth of contemporary evidence supersede the depth of historical data?*\n\nGenerally, I agree with your overall sentiment, but not for the reasons you cite here. I think there's a couple of things being conflated in the messaging. First, a 3-fund portfolio isn't going to get you some kind of multi-digit percentage return most of the time. You invest in a 3-fund portfolio if you're trying to preserve your money. Comparing a 3-fund portfolio to (insert growth fund here) isn't quite a fair comparison because the goals are different.\n\nAdditionally, I will point out that thematic investing isn't new. ARK and others have been following themes to great success, and as long as the theme remains hot (technology, clean energy, genomics, medical devices, etc.) the funds will continue to do well. [IHI](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=IHI&amp;allocation1_1=100), for example, has done a compounding return of of 15% per year since inception (2007), blowing away the SPY in all metrics (less drawdowns, higher return, lower volatility, etc.).\n\nTraditional thinking states that you can't beat the market over time, so why even bother trying. People who believe this accept it as fact, when there are so many other factors involved (e.g. was the person who picked stocks buying the same stocks every time they got paid?).  I expect this notion to be challenged over the next decade, and quite frankly, I hope the thinking dies out. There are plenty of funds and folks buying baskets of stocks (e.g. 10-20 stocks) especially now with fractional shares weighted for specific targets and are continuing to ascend to new highs.\n\nAs much as people want to speak poorly of strategies that differ from their index investing, rarely have I ever seen someone address the elephant in the room which is, \"By not investing in the index, you were able to beat the index.\" I've had many debates here about this because there is a camp of diehards who refuse to look at any kind of alternative data. If I say [here's an example of a basket of 3 stocks that has beat the SPY for the past 26+ years](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=MSFT&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=WM&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=INTU&amp;allocation3_1=34), is that enough evidence to show that consistently beating the market is at least *possible?? (put your pitchforks down, I did not say guaranteed).* I've been talking about this for the entire lifecycle of this reddit account, so it's nothing new.\n\nIf you're a person who is looking for outsized returns, you'll need to go outside the index. Momentum is one strategy that has consistently worked to accomplish this.\n\nGood luck",

        "body": "I\u2019m gonna make this real simple for you.  Forget about the names of the Greeks for a min, (since you don\u2019t know what they mean anyway \ud83d\ude09). \n\nEvery option contract premium (how much it costs to buy said contract) is the total of its intrinsic value and extrinsic value. \n\nIntrinsic value is how far in the money the contract is.  So, if MSFT is $215, and you have a $210 strike call, there is $5 (per share) of intrinsic value there.  That means you\u2019re holding a contract that lets you buy shares $5 cheaper than on the open market.  Now, people who sell options are smarter than you, so they aren\u2019t going to let you just have that $5/share for free so the contract is gonna cost you that $5 and then some. \n\nThe \u201cand then some\u201d is the extrinsic value.  This is your gambling fee.  And extrinsic value disappears.  100% of extrinsic value is gone at expiration, every time, every contract, no exception. So if the MSFT contract we were talking about above was going for $6.00, that means there\u2019s $5 of intrinsic value and $1 of extrinsic value. \n\nNow, to bring this all together for you smooth brain idiots to understand.  Only extrinsic value is impacted by theta and Vega.  I know, right. Weird huh.  \n\nSo with the MSFT contract above, $1 out of the $6 it cost you is subjected to IV crush or theta. So 16% of the value of your contract is impacted by Vega (IV)or theta (time).  The further you are in the money, the more intrinsic value you have, and less extrinsic.  Therefore, less of your contract would be subjected to the bleed of Vega or theta. \n\nWhen you buy an OTM option, it is 100% extrinsic value.  So, 100% of the contract is subject to theta and Vega bleed.",

(No offense).. a reminder of really bad ideas stemming from pump and dumps. I got sucked into ATNM. Twice.  \n\nHonestly, and harshly, It\u2019s better you lose $2500 than 5,000. You just paid your market tuition of $2500. Everyone does. I paid $1200 to a shitty Microsoft weekly option contract I shouldn\u2019t have bought as my first option trade. 3 months later I made that back plus 3500 off 1-2k option investments (usually much less) at a time. (After that 1200 loss I also doubled down on studying, paper trading, and YouTube lessons. Dozens and dozens of hours before I made another trade). Take it on the chin and use that 2500 tax loss to offset your taxes. I\u2019ve taken losses of $700, 1200, and two separate 200 losses since sept 1st (there\u2019s more but those are the biggest.) If your strategy is good you\u2019ll make it back. \n\nBtw you\u2019re $5,000 investment in that company is 6% of their revenue for Q3. So. There\u2019s that. \n\nTL;DR - Take the loss, claim it on your taxes. Do not buy back in or you\u2019ll trigger a wash sale. \n\n-edit- Doing some quick research on them... and wow. They apparently used to be \u201cOn The Move Systems Corp\u201d and it does not look good. Take your loss and move on my friend.",

Went through some more stuff and it seems like their fiscal year ends in March, which means management may actually end up fully selling in March, but at the same time, DXC (the company that prsp was split from) just got a BO offer from this French company. It\u2019s really interesting how both companies are being bought out at the same time. 30c Jans are still above the price I recommended them at (I said buy at 0.1, now at 0.3) so if you\u2019re up, take some profits perhaps.",

Oversubscribed meaning that more ParentCo shares are tendered than new company shares are offered than exchange is done on a pro-rata basis. Usually, some sort of 8K or company press release state that the offer is oversubscribed. There\u2019s a handful I\u2019m looking at that don\u2019t explicitly state it one way or the other, and I\u2019m just trying to determine what happened in these deals (GE and Wabec, HPE and Micro Focus, HPE and DXC, Starwood and ILG, Nabors and C&amp;J Energy Services, Tyco and Pentair). Doing this to look at employee equity when deals are undersubscribed.",
