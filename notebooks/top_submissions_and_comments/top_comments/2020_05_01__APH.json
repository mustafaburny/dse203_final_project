Where I disagree with you is the notion that they hype SO much, on heavily inflated numbers and cause SUCH instability then try to mop-up after  finally having to admit their B.S., its ridiculous. I don't care at all what the share price is truly, I don't own any anymore, sold years ago. But I've watched them since the beginning and to see what kind of games they play, in the light they are under ( being a big stock lots of people pay attention to) and what it does to the industry as a whole is despicable. I will never trust this leadership with someone else's 1000 ft pole. Just wait, there is going to be massive shortcomings in what they say they are achieving. Then everyone can continue to down vote my note. Don't care. They are on the same plane as early CTRST ( had them, lost a ton, they were just flat-out ridiculous illegal)  but I would honestly say Hexo has bad leadership BUT not nearly as over promising as APH is. Thus its easier to plan and investment with HEXO. ACB, as soon as they hit 700 000 000 shares diluted, I sold. Never looking back. But they aren't bad. They are heavily overextended but again not playing as silly a \"smoke and mirror\" game as APH. In counter, VFF, CURA, TRUL, even CGC , much much better ( not perfect) leadership in the same or similar space. And there are more just riddling off the dome.",

Turning to page 5 of Aphria's two most recently quarterly financials: \n\n[https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aphria-Inc\\_Q2\\_2020\\_Financial-Statements.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aphria-Inc_Q2_2020_Financial-Statements.pdf)\n\n[https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Aphria-Inc\\_Q3-2020\\_Consolidated-Financial-Statements.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Aphria-Inc_Q3-2020_Consolidated-Financial-Statements.pdf)\n\nLook for the section called \"**Cash used in operating activities\"** and you can see how they go from their net gain for the period to the actual cash flow figure by removing all non-cash adjustments that are included in net gain/loss. APH had -$71.23M in cash used from operating activities through fiscal Q2 and now are at -$124.37M in cash used from operating activities through fiscal Q3, meaning they posted a $53.14M operating cash flow loss on the quarter. This is part of the reason why you see cash dropping from the start of the quarter to the end, with the capex and financing activities added in.\n\nNow you compare this to GTI's 10k they just posted: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001795139/d711db76-ee78-4a81-99d2-c85271bd8acf.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001795139/d711db76-ee78-4a81-99d2-c85271bd8acf.pdf)\n\nPage 9 of the pdf and you'll see the same basic page of numbers for GTI titled \"**Cash flow from operating activities.\"** At the bottom, you'll see a positive $27,048,097 in \"**Net Cash provided by operating activities\"** after all the non-cash adjustments. This is what it means to have \"positive operating cash flow.\" Now continue down this page to add in capital expenditures and financing activities, and you'll end up with \"**net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\"** of positive **$24,854,620,** reflecting positive free cash flow as well. Hence why you see the **cash and cash equivalents** rise from **$46,667,334** from the start of Q1 to **$71,521,954** at the end of Q1. \n\nGTI cash level went up because they had positive free cash flow from operations. Aph cash went down because they had negative cash flow from operations.",

I'd put some hours into your DD and reduce that list by half and add a few more quality names for example Trulieve was already mentioned as a big miss. \n\nStraight up a portfolio of: CGC, ACB, Aph, Cura, GTI, CL, Trul would be a very safe bet\n\nThat would pretty much have you covered minus a few random subsectors like extractors or oddballs like VFF. \n\nAnyways GL",
