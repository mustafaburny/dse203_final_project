What I\u2019ve heard of is that the big central banks (with some smaller ones included) are looking into the possibility. Sweden has made an actual order for a platform from Accenture. \n\nThe initial talk focuses on making transactions over borders easier. Bitcoin is an example that works well for that. What Bitcoin isn\u2019t so good for is day-to-day transactions (at least as of now). Might be that the first focus is on large transactions, in which case payment processors like Visa may not be really relevant. \n\nHowever, there are strategies that the banks can use to make the currency better suited for day-to-day. They can use a faster trust model (maybe not likely) or they could seek to create a credit model where transactions can be closed before proof of work (etc) is completed by giving their backing to the system. In these cases maybe there\u2019s an impact?\n\nBut as far as I can tell it\u2019s all not very conclusive yet.",

        "body": "For me, I am looking to buy the dip on airline stocks. Here\u2019s why: \n\nOverall, I do see airlines returning to growth. Booming middle class in many nations will boost air travel demand. Also, everyone still wants to travel and air is one of the few ways we can travel to many places. Boat takes too long. \n\nMany airlines have stronger balance sheets after the chaos that ensued after deregulation of the industry in the early 2000s. That still doesn\u2019t mean that some are at risk of bankruptcy. \n\nWith higher current ratios among the industry, I am confident that many will be able to survive the lockdowns. Also, since many are in a rush to go outside, I believe airlines will see many bookings in the near future. \n\nBusiness travel makes up a huge portion of air travel. Accenture, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, etc. will continue needing their bankers and consultants to travel to fulfill their business deals. \n\nNow I am hoping that these airlines can sell those airplanes in one way or another to gain more cash. There are too many airplanes, according to Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett\u2019s comments are really harmful to Boeing because they produce planes. \n\nAmerican Airlines peaks my interest especially since they have a hub and spoke business model, which helps airplanes cut costs and boost margins. Still need to do more research. Southwest is attractive overall. Delta and United, also attractive. Alaska Air is really attractive imo. Skywest, possibly attractive. Hawaiian Air can be a great play as many will prefer to go to Hawaii for vacation because Hawaii had one of the least Coronavirus cases. If that\u2019s the reason why many want to travel to Hawaii, then it should also boost demand for travel to Alaska as Alaska also has one of the fewest Coronavirus cases. Mesa Air, still looking into it.",

Oh and I get the SSO using Microsoft/Google security included so don't have to spend another $10 per user per month on an Okta login?

So many SaaS models today rely on the $x per user per month model and Microsoft or Google or Facebook or Salesforce come in and offer something almost of the same quality for 20% of the price.\n\n Why should I pay $10 per month per user for Slack or Zoom when Microsoft throws in Teams and Google throws in Meet to their bundle for practically free and pours in tons of cash to continue to improve them? Oh and I get the SSO using Microsoft/Google security included so don't have to spend another $10 per user per month on an Okta login? And so on and so forth.\n\nThere are some awesome software businesses out there but not as many as I would like to see. A hardware + software component or just insurmountable data advantage (like Bloomberg has) would be great but seems like so many of these public companies are very replaceable.",
