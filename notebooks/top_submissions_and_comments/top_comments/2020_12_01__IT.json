This is a good startup with a very specific and focused problem to solve.\nThe even more enticing prospect to me are the consumer electronics applications. IPhone 12 now added lidar to improve photo depth. That's just the beginning of usage for these. With a simple cost effective chip these could start showing up a lot of places.\nWhat isn't clear to me is how they are protecting this tech and preventing others from replicating unless it's strictly cost advantage of being first.\n\nTake a look through the investor pitch from Aeva.

In order for a share to trade, there has to be a buyer and a seller. If there's low volume, that tells you that not as many buyers are interested.\n\nWhen buyers aren't interested, the price has to come down to attract buyers. \n\nThere's more supply than demand, so the price goes down. \n\nEveryday, in the morning, GME spikes. The first house of the day is classically the most volatile time in the market. So more people are interested in buying in the morning, because that's when spikes happen most often. \n\nThe rest of the day, buyers accumulate shares near support instead of chasing pops - which is why GME tends to hold key levels throughout the day. Then, they sell into the morning spike the next day - and smart short sellers take advantage of it. \n\nSmart shorts aren't sitting around selling GME all day because there's no fucking volume and it's not volatile enough. Pro longs know that without shorts, there's no risk of a short squeeze - which is how you get monster runs.\n\nSo, yeah. Volume goes down, price goes down.",

Qualified is important for sure. I don't think anyone wants to force hands at recruiting unqualified individuals. Qualified, but underrepresented is the aim. Not a usurping of the corporate meritocracy. I think that's both fair, and important. If you disagree with the premise entirely, that's fair too. I just wanted to clarify that conceptually, the idea isnt unqualified folks getting hand held and led into leadership roles, but rather qualified folks who otherwise would not be selected (for whatever reason) being selected instead (but qualified lol).",

Straight up like 3,000 calories 100 grams of fiber, ate it in like 25 minutes in 1 sitting. 6 hours later my insides were being torn apart and I had the longest fart I've ever been able to muster. Imagine for a second you thought you had to shit, and you take a deep breath, and you push, and it's just a pure fart for your entire breath, after about 15 seconds you're trying not to laugh but you're in complete disbelief that you're still farting, 20 seconds, 25 seconds. Air still coming out your butt hole, you have to take a SECOND fucking breath to finish the fart off.. You didn't even have to shit..\n\nAnyways, TSLA to the moon",
