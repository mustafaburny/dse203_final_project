Think i might start doing this again but it takes up a lot of margin as collateral\n* SHOP gains was all through stock which I sold last week, wish I held through today but can't win them all. SQ same story sold the stock last week before earnings to capture my \\~20% gain\n* TLT I had call options which I might pick up again. Acted more as a hedge to macro environment as this is an ETF which tracks US 20yr + bonds. Sold them once I saw the macro environment turn bullish, luckily made some good money in the process\n* SNPS was an earnings play which turned out to be profitable, bought calls and sold them shortly after the stock popped.

Shit we don't want to do but don't want to pay for expensive automation alternatives that cost too much for the level of work OR there's some built in issue that makes a person still required.\n\nManual testers, low level QA, and analyst responsibilities can be done in the US, it just isn't worth it.  On the semiconductor side, I/O, physical verification, library design, and application engineers for less sexy products are all roles that can be done here (and still are), but the people here are either aging out, or they're really really good and highly paid with a team to push around in NOIDA.  If it's doable from TI's design site in India, why pay for the H1 to move the guy here.\n\nIf you really think India shuts down, Synopsys might get some business, but I think even their design teams rely on India now.  You could also short Wipro ($WIT), since they're a publicly traded player for offshore tech workers.",

I've learned about The Trade Desk, Synopsys, and Zoom, all of which have been incredibly profitable. \n\nI just got a new email about some upcoming webinar next week for 5 new companies that show potential to be some of next FAANG stocks. Motley Fool is calling them FAZER, but they haven't released the names of the companies. So I decided to once again do my own research, and I figured them out:\n\nF - Fastly\n\nA - Appian\n\nZ - Zoom\n\nE - Elastic NV\n\nR - Roku\n\nZoom and Roku are just about the closest to household names, without being actual household names like Netflix/Google/etc. The other three, before researching what these companies were, I had never heard of them. Appian seems pretty interesting after doing 30 minutes of research in them. Fastly and Elastic seem like pie-in-the-sky companies by Motley Fool.",
