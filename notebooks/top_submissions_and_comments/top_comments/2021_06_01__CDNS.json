I can't do that on video, but I can do it on a pdf or paper. \n\nIf I need to look at a dcf you've built, I'll basically have to keep pausing and playing, if I need to go over something again I have to find the right timestamp. All these actions are basically wasting a lot of time and making the process much more complicated. At times it's very easy to tell where the holes are in an investment just by glancing through the numbers or bullet points of the thesis. In this case there is 40min of video, also done by someone I don't know very well (easier to dedicate 40min to listen to Soros/Buffett speak about markets than someone I do not know). \n\nRegarding the English proficiency, I think thats another point in favor of a written thesis. In the case of video, you are making the assumption that your accent, prosody and cadence are neutral enough for everyone to understand easily. If I personally misunderstand something you mention, then I have to rewind and re-listen. If it's written down, at worst I don't understand the word and can look it up.

I.e. will they not only come out with halfhearted late to the game 10 nm but will they then quickly proceed to 7 to 5 to 3 etc to catch up or get ahead of TSMC? If they don\u2019t get close they will have worse chips PERIOD because that\u2019s how density works.\n2. If not #1, then when do you think they will have it fixed? Perhaps the delayed date they announced today? Some other date? \n3. If not #1 again, then their chips are worse for at least another year or two. If so, they will lose some share. They will lose more share in DC than client (because consumers aren\u2019t as educated as DC folk). DC folk are conservative which has protected intel a great deal, but with high profile examples like Google as of recent, I think Intel will continue hemorrhaging market share. Or to look at another fun example, in this market of unprecedented demand, Intel DC went down last quarter. They blamed it on some unintelligible \u201cdigestion\u201d excuse. Meanwhile AMD experienced significant growth. \n\nSo if you trust 3 is the case, then the question is what % share does Intel lose? If for example Intel lost 10% of revenue, they\u2019d be worth at least 10% less but that ignores momentum (I.e. what sort of discount might the market apply to a company that isn\u2019t growing).",
