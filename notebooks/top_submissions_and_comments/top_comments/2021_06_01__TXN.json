Everyone has Arm &amp; Hammer in their refrigerator/freezer and in their baking cabinet. Everyone knows and trusts Trojan. $AET sold insurance until it was purchased by $CVS, which ended up being a great deal for me growth wise. I bought $AET in like 2009, ended up with a bunch of $CVS shares and cash to buy other companies. \n\nI mean, my portfolio is not that crazy. Most of my \u201cpicks\u201d came from research as well as what my grandfather, who taught me how to invest, had bought over the years. No crazy growth companies or gambles, just good companies that have shown consistent and solid growth over decades that also happen to pay a decent dividend. \n\nI mean, right now you can pick up $JPM at a p/e of 12 and a yield of 2.35%. $TXN has a solid growth plan, if you read their investor materials it shows that they are all about returning capital to shareholders with stock repurchases and dividends. $HD has been great because everybody went there during the lockdown to renovate their houses. They also own a ton of brands that they sell in their stores.  You can pick up $CI with a P/E under 10! $ORCL is attractive and I\u2019m building a position through my 401k plan, which has a brokerage about option. \n\nA lot of good companies out there that you can buy that are solid performers that pay dividends without too much risk. There are plenty of places to look at speculative investments, big gambles to get rich quick, but if you find good companies that show consistent growth, and you are patient and hold, you will be rewarded over the long run.",
