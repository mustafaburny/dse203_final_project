Not only that, they make analog chips which have very long sell cycles. The latest Samsung or Apple chip may only be relevant for a year or 2 before faster/better chips are made but analog chips have 7 to 10 year sell cycles. $TXN still sells a chip that they designed/manufactured 30 years ago! And, it's vertically integrated. Great business.",
