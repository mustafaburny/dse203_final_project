LinkedIn has the richest data on people's skillsets and job search activity. This helps hiring teams reach out and close candidates faster. \n* Want to sell your B2B SaaS product? LinkedIn shows where different people are in an organization and what they do. For example, if you're trying to sell Salesforce, you'll know if you're talking to the CTO, Director of Sales, or a Sales Rep, and be able to position your pitch accordingly.\n\nSo while LinkedIn does many a good chunk of change from advertising on their social media platform, they have a huge sales team that sells these SaaS solutions to other businesses.",

I cashed out my retirement in 2018 (it wasn't much but I just wanted to pay off some bills). I used to work as an actuary/data analyst.\n\nI am pretty young in my career and have had a lot knowledge gaps either filled in by reddit or mentors (people I know and not some online guru that people call mentor).\n\nI help people without college degrees find jobs. I'm the founder of https://www.NoDegree.com (I got super lucky with the domain) and host The NoDegree Podcast where I interview people without college degrees and have them share their stories. I just interviewed someone without a degree who works at Salesforce making VERY good money. He found me on LinkedIn. \n\nI also interviewed the CEO of Scribe Media. Someone on LinkedIn messaged me who messaged me before and was like I think he would be a good guest, want an intro? I will meet up with him when he comes to NYC. I am getting some amazing guests and have connected with some decent podcasters who also refer me guests.\n\nI have had offers for funding before but I have a long term vision and I have sacrificed a decent amount of money in order to maintain my vision. LinkedIn has allowed me to be cash flow positive without worrying too much about chasing money. I don't want to sacrifice control to someone whose only focus is an exit or cashing out during a funding round.",

        "body": "People want out of dense urban environment. It's fun when shit is open right? A lot of college kids graduating college and want to maintain that kind of social life in their work life. At the same time, you can walk to work, you're close to your office, etc. Who wouldn't want to go to happy hours with friends and co-workers afterwork to let loose? \n\nBunch of shops are closed, my friends at Salesforce, Dropbox, Google, etc are all WFH. They can periodically go into the office, but they're not required to and encouraged not to. There's no plans to have them back at the office until at least 2021 right now and many of these companies are gathering data and finding that it's more cost effective to keep some of these people WFH. Especially the tier 1 or the new comers. WFH employees literally absorb some of the expense by not being in the office. \n\n\nSo in retrospect there are less need to live so close to your work. If the plan in the future is only to ask you to come back periodically like once or twice a week. Sitting a traffic is no big deal, it's not like an everyday occurrence. Now you have people who don't have a need to live in these dense environment who has an opportunity to get out. Who wouldn't want to live in a house where you have your own yard, or garage, or parking, etc. Why deal with your bedroom headboard against your neighbor's bedroom right? \n\nThe social life is non-existent for now, so there goes the perk of living downtown. Why live in a downtown dense urban environment if none of the benefits are there? Can't find a place to park, hard to own a car, minimal outdoor space, shit ton of people, you're far from everything that's not closed, etc.",

        "body": "It may also be worth looking at this from another angle. You've already shown an interest in some diversification, given your broad accumulation of tech stocks rather than betting on an individual one. And you list an interest in additional companies, 2 payment / financials and 3 healthcare related.\n\nA lot of the focus on long term investing is based on the minimization of downside. Ex: Suppose one company from your list of 7 tech stocks got banned from a country (we're seeing the beginnings of this with Huawei, likely expect some retaliation). How exposed are you to that negative news?\n\nBy constructing your own collection of 7+ tech stocks, you'll end up re-creating your own mini diversified ETF. By adding additional sectors into your investment portfolio, you're diversifying your risk from one sector into multiple. The end result is an actively managed portfolio where you do all the work. If you value your time / energy spent on managing stocks in this portfolio, you're effectively paying a fee for this actively managed portfolio. At the very least, you're spending your free time.\n\nSuppose you want to focus on a tech-heavy portfolio, but from a less actively managed standpoint. You can pick up an etf, like VGT for example, that focuses on just the tech sector. From the top asset holdings as of 6/30, that etf holds AAPL, MSFT, V, M, INTC, NVDA, Adobe, Cisco, Paypal, Salesforce with roughly 60% of it's assets. This is actually pretty well aligned with your current collection of stocks. There are individual sector ETFs, dividend growth ETFs, disruptive tech ETFs, and broad market ETFs. It's important to recognize when the collection of stocks you end up with actually aligns with a broader index. Arguably your current portfolio and intended direction seems like 40% VGT and 30% VHT. If later you want to add exposure to other parts of the economy, you might end up with a mix of multiple individual sector ETFs, which might end up having significant overlap with the S&amp;P500 or VTI (total market ETF). A long road to end up at a broad market ETF.\n\nThe important thing about ETFs that track benchmarks / indices is that the index is a moving target. Right now there are discussions about TSLA being included in the S&amp;P 500, which would kick some other company out. All the S&amp;P index tracking funds would adjust to this new definition of the index, and all passive investors would then be exposed to TSLA. This is true for many of the index tracking funds, the index definition can change and the funds change to reflect that.\n\nIn trying to outperform an index, you're making a bet that you can pick stocks that do better than the continually evolving indices that track economic growth of various sectors. It's always worth evaluating whether you can outperform the 7-9% long term avg the S&amp;P500 returns, and how much effort it takes for you to do that. By spending a lot of time and effort on stocks, you're spending time trying to improve performance on current savings. Your time could also be spent acquiring skills to increase your earning potential, increasing future savings.\n\nTL;DR: Upgrade your portfolio to sector ETFs, eventually to VTI.",

Will take the profits (if they print) and buy some shares. \n\nI have a baby for LEAPS I haven\u2019t told anyone about yet. AGRX. Look into it. They won FDA approval for their birth control in February literally as this all started. So it stopped everything in its tracks at the worst time. But as soon as things open back up, they have a Salesforce ready to rock and roll. Birth control is big since locksdowns also. The other option is they get bought out, your boy JNJ is one of the rumors to buy them. Either way they are at a lower price than before the approval. I personally have some December leaps.",

        "body": "Nivida is my favorite of the 3 and here's why: \n\nAdobe: Debt/Equity(&lt;0.5) is nice and if I just looked at that then I would say Adobe but the current ratio is very close to 1 and debt has been rising over the past 10 years. Margins along with ROA/ROE are beautiful but a company can't go bankrupt by having too little debt and although it is nothing to sell over I always try to be as pessimistic as possible before I buy because the emotional scale tends to shift once you've purchased an asset.\n\nSalesforce: As with Adobe, Debt/Equity is low but the current ratio is also low.  Profits are worse with Salesforce with operating margins decreasing since 2018. As of 4/30/20 the Operating Margin is around -0.2%. ROA and ROE are both negative and have been decreasing since 2018 like Operating Margin. Also, Salesforce has had an unpredictable EPS. I like to see a line with a 45 degree angle but Salesforce has been wildly fluctuating since 2006. \n\nNividia: Debt/Equity is low (less than 1) but recently it went from roughly 0.20 to 0.5 which is because of a nearly 200% increase in debt from Q1 to Q2 2020. However, even though the Debt/Equity has gone up in the past quarter the current ratio is MUCH higher (10) than Salesforce or Adobe. Also, unlike Salesforce, Nivida has beautiful Operating Margins (26%) as well as ROA (18%) and ROE (28%) like Adobe. Finally, EPS and Free Cash Flow is a lot more predictable and is what I like to see. As a cherry on top, insiders own roughly 4% which is always great to see.",
