Point is, CDNs are going to be dominated by the biggies or the freebies. There is no need for intermediates, imo.",

Then, you seeming intentionally misconstrue my meanings for Netlify and Datapath. [Netlify Edge](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/) and Datapath's cloud-to-cloud are advancements upon CDNs. I was saying that if you're going to pay for something like Cloudflare, you should be doing something more specific or something better that ties in with AWS, GCP, and Azure CDNs. But, yes you're right there hundreds like datapath, just as there are hundreds like Cloudflare. If you're not willing to pay for AWS, GCP, or Azure, itmeans you're going the cheapest route possible, which might land you with Cloudflare, or much more likely, you'll piece together a bunch of the cheaper services and free services out there to do whatever specific thing you want. From what I can tell, Cloudflare is picking up scraps at best, and is getting squeezed in a race to the bottom.",

Netlify isn't a CDN, it's a static site hosting service that uses Fastly and other actual CDNs. Datapath isn't a CDN, it's a 3rd tier networking company amongst hundreds in that niche.\n\nYou don't seem to have much experience with space.",

It's nothing special, anyone can spin up some Nginx servers and host content. \n\nCDNs are global, it doesn't matter where you run your infrastructure in order to use them and not using the cloud doesn't mean you're looking for the cheapest route. Cloudflare and runner up Fastly are the next generation CDNs taking on plenty of legacy companies and growing rapidly every quarter.\n\nYour post makes it clear that you have zero experience with any of this beyond reading some marketing pages. And your focus on the Cloudfront free tier sounds like you don't have much scale or budget either.",

Always log in early so your availability (Skype, Teams, etc) shows green \n2.) Reply to emails and messages quickly \n3.) If workload is low, make sure your deliverables are on fucking point \n4.) Never confide in coworkers (even friends) how little work you actually do\n5.) Ask boss if he/she needs help\n6.) Stay logged on later than your peers. Even if you\u2019re just moving your trackpad every 5 minutes it\u2019ll show that you\u2019re available - e.g. \u201cthat dedicated motherfucker is STILL online?\u201d Meanwhile you\u2019re doing blow and drinking beer while appearing productive \n7.) If your calendar is empty, create false meetings for yourself with no invitees. \n8.) If you MUST do cocaine on the job, be sure the cadence of your voice is not atypical \n\nIf you have any additional questions, check my calendar for availability (spoiler alert - it\u2019s fucking full).",
