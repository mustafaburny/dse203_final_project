However I looked into it and here are some reasons why the OP is an idiot.\n\nHis argument is that INTC is a good investment because of the automotive chip shortage.\n\n1). INTC doesn\u2019t make automobile chips\n\n2). Neither do the car companies\n\n3) car computer modules are created by companies who then outsource in bulk the components.  So something like Chrysler will buy a module from Bosch who will buy the from the cheapest bidder.\n\n4) there is a chip shortage.  However the current issue is that because it\u2019s outsourced through several rings of suppliers car manufacturers have almost no control over their supply chains and no clout over their actual producer(TSM).  So when they cancelled and then restarted their orders the auto industry set their supply chains back a few months. \n\nThe shortage is that, several months worth of production.  It might sound big for Toyota to make 1.5m fewer cars this year.  But that\u2019s 15%.  It\u2019s not a total shutdown.\n\n5). If this were an EV issue then companies that don\u2019t really sell EVs, most of them (Nissan/Renault, Stellantis, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Mazda, etc) wouldn\u2019t have been hit either, no?\n\nFinally, Ford has what?  100k LiON batteries to put in cars this year?  In their production run of 7m cars?  Ford can try and blame EVs, but the truth is their whole industry blundered bigly.  Ford just blundered worse cause they\u2019re so bad at managing supply.\n\nYou\u2019re arguing a secular increase in chip usage due to EVs.  Hey genius, there\u2019s a secular increase in chips due to everything.   It\u2019s why TSM is putting $100b into capex this year.",

        "body": "So as a person that\u2019s been an investor for decades AND I have worked in the tech industry for decades, I personally have sold all my Intel stock. I held Intel for about fifteen years but I\u2019m now very convinced that their glory days are behind them. They certainly will be a billion dollar company for decades to come but they are just far too behind the next big race. Here is why. \n\nThe actual architecture and nature of the cpu race has changed. For years it was all about raw performance, we saw this with x86 architecture (which is intels bread and butter) we have seen this for 30 years, higher clock speeds, more cores. But two major shifts happened in the industry that Intel just isn\u2019t prepared for. One is the rise of mobile devices led by the iPhone with android soon to follow. Power consumption became the driving metric for better battery life. Most mobile phones use a cpu architecture called\u201cARM\u201d vs Intels x86 architecture that powers most windows devices. ARM CPU\u2019s use considerably less power then their x86 counterparts and now that the worlds primary computer is their phone, arm has considerable market share. The next thing that happened was ARM CPU\u2019s became incredibly powerful and could rival (and sometimes just destroy) X86 CPU\u2019s in performance while consuming less power. The industry term now is \u201cperformance per watt\u201d This is why Apple is switching out their entire product line to ARM even on Mac\u2019s which over the last decade or so ran Intel CPU\u2019s. \n\nAnother tech shift is cloud computing with the rise of AWS, Azure and Google cloud. Electric costs are out of control for big data centers so these guys are turning to ARM CPU\u2019s for server side work as well. This is a MASSIVE shift in the industry that no one knows about except people that work in the industry. So Intel is being directly assaulted on both the server side and the mobile side in a war that they were WAY late to the party on. I don\u2019t see them recovering easily from this shift. \n\nNow of course none of this happens over night and it will probably take a decade but their hay-days are behind them. Then you look at what AMD is doing and they are actually making decent products after all these years. So even on Intels home turf they have a fierce competitor. Hope that helps.",

I get it, people like companies to be green but what IS THE POINT is that the chips they are making ARE GREEN that is the chips use less power and are more powerful. Intel missed a critical development and is very far behind TSM. While Intel does have new chips in its pipeline they aren't about to catch up to TSM any time soon and Intel has a lot of execution risk in its plan to once again be the flagship company it once was.",

It's not unlikely that it'll be a colossal failure or a home run, but the realistic thing is that it'll be mediocre.\n\nFurthermore Intel core architecture at this point is a patchwork mess of random idiotic instructions with little to no uses.\n\nX86 as a whole is loosing ground to risk.

Amazon and Walmart have been kind of duds this year as high P/E stocks, while GM and Goldman Sachs have been low P/E All-Stars.\n\nStock | Price increase past year | P/E ratio\n:--|--:|--:\nAmazon | +2.8% | 60.4\nGoldman Sachs | +99.7% | 7.6\nWalmart | +2.8% | 41.9\nGM | +66.0% | 5.7\n\nP/E cannot be relied upon in isolation to pick good/bad buys. GM is a good example of the complication of P/E. Almost all of GM's business is internal combustion engine cars, so its P/E is using its legacy business as a base in the calculation, but all of the optimism around GM is about everything else they are doing besides internal combustion engine cars. GM itself thinks their legacy business will disappear in 10-15 years, so its P/E is nonsensical when looking forward. Their \"true\" future P/E is going to be based on earnings from non-internal combustion engine cars, and those earnings are essentially zero right now. In other words, their true forward looking P/E is much higher than 5.7. They are a future high P/E stock disguised as a current low P/E stock, but the future high P/E is going to be driven by earnings declines.\n\nIn terms of finding value, there is usually a story why a company's P/E is low. You have to find the story and see if you are okay with it. Maybe it's something like Intel where consumer sentiment is so negative due to their rivals' recent tech advantages, but the deeper you look, the more you see competitive advantages that Intel will be able to maintain and leverage going forward to build its stock price back up. Or maybe it's a low P/E like Altria because no one wants to own tobacco stocks.",

Converting Intel's fabs into a foundry business will be incredibly hard. From a technical standpoint, fabbing your own chips is extremely different from being a contract foundry. Intel, in particular, is known for doing a lot of manual layout/hacks to squeeze performance out of their process nodes, and this will be difficult (if not impossible) to replicate for foundry clients.\n2. Intel isn't really an attractive place to work anymore. Most of the best people I know aren't going to Intel, they're going elsewhere: Apple, Nvidia, etc.\n3. Intel has absolutely no chance in competing with TSMC on advanced nodes and realistically is out of this race for a long time. They're late to EUV, and TSMC's head start is pretty insurmountable.\n\n\nThis isn't to say that Intel won't be profitable over the next years, but I think it's important to keep some perspective.

GM is a good example of the complication of P/E. Almost all of GM's business is internal combustion engine cars, so its P/E is using its legacy business as a base in the calculation, but all of the optimism around GM is about everything else they are doing besides internal combustion engine cars. GM itself thinks their legacy business will disappear in 10-15 years, so its P/E is nonsensical when looking forward. Their \"true\" future P/E is going to be based on earnings from non-internal combustion engine cars, and those earnings are essentially zero right now. In other words, their true forward looking P/E is much higher than 5.7. They are a future high P/E stock disguised as a current low P/E stock, but the future high P/E is going to be driven by earnings declines.\n\nIn terms of finding value, there is usually a story why a company's P/E is low. You have to find the story and see if you are okay with it. Maybe it's something like Intel where consumer sentiment is so negative due to their rivals' recent tech advantages, but the deeper you look, the more you see competitive advantages that Intel will be able to maintain and leverage going forward to build its stock price back up.

While there were talks a few months ago in regards to Intel acquiring them, a lot of electronics that don\u2019t require high end semi conductors(7nm TSMC, 8nm Samsung, 10nm Intel) are made using cheap, larger nodes that are less efficient. Global foundries failed to develop high end chips after they abandoned their rnd, but they hold a 15% market share(at last check) in markets which use lower grade nodes. Best part is, that they are supposedly going public in 2022.

Nobody (w a day job) can look at all.. at least that's why I find some good in SOME of these posts. Look at AMD, 2016/17 left for dead ... much better plan for revival and MUCH more focused and driven under Lisa Su... Intel, FUBAR and resting on their butts ...   CRNT (obviously in my opinion)  falls into this category, micro cap, conservative management and playing in a vastly growing industry, 5G ... and they have an existing competitive advantage in their 5G IP50 line (wideband) and a new System on a Chip that will provide a huge opportunity to basically corner the 5G back and mid haul market... so much so that they will be in a position to OEM the SOY to competitors .. increasing their slice of the market and vastly upping their profit margin... or getting bought out.   \n\n\nSeparating the huchksters from the information, and then doing you're own DD, is how you stand a better chance of beating the market; long term stocks w good fundimentals.. if momentum hits, great .. if not, they will still rise on their own merits once their revenue takes off.",

This is no go and it may turn around a bit on buybacks, financial engineering they have a ton of money but it's not on the back of technology.  \n\nAny non boomer working in cloud computing/semi field can tell you INTC is not where you want to put your money.

TSMC is building new fabs, Intel is building, GlobalFoundries is building, Samsung just announced increase in capital spending and they will profit from it in 2-3 years as this is on average how long it takes to finish a new fab. Right now the equipment makers will be the big winners on chip shortage. AMAT and LRCX are particularly undervalued. They sold off recently along with MU because they also supply DRAM equipment and there is suspicion in the industry DRAM cycle peaked.

        "body": "There are lots of exceptions. Amazon and Walmart have been kind of duds this year as high P/E stocks, while GM and Goldman Sachs have been low P/E All-Stars.\n\nStock | Price increase past year | P/E ratio\n:--|--:|--:\nAmazon | +2.8% | 60.4\nGoldman Sachs | +99.7% | 7.6\nWalmart | +2.8% | 41.9\nGM | +66.0% | 5.7\n\nP/E cannot be relied upon in isolation to pick good/bad buys. GM is a good example of the complication of P/E. Almost all of GM's business is internal combustion engine cars, so its P/E is using its legacy business as a base in the calculation, but all of the optimism around GM is about everything else they are doing besides internal combustion engine cars. GM itself thinks their legacy business will disappear in 10-15 years, so its P/E is nonsensical when looking forward. Their \"true\" future P/E is going to be based on earnings from non-internal combustion engine cars, and those earnings are essentially zero right now. In other words, their true forward looking P/E is much higher than 5.7. They are a future high P/E stock disguised as a current low P/E stock, but the future high P/E is going to be driven by earnings declines.\n\nIn terms of finding value, there is usually a story why a company's P/E is low. You have to find the story and see if you are okay with it. Maybe it's something like Intel where consumer sentiment is so negative due to their rivals' recent tech advantages, but the deeper you look, the more you see competitive advantages that Intel will be able to maintain and leverage going forward to build its stock price back up. Or maybe it's a low P/E like Altria because no one wants to own tobacco stocks.",

While there were talks a few months ago in regards to Intel acquiring them, a lot of electronics that don\u2019t require high end semi conductors(7nm TSMC, 8nm Samsung, 10nm Intel) are made using cheap, larger nodes that are less efficient. Global foundries failed to develop high end chips after they abandoned their rnd, but they hold a 15% market share(at last check) in markets which use lower grade nodes. Best part is, that they are supposedly going public in 2022. I personally think that this is a wise investment, though a rather obvious one, as any company which is trusted by the US government and hold a market share in a sector worth billions is a simple stock to buy",

The problem with your analysis is you\u2019re looking at book value, you need to look at future growth and both companies they can take market share have a fair amount higher market cap, meaning it has plenty of space to grow if things keep going well for them. The stock market cares about future growth, not too much on past performance.\n\nTo give you a basic idea of investing, there are four types of companies - Dogs, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Stars. AMD is at the Question Mark phase that is almost to Star. They are taking market share in a fast growing area. The typical investor strategy in that situation is to \u201cbuy\u201d.",

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

A lot of investors expect AMD to win those contracts when they come up for renewal. Will that happen? Who knows. A lot of US govt. contracts are still being renewed with intel because intel manufacters their chips in the US.\n\nI personally don\u2019t see AMD as over-priced for its potential, but I do believe most of its potential is now priced-in unless a major positive event occurs. I see more downside risk in the event intel makes a breakthrough (although that is highly unlikely for awhile) or a negative event occurs. \n\nRegardless, AMD\u2019s run up is backed by fundamentals and reasonable expectations. There are definitely major downside risks since it has a P/E of almost 40, but it can definitely grow into that P/E if it continues its current trajectory. The biggest problem with AMD is their value isn\u2019t primary driven by its own performance, but the poor performance of its competitor, which makes the investment a bit risky.",

GM is a good example of the complication of P/E. Almost all of GM's business is internal combustion engine cars, so its P/E is using its legacy business as a base in the calculation, but all of the optimism around GM is about everything else they are doing besides internal combustion engine cars. GM itself thinks their legacy business will disappear in 10-15 years, so its P/E is nonsensical when looking forward. Their \"true\" future P/E is going to be based on earnings from non-internal combustion engine cars, and those earnings are essentially zero right now. In other words, their true forward looking P/E is much higher than 5.7. They are a future high P/E stock disguised as a current low P/E stock, but the future high P/E is going to be driven by earnings declines.\n\nIn terms of finding value, there is usually a story why a company's P/E is low. You have to find the story and see if you are okay with it. Maybe it's something like Intel where consumer sentiment is so negative due to their rivals' recent tech advantages, but the deeper you look, the more you see competitive advantages that Intel will be able to maintain and leverage going forward to build its stock price back up. Or maybe it's a low P/E like Altria because no one wants to own tobacco stocks.",

While there were talks a few months ago in regards to Intel acquiring them, a lot of electronics that don\u2019t require high end semi conductors(7nm TSMC, 8nm Samsung, 10nm Intel) are made using cheap, larger nodes that are less efficient. Global foundries failed to develop high end chips after they abandoned their rnd, but they hold a 15% market share(at last check) in markets which use lower grade nodes. Best part is, that they are supposedly going public in 2022. I personally think that this is a wise investment, though a rather obvious one, as any company which is trusted by the US government and hold a market share in a sector worth billions is a simple stock to buy",

I believe Pat is more tech inclined but it's a long road and in the mean time you can invest in AMD, TSM, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, APPL etc if you want exposure to semi or cloud computing.  \n\n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/panf65/intel_is_50_bucks_just_saying/ha79m4v/",

I just dump into that every paycheck and rearrange once a quarter to keep my ratios about the same.  The other 20% goes into individual stock picks.  Really, I think of individual stocks, my biggest one is Intel, and it's only 1% of my entire portfolio.  I want to test this out for a few years and maybe slowly shift the balance if I feel like I'm getting the hang of it.  I believe the market is overvalued right now, but I believe, in general, in the idea that the market is where you should invest your money.  I'm still going 25 or so years until retirement so I got time to really dig into some of the companies I'd like to when a correction happens.\n\nI also run a magic formula investor portfolio with about $600.00, just to compare how it looks with next year, have about $350.00 invested in crypto, and an account for daytrades and options plays that I do not feed but only use the money that are in them.
