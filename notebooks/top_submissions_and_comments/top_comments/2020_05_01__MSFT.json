They took a beating and am expecting a bounce back from the 132-133 level. I'll be going short term calls tomorrow for a quick scalp at open.\n\nPTON Calls: Same as above \\^ bounce back from the $40-41 level\n\nDKNG: FOMO if you want. This thing could pop to $40 or drop to $30. I won't be touching this until at least another week or so. Risky af but mad tendiez if you guess the right direction (calls/puts)\n\nCOTY: Same as above, but I expect this will hold better than DKNG since its already near rock bottom prices. Might throw a few thousand at it tomorrow in calls.\n\nSPY: i personally don't play SPY, but there is mad tendiez to be made if you get in calls at a dip (around the 295-297 range) or puts (around the 301-303 range).\n\nCCL, RCL, NCLH: Easy plays to go long on a dip, Beaten up cruise stocks that have been forming new bottoms. Easy 2x 3x bagger if you get in before a large move up in the premarket. They seem a bit overheated lately though so I would be careful of a pullback soon, in which case go short term puts.\n\nAAL, DAL, UAL, LUV, SAVE: Same as above\n\nAAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA: Tech saw a big hit today, might be a good spot to buy the dip. I'll be watching closely tomorrow if we continue to fall in tech at open, then I'm buying the dip for sure.\n\nBABA, TSM: GYNA stocks if you want i guess\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck making your parents money back you fucking autist.",

Pretty much every country's military runs windows.\n\nJust listened to the q3 earnings call. Cloud demand is up like crazy right now. So, money is being shifted away from local resources into cloud computing resources. So many of AWS and Azure customers are shifting money into these tech companies. Smaller firms like NetApp, Atlassian, or Slack are seeing sales raise with this new demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, there are entirely new markets for tech that weren't viable pre covid. Consider the NFL, NBA....I can't remember the sport, but they now use MSTeams. Companies are seeing the cost benefits of remote work. Virtual Formula 1 is another example. Things are going to be interesting. To stay competitive, you will need to piviot into this new economic situation. Red Robin is an interesting case study. They cut costs like crazy and embraced off site orders. Or look at Trupanion's 10K. They cut costs and increased cash on hand to a point where they can operate for an entire year w/o income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to remember that there are millions of dollars worth of human intelligence driving the decisions behind each of these Tickers. Boards are made up of people with way way way way more industry knowledge than anyone on reddit. Yes, Tesla exists, and a tweet can swing billions of dollars around the moon, but for the most part, companies are ran by intelligent folks trying their best to make money. That's it. Even if the world is on fire, these people will find a way to sell you insurance on credit. The economy has existed since before the old testament. Exodus 30:11-16  is just ancient hebrew tax law. Even if it's not money, people will find something to trade to create value. The wheel keeps on turning.\n\nEDIT: Totally forgot, look at MSFT 10K. B2B OEM sales are the bread and butter. So you will need to see large retailers (including amazon) collapse before companies like intel and MSFT will feel the big hits.",

        "body": "I'm sorry but this is a gross misunderstanding of what is going on.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is not the economy.  It also is not an equal weighing of all the companies in the S&amp;P.  As long as there's not full blown fear, there should be some differentiation.  Owning MSFT and owning M are not equal.  The stocks like MSFT are helping carry the S&amp;P while M being down a lot is a not a proportionate loss.\n\nDon't forget, we are down.  It's not like we're up YTD.\n\nYou also have to remember that there's no competition to equities.  The 10-year is yielding less than 1%.  Why would I buy that when I can buy AAPL and get a better dividend than that?  After all, it has about $100 billion in cash alone right now so the dividend seems pretty safe.\n\nThere's also this thing called sentiment.  In layman's terms, it's the general belief of what will happen.  So while unemployment may not return to the record pre-crisis levels, the market believes most of these jobs will be back soon.  And that makes a lot of sense if you believe the world will be re-opening soon, which I do.  Since the general belief is that unemployment will be resolved shortly, the market is priced accordingly. \n\nThere's also TRILLIONS of dollars of stimulus being issued in a variety of ways.  I think you might underestimate how much TRILLIONS really is.\n\nEven if you're right and the market is being irrational, these bullish rallies are normal in a bear market.  That means you can be right AND THIS STILL HAPPENS.  These must be accounted for but you're not accounting for them whatsoever.\n\nMost importantly, you're looking at this like an amateur.   Big time investors are capitalists.  They understand ups and downs and all sorts of things I'm sure I don't know.  But markets are functioning.  The big fear in the Great Recession is that markets weren't functioning.  We recovered once it proved the markets functioned.  Knowing this, the Fed went right after this point immediately.  THAT'S WHY THE FED DID WHAT IT DID BECAUSE IT'S THAT IMPORTANT.  The day the Fed announced infinite QE was the bottom on the chart for the reason.  The Fed basically guaranteed markets will work so the worst case scenario is off the table.\n\nLastly \"Things aren't returning to normal anytime soon\" is a massive assumption.  I'm not saying the world will be back to normal on May 15th but a lot of people think the opposite of you, myself included.  Be careful what assumptions you make.\n\nEDIT:  You also have to remember how people think.  Let's say 20% of people thought the world would open again in April, 20% in May, 20% in June, 20% July, and 20% in August.  Well it's May now so the April 20% and the May 20% think re-opening is right around the corning - that's 40%.  In June, you add that 20% to the existing 40% and now we're up to 60%.  Just like you think the market will fall every day, they believe the opening is just around the corning.  You keep thinking \"tomorrow is the day\" forever.  Being stubborn  goes both ways.",

I personally don't believe it's a $0.20 company (do your own, accurate DD outside of Reddit). \n\nThere will be upswings in the future, so I'd rather hold than lock in my loss now.

Your wife will leave her boyfriend for a man that\u2019s more manly that he could ever be. You\u2019ll jerk off your wife\u2019s ex while you both watch her fuck her new boyfriend. She\u2019ll get pregnant, have the baby, go out for a pack of cigarettes, never come back, divorce you, make you pay alimony AND child support even though you have full custody, just not in the courts eyes. You\u2019ll raise the child, his first words will be \u201cdada\u201d, you\u2019ll teach him to walk, ride a bicycle, throw a baseball, how to ask a girl out, teach him to shave, tie a tie, he will excel in his studies, go to Harvard, graduate at the top of his class. The child, now a man, got an internship after college at Twitter (TWTR) and worked his way up to become CEO, he reorganized the company and it excels beyond your wildest imagination. Every move he makes has the midias touch, he will be featured on every financial news outlet, you\u2019ll see his face plastered all over wall street and main street. Your Tendy alert goes off every day, like clockwork, showing that TWTR has increased more than 5% for the day (it never goes down), the stonk will eclipse the values of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon with retard strength even when the financials don\u2019t make sense. You\u2019ll be proud and everyone around you, no matter where you are, will constantly praise you for his success (which is your success). You alone raised him and he grew up to be everything you wanted, but could never, be. He has always loved you unconditionally, but, since you secretly despised him, you never bought calls, only puts. What I\u2019m trying to say is, buy puts.",

        "body": "**We were of course mentioned:**\n\n*\u201cAnd, hey, it took a pandemic, but it was already happening before this with Wall Street Bets and cryptocurrency,\u201d Camillo said by phone. \u201cNow they\u2019re wanting to go one layer deeper. OK I did that, I did crypto, OK now I own Tesla, I get it. But there has to be more to investing than just Tesla.\u201d*\n\n**No, all there is to investing is owning Tesla, in call form specifically. Mr Camillo clearly has not read that many posts here.**\n\n*\"The fingerprints of tiny investors are all over the options market. Trades consisting of just one contract now account for 13% of total volume, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by John Marshall. That supports a view that \u201cindividual investor active trading is playing an increased role in market volatility.\u201d In some popular stocks, like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Alphabet Inc., small options trades account for nearly a third of total volume.\"*\n\n**CMG options? Really? Not AMD? Or DIS? Or MSFT? Or TSLA? Or MRNA? Chipotle???**\n\n*That\u2019s been true for Ameer Umarov, a cab driver in Arizona with an interest in math and a passion for video games. Months ago, when he realized the coronavirus was growing into a global health crisis, he reactivated his Amazon.com account to make some purchases. Not for masks or hand sanitizer -- for books on stock trading. Two a week, at one point.*\n\n*When equities started surging in late March, Umarov stayed away, scared by the volatility. He was ready to act by the first week of April. He bought shares of Boeing Co., a bad decision that set him back more than $4,000. But a stake in Halliburton Co. brought him $9,800, after he sold shares on the day of a 16% rally late last month. A few other purchases -- Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology Inc., among them -- yielded mixed results. All told, Umarov is down some $400 since he began.*\n\n**Definitely more losses than that.**\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble, but a highly intellectual gamble,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s about knowledge and risk, but especially for guys like me, it\u2019s all about sheer luck.\u201d*\n\n**He gets it.**\n\n*This month, he stopped buying books and instead signed up for a virtual trading boot-camp. He paid $4,100 for two days of 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. classes, where he learned about concepts like support, resistance, and trading on gaps. To Umarov, the course is a long-term investment, and he\u2019s decided eventually he wants to make trading his full-time job.*\n\n**I really hope that's not code for True Trading Group.**\n\n*\u201cI have no idea how it\u2019s going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will be stupid not to try.\u201d*\n\n**Sums up this sub entirely.**\n\n**BTW, Ameer, you should reveal yourself. I assume you are reading this.**",
