Pretty much every country's military runs windows.\n\nJust listened to the q3 earnings call. Cloud demand is up like crazy right now. So, money is being shifted away from local resources into cloud computing resources. So many of AWS and Azure customers are shifting money into these tech companies. Smaller firms like NetApp, Atlassian, or Slack are seeing sales raise with this new demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, there are entirely new markets for tech that weren't viable pre covid. Consider the NFL, NBA....I can't remember the sport, but they now use MSTeams. Companies are seeing the cost benefits of remote work. Virtual Formula 1 is another example. Things are going to be interesting. To stay competitive, you will need to piviot into this new economic situation. Red Robin is an interesting case study. They cut costs like crazy and embraced off site orders. Or look at Trupanion's 10K. They cut costs and increased cash on hand to a point where they can operate for an entire year w/o income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to remember that there are millions of dollars worth of human intelligence driving the decisions behind each of these Tickers. Boards are made up of people with way way way way more industry knowledge than anyone on reddit. Yes, Tesla exists, and a tweet can swing billions of dollars around the moon, but for the most part, companies are ran by intelligent folks trying their best to make money. That's it. Even if the world is on fire, these people will find a way to sell you insurance on credit. The economy has existed since before the old testament. Exodus 30:11-16  is just ancient hebrew tax law. Even if it's not money, people will find something to trade to create value. The wheel keeps on turning.\n\nEDIT: Totally forgot, look at MSFT 10K. B2B OEM sales are the bread and butter. So you will need to see large retailers (including amazon) collapse before companies like intel and MSFT will feel the big hits.",

I was super-excited, had all of the right clothes to wear, and was definitely looking forward to flossing the new-and-improved me.  The first party was definitely cool, as I felt my way around, filled with nervousness and anticipation.  I laughed off the fact I didn't actually go home with a woman that first night, or even get a number, or even talk to a woman, but I had a nice buzz and was prepared for my next shot.   It was kind of like my bet on Dominoes this earning's season, in hindsight it didn't work out, but I had done the research and looked forward to the next round.\n\nThe next few parties in college, I began to resent how easy it seemed to be for everybody else to have a good time, and get apparently what I was looking for.  I was beginning to get less and less optimistic, and that initial sense of euphoria and confidence was slowly turning into self-loathing and the feeling of petulance of not belonging there.  As I bet AMZN and MSFT this earnings season, the same feeling became me.  Why didn't I just click on FB instead, why did I blow $1600 on an expiring weekend SPY Put.  None of it makes sense, to anybody.  \n\nEventually at the end of my freshman year, I realized that parties weren't for me, and maybe I'm just a weirdo.  Maybe earnings aren't for me either, but I could just be broke.  In either event, I have no business being there or here.",

In fact, I would say that NVDA and AMD are far more analogous to each other than even AMD -&gt; AAPL, and certainly to MSFT. The  way that I see it, NVDA/AMD are fundamentally companies that are concerned with producing a *physical good* \\- literal chipsets and dies. AAPL seems to waver on the hardware side of things (they have been known to go proprietary in that arena, but have also loaned out work to INTC on more than one occasion). I most certainly see MSFT as a true software/PaaS/SaaS company - suffice to say that they are producing very little in the way of physical goods.\n\nI think the *soft/hardware* direction is important to mention, because that fundamentally plays into the way that these companies deal in the market. Developing hardware is a mind-bendingly expensive process (relatively speaking). It takes years of R&amp;D and cash on hand to fund something that is truly great. An example of this would be the move AMD made to Zen (which is based on the concept of 'chiplets'; highly-scalable many-core designs that are fundamentally different from their monolithic predecessors).\n\nIn terms of growth, I would have to say that I see two viable options here: *NVDA and MSFT*. MSFT is pretty easy to explain; they create a product that fundamentally has lower upstart costs (software development's most expensive attribute is the cost of human labor) and lower maintenance costs (I would think). There is some movement towards a more data-center driven profit scheme (which would require boots on ground hardware en masse), and Azure is certainly an AWS competitor, but I think we've yet to see them really go full throttle on that (I think it could be big if they did).\n\nNVDA is a leader from a technological perspective. GPU compute-cores are very specialized devices that are good at doing only a few things, but very, *very well.* NVDA has been hammering away at this technology for years - they know the game, and they know where the money is. Autonomous cars, drones...the computer viz recogition software for postal, for literally anything, runs on a platform that is fundamentally a GPU (very high level view here). Machine learning applications in this field at the data-center level (think machine learning on AWS) are absolutely dominated by NVDA; In fact I would go as far as to say there aren't really a lot of competitors out there that are bringing to the table what NVDA does (Honestly AMD has severely gimped even their consumer dies at this point).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can elaborate more, but I'd go with MSFT and NVDA on this one.",

Some of the biggest returns won't even be from the infrastructure, but the companies who will take advantage of the network to improve automation, autonomous driving, and all of the semiconductors, processors, and sensors that will power all of these innovations.",

        "body": "&gt; DKNG or PENN as online sports betting becomes commonplace \n\nAre there any studies/statistics to show how fast this industry is growing? I'd love to educate myself in it. I've been looking into ERI, MGM, BOYD and Penn already but never really gave any attention to DKNG, Penns also probably been on the bottom of my list as well for gambling stocks, but I can definitely see the room for growth in online gambling via a phone in the future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Looking for companies working 5G infrastructure as it pertains to cloud computing, as I think the future of consumer networks is wireless, with only larger commercial pipes needing to be hard\n\nI've been trying to find a good 5g play as well. Right now I'm looking into qualcomm and MU.\n\n&gt; I think Azure will win the cloud war for the majority of government and large caps so also looking for companies on the forward development side of that, especially in business intelligence, how it's used, etc. \n\nAnother industry I know nothing about haha. I'm looking to get into microsoft if we see another dip and I'm already invested in Amazon which is currently the leader in cloud. I know microsoft is much better at marketing their products to big caps though which will further their revenues a lot. From what I read earlier (on reddit to be fair..) is that as of right now Amazon undeniably has the better cloud services (apparently microsoft is slightly lacking in their quality) but microsoft has been making up for this with their hard line  marketing towards big caps so I can see that being beneficial for them too. I think everything cloud is going to be big in general, so investing in anyone doing cloud is a good investment in the long run probably. \n\nI'm also invested in Alibaba which is investing HEAVILY into their cloud service and will probably be the biggest cloud service in China and likely surrounding nations within their sphere of influence so I definitely think they're great as well.",
