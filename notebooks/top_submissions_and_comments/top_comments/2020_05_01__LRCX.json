They picked that strike because they premiums are cheap so they keep most of their upside and still be protected if things go completely against them. \n\nTSM and LRCX also have a lot of exposure to this trade war. China made up 60% of TSM and 17% of LRCX's total revenue. In their last quarterly report LRCX also talked about how the trade war would really hurt them. One of the big concerns was that if trump started blacklisting these companies they would have to license to Chinese based manufacturers. This would make it for their IP to be stolen because China doesn't enforce patent laws.\n\n\nIf anything inverse this but Im biased. Its also most likely too late this news came out Friday right before close. \n\n\n\n\n[Positions Opened Friday Morning ](https://imgur.com/a/3yiGoAF)",

I have no idea how this company works going forward if they don't move to Korea or US/China patch up their relationships, but the P/E is at least pretty low.\n\n\\- Balance sheet is a little esoteric with derivatives and investments, not sure what's going on there for a longer term play\n\n\\- Cloud demand is seeing as a growth area - [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/pkd3n5u8](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/pkd3n5u8)\n\n\\- They are pausing buyback this quarter",

This would adversely affect our business with China, Japan, Korea, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy. A significant trade dispute, impact and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. Tariffs, additional taxes, trade barriers or sanctions may increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. In addition, there are risks that foreign governments may, among other things, insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins. Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S. or foreign governments. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses could potentially limit our markets and impact our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of anticipated growth for our business.\"",

The majority of TSM's revenue is gone until they find a loophole, and their manufacturing costs are going to increase if they stay in the US. The TSM factory is just a plan right now thats only supposed to make up 3-4% of total production so it doesn't seem relevant to me. TSM will probably drop on the uncertainty of them leaving the US alone because Huawei is already pressuring its suppliers to move. \n\n\nProbably wasn't a great move but the thing that pushed me over the edge to buy puts on LRCX was them mentioning in their earnings report what a situation exactly like this would do to them.\n\n\nIf you really wanna make a play on this news NVDA also has a lot of exposure and there might be room to short but it seemed way to risky to me.",

Ive made good money day scalping bounces off support, holding for like 30mins to a couple hours... \n\nSo I'm a tech tard. I know the cloud software sector really well as well as the semiconductor sector. If you were looking to park money in a stonk then I would stick to tech long term although there are some serious discounts in the banks, REITs &amp; cruises long term (I ignore the airlines due to dilution and possibly long term weak demand, as opposed to the cruises where Americans will fucking flock to even if it was the end of the world)   but there discounts are value plays so beware; personally I 'feel' best investing in the best. I dont want to risk my company losing to another so I go with the fastest growth/strongest market positioning. \n\nIn stonks you cant go wrong with ROKU SQ TSLA long term. All leaders, fast growth, the future of consumer tech (RST is the new FAANG). I'll get hate on here but ROKU SQ TSLA could run 500% easy over the next 5 years. No joke.\n\nIn cloud you will pay a premium to own the best but I would go for it. My favorite positions are AYX (actually not cloud but its a data science platform) DDOG/ESTC (observability/APM/API/SEIM) CRWD OKTA (cybersecurity, ZS is a distant-er 3rd). ESTC AYX probably the best value proposition of these companies right now. CRWD is still a buy and going to new highs by next year easy. \n\nAlso check out SE PDD BILI as Chinese stonks, INSG for 5G, and then basically the entire semiconductor sector especially AMD NVDA MU MRVL XLNX. \n\nPeep VTIQ which is the future Nikola motors as well. Peep INMD which is a high gross margin, high growth aesthetic medical device company thats trading at a massive discount. Peep DXCM PODD also in medi devices; peep VRTX CRSP EDIT NVTA TWST in bio - can also buy ARKG. Hope thats helpful",
