Essentially he offloaded a shit ton of liability from ANT's (like paypal/venmo in china) loans onto the chinese government aka the chinese people.  So now the govt has to deal with all that before it potentially explodes in their faces, and they have to teach jack ma a lesson because he essentially sold them bags of dogshit and then bragged about it publicly while laughing in their faces",

        "body": "&gt; you are telling me that you would have all your money in a savings account if we had 0% inflation?\n\nNo, I said that if we had 2% deflation I'd hold all my money in a savings account. However if we had 0% inflation I would probably keep most, if not all of it, in a savings account anyway. I gave the example of pension funds specifically, since pension plans are usually based on capital preservation rather than high growth.\n\n&gt; you do realize that companies still exists and grow right?\n\nAnd companies also shrink and fail. Why take the risk when I know I can get a 2% appreciation every year?\n\n&gt; love that you try and throw around economic rigor as a buzzword, without providing any of your own.\n\nI don't need to provide any \"rigor\" when I'm stating consensus. You're the one arguing the case that challenges all existing theory.\n\n&gt; Thanks for the laugh mate, missed this side of reddit\n\nThe one that questions whether a currency based on wasted CPU cycles can be the basis of a stable currency? Consider this, the number of bitcoin transactions sum to about 0.22% the value of paypal transactions in a given year. However, bitcoin alone consumes more power than 7 nuclear power plants, more than the entire country of the Czech Republic.\n\nA single bitcoin transaction consumes more electricity than a small household does in an entire year.\n\nIf we were to seriously consider adopting bitcoin as a currency, we would need to build over 3000 nuclear power plants to support it. That's before I've even factored in the additional computational expense of adding more nodes to the network (it simply does not scale).\n\nI've got a BEng in Computer Engineering, and am near completion of an MSc in CS from a top 20 university. I've written my own blockchain systems before to learn about it. In fact, I bought my first bitcoin in 2012, and made good money selling it not long after. In total I've made about \u20ac10,000 on bitcoin, so this isn't about sour grapes either.\n\nIn my expert opinion, a blockchain is a slow and inefficient database. Bitcoin is inefficient by design. Transfers are extremely slow, and extremely expensive. This only gets worse as you increase the size of the network.\n\nIf you think it's going to be the next currency, you're a fool.\n\n\n\n\n\n**I'm very happy that you've made these arguments and got your upvotes, it's enough for me to see that this sub is not worth wasting my time on. Have fun chasing the bag kids. What would I know about bitcoin, I'm only a computer scientist.**",

        "body": "I understand the desire, but those sparse expirations, low volumes, and crazy wide bid/asks are all warning flags to steer clear of options on those ETFs. You're just throwing away money trading those options.\n\nA better idea would be to figure out what the top 3 holdings of each of those funds are and see if any of those companies have highly liquid options. Then trade options on those companies as a sort of proxy.\n\nFor example, the top three holdings of SOXX are AVGO, NVDA, TXN. All three have decent liquidity.\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SOXX/holding\n\nYou can then use an asset correlation app to see which of those individual stocks with liquid options most closely correlates to the fund's performance. For example:\n\n[Portfolio Visualizer asset correlation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&amp;symbols=SOXX+AVGO+NVDA+TXN&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;tradingDays=60&amp;months=36)\n\nTXN is the closest with a .84 correlation to SOXX.\n\n\n\nFWIW, you're paying an obscene expense ratio on ARKK. You'd likely make more money over the long run holding QQQ instead of ARKK.",

        "body": "One way I like to visualize dividend growth investing is by using Visa as an example. A lot of people might look at its current yield of 0.70% and think it would be a terrible dividend stock to own because they yield is so low. But when you look at the actual dividend amounts things start to become a lot more clear.\n\nIn 2009, Visa paid a dividend of $0.10 a share. In 2019 they paid a dividend of $1.00 a share. Visa's stock price was around $20 in 2009, so if we use that as our cost basis, the current dividend yield we'd be receiving from shares purchased in 2009 would be 5% (known as yield on cost). So basically even though Visa currently yields 0.70% to anyone buying today, that doesn't mean everyone holding shares is making 0.70% on their investment. \n\nThis is one of the reasons Warren Buffet has been so successful over the years. For example, his cost basis on Coca Cola is $3.25 per share, and the stock currently pays a dividend of $1.64 per share. This means Buffet's yield on cost is over 50%. He invested $1.3B in KO back in the late 80s and early 90s, and will now collect $654 million in income from the stock this year alone.",

There is uncertainty in the market COVID globally and COVID + Elections in the US . Don\u2019t go all in. \n   I had 21 k to invest earlier this year.  the market was insanely high valuations and meanwhile as I enjoyed huge gains on my existing positions, I was afraid to buy at ATH prices...and than CoVID crash happened .\nSince than I split th3 total amount  up into 3 investment runs of 7 k each and over all its been up 18% and these are diversified mutual funds not individual stocks . So do your Research find companies that you feel Comfortable with and invest in Phases .. don\u2019t feel like you are missing out as your are simply protecting your money . Remember it\u2019s your money people love to brag\nAbout their gains no one mentions  how much they lost so be cautious and take calculatedRisks . Most folks who have been investing for the past 5-10 year have seen insane growth and there will be profit taking so keep that in mind as well.",
