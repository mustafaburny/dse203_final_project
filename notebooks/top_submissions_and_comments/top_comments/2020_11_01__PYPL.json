See the earnings call for IDXX, revenue growth and vet visits are actually positive this year because despite the restrictions... people still care about their pets and more people WFH = more first time pet owners\n\nLYV: What I learned is that most people don't care about social distancing and are ok with packing a venue to watch concerts and sports again. So many of the mom and pop shop venues are probably going to close due to $0 cash flow this year. As long as LYV can make it out alive until restrictions are lifted... the only competitor in there way will be pretty much AEG and they can continue its pre-COVID momentum. Warning... the stock hasn't dropped a lot for a company that is in a cash crunch and has +95% revenue decrease, which surprises me. E\nWhat won't surprise me if the stock drops to $20 - $45 and I'll be a buyer.\n\nV and MA: Should also accelerate growth once a vaccine is available and transactions are lifted. They should recover a big chunk of their spending volume and cross-border fees, but I think business travel is permanently impaired. Right now I'm a V holder, but I like PYPL a bit more as my favorite fintech.",
