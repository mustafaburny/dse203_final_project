Everyone else is Nokia, Motorola,  Kyocera etc.  functional products that don't make a mark.    \nContinuing the analogy, in 15 years lots of people will be driving Walmart tracfones cuz it makes no difference to them.  \n\n\nMost of problems we've discussed will be solved.   \n\n\nIt's fun to think about what that might look like   \n\n\nFor a while charging station growth will be insane but once EV's reach 80% penetration charging stations will be less important,  as everyone has one at home.  You visit the in-laws, \"hey,  I need to charge my car for the drive back\"  \n\n\nIt will be a problem for apartment dwellers for a while but then it becomes a problem for apartment managers as charging stations  become an amenity.   \n\n\nEVs also change the math on  renewable energy.   \n\n\nWind and solar and storage are just becoming competitive with  grid  power at $.12/KWH.   But what if i can charge twice that at a service area on f I80 in Iowa? Now a 10 acre solar farm looks pretty good.   \n\n\nLike the internet, some things we saw, some things we didn't.  \n\n\nWe figured online shopping might be good for carriers  But not many people expected USPS  to delver Amazon on Sundays or Amazon to buy a fleet of trucks.  \n\n\nThis is gonna' be a wild ride.",

Paid $1k for two Samsung Galaxy S2s when they were brand-new.\n\nFast-forward several years, I'm finding that I need to replace my Android phones constantly. Not just due to negligence (my wife treats her phones like they grow on trees), but they just STOP WORKING the way they're supposed to. Meanwhile, all of my friends have iPhones that are 5-6 years old and still work fine.\n\nI finally say fuck it and buy two iPhones. HUGE upgrade. Better camera, better battery, smoother experience overall. Again, I'm not a mac guy at ALL. But I'm 100% in on iPhones now. They're worth the high price tag.\n\nDisclosure: I bought AAPL at something like $95 after it split 7:1 many years ago because my smooth brain figured that a price tag under $100 would be appealing to the masses. And guess what...it was.",

They have asked a court to stay litigation pending a settlement.  Make free money before the stock is halted or news release is put out.  You can see the court docket here:\nhttps://insight.rpxcorp.com/litigation/ilndce-361383-wi-lan-v-motorola-mobility\n\nOthers are highlighting that this is likely only made possible as Apple has agreed to a license as well and this will be an industry wide license.\n\nTodd Coupland has a $6 price target if there is a positive resolution here.  So you make FREE MONEY waiting for the Motorola announcement and a potential quick double.\n\nThis guy who broke the news on the Motorola settlement on stockhouse has been pounding the table highlights that this is worth a Billion total on a stock worth $300M.  Implying a quadruple from here.  He has been right every step along the way.  He has over $2 million invested in the stock.\n\nhttps://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard?symbol=t.qtrh&amp;postid=33912385\n\nThis stock has a history of going parabolic\u2026 and very quickly.
