If you picked CRSR instead, you be down to $4,200. \n\nIt's a loser stock.\n\nThey don't compete in the business space, and instead of expanding to console gamers they are going after a much smaller market by targeting content creators with Elgato. They just lost an appeal about the patent for their controllers (SCUF), potentially losing a moat there. Lian Li seems to have overtaken Corsair as the \"go to\" brand for cases and fans. \n\nI say this as Corsair fanboy. I got 4x LL140s and 2x LL120s in my 280x Crystal case, the MSI/Corsair 1080ti, the K95 platinum keyboard, the MM80 RGB mouse pad, and the ST50 headphone stand.\n\nI love Corsair's stuff. But I don't like their stock.",

People might buy one apple device, but there is now way they will buy 2 since the iPhone and iPod are so similar.  They will have other tech devices.",
