The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**\n\n \nShort Attack:\n\n1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n\n\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n\n\n3. Spread disinformation through \"analysis\" to get people to sell their stocks because \"the fundamentals aren't there\". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n\n\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.\n\n\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n\n\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n\n\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don't exist to scare us. They don't know our apps don't even have a sell button, only a liftoff button for the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19 \ud83c\udf14 \ud83c\udf16 \ud83c\udf1b \ud83c\udf1c \ud83c\udf15",

I\u2019m tired of the bullshit, you\u2019re tired of the bullshit, were all tired of the bullshit, including everyone of the working class that aren\u2019t even in GME, BB, NOK, BBBY, and AMC. There is so much universal disgust with Wall Street that the likes of AOC, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump Jr. Ro Khanna, Ted Lieu, and Robert Reich all agree that what we saw yesterday is blatant market manipulation.\n\nWe need to get the word out that the Short-Sale Rule is already a precedent of regulation by the SEC. If you don\u2019t know what it is, click here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp)\n\nWe need to get the word out that the SEC has the power to implement SSR on all our favorite stonks right now. Twitter, instagram, Reddit, and directly contacting your local congressional representatives and senators and demand that the SEC immediately enforce the SSR to prevent continued market manipulation. WSB is not political but both sides of congress are on our side right now and we absolutely cannot let this crucial moment slip to get the justice we deserve after yesterday.\n\nIf you do not know who your congressional representative is, click here: [https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)\n\nYou can use the following when they take your comment:\n\n**\"I strongly urge congress to call on the executive branch and the SEC to implement and enforce the Short-Sale Rule on heavily shorted stocks to protect retail investors.\"**\n\nSay whatever else you want, but that is the key phrase that needs to be used. I also mentioned that this is currently charging up a tremendous amount of distrust in American markets that has the potential to devastate our economy on the world stage.\n\nWe are on the edge of glory and we have the numbers to push their hand and get the entire country behind this to prevent the abusive short ladder attacks we\u2019ve been seeing all week.\n\nGET THE FUCKING WORD OUT. I like this stock way too much to not see it grow up and reach its full potential because of billionaire hedge funders strategically unwinding their positions through a series of short ladder attacks instead of letting the squeeze play on as it would in a truly free market.\n\nFeel free to copy/paste this and spread it through the subreddit for all to see.\n\nAnd don\u2019t fucking forget............ \ud83d\udc8e FUCKING \ud83d\udd90 \ud83e\udd1a\n\nGME TO ALPHA CENTAURI \ud83d\ude80",

In the app, go to More... \u25ba Settings and Profile \u25ba Quick Access \u25ba Turn on Watch Lists &amp; Real Time Quotes. This feature is turned off by default and means Fidelity has a 15 minute delay on live ticker prices.\n\n\u2705 - Activate \u201cExtended Hours Trading\u201d. This allows you to trade on the markets before and after close for a set amount of extended time. To do so, you HAVE to be on the Fidelity website. Search in the top right hand search corner \u201cExtended Hours Trading\u201d and pick the article titled exactly that. Walk through the process to enable it. Others are saying to call Fidelity. Don\u2019t. Customer service simply walks you through how to do it on your own from the Fidelity website. \n\n\u2705 - Rate Robinhood a 1-2 on the app and playstore. \n\n\u2705 - Rate Fidelity a 3 or 4 on the app and playstore. 5 star customer service but they deliver a 2 star experience on their god awful UI. Let\u2019s do this to help convince Fidelity to modernize their brokerage app platform &amp; leave Robinhood in the dust. \n\n\u2705 - File complaints on Robinhood using SEC. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html)\n\n\u2705 - Class Action Lawsuits. If you believe you were negatively impacted by Robinhoods actions and believe you are entitled to compensation. Begin browsing r/ClassActionRobinhood for further information. Only sign up for the class action you believe has the strongest case. Don\u2019t sign up immediately either.
