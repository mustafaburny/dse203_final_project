        "body": "My 2 cents, conglomerates may have worked in the past but not in the present. Having multiple industries with little synergy between them can be interpreted as diversified income, but I view it as a lack of focus among the management team. Jack of all trades, master at none. It also introduces a lot of admin costs within the company.\n\nAs an example, Verisign. Only selling internet domains and management has laser focus on one industry. This shows up in their high margins",

And I was fortunate that at the time, I was fairly diversified and still accumulating so the draw-down that I experienced was quite recoverable and didn't have lasting impact. But I am sure that wasn't the same for everyone. \n\nIf you were fortunate to have chosen a stock that recovered quickly and continued to climb then that's great. But that was not true for many other high-flyers stocks. Cisco for example has never recovered from it's highs. Akamai has never come close to recovering. Microsoft took about 10-15 years to recover.  Verisign which was the hot cybersecurity stock or the day is now only starting to recover. And the broad market took a good 10-15 years to recover back to the same level. Also - don't forget the many companies that evaporated like [Pets.com](https://Pets.com), webvan, etoys, [agency.com](https://agency.com), Doubleclick.  These are just the ones that I remember because I either swing traded them or they were core holdings in my portfolio at the time. \n\nYup - EV and clean energy are part of my portfolio but I will continue to hedge and protect my hard-earned capital.",
