Having multiple industries with little synergy between them can be interpreted as diversified income, but I view it as a lack of focus among the management team. Jack of all trades, master at none. It also introduces a lot of admin costs within the company.\n\nAs an example, Verisign. Only selling internet domains and management has laser focus on one industry. This shows up in their high margins",

And I was fortunate that at the time, I was fairly diversified and still accumulating so the draw-down that I experienced was quite recoverable and didn't have lasting impact. But I am sure that wasn't the same for everyone. \n\nIf you were fortunate to have chosen a stock that recovered quickly and continued to climb then that's great. But that was not true for many other high-flyers stocks. Cisco for example has never recovered from it's highs. Akamai has never come close to recovering. Microsoft took about 10-15 years to recover.  Verisign which was the hot cybersecurity stock or the day is now only starting to recover. And the broad market took a good 10-15 years to recover back to the same level. Also - don't forget the many companies that evaporated like [Pets.com](https://Pets.com), webvan, etoys, [agency.com](https://agency.com), Doubleclick.  These are just the ones that I remember because I either swing traded them or they were core holdings in my portfolio at the time. \n\nYup - EV and clean energy are part of my portfolio but I will continue to hedge and protect my hard-earned capital.",

Got beaten down heavly + Corona. Just buying the recovery. Price Taget 5-6$\n\n**VIOT** 3% Viomi essentially is poor mans strategy to get a slice of xiaomi. Their market is mainly china. I think people underestimate smart home product market in china by a lot. Price target is kind of dynamic here, its hard to pin down. Its definitly cheap tho.  \n   \n**XERS** 5% My first real biotech stock. This is not just random biotech investing. I read every study and sec filing. I also used to be in the industry. Kinda hard to value imo they can achieve 30-40% market share. That would imply a future P/E of 3-4 at current market price levels + Value of the pipline, which looks great.**TL.DR.** They make and EpiPen equivalent for Hypoglycemia and it works great. Price taget 12-14$ for approved product alone achieving 30% market share in \\~ 3-5 years +  \n\n\n  \n**VRSN** 10% (I hold a deep in the money LEAP)  \nDunno why it is so cheap. Onlything that can hurt VRSN is a lot of inflation. They make money for every domain registered and can now increase prices again by 7% a year, what will translate into pure profit. Price taget 240$.  \n**FOG.MU** 13% Signature AG homepage is only in German. They basicly offer a service for get listed, raising capital and also do \"angel investing\". The stock is really underfollowed and cheap as hell on every metric. But so illiquid that 34% drawdown days are not unusual. I wouldnt buy it again. Its so small and has a lot of \"key-man-risk\".",
