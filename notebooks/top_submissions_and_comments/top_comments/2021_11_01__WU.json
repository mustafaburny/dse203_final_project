They have shifted product mix away from smartphone chips (low margin) to more tablets and auto industry screens (higher margin). These are growing segments with significantly higher margins. Both segments growing significant double digits YoY while smartphone chip sales decreased single digits.\n\nThey've also secured long term supply agreements for customers (for a fee and guaranteed minimum quantities) in addition to being paid fees to procure/guarantee capacity for non-customers for certain technologies.\n\nThey are also in the VR space and make boatloads on Smart TV stuff (Smart TV industry wide is projected to grow at 16% CAGR) and touchscreen display stuff.\n\nAdditional bear case: Wu brothers don't care about shareholders blah blah blah.\n\nCounter: Historically they pay out 75% of net profit as a dividend as is incentivized in the Taiwan tax structure.\n\nAnother Bear Case: China/Taiwan relations get significantly worse (or China straight goes to shit). Himax is a Taiwanese company with a lot of their customers and suppliers in China.\n\nhttps://www.himax.com.tw/investors/\n\nAs of\u00a0today\u00a0(2021-11-05), Himax Technologies's share price is\u00a0$11.45.

        "body": "You clearly haven't been paying attention to the amount of institutional money coming into the market. BTC already had a 50% correction this year and bounced right back.\n\nOr the continued adoption worldwide of bitcoin and crypto currency. Smart money follows smart money and all the banks and funds are starting to get into crypto, hence why it's still early. With more money comes more stability, as we're starting to see. You would actually have to follow BTC metrics to understand this though. \n\nThere's going to be a massive supply shock, that's why everyone even the big players are accumulating. This will bring financial freedom to billions of people worldwide who don't have access to bank accounts, let alone appreciable assets. More countries will continue to adopt BTC as legal tender and benefit from it as well. El Salvador has already invested $13M profits into schools, and there are more people with a BTC wallet than a bank account. No longer will people in the 2nd/3rd world be held hostage by Western Union fees, or INSANE inflation rates.\n\nYou're thinking very close mindedly, I of course know it's a volatile space because of the timing but it's also the perfect time for a retail investor to take advantage. I've also been taking profits on the way up just as I would with any stock. Whether you like it or not, I've done my research on crypto, believe in it, found the value, bought low and made my way to amazing gains both realized and unrealized. How are your negative yielding bonds doing? How about gold? Tech is the future, defi will be a huge portion of the tech industry. There's trillions of dollars of negative yielding bonds in the market, that's trillions of dollars looking for the next best store of value and guess what everyone's buying.\n\nNot financial advice, I definitely wouldn't take any advice from anyone on this sub here otherwise I wouldn't have these gains.

S&amp;P 500/total market/world etfs are considered lower risk with long term gains. \n\nI personally don\u2019t think it adds value to do FCF valuations, capm, etc for my own personal investments. I think about the industry, future and where the company would fit in (eg I would be more comfortable that Google/big tech will have a role than western union/ other industries that I could see a future without), certainty the company will be around (Is it well known? What are the competitive adv/barriers to entry), how reasonable is the valuation to be at a high level (Amazon is massive and makes a ton of money, where tsla seems way too hyped up).\n\nAs far as buying things that I use, well, my biggest single holding in a company is Amazon, and I use it all the time plus I grocery shop at Whole Foods. I got in awhile ago, I\u2019m crazy about Whole Foods (used to own that before it got acquired haha)and it\u2019s done really well. If it\u2019s a well established company that you love, then go for it. If it\u2019s more niche like Tata, don\u2019t go as big in your investment. I\u2019ve had a few similar investments and they all did bad haha.\n\nFacebook and snap seem too trendy personally, social media companies get swapped out for others too often for me. Microsoft/apple, probably safe and not going anywhere. Netflix.. hard to say as a long term hold as there are so many other good streaming services.\n\nI stick to mostly etfs, but do have a lot of other things I picked up that I think are good plays. At the end of the day will I beat the market? Lmao who knows, but the big thing here is I am investing and I\u2019m gonna make money. It may not be the most efficient use of money but you\u2019ll never quite know if it is unless you dedicate your job to it and even then it\u2019s hard to say. People like jayz and \u201cinsert other rich person here\u201d started with a lot of money from income/trust fund and made a lot of money off that. Would they have been better off with the s&amp;p? Not sure. They also have the advantage of investing in companies earlier on I would think like a vc/angel/peg and can create value in different ways.",

As an experiment, go buy some, find a friend in a different country, and send them a digital asset that has value, which they can either spend directly or convert into fiat and spend. Then try to do the same thing via wire transfer, western union, etc. and tell me which is easier, more convenient, and cheaper. There is almost no comparison.\n\nAs another experiment, go take something you own (e.g. physical gold, your car, etc.) and try to use it as collateral to take out a loan to buy something. Then do the same thing using Bitcoin. You can take out a loan in USD using Bitcoin as collateral with an interest rate of 5%. The entire process from beginning to end (including signing up for the service) takes about 5 min. They don't ask for verifying documents, paystubs, income verification, or anything; that money you requested is in your possession in seconds because the Bitcoin you give them is perfect collateral that they know is good and they know they can liquidate in a heartbeat if you don't make your payments.\n\nWith regard to governments shutting it down, they can't shut down cryptocurrency networks anymore than they were able to shut down torrents for pirated media. Read examples of what has happened when authoritarian countries tried to ban crypto so they could continue to manipulate their currencies to their benefit at the expense of their citizens; they failed miserably.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/31/out-of-control-and-rising-why-bitcoin-has-nigerias-government-in-a-panic](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/31/out-of-control-and-rising-why-bitcoin-has-nigerias-government-in-a-panic)\n\nCryptocurrencies are here to stay and are only going to get more valuable. As has been the case, as time passes, the rate at which they will become more valuable will only increase. Yes, they are very volatile because they are free market products and no governments are propping them up, but their trajectory is set. The sooner you accept this, the better off you will be. I wish you the best of luck.",

He was a Serbian-American engineer, inventor and physicist who made scores of breakthroughs in the development, transmission and application of electric power. He is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.\nNikola invented the first motor with alternating current and developed technology for AC generation. In late 1886, He met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. Based on Nikola's new ideas for electrical equipment, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887.

You do not touch the higher levels of investing until you have a firm understanding and success at the lower. \nThe lowest level is ETF investing, easy to learn easy to toss money at and make returns. Also builds a strong base to work from\n\n The 2nd is individual stock, once you really learned to analyze investment data. You can also work on the emotional side of your investments in this area like not panicking during a selloff or becoming to elated in your gains not to sell.\n\nThe 3rd level is learning the various trading options such as limits, stop losses and margins. Really it can be bundled into the 2nd BUT these things are generally more important for traders rather Investors.\n\nFinally we get to options, if you don't have a firm grasp and decent experience with the above then you need to stay the hell away from options. They are the ultimate trap to newbie investors who see dipshits on WSB gambling away there entire savings. HOWEVER, a reasonable experienced investor whom can make sound decisions in there investments in the previous level can  infact benefit from limited option trading (can never recommend an all in). \n\nI for one am sitting on some delicious AMD 87.5 leap calls that don't expire til next June. I felt they were a reasonable investment as the XLNX merger was already know.",

Right now the gap is continuing to widen and all of the major tech pushes in semiconductors right now need lower power consumption. PCs dominated the sector for decades but in 2018 you could see that era was coming to an end. PCs are the only area we\u2019re intels 10 nm process node competes. By the time 7 nm is in production tsm will have released 3 nm. A few years ago intel was only one process node behind but now they are 2.\n\nMaybe the best example of this is my best friend who is not an engineer owning a ton of intel he bought the upward swing of the dip in 2019 and got it for 48. I convinced him to rotate that position into Amd and the best way to do that was xlnx based on price ratio of the two. He was able to get out at 57. He made 18.75% holding a stock for two years during one of the most historic bull runs ever and even an order of magnitude more historic for semiconductor stocks. He rotated all of it into xlnx at 120 and in a few months is up 79%. The delta between Amd price appreciation and intel might not always be that crazy and that fast but for the next two or so years I think most semiconductor stocks will outpace intel gains wise.",

Xilinx stock is at 191 and by far not a peanuts company.  AMD stock is still cheap compared to what it will be in 5 years or less.  Qualcomm is having big gains too.  I have all three plus others and my gains today is damn close to orgasmic.",

        "body": "There\u2019s more to it than just thinking it will hit my  call price. If the stock is at $100, I can buy $140 (or higher/lower, this is just an example) and if the stock goes up I can earn money along the way. Once your option is \u201cin the money (ITM)\u201d your options gain faster. A common strategy is to buy Leaps, which are a year or two out or more (expiration date). Do this with solid companies and look at their performance, price targets, etc. AMDs price target has, mostly, been pushed some where between $130-150. So I bought $130 calls when the price was around $125 (they\u2019ve crushed earnings all year and had big runs the last two ERs). I\u2019ve been in and out of calls with this stock for the past year+. There\u2019s a macro play with merger coming. This is not about gambling. It\u2019s knowing the stock, fundamentals, and preparing accordingly. Fully expect this to run more post-merger with Xilinx. Then will take it from there. Hope this helps.",

        "body": "&gt; And what use case are we seeing for these besides Shors algorithm? A probabilistic computer is not good for almost all the problems we have to solve today, so beyond needing one to help with your cryptography, what is the use case for the market? \n\nI've yet to understand why shor's algorithm even gets mentioned - Seemingly only around hype articles and investing spaces. I'm guessing because it's easy for the layman to understand the nature of the result: \"you get a prime factors and someone told me they're important to encryption\" that's *technically* true for one nature of encryption but absolutely false for symmetric encryption like AES-256. Now we do have Grover's algorithm which reduces the solve space of AES-256 to AES-64 but that's arguably marginal gain because of a dirty \"secret\". Quantum computers don't run as fast as classical computers, there isn't as many processing cycles per second on even the best machines so when you see only quadratic gains in solve time, forget it. It's exponential or bust because of this slow down that you have to overcome.\n\nPhysicists like me want them for simulating quantum physics. I know, pretty meta, but that's our motivation and frankly everything else is just frosting. You need 2^N bits on a classical computer or N qbits, the choice is easy. I believe a lot of \"killer apps\" could simply be built in this benefit of 2^N unitary matrix multiplication resulting in 2^N exponential speed up and 2^N state space.\n\nThe \"probablistic\" nature of these algorithms is already accounted for in the solve time. Circuits are developed so that \"incorrect\" solutions are attributed with both positive and negative probabilities so while your state space is 2^N, your output is completely deterministic and repeatable.\n\nMore tangibly I'd point out computational chemistry which leads into biology and pharmaceuticals.\n\nYou will be able to simulate high-temperature superconductors; the active sites of enzymes containing metal complexes or radicals, photovoltaic materials and inorganic catalyst behavior. Anything that needs precise modeling of electron orbitals is impossible to do classically. Projects like folding@home are monuments to how bad classical computers are at computational chemistry. It's tough to simulate anything without assumptions and simplifications that interfere with your results on a classic machine.\n\nOne example is how the transcription of genetic information encoded in DNA is regulated by histone proteins which exist in a regime where the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down. This forces you to calculate for every electron spin state in the system. Just the Fe ion has 151 electrons and 121 spatial orbitals and that's only one of nine catalytic steps to understanding gene switching. Enter quantum computers\n\nAnother example is how telomerase replenishment is significant to our understanding of stem cell maintenance, aging, and cancer treatment. Quantum computing would have advantage in simulating the catalytic active centers and preserve fidelity during the extension process. This is because the process relies on nucleobase pairing.\n\n \n&gt; noise problem\n\nAs for your purported \"noise problem\" I genuinely don't know what you're talking about. The world record for two gate fidelities, state prep, measurement and entanglement are all beyond acceptable for commercial use today, if someone used noise as an excuse... they used it as a buzz word to wave away impatient investors. The papers that have come out for QEC on logical qbits proves as much. It's getting increasingly frustrating watching companies flail in the space and spread disingenuous quantum hype and quantum excuses to pump their stocks up and while I'm not going to name names, they're everywhere and I hope they're self evident to the critical eye. Look for the humble, steady releases on arxiv.org not the \"we just made a computer 10 million times faster at everything but you can't independently benchmark it yet\" articles.\n\nIt's not the next Fitbit or iPhone, that's for sure but computing is shaping the future and specialized compute units have consistently been the answer. Look how Important companies like Intel, AMD and Nvidia are and they spend a lot of time just making specialized graphics cards, Xilinx just makes FPGA's and Bitfury, ASICS.\n\nWe're rapidly seeing cloud accessible commercial systems that are being leveraged by multiple industries to calculate the solutions to everyday problems. I would bet the first \"wow\"problem  will be chemistry based but it could be natural language processing, logistics, cryptology, or something unexpected. This isn't a video game, these research problems aren't time fungible so I can't possibly know which one will break through first.\n\nI guess my thesis would be, \"don't bet against this technology evolving and improving exponentially\"",

NVDA I think is riding a bigger tail wind from crypto, and IMO is more priced to perfection (disclosure they are above my sell target price), but they have done a good job with software offerings that are quite profitable too.\n\nAll the analysis from Fidelity etc say INTC is undervalued and a buy while they say stay away from AMD.

For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

        "body": "Purchasing shares to cover a short position can work, but it can also work against you. It's a very capital-intensive way to cover the position in any case. I've done it before both successful and not. A more capital-efficient way of doing this is cover the short with a deep ITM long option or a ZEBRA. I prefer ZEBRAs, especially long-dated.\n\nYou are always going to get a lot of sanctimonious knee-jerk responses about selling calls from people who have no idea what they are talking about. As someone who has sold naked calls for years, it's risky and it's a lot harder to make money than by put-selling. There's also a lot of value to balanced delta in my opinion. \n\nMost of the time lately they are either challenged or at an unrealized loss, but rarely ITM, depending on your entry delta. You usually get a month or two out of the year where they are the only thing that pays. It's easy to not be stupid about it. Don't trade meme stocks and don't sell 400 naked puts on a $20K account. The last few months have been rough, because a lot of stuff is up significantly more than volatility had priced in. Vol is just way under priced right now. I have strangles on MSFT, CVS, WMT and XRT that have all blown way past my short call strike. I'm inverted on all of them. At the same time, a lot of stuff has tanked and gone way past my short put strikes.",
