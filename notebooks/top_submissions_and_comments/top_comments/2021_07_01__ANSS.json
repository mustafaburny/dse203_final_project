Several have big histories with Google, Ford, and Ansys.  No way they are working for chump change. They must see big things ahead for their options.",

But if you take a look at MVIS videos of their consumer Lidar point cloud. Ol even that looks better than Tesla point cloud. And the LRL is gen 5 version of that",

It's a great launching point for an Azure upsell, further entrenching their stickyness in workflows.",
