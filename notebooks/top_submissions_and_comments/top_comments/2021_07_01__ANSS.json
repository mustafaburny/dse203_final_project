You can't solve every problem by throwing money at it. If you're coming in to a field 10 or 20 years behind in research, just being big doesn't mean you're going to catch up in tech just like that. Look at what happened to IBM in the face of upstarts like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.\n\nEven if big companies can fund their own research later, that will put them a decade or more behind. Meanwhile, another big energy competitor could buy up several successful startups and quickly become the dominant player. So like with tech startups, the big players won't be looking for discounts, they'll just wait to see who makes the best proven breakthroughs and then compete with each other to acquire the best tech first.",

Speaking of which consider Ford going public in '56, look at all those decades of building up before going public. Or IBM over 100 years ago. \n\nSo profitability, being so young its all about scaling up and expanding their facilities. Any money is being used to make them more competitive. They believe they can do that by building a larger rocket which will broaden their capabilities. They will be receiving a 750million dollar cash injection. 200 of which will be going to designing and building the next rocket [Neutron ](https://youtu.be/agqxJw5ISdk). Give them room to screw up and lets put it at 250. The rest of the money could go to a number of things. Building a launch pad in New Zealand for Neutron, they have a deal to use the existing launch pad in Wallops, Virginia. They could build three more Neutron rockets, you could have a fleet. Cycling one out and brining in a new improved model throughout the years. They also have their own unique satellite bus built in-house, [Photon](https://youtu.be/LAUj-TQpn-A). First it delivers the payload of other satellites, but it's also open to configuration. I hope they have plans on scaling that up for the Neutron.  They are currently generating revenue, but no they are not cash flow positive, they hope to reach  that in a couple years.\n\nSustainable, as a private company they made it through the global recession of 08(I know that's a weak point). Their still acquiring more partners as they continue to develop their product. For instance BlackSky started by launching their prototype with another launch provider, but now they have multiple launches contracted with Rocketlab. \nThis is still a young industry, if the speculation about mining in space comes true, I believe they will be well positioned for that market. In the mean time it's all about satellites. I think we're at a crossroads, the infrastructure on a large scale could be changed. Do we continue laying and maintaining ground lines to connect everyone on the network? Or do we launch a bunch of satellites and change so everyone goes back to putting a dish on their roof? Or Winnebago, and have internet in the middle of nowhere?\n\nScaleable, I've already hinted towards scalability with a fleet of larger rockets. Possibly larger satellite busses. But it's space, so I want you to use your imagination and think if it's scalable.",

They are not cars, they are hardware with software licenses that are only profitable if you count the pollution credits sold.

The chip shortages have made them focus on high end models, I kinda doubt they will start the base model production given the profitable high end models will bring. I see the brands that you know selling higher end, and coach built super high end cars. Once the patents begins to expire, we will see Chinese cars flood the low end with of the shelf tech. I am in on Nio and researching the Chinese makes that are actually producing and selling cars today. I liken it to the IBM computer \u201cclones\u201d of the \u201880\u2019s.

China has super factories that you can order any number of scooters, at any price point based on the quality of the parts specified, then slap your model name in them.

Also IBM is at least a couple of years ahead in its hardware scaling.

But I'd strongly suggest looking at the holdings; oil companies, AT&amp;T, IBM, lots of riffraff has high dividends but they could easily have low/negative real return over the next 10+ years.\n\nSkimming the top 10 holdings of each - I'd go with VDADX over VHYAX. Dividend appreciation, dividend aristocrats, usually good choices. Even taking a stock like AAPL for example - if you bought it in 2013, you'd have a 5% dividend yield on your original investment ($13/share back then, $0.60 dividend now). If you bought XOM in 2013 in the $80s, you'd only be making about 4% on your original investment. In terms of total return, again you'd be better off with AAPL by a long shot.

You can equate pets.com to companies like NKLA which make gravity powered trucks. NKLA was ~ 30B market cap at its peak -- and it's still worth 5B+\n\nThat kinda helps my point though. NKLA tanked but it has no correlation to the overall stock market, and the whole stock market went up in fact. Same with the entire SPAC bubble. Yes it was a bubble, but it popped and the market moved on its way without missing a beat. \n\n&gt; The \"real\" megacap tech companies of 2000 were hewlett packard, microsoft, ibm, csco, intel, sun, compaq, etc. Their P/E ratios are much closer to the FAANGs of today. And most of the peak P/E ratios happened after a series of bad earnings.\n\nEven then the PE ratios are not the same. MSFT in it's peak in 1999 had a PE ratio of ~82, it now has a PE ratio of ~35. \n\nI'm not gonna say that *every* company today is fine. Many are not (including NKLA). But the 2000 was endemic throughout the market (i.e. say \"internet\" and stock 10x'd at ipo). Today the market is much more varied and plenty of companies trading at high multiples do so because they're growth is very real.\n\nSorta unrelated but I personally believe tech got an insane boost from covid which is/will be driving huge digitalization efforts and  accelerate growth for many saas/cloud centric companies.",

        "body": "Sort of. Anyone can make an android device. Only apple can make iOS devices. We saw how this played out in the PC space already - anyone could make a windows computer. 75% of the market now is Android. Apple is regaining small market share but it's just a cyclical oscillation that occurs due to all the other platforms dropping to zero in the last couple years. E.g. if 5% of Android users decide to give iPhone a try and 10% of iPhone users decide to switch to Android, iPhone still gains market share when it's far enough behind (so you get the feedback effect we see now).\n\nThe problem with closed platforms is they will eventually find themselves behind. There are just too many competitors - it's Apple vs. the world. Wearables, automotive, VR, AI capabilities... there are tons of ways the landscape is going to change in the next 10 years and it's highly likely Apple finds itself behind. Camera upgrades and poo emojis can only get you so far - eventually people don't need your new product.\n\nApple also charges a fee to develop apps. It's free on Android. On Android you can bypass the app store easily and download any app, even from a web address, on iOS it is a massive pain (we see this with fortnite).\n\nAlso we are at peak phones now - I only see downward pressure on margins due to the competition. Apple cannot get away with such high margins anymore - the only reason we don't see that (their margin is only slightly falling) is because they've added all these other high margin business to offset it (i.e. their services they've expanded in the last couple years). The reality is they're losing margin on their phones and they won't be able to hide that in their numbers forever (they certainly tried when they changed their reporting two years ago).\n\nSo those are my concerns with Apple. I always felt their original PE ratio was correct. Once Buffet got in on them they experienced PE expansion which is irrational IMO and I predict will correct itself at some point.\n\nThat's my opinion anyway. I think the market is really messed up right now based on bad speculation.\n\nFor reference, I'd say IBM, INTC, AAPL, and MSFT should be way closer in terms of PE than they actually are. Something more in line with reality would be IBM -&gt; 10, INTC -&gt; 14, AAPL -&gt; 18, MSFT -&gt; 22. MSFT and especially AAPL sitting at 30+ is just ridiculous, as is IBM hovering around 25. I don't think INTC is priced that unreasonably but it is compared to everything else right now.\n\n&gt; I have used both android and other OS's and I have found Apple to be the most easy for my work and personal life\n\nThis was true years ago.

        "body": "Nothing too technical or a complex trading strategy but I have been working in Finance for over 15 years so I have a bit of experience.\n\nEssentially I follow 20-30 stocks like a hawk, adding and removing stocks from this list. I know these companies in and out. Then I wait for a dislocation in the stock and or a sell off in the market. Once this happens I buy call LEAPs at least one to two years out, waiting for mean reversion and or whatever catalyst I believe takes place. Most importantly, I trim gains along the way up by setting specific targets. Thus at 20% gain I sell X amount of position, 50% x amount of position etc etc. This protects my gains even though does limit a bit of my upside but found this to be important in locking in gains before they all erode. Especially in options. IE earlier this year CEO of VWM left for INTC, VMW was crushed by over 15% for a stock that barely moves. That was an easy play knowing there was a dislocation and the stock soldoff based on their CEO leaving which really didn't matter since the company is essentially controlled by Dell. Then I bought calls on VMW, stock went back to previous levels and I trimmed at 40% and 70% initially then let the rest ride. Ended up closing my position a few weeks later for a bit over 60% gain in about 3 months by using target goals I set myself for each position and play.\n\nDoesn't mean I am always invested all the time, I patiently wait for the right opportunities but do sit in higher cash position than most before striking. Currently 40% cash as markets are a bit frothy.\n\nHave had excellent returns with this approach but it took time to develop and learn through my experiences.",

They have improved, but are still a ways behind.\n\nTheir CPUs are really good right now and Intel are floundering. That said they are still hampered because most current software isn't very good at multi threading so single core performance is important, especially for gaming, and Intel are competitive there. They are eating Intel in data centers though.\n\nThe big thing for me is that AMD have a runway - theyre still behind but have better CPUs and the data centre uptake is very bullish. Supply could become an issue here, because the big data centre players won't want to wait or to overpay. But assuming adequate supply there should be noticeable growth in the data center side, and of course GPU supply constraints mean that they will continue to sell as many as they make.",

The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD. \n\nA plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and \"5G-cloudification\" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI &amp; tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM &amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China's Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.",

The RISC architecture has advantages over CISC architecture which we are observing right now and/or will observe in the near future. And these can't be undone, worked over, or something else. Every x86/x64 processor developed today can run programs written 30-40 years ago, while a company like Apple can come and say screw that, we start from scratch. This and other issues in the x86 architecture make it an (apparent at least) dead end. AMD is also offering a big competition to Intel, and in the server space there is also big competition.

Also, they are pivoting to industrial automation - have bought robotics companies that past few years. The CEO wants automation revenue to become the largest source of revenue for the company so they can move beyond the boom-bust cycles in Semi's.",

Every % improvement of performance per watt makes a huge difference when you have millions of machines. After Intels problems with performance and vulnerabilities, datacenters / cloud platforms learned that they need to diversify a bit and have rapidly introducing AMD based servers. \n\nWhile I do think Intel will fix their issues and is still valuable, in terms of pure growth, it seems like AMD has more potential as datacenters are diversifying to use more AMD. I guess the main risk is if AMD can keep up with demand.\n\nWhat I'm more interested in is Intels venture into ARM based chips.",

Intel has needed an engineering leader for a while and they\u2019ve only had finance and sales guys.\n\nYou are counting out Intel based on their record of past failures over the last decade. However, my belief is that their execution and product line are going to improve drastically over the next couple years.\n\nThere\u2019s room in the market for both TSM and Intel on the fab side. There\u2019s a massive shortage in semiconductor capacity. Everything is going to need high performance chips in ten years. Current investments by TSM and Intel are just a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed to create capacity to meet future demand. So it\u2019s not a zero sum market between TSM and Intel.\n\nAMD vs Intel vs ARM is a bigger threat \u2026 however, people underestimate what Intel\u2019s server group has cooking. Here also I think x86 with Intel cores will reign supreme for some high value work loads. Having said that, I think it\u2019s unavoidable that ARM based VMs are going to swallow a lot of low end cloud compute. We tested AWS ARM VMs for many work loads and they were an absolute win on a cost adjusted basis. Intel will have to do some serious work to stop that drift.\n\nAlso, having my dev machine as an ARM Mac instead of an x86 MAc this year for the first time, means I\u2019m actually running ARM server binaries natively and x86 binaries under emulation, instead of vice versa which was the case in previous years.",

Its more moving parts in the future whereas we prefer less moving parts with current competitive advantage.\n\nNVDA is kicking AMD's ass inside out on GPU and hardware acceleration in datacentre/AI. We just have to accept it as it is. NVDA is something you should also look to get into when the price isnt so stupid. AMD is not NVDA though. Dont expect those price levels.

Intel's comments on \"chiplets glued together\"? Well those chiplets glued together are what allow AMD to make much better yields on smaller die sizes. When a wafer has an issue, you lose a lower portion of the wafer if you have smaller dies, or chiplets. So now AMD has several years lead on making chiplet designs talk to eachother faster or more efficiently.\n\nIntel is however throwing in the towel and going to pay for EUV by TSMC in 2023. AMD has advance plans for 2023 with TSMC anyway and think they are second customer behind Apple so should be on a more even playing field moving forward in 2023, with the advantage of maybe 5 years with infinity fabric and chiplet design instead of monolithic dies. However if EUV pellicles come good by then, monolithic dies may be better - cant tell.\n\nTrying to figure out short term moves with AMD is nuts. Just buy stock or leaps.",

The best thing Mr. Ishrak did was bring the pacemakers to market. So, let's say I want a personalized AI, that learns from me and continuously recalibrates for my unique body in real time. I'm gonna need Intel level computational support to run my implantable, like a pacemaker. The big problem Mr. Ishrak ran into in his life was that the pacemakers got hacked. So, bear with me, if I'm a theoretical whale, I can afford a badassed implant. 1) I'm wise enough to know I want it to be AI &amp; computationally gifted, super smart, and personalized. 2) I need that implant to be autonomous and never talk to the cloud for security reasons, as if my health data goes public or gets hacked, it can be used to tank my stonk, or kill me, or in the case of a world leader, bring political turmoil. I'd like to see CPUH go visionary and make a chip on chip neuromorphic device that is implantable.

Right now most LEAPs are for January 2023, and I think we'll see some January 2024s coming out in the next few months.\n\nWith the synthetic long, you should aim for as far out into the future as possible. This allows ample time for your investment thesis to play out (somewhat moot because you can roll indefinitely), and more importantly helps with taxes if you make gains on the long call (assuming USA here). No need to worry about the greeks in this strategy because the long call and short put offset the greeks on each other, but important to know your delta will come out to 1 after you buy the call and sell the put. Opening 1 of these positions with a delta of 1 means you are tracking the gains and losses of 100 shares. That's what gives this strategy the leverage it has, because you get a delta of 1 while sometimes getting paid to open the position.\n\nBuying a call does not take care of the collateral for the written put and this strategy will use some of your available margin. Most securities will require 30ish% collateral for the short put, and higher for more volatile securities. So in this instance, entering at the 55 strikes for INTC will require $1,650 of margin, but you'll receive $.10 credit with yesterday's prices. Compare that to the cost to buy 100 shares, which is about $5,600 today, so this is where the leverage shows.",

All the DDs written on here continue to ignore how important the Xilinx merger is. It was hated on by many, but Su Bae is no moron, she is strongly positioning AMD to dominate the CPU and Semi-Custom solutions. AMD will continue to make progress in the GPU and gaming market but the growth and tendies will come from expanding further into and dominating the server industry and building strong relationships that will establish profits for years, as well as expansion into 5g, aerospace and defense, and AI.",

Facebook was in trouble for collecting data without content too. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal? But now everyone is hot for FB stocks.\n\nMicrosoft has been fined millions by the EU for monopolistic practices as well. But everyone loves Microsoft stocks nonetheless. \n\nAnd as to Ant Group, they are a massive financial service company that can offer customers credit. How come they don't get to be regulated like a bank? My point is that these actions make sense and good regulations is beneficial for investors too in the long run.",

But I can\u2019t allocate so much of my portfolio in this company vs a FB/AMZN/GOOG (where I get growth, balance sheet safety, and moat)\n\nFrom here, if you want to get in on the action. You have to believe they do a few things\u2026\n1) surprise HEAVILY on revenue growth and forward guidance\n2) grow more into their cyber security suite of tools beyond just basic stuff like their widely used DDOS prevention (a ton of websites use them for this) and firewall \n3) Content delivery network investment trend continues and profit margins aren\u2019t competed away with bigger boys entering the game (ie GOOG, MSFT, AMZN)\n4) website speeds overwhelmingly determine ranking on google and mobile searches\n\nCloudflare and Fastly are the two more popular services for websites and apps to use as they offer ease of use to speed up website access for users and support to prevent website downtime. Folks have frequently complimented on how easy cloudflare is to use.",

It was the #1 company by marketcap in 2019 and march 2020.\n\nMoreover, It has never fallen out of the top 10 list for more than 20+ years even with failure of Ballmer, tech bubble crash, Nokia, etc. Now with the new ceo, I dont see it going out of the top 10 especially since it is so far ahead from #10 spot which is Alibaba at 600 billion market cap. (Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).\n\nBack in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.\n\nMicrosoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2012",

Tesla sells under 1% all vehicles worldwide but is somehow worth *more than all the other carmakers combined* because lots of people were buying Tesla stock and not because of any financial status of Tesla. dogecoin started LITERALLY as a joke but somehow was more valuable than companies like Ford Motors only because a ton of cash flowed into Dogecoin. this is all sheer insanity by traditional stock valuation guidelines. asset bubbles are nothing new, but Burry believes it's being exacerbated by passive investing. \n\n- Burry believes this situation of prices being based on cash flows is similar to what happened in the housing bubble, when multi-zillion Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) were being priced not by a reasonable estimate of their fair value but by cash-flows. \n\n- when flows reverse and lots of people want out of index funds, it will get ugly because so many stocks are linked/benchmarked to major stock indexes *including lower volume stocks*. consider VTI: the top holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson) might have a billion shares in total and hundreds of millions of dollars trading each day. but the smallest company stocks might have only a few million shares and a few million dollars trading each day. if too many people want to sell all at the same time, it will drive prices down sharply because these stocks are so often sold as a bundle/unit. as Burry puts it: \"The theater keeps getting more crowded, but the exit door is the same as it always was\"\n\n&gt;since the guy predicted 2007-2008 crash.\n\nhe also predicted the dot-com bubble.",

The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD. \n\nA plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and \"5G-cloudification\" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI &amp; tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM &amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit.
