        "body": "A few things, previous earnings blew up, JKS has been testing and pushing mid-high 70s on practically no catalyst. When it dropped after last earnings, it took almost 2 weeks to come down. It tested 76 last Monday. I'm expecting minimum 80 with a high of 100. Exit plan 400 shares at 80-85, and 100 shares to ride. This market is different than last earnings, but I think I might be pleasantly surprised if this keeps running after market open. Tbh, didnt follow ENPH or MAXN, so can't answer that. Also, I'm not an expert.",

Honestly, it's 20% of my portfolio, but that's just because it's tripled in value since I weighted it at around 12% a couple years ago. My only thought was that I would keep a 10% allocation for it if you're starting now. I love the returns I've gotten over the past year and a half, but I just also increase my exposure to clean energy through specific stocks that I either personally believe in or that I feel QCLN doesn't have enough exposure to. My only point was that QCLN's beta is pretty wild for an ETF, so I probably wouldn't make it more than 10% of your portfolio if you're trying to increase exposure to renewables unless, of course, you want the risk which at 22 is completely understandable. All renewable positions I hold are: QCLN, SPWR, ENPH, and CSIQ. really happy with SPWR and ENPH's performance so far, but I think CSIQ is the best value stock in the renewable sector right now so I'm holding it long-term.\n\nOverall, I think your portfolio kicks ass.

        "body": "Some background:\n\nMAXR is a company who specializes in delivering commercial overhead satellite imagery. They are considered to be an industry leader in this field. Multiple government agencies within the US Intelligence Community and the DOD have contracts with MAXR to deliver imagery. They had a change in leadership in 2019 after a rather nasty short report exposed some serious issues within the company, and the loss of their Worldview-4 satellite didn't help matters either. \n\nA few reasons to be bullish:\n\nThe CEO Daniel Jablonski - Since the new CEO took over in Jan 2019, the stock has gained more than 400%. The company was in massive debt, an issue which became his number one priority to fix. The leverage ratio is much improved since when he took over. Seeing as most of MAXR's clientele are government agencies, it's fitting that he has experience as a former naval officer. He knows his customer base, as does his board of directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors - Multiple members each with decades of experience within the US Government, DOD, IC etc. In particular, Gilman Louie was the founder of IN-Q-Tel, the first venture capital firm for the CIA. We recently added him to the BOD after the acquisition of Vricon, which will allow us to augment our imagery with 3D mapping capabilities.\n\nThe Upcoming Launch of Worldview Legion, a new satellite constellation - A better, more cost effective upgrade to the Worldview-3 satellite is going to allow for higher quality imagery to be captured much more often. Our current backlog is worth around $2.2 billion according to the most recent earnings report, and you can bet this number will significantly increase once Legion is in orbit - expected around Sep 2021. More details at [https://www.maxar.com/splash/it-takes-a-legion](https://www.maxar.com/splash/it-takes-a-legion) . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI advise you to do some digging and see for yourself! I seriously believe this is still a significantly undervalued company. Hope this helps! Now go get those tendies!",

IHL also reported that the number of chains adding stores in 2019 has increased 56%, while the number of closing stores has decreased by 66% in the last year.\"\n\nit should be noted that GME is closing between 400 and 450 stores though:\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/09/10/investing/gamestop-store-closures/index.html\n\ni've also looked at several stores that are within the \"specialty retail\" group:\n\nhttps://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_specialtyretail&amp;o=pc\n\nsorted by price-to-cash (P/C). a lot of them had great earnings in the last quarter, and many went up after. GME is the cheapest in the group in terms of P/C ratio, perhaps indicating a degree of upside\n\nfurther, MIK and BBW have earnings on dec. 3rd\n\nmaybe, *maybe*, completely guessing: their earnings might provide an indication of what will happen with GME on dec. 8, ah\n\nalthough, that should be combined with the fact that it's a console-release year, along with the fact that gaming is a massive and growing industry",

They belong in your retirement account and you check on them a few times per year.\n\nIf your source of income comes from working, you should be dedicating a portion of your paycheck to your retirement account - and a portion to your YOLO account.\n\nAs money shows up in your YOLO account, you light that fuse and pray for it to be a bottle rocket. If it explodes in your face, you wait until next payday. If it's a bottle rocket - you send 75% of those profits off to pasture (i.e. lock it up in a retirement account). The other 25% is a bonus bet you get to make, instead of having to wait for another paycheck.\n\nYou want to be playing with underlyings that are just stupid, volatile and wild. Super high IV when it's not earnings time. The ones that just make no sense, and they're swinging up and down violently every day. The more drama, the better. If you were betting on a horse, you don't want the big stud horse that everyone is betting on because the payout sucks. You want the horse that stopped in the middle of the last race to eat the shit on the ground from the horses in front of it. The one that has tourette syndrome. You want... the [Becky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFs9jLN4siQ&amp;ab_channel=dnasewell) version of a horse. You will have no damn clue where it's going, but it's going somewhere - and fast. It's the unexpected move.\n\nWhen you buy that cheap OTM, and Becky happens to pop off while she's carrying you in Geralds bucket - you're turning that $100 into $10k. Risk $100 to make $10k? Fuck yes, all day long. Except, you can't do it with just any stock. It needs to be a Becky stock. (Can someone make me a meme of this, please?) How do you find Becky stocks?
