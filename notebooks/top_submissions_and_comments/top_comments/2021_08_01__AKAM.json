        "body": "I'm am a CTO.  This.. absolutely this!\n\n'Serverless', edge computing is finally catching on.  Old school IT doesnt understand it but those that do, understand that you can reach world scale, amazing performance and on a dime in terms of operational costs.  For those that are unfamiliar, almost all of these companies provide a model where you can develop a product, get it out there with minimal capital costs and have almost all of it be operational costs that scale with the success of the product.  Infrastructure as a service is an intermediate step and is what AWS made its initial $ on.  Yet there are still folks with servers in centers or under their desk operated by individuals.  There are decision breakpoints the savvy execs look at of when to do which but there is no question in my mind the companies mentioned will win or be bought on the rise.\n\nFastly too has a great offering, unfortunately lost a few clients causing their earnings of late.\n\nCloudflare is my favorite as I see what they are doing to not just do a better job cheaper but also advance everything. This appeals to me in many ways, they were undervalued, have a solid structure in place and are pushing everything forward.  Hey if they get popular here, I wouldnt mind either ;)\n\nAkamai has sat on its cash cow for so long, they have the cash and ability to do big things but unless its an enterprise deal or third party through a cloud provider they rarely are part of the conversation.",

I'd be looking to buy a small position (no more than 1% of my portfolio). I see growth potential, however, I also think there is at least an equal chance that a competitor like Akamai will eat their lunch.  Please note that I generally think penny stocks should be avoided due to high failure rates among the underlying businesses and they are typically more difficult to evaluate than their more established peers..
