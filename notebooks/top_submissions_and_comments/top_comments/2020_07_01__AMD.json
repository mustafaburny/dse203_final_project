That said, Intel is still a household name, and they have a very aggressive marketing and licensing strategy.

        "body": "For 8 years, I worked at Intel as an electrical engineer designing circuits for the future manufacturing processes that Intel would be releasing 2-4 years into the future. There are literally thousands of MS and PhD engineers working on the myriad of challenges involved in making better computer chips. All the way from the design of the manufacturing tools, the amount of NAND gates in a library, the modeling and forecasting of dozens of transistor parameters, writing and supporting the simulation tools, to what I was doing designing and testing: analog circuits in a not yet stable manufacturing process. And hundreds of other challenges that each had teams from a few to a few dozen engineers trying to solve them. It's an insanely complex task. Most engineers working on any of these tasks are so specialized that they don't have any idea how to do the job of the engineers sitting a few aisles over. These engineers are 5-9 management layers below the CEO. Other companies operate the same way, it's just how chip design is done. \n\nIntel's main advantage over the last few decades was that it continuously had the most advanced manufacturing process, maintaining a 1-2 year lead over its closest competitors. However over the last ten years, TSMC has caught up and now overtaken Intel. This is mostly due to Intel's engineering struggles with it's last few manufacturing processes. These things spend half a decade in planning and development. Decisions were made years ago that they are now stuck with. \n\nYour points are all about top level management and I'm sure there's some truth to how important the CEO's decisions are, but I think Intel's current problems are primarily engineering problems with the manufacturing process. I sincerely doubt it's for lack of investment by CEOs. I think it's more likely that TSMC had better engineering talent and was able to do things more creatively that ended up wildly successful.  And surely some luck there too.\n\nAMD has been doing well with their architectures recently and they should get credit for that, but their architectures were always quite good, the thing holding them back was their process and what had been a disadvantage, with TSMC, is now a huge advantage. They are poised to take market share, but they mostly have TSMC to thank for that.",

And, these companies will almost definitely be looking to AMD, as Intel's 7nm chips aren't expected to be available until *at least* 2022, and AMD is already mass-producing. Depending on how hard these companies ditch Intel, it could be an actual death blow. \n\nAnd that doesn't even bring up the issue that things are shifting more and more to mobile platforms, where Intel completely failed. Companies like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm absolutely dominate in the mobile SoC sector and managed to castrate a titan when Intel attempted to enter that market and failed miserably. \n\nIt's bad news all around. \n\nDoes that mean they can't come back? No. Of course they can. But the concerns are real.\n\nWhat other major stocks have you seen recently crash 13% on earnings then just... Stay there? Flat? We are in the most legendary dip-buying market of all time, where almost any dip will be bought without any logic, and yet no one would touch INTC, which is one of the biggest tech companies in the world.\n\nIt's a bit concerning.\n\nYour DD is basically \"bruh, it's Intel.

We are getting to a point with processors where the failure and error rate are almost matching that of the successful output rate for some of the processor processes (this is true for the industry as a whole). The difference is, intel has in house fabs. Amd outsources their fab work to partnered companies. The reason this matters is as you have more failures and complexities arise, if your in housing your own stuff, you eat the cost of failure directly. If you contract it out, you frankly don\u2019t give a shit what happens. You either get your product or the partnered company hasn\u2019t held up their agreed contract and things get legal. \n\nAs a result amd has been able to move forward with newer nanometer processes without any fear or concern of if it\u2019s even feasible or not. \n\nI will end with this though. Intel wouldn\u2019t be dropping 8 billion dollars in to a new fab space (d1x in Oregon) if they didn\u2019t feel they had a solid road map. Mark my words now, in 5-10 years, intel will be the leading manufacturer of FPGA\u2019s and FPGA\u2019s as a whole, will begin to replace the standard processor market as we know it.",

You do this  and you will be a multi-millionaire before you hit 50 providing you increase your portfolio with monthly capital injections. 50-100-500 it doesn\u2019t matter just every month make it a point to pay yourself first and add or make a new position. Time is the ultimate currency and it\u2019s on your side. If I were you I would ask myself \u201cwhat will my future look like\u201d and invest in companies that align with that future. My future looks like this TSLA, NIO, AMD, GLD, SLV, MSFT, APPL, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, BRK-B, LYFT, APTV, LULU, ARKK, QQQ, PLUG, NEM, NET, MTCH, DDOG, SPCE etc. I also own 2 rental properties and a lots of physical gold, silver and some pretty sweet guns. This is what I see in my future and I\u2019m 33; now ask yourself what you see in yours. Also, as a side note: ride the wave. There will be terrible days and there will be amazing days but stay the course. Don\u2019t trade with emotions and sell because you lost 5%. Ride that wave through the storm and always buy the dips. Read the \u201cintelligent investor\u201d and \u201ca random walk down Wall Street\u201d. Enjoy this life lesson young man. Also, second side note: be a good person. Don\u2019t be a jerk to women, don\u2019t cheat, have respect for yourself and stay the fuck away from hard drugs and alcohol.",

        "body": "I was surprised Intel hovered around 60 as long as it had. They're selling server chips with two year old processor form factors for twice the price of AMD's Rome procs. For every company looking to do a refresher on hardware, the choice was a no-brainer. The Rome 2 procs were something we waited to August 2019 to order, and there was such a backlog from orders, that delivery occurred in May of 2020.\n\nI don't think Intel is going to do well. I am surprised they remained $60 until they lost $9 premarket.\n\nYes, Intel does have other revenue streams: network chipsets, motherboards, storage SSD fab, ~~video cards~~, etc. Still, I can't help but think that Intel's lack of R&amp;D into another processor architecture informs me as to their company modus operandi: they rode astride the chip manufacturing world for too long, and a more innovative company is now eating their lunch. They were content to imagine that single-NUMA architecture was going to continue to dominate, while AMD focused on multiple NUMA nodes.\n\nThe disadvantage of single NUMA architecture is the complexity of assembling a die with 24 or 28 cores as a single unit. A lot of their production is thrown away or put into a lower bin when a manufacturing defect takes place. This effectively increases the cost or manufacturing, and Intel processor prices as a whole.\n\nAMD on the other hand, has been developing the Zepplin architecture since the Bulldozer chips in 2011. Their goal was to make production easy by assembling NUMA node modules in batches, and then later integrating them on the  CPU die with a separate processor responsible for intra-node communication. This decreases the points of failure from the entire die, down to single cpu components. This decreases their rate of rejection, which gives them the upper hand on price.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for Intel is their inability to close the architecture process size below 10nm. When I'd heard that AMD was producing 7nm processors, I was intrigued what Intel's response was going to be. When it came out that they were going to be producing only mobile processors at 10nm, I knew they were in trouble.\nIntel has become second-class, and if they don't invest in some serious R&amp;D on their process and architecture, their processor division will soon become redundant.\n\nI am ultra-bearish on Intel in the long run. I cannot understand anybody claiming otherwise, and they are going to suffer immensely. Their R&amp;D teams are definitely being whipped in the back rooms.",

Nuclear is not something the United States, Japan, UK, Germany, or the rest of the 1st world countries want to go because of the waste and environmental impact.  China and India are the two majors that would need to commit to nuclear, and if they do, dollars to doughnuts they are not gonna use mines located in the US.  Another thing to consider, is that if people start to move out of the cities and people dense areas to more sparsely populated areas what is gonna prevent them to stay complete off the grid if it's possible with today's tech.  The pitifalls of the past in using renewable energy as the primary source to power a home has always been the conversion and storage part of the equation,  not the acquisition of it.   On the inverter side, companies like SEDG and ENPH have held onto their gains and continue to show robust sales in both the US and Europe.  Tesla's power wall has been gaining momentum and is leading the way in batteries.  Tesla is not just a car company, it's a renewable energy infrastructure play that in years to come will drive the new IoT in the future.

        "body": "nah don't mess with penny stocks.\n\nOptions are the way in the volatility. They are risky for sure but you can do quite well if you are smart about it. And generally a bit more predictable based on patterns and valuations. \n\nENPH is a great example. Every time there is a dip, you can buy towards the bottom and it'll recover within a week. It keeps a trading range. AMD is another one. You can find a ton of stocks that bounce between trading ranges. \n\nBut you can also play them off unusual activity or around before expected news. \n\nAZN had around a 6% day yesterday. My options went up 176% since I got in a few days earlier before the IV spike. \n\nGot be careful with them tho and only trade with a certain position of your portfolio. I try to keep 10% or lower. Also make sure you fully understand them and know what you are doing. But most people stay away because they don't understand them... Even Warren Buffett uses options at times.",

ENPH was truly a unicorn penny stock with a product that is actually stellar (for residential purposes dare I say slightly better than SolarEdge).

We won't have a strong need for that until much heavier renewable penetration, possibly 2030 (for California) or later (for other states in the East coast). Even in CA there is not a strong need for that yet. Academics at universities are just now starting to pay attention to the data analytics aspect of renewable.",
