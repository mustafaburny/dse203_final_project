Sticking with the big boys will likely yield way better results long-term. When people try to get fancy they get fucking obliterated for the most part. Unlike with the IANs and MMENs of the world, TER is already pretty close to profitability so it's a bit different than the very early days.

These guys have higher upside at their current levels, especially if they get NJ legalization, but I'd be lying if I said I'd put more money in TER than the well oiled machines up top.

The sector is riddled with sketchy companies. I'm very picky with who I invest in and they just barely made my list personally. They only very recently got off my shit list.  \n\nI think the risk-reward is quite good at least for the short-term. Should be rapid growth in 2020. Afterwards, I'm not as sure but that doesn't really matter in terms of short-term price action. I'm not really looking to \"invest\" longterm in any company. I just play the dips and rips.\n\nAs for the TER stock.. Don't bother for now. It doesn't do anything. There's no volume. But as a \"set and forget\" invest in the hopes of them blasting off after or near their ERs? I don't hate the idea. I would consider it over GTII or CURA at their valuations, but would never consider it when GTII was at fucking $5.",

        "body": "Not a slam dunk by any means but their operations are reallllly lean right now compared to just a couple quarters ago. And I like their strategy of penetrating the extremely profitable markets deeply. \n\nAny reason you're for gut uneasy feeling about them? It makes sense.. Not knocking you. The sector is riddled with sketchy companies. I'm very picky with who I invest in and they just barely made my list personally. They only very recently got off my shit list.  \n\nI think the risk-reward is quite good at least for the short-term. Should be rapid growth in 2020. Afterwards, I'm not as sure but that doesn't really matter in terms of short-term price action. I'm not really looking to \"invest\" longterm in any company. I just play the dips and rips.\n\nAs for the TER stock.. Don't bother for now. It doesn't do anything. There's no volume. But as a \"set and forget\" invest in the hopes of them blasting off after or near their ERs? I don't hate the idea. I would consider it over GTII or CURA at their valuations, but would never consider it when GTII was at fucking $5.",
