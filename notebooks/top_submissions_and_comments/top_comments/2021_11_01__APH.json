        "body": "A trip down memory lane...I recall a few years back when the headlines were about some weedstock investors (I owned CGC and APH on the TSX) who were detained at the border and not allowed to enter the USA due to their investments.  I travel between Canada and the USA quite a bit and had difficulty comprehending how my investments on the TSX could preclude me entering the USA...especially when guys like Bruce Linton and Vic Neufeld were jet setting all over.  So I continued to take the risk and travel.  Not once did anyone at Customs ask about my investments.  My response would have been \"none of your business.\"\n\nSAFE reminds me a bit of this paranoia and the lengths that certain entities will go to to keep retail investors in this sector scared.  The only thing MSOs have going against themselves is their inability to be listed on a decent exchange and banks like JP Morgan and Credit Suisse not allowing clients to trade.  Compare the P/E multiples to entities like Tesla or any of these EV manufacturers.  I keep reminding myself the risk is not in the MSO itself, just the limited access most have to the stock.  Eventually the politicians will clue into the fact that 94% of adults in the USA who were asked are fine with legalization.  For me, the frustration lies in how sad the politics of all of this is.",

Got lucky bailiing out of WEED (it may have been CGC by that time) in the $60s and $50s when it was on the way down from its ATH. I dumped all my ACB in the $20s when the dilution became obscene. Was lucky enough to put it all into APH/APHA below $10 to keep my average around $5. I have enough LPs now and started accumulating MSOs in the summer of 2020 ... mostly CL and CCHW. I have been and will continue to accumulate these for the foreseeable. \n\nGood luck and have fun!",
