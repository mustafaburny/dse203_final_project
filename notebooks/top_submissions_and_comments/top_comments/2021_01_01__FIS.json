The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.\n\nSo here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Fidelity and Vanguard\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.\n\nThis weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.\n\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.\n\nTake this opportunity by the balls and never let go. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nUSE YOUR \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",

For them, the billions they stand to make off GME stock is chump change and they don't give a fuck if some internet retards bleed a stupid hedge fund for billions.\n\nThe real reason they aren't blocking trades is because doing so would undermine customer trust and goodwill. Those are two things they've spent over 40 years building up. Fidelity and Vanguard are businesses in it for the long run and plan to make way more money than GME could ever make them.\n\nFurthermore, both companies process their own trades and clear them through subsidiaries they own. So they don't have to bow down to Citadel or any other Wall Street shit eaters like Robinhood does.\n\nWhen this is over, I highly recommend anyone with remaining stock in robinhood or other shady platforms moves it to Fidelity or Vanguard.

        "body": "CONCERNING RH, FIDELITY, VANGUARD, and $GME\n\nLet's get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required. So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are... \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Fidelity and Vanguard\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. (I have also heard TDA is ok) You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail. This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.\n\nBasically, about 30% of GME shares are owned by just 3 investment firms (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard). Another 30% is own by other investment firms and Ryan Cohen, which brings it to over 60%... all of who have a vested interest in seeing GME moon.\n\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON. Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 USE YOUR \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nSOURCE: [https://fintel.io/so/us/gme.](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)\n\nCheck the institutional ownership of GME, If you think for one second that Blackrock, the world's largest investment fund, is going to let GME fail then you must be literally retarded.\n\nThey do not lose money. Period.\n\nSPREAD THIS INFO",

Earlier, I used to move \"mature\" positions from RH to Fidelity. I moved all my positions today. This is how I did this:\n\n1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.\n2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.\n3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type \"transfer asset\". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.\n4. Click on \"Start a transfer\"\n5. In the \"Select your current firm\" field, type \"Robinhood\". It should show up as \"Robinhood Securities Llc.\". Select that to go to the next step.\n6. In the next screen, paste the previously copied RH account number, and select \"individual\" in the account type.\n7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account. Like I mentioned above, earlier I used to transfer single equities, but today, I selected \"entire account\".\n8. I know that this works as I have transferred other accounts into Fidelity in the past without an issue (once I had an incorrect cost-basis, but that was taken care of with a phone call).\n9. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.\n10. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it's the next tax filing season.",

Fidelity offers up to $25,000 in instant deposit credit.\n\n\u2705 - Withdraw any money currently not invested but deposited into Robinhood &amp; other Brokerages restricting trading. \n\n\u2705 - HOOOOLLLDDD your Robinhood AMC &amp; GME stock.\n\n\u2705 - Setup live market pricing on Fidelity. In the app, go to More... \u25ba Settings and Profile \u25ba Quick Access \u25ba Turn on Watch Lists &amp; Real Time Quotes. This feature is turned off by default and means Fidelity has a 15 minute delay on live ticker prices.\n\n\u2705 - Activate \u201cExtended Hours Trading\u201d. This allows you to trade on the markets before and after close for a set amount of extended time. To do so, you HAVE to be on the Fidelity website. Search in the top right hand search corner \u201cExtended Hours Trading\u201d and pick the article titled exactly that. Walk through the process to enable it. Others are saying to call Fidelity. Don\u2019t. Customer service simply walks you through how to do it on your own from the Fidelity website. \n\n\u2705 - Rate Robinhood a 1-2 on the app and playstore. \n\n\u2705 - Rate Fidelity a 3 or 4 on the app and playstore. 5 star customer service but they deliver a 2 star experience on their god awful UI. Let\u2019s do this to help convince Fidelity to modernize their brokerage app platform &amp; leave Robinhood in the dust. \n\n\u2705 - File complaints on Robinhood using SEC. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html)\n\n\u2705 - Class Action Lawsuits. If you believe you were negatively impacted by Robinhoods actions and believe you are entitled to compensation. Begin browsing r/ClassActionRobinhood for further information. Only sign up for the class action you believe has the strongest case. Don\u2019t sign up immediately either. Allow the legal firms to continue developing their cases before determining the strongest.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0fThis is not legal or financial advise.

The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.\n\nSo here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Fidelity and Vanguard\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.\n\nThis weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.\n\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading.

The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.\n\nSo here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Fidelity and Vanguard\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80##\n\nYou want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.\n\nThis weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.\n\nSO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze @$4200.69 and beyond.##\n\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.\n\nTake these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nUSE YOUR \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",

The position was not large.\n* Decided part of my portfolio to be \"fire and forget\" (it's 70% MSCI World, 30% EM ETFs). They will just live their own life and grow with the world for the next decades. (It involved a bit of reshuffling that account, but worth it).\n* My broker app supports alarms, so for each of the remaining positions I decided what my plan was and then I set corresponding alarms. Some stocks I will keep forever, some I will sell if their price leave an interval, some I will buy more of if the price is below a point (but never sell) or sell (but never re-purchase).\n* So now I wait for my phone to alert me rather than checking constantly.\n* I do a weekly check of my regime - plan to shift to monthly.\n\nMy returns are better (!) and I can focus on day2day and get more money into the system.\n\nAll the best.",

        "body": "Yup that typical apple user who has spent at least two or three or more of $500 iPad, $300 watch, $1k phone, $200 AirPods, $1k Macbook they\u2019re just gonna happily give it all up in a second. All their iCloud photos and songs etc. They\u2019ll happily just give it all up right? And for what? Some new phone running android? Yeah I don\u2019t think so.\n\nAside from having the ecosystem and dominating sales in the developed world, no one can out engineer them. Their products are always market leaders, they can arrive with less specs but performance will be better. No one is threatening their space at the moment, tablets? It\u2019s iPads vs no one. Smart watches? It\u2019s apple vs no one. Not like Samsung or google didn\u2019t try, apple just destroyed the competition so they may as well not exist. Apple are currently coming for intel and AMD.\n\nI love that with google half the items you list off are not even commercially released yet. Yes they dominate with search, YouTube and maps. As I said they are monopoly in those areas. But they don\u2019t have the brand loyalty of Apple. Not even close.\n\nYeah let\u2019s see how the monetisation of WhatsApp goes, you realise there is a reason for that right? Messaging apps are a dime a dozen, if you\u2019re gonna load it with ads or start stealing my data I\u2019ll go elsewhere. Just wait until the iOS update comes out where people have to allow Facebook to steal your data before you use their apps, let\u2019s see just how many people start leaving. There\u2019s a good reason Facebook took out multiple full page ads trying to attack apple over it.\n\nAnd that leads into Apples other area they are owning. Privacy. Google and Facebook are the opposite and Apple are giving people exactly what they want. Protecting your data, alerting you when someone wants to take your data. They\u2019ve taken the users side in the data war, that is only going to add to their business in the coming years as it hurts google and Facebook.",

They outsource it.\n\nSamsung is currently producing 5nm, and I think TSMC is too, but their entire inventory appears to be contracted to Apple right now.\n\nIt's also not an apples-to-apples comparison from fab to fab.  Intel's 14nm is closer to a 10nm from TSMC and Samsung, and the 10nm is expected to be closer to a 7nm process.  Intel's 7nm corresponds well with a 5nm TSMC/Samsung process.\n\nIntel's 10nm is slated to come out later this year, with a slow trickle.  This puts them about 1.5 generations behind Samsung and TSMC.  In spite of this, Intel's processors are still competitive with AMD's, if just barely behind and slightly costlier (though prices for Intel are dropping and AMD are rising).\n\nI think this means overall that Intel has either a better design or manufacturing process that if they can push their node process to improve at a heightened pace could have them dominating the performance-to-price market in 2-5 years again.  Intel definitely has the cash on hand to invest in this, but they made many missteps on their push to get the 10nm and 7nm chips ready, so I'm not hopeful that Intel can pull this off, regardless of who heads the company.",
