The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.\n\nSo here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Fidelity and Vanguard\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.\n\nThis weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.\n\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.\n\nTake this opportunity by the balls and never let go. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nUSE YOUR \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",

Those are two things they've spent over 40 years building up. Fidelity and Vanguard are businesses in it for the long run and plan to make way more money than GME could ever make them.\n\nFurthermore, both companies process their own trades and clear them through subsidiaries they own. So they don't have to bow down to Citadel or any other Wall Street shit eaters like Robinhood does.\n\nWhen this is over, I highly recommend anyone with remaining stock in robinhood or other shady platforms moves it to Fidelity or Vanguard.

Earlier, I used to move \"mature\" positions from RH to Fidelity. I moved all my positions today. This is how I did this:\n\n1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.\n2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.\n3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type \"transfer asset\". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.\n4. Click on \"Start a transfer\"\n5. In the \"Select your current firm\" field, type \"Robinhood\". It should show up as \"Robinhood Securities Llc.\". Select that to go to the next step.\n6. In the next screen, paste the previously copied RH account number, and select \"individual\" in the account type.\n7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account. Like I mentioned above, earlier I used to transfer single equities, but today, I selected \"entire account\".\n8. I know that this works as I have transferred other accounts into Fidelity in the past without an issue (once I had an incorrect cost-basis, but that was taken care of with a phone call).\n9. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.\n10. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it's the next tax filing season.",

Fidelity offers up to $25,000 in instant deposit credit.\n\n\u2705 - Withdraw any money currently not invested but deposited into Robinhood &amp; other Brokerages restricting trading. \n\n\u2705 - HOOOOLLLDDD your Robinhood AMC &amp; GME stock.\n\n\u2705 - Setup live market pricing on Fidelity. In the app, go to More... \u25ba Settings and Profile \u25ba Quick Access \u25ba Turn on Watch Lists &amp; Real Time Quotes. This feature is turned off by default and means Fidelity has a 15 minute delay on live ticker prices.\n\n\u2705 - Activate \u201cExtended Hours Trading\u201d. This allows you to trade on the markets before and after close for a set amount of extended time. To do so, you HAVE to be on the Fidelity website. Search in the top right hand search corner \u201cExtended Hours Trading\u201d and pick the article titled exactly that. Walk through the process to enable it. Others are saying to call Fidelity. Don\u2019t. Customer service simply walks you through how to do it on your own from the Fidelity website. \n\n\u2705 - Rate Robinhood a 1-2 on the app and playstore. \n\n\u2705 - Rate Fidelity a 3 or 4 on the app and playstore. 5 star customer service but they deliver a 2 star experience on their god awful UI. Let\u2019s do this to help convince Fidelity to modernize their brokerage app platform &amp; leave Robinhood in the dust. \n\n\u2705 - File complaints on Robinhood using SEC. [Link](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html)\n\n\u2705 - Class Action Lawsuits. If you believe you were negatively impacted by Robinhoods actions and believe you are entitled to compensation. Begin browsing r/ClassActionRobinhood for further information. Only sign up for the class action you believe has the strongest case. Don\u2019t sign up immediately either. Allow the legal firms to continue developing their cases before determining the strongest.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0fThis is not legal or financial advise.

The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.\n\nSo here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...\n\n##\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Fidelity and Vanguard\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80##\n\nYou want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.\n\nThis weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. \n\n##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##\n\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.\n\nTake these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nUSE YOUR \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",

They could let you buy, BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD GET SHARES. The squeeze is squozing, and the only way out of $100k+ share prices which would break everything was to STOP THE MARKET.",

Earlier, I used to move \"mature\" positions from RH to Fidelity. I moved all my positions today. This is how I did this:\n\n1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.\n2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.\n3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type \"transfer asset\". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.\n4. Click on \"Start a transfer\"\n5. In the \"Select your current firm\" field, type \"Robinhood\". It should show up as \"Robinhood Securities Llc.\". Select that to go to the next step.\n6. In the next screen, paste the previously copied RH account number, and select \"individual\" in the account type.\n7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account. Like I mentioned above, earlier I used to transfer single equities, but today, I selected \"entire account\".\n8. I know that this works as I have transferred other accounts into Fidelity in the past without an issue (once I had an incorrect cost-basis, but that was taken care of with a phone call).\n9. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.\n10. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it's the next tax filing season.",

Take a one time lump sum loss.\nThis won't be the only loss they take though if \ud83d\udc8e\u270b. You don't need to sell your Robinhood stocks to buy at other brokers though. If you were going to buy more on Robinhood, create a Fidelity account (Fidelity still allows buying) and buy there. It's all commission free. It doesn't even sell your data. On top of it, raise Robinhood customer requests to transfer your shares to Fidelity.\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS IS JUST MY OPINION ON SOMETHING SOMEONE CAN DO.",

When pointed out that the SEC hasn't said anything about this he just says \"well other brokers have to comply with SEC requirements\" Okay but schwab, vanguard and fidelity didn't suspend trading for a specific slew of tickers popular on an internet forum. What requirements are they not complying with (or are you not complying with) that makes the situation different? Why only restrict buying and not selling for retail investors? \"Uhhhhhh regulatory requirements, financial requirements.... how many times do i need to say requirements before I sound convincing? \"\".\n\nTHEN of all fucking things.... this bitch says they feel good about the situation lmao. \"We did this proactively...\" Okay so then why did you not tell any of your customers ahead of time that you would be placing these restrictions on buying specifically? He's making it sound like this was a decision they'd coordinated and planned for (which they clearly did) but yet had no transparency with their customers. Okay so even if we believe this fairytale story of yours you still failed to inform your customers of something that would critically affect their investment decisions had they known a priori.
