Im very bullish on achronix, especially with xilinx being swallowed by AMD, which will probably be much smoother than intel's debauchery of a buyout  /w Altera, but will still mess up xilinx IMO.\nAchronix will stand out even more.  FPGA tech is not very click bait worthy, which is fine by me. Less pump and dump volatility, and I see this as a long term hold with zero doubts.",
