Just saw it in the [Rocketlab ](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLab/comments/pgcnhz/rocket_lab_is_exploring_inorbit_refueling_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) subRed\n\nJust a little pushback to your comment, only trying to change your prospective. Your first sentence, it cancels itself out. When I say moat you understood it as what I meant, an \"advantage\". So we could say first entrant, that's a narrow moat. Then I would argue what if they have a few narrow and medium sized moats to combine for a wide one? A medium moat that will narrow is their location. Until it's more common to launch in less rural areas then this is not nothing. Being able to launch east, near the Equator, with little air and marine traffic, that's beneficial.\n\n I agree they do not have first mover advantage when it comes to making small sats. That goes with their medium moat of having these three things, rocket manufacturing, satellite manufacturing, and their own private launch site. If you are in the business and don't have one of those three, you'll be paying a premium at some point. I realize $/kg is the king metric, but reusability and launch cadence are starting to become important. \n\nReally a quarter,  priced in? I've only been studying the market a few months and I even know how naive that is. A quarter means you value them at their total cash and assets alone, neglecting 15 years of experience and intellectual property. As for priced in 10 years, new space is a new sector, new sectors are hard to gauge growth. If it takes them 5years to build a Medium class rocket, they'd have 5 more years to expand that product. So in ten years what if they are half the value of Space X is currently$70-90billion? 40billion dollars would put them close to $100/share.\n\nThat's really great you got to meet him. I'm not even in your industry and I know I'd get a big kick out of meeting him, or Ellis, or Elon obviously.",

Then I launched my own consulting company - quickly figured out that services work doesn't scale well - pivoted the business to a product startup and used the consulting to finance it.  All told, it took 20 years to get a really big exit - like net of over $200M.  \nThere is no shortcut that I know of - education, skills, experience,  lots of hard work for years and then luck.\nNow I get to do whatever I like, I am typing this from a private jet on the wifi coming back from vacation... I know, wtf. I pinch myself too.\n\n\n2) How can I invest like you?\n\nWell. I have a lot of money so I can make risky bets.  I don't do options though, only stocks. I put $50k into GME on a whim at $65 and sold when it hit $350.  That was a laugh.  \n\nBut seriously, I invest in stocks that I feel like I know. I use HUBS - they are in a great space and really appealing to SMB. I see them as the most viable competitor to Salesforce - go look at Salesforce's market cap. Classic Clayton Christensen - you will be eaten from below.\n\nI am not really much of an investor - just see things that make sense. I bought Amazon at $350 - should have put in more...\n\nI typically invest in tech stocks because I feel like I understand the business.\n\nMy stock account is just my plaything. My real investing is much more structured and done with my wealth advisor at a large brokerage.",
