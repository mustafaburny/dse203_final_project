They did good on revenue and earnings, but the big dark cloud they unloaded on themselves was lowered expectations for growth through 2021. All green energy is getting clobbered by raw material shortages. ENPH announced that they expected lower product and revenue growth through 2021 because they will have restrictions on the production of their microinverters.\n\nThe market has absolutely punished them for it, because growth stocks that operate at PE and PS ratios of ENPH has absolutely no room for error otherwise they'll be punished.\n\nI think it'll go back, but you need to wait for it to find its bottom. Q2 earnings may provide more insights whether it'll slide more. \n\nThis isn't a short squeeze or hedge fund attack. This is an aggregate macro factor supply/demand issue.\n\nAsk yourself these 4 questions:\n\n1. What is ENPH's revenue growth rate?\n\n2. What is their PS multiple?\n\n3. How many years in the future is ENPH's growth priced into the current stock?\n\n4. What are competitor multiples?\n\nENPH was pricing in nearly 4 years of growth into their stock. If you're willing to wait for this chip shortage to end (predicting in about 1-2 years) you could see 100% growth in ENPH price. Thats a good ROI given SPY only grows about 10% a year.\n\nBut if you don't have faith that will happen, I would consider reallocating your capital.\n\nJust FYI, your vote probably doesn't mean shit unless you own 10% of the company or something.",

That's tanking.\n\nAlso, AVNW is only down 25% from its peak in April, while the entire tech industry and growth is down. Also, its basically at its February heights, which means the stock is well positioned.\n\nOkay, lets look at financials. Their margin is 38% with 8% YoY growth. They were priced at $10 in October and are $30 now.\n\nAlso their revenue for the year is targeted for $265M for the year and their market cap is $331M. Their P/S is 1.1. Since their revenue growth is only 8% YoY, with 38% margins, I don't see their stock price going far beyond $40 without good PR or projections to expand into  broader markets.\n\nSlide 13 of their investor presentation says there is a growth opportunity in rural broadband. And slide 7 says they have 6% of their TAM of $3B, and that the 5G growth market is 24% CAGR to increase  1.5B by itself.\n\nhttps://investors.aviatnetworks.com/static-files/35c3c9af-aa0d-42bf-bf3c-d9c04cafcbb6\n\nWith all this, AVNW may have a stock that could reach $50 or $60 if they can increase their revenue growth rates. But at 8% growth, they're not going to see super high stock prices without greater growth. But a 1 P/S ratio is really really low. But the industry for microwave transmission (ie. ERIC, CRNT, etc) all have P/S ratios of ~1. Don't expect to rely on a high P/S ratio to drive up this stock price.\n\n$30 seems priced to perfection.",

They will be in 5-10 years as prices drop.\n\nThe ENPH battery system is garbage right now. It sits behind the inverters which means it must be inverted again for storage and then inverted yet again to be usable.... Total trash. What they need to do is put a switch on their micros so that they are pass through (like optimizers) when sending to battery and inverting only when sending to panel. Or if thats too hard, just offer a optimizer system like SEDG... SEDG already works that way and TESLA has designed their system with a central inverter too for that very same reason.\n\nBut ENPH is still much better for non-battery installs and will remain market leader until batteries become mainstream.

Every other stock I looked at and considered investing in lost a shit ton of money in that timeframe. \n\nI still wouldn't be a millionaire but I kick myself in the ass everyday for paper handing that shit. It did capture my interest and I proceeded to do my best to learn on my own all about the market and join some Discord groups full of traders who if I compared my IQ to theirs' it would collapse the fundamental laws of mathematics. \n\nTake that $700 and invest it in learning the market. If you can find some classes great, if you can buy some books, cool, if you can buy some software or whatever and actually dedicate your wrinkles to learning even better. Invest in learning about the market with that money and paper trade while you can because after you start you can't really go back to paper. \n\nThe money will maybe possibly come later. I'm still waiting on the money, but it's only been two and a half years lmao. (I am net-gains but I wish I had spent more of that money I blew on learning the easy way rather than the hard way.)\n\nOr dump it all in on GME like I did. \n\n^(not financial advice)",
