        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

        "body": "I work in the semi industry and I've been in and out of AMAT positions the past couple of months. TSM, Samsung and INTC have near-term headwinds in terms of earnings based on semiconductor demand simply because it takes so long to expand capacity. The front-end winners in current semi production efforts are going to be those who supply the tools, products and services that go into these fabs that are planned for construction: AMAT, ASML, TER, LRCX, to name a few. Secondary effects on earnings from this will come 1-2-3 years down the line for the semi manufacturers themselves, depending on whether or not they are expanding/upgrading an existing facility, or building one from the ground up.\n\nThe end-users of these semiconductor products (GM, F, NVDA, AMD, etc.) will be the last ones to benefit from expanded chipmaking capacity, as easing the demand crunch allows them to resume normal sales levels. Note that for auto mfrs, this has a ripple effect on rental car companies, who sold all of their fleets in fire sales last year and now can't replace them because the auto mfrs can't make cars.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is booked up for the foreseeable future; these bookings have prices agreed well in advance, and are almost certainly not subject to TSMC's recent statements that they plan to increase prices; that will happen with new bookings down the line.",

        "body": "Your analysis is probably true for delta, but the problem with playing those names using vol is that the IV is higher. Options trading is most useful when you get the gamma cheap while also calling the direction right.\n\nI'm buying INTC 23Apr 70c because resistance at 65 has kept IV muted. My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr. I hate talking in terms of resistance in general, but looking at the long-term chart as well as price action in the morning after the Intel Unleashed event, it certainly seems like you'd need a big catalyst to justify a breakout beyond 65. I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",

        "body": " TL:DR - looking for feedback on a simple hi return stock screen and thoughts on how to rank results.\n\nEarly 60's, simple, diversified, buy and hold retirement portfolio approach my whole life. Looking at working probably another 5-10 years and starting to get a lot more active in my portfolio. Nothing crazy and I'm fundamentally a conservative+ investor, but I do not subscribe to moving 100% into ultra safe right before retirement. Portfolio size is low 7 figure for reference.\n\nOver the past few months I subscribed to a couple of authors on Seeking Alpha and have tried out a few strategies with minimal exposure and have a good idea of how to use some of the approaches in my portfolio. I want to develop my own screens because at least on Seeking Alpha, the authors I've found charge a small monthly fee for their updates. It's nothing huge, and for me at least has been worth seeing their approaches, but nothing I want to pay for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm going to put together a dividend screen/strategy and a \"better than cash\" parking lot strategy. Pretty basic and straightforward. I also just got started on putting together a screen to identify a more hi growth strategy - thought being on a monthly basis invest in the top 4 stocks that fall out of the screen. Would love some feedback on the screen (I'm stock knowledgeable, but certainly not an expert). When looking at the screen and giving feedback keep in mind my objective: not looking for the perfect approach or for mega returns, I'm an 80/20 kinda guy so looking for a decent, simple to execute strategy to reliably give back a growth-class return. (And using the Fidelity screener as that's where my portfolio is).\n\nScreen as it stand currently:\n\n* Tagging Energy, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Industrials sectors\n* Market cap down to Medium (as defined by Fidelity: 6-33B)\n* 13 week price performance down to 13%\n* 3 yr annualized Beta of 1.1 and up (conflicted on whether this really helps the screen)\n* Very Bullish or Bullish analyst recommendations (Summary score from StarMine)\n* Forward EPS 3-5 yrs high to very high (16.5% and up)\n* EPS growth Projected year versus last year high to very high (40% and up)\n\nAs an example, running that screen today resulted in a list of 7 stocks (sorry not allowed to link image or would give you a shot of the fundamentals):\n\n1. AMAT - Applied materials\n2. FANG - Diamondback Energy\n3. EOG - EOG Resources\n4. NXPI - NXP SemiConductor\n5. KKR - KKR &amp; Co\n6. LRCX - LAM Research Corp\n7. MU - Micron Technology\n\nSo the thought would be to run this first day of every month and put a set amount in the top 4 stocks in the filter. I would guess some stocks might stay in for months, some might rotate in and out quickly.\n\nMy question is basically around how to rank. So do I just pick a screening metric (or some other metric) and do a simple rank on that metric to determine top 4, or do I create a formula to weight and aggregate multiple metrics into an overall score and rank on that?\n\nSorry for the long post - thank you to those who stuck with it and are willing to share your thoughts.",

Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes.

        "body": "Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat. That\u2019s as of 0630.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes. You\u2019ve been warned (Voltswagen, er Volkswagen did a good job of preparing you for that as well).",

In fact these are the types of posts that I hope get on the top of r/options (I gave you an award - hopefully it pushes it up). Your post is a great post for people who are actually looking to learn more about options than just buying calls/puts. Half of the time I see posts that are just like \u201cyolo into calls on stock xyz\u201d or \u201cshould I get out of my position now or wait it out\u201d etc. get to the top, which is sort of disappointing to me. I don\u2019t have any issues with those posts, but they don\u2019t offer the insight your post offers. \n\nWhat you described is a rough sketch of dispersion trading. You probably won\u2019t be able to find much about it online but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a few articles and research papers that you can find on Google (just type dispersion trading into Google). There\u2019s also this on YouTube that gives you a brief intro: https://youtube.com/watch?v=32bVTQw7XDg. It\u2019s a *true options* strategy and much more sophisticated than the ones you generally see here on Reddit of just buying calls or puts. I would guess it\u2019s one of the core strategies almost all option trading firms make to generate profit. It\u2019s almost impossible to do as a retail trader (your set-up you described in your post will be very costly and almost impossible to manage), but if you have like some complex system of algorithms + a bunch of quants helping you out, there is a way to pull off this trade so that you can *have a positive profit no matter how the stock market moves*. \n\nThink about it this way with a super simplistic example in SPY. SPY is a function of its 500 stocks. So there must be a relationship between these 500 stocks (or sector of stocks) and SPY. If this relationship gets off in either direction, you can take advantage. If Stock X and Stock Y have IVs of a and b, then the basket that is some weighted combination of Stock X and Y *must* have an IV of f(a, b) where it\u2019s a *solvable function*. This means anytime it gets off, no matter how Stocks X and Y move, you can make money. \n\nAnyways that didn\u2019t really answer your question in your post directly, but I\u2019m giving some basic insight on the type of thinking you described in your post. As I said, I don\u2019t think most people have the resources to pull it off, but given you can even think of this idea, that\u2019s pretty impressive! And as I said, it\u2019s a great post for people to learn more about more advanced option strategies than just buying calls/puts.",

As we draw closer to the delivery days, the number of open interest contracts should almost always fall as most players in the COMEX are speculators and do not have the silver nor have the interest to demand delivery so they would rather just close off and roll their contracts over to future months.\n\nThose contacts that remains are more likely serious participants who want delivery and are not just speculating. So if that total number of open interest contracts remains high when we hit the delivery day, that means more likely for more silver will be demanded from the COMEX and as it stands now, the COMEX stock is only at 24,000 contracts. If more than 24000 contracts demands delivery, they'll be out of stock.\n\nThe COMEX may have ways to increase their stock in the meantime.

And if the stock isn't above 500 (call) by April 16 2021, then the options expire worthless. \n\nCost/share: OP paid 30.01 per share to buy these options (not the stock...just the options...more on that later). And remember, each option is a 100 shares and OP bought 80. So....80 contracts* 100 shares per contract * 30.01 cost/share = $240,000 bet. \n\nWho gets that money? The person who is putting up the shares. That is, someone (could be ultiple people) who owned 8,000 shares. That person got a $240,000. \n\nHere's where it gets a little complicated. You can buy and sell the option contracts itself. The value of those contracts is directly related to how much time is left before the expiration date and whether the options already are over the $500 strike price (or \"in the money\"). \n\nAs these options are already in the money (current nvidia price is like $612/share). The value of each contract is $127.20 per share. So, 80 * 100 * 127.20 = 1,017,600.",

Last April, it was left for dead. Predicting an imminent demise for the retailer, hedge funds piled on their bearish bets and the company\u2019s market value sank to a few hundred million dollars. A year later, thanks to big buying from the Reddit crowd, GameStop is worth about $13 billion and is now looking to raise as much as $1 billion in capital to fund internet entrepreneur Ryan Cohen\u2019s turnaround plan. This year\u2019s GameStop stock mania may make its business transformation possible.\n\nThe retail investor frenzy over GameStop shares has been well covered. But the stock\u2019s rally has some fundamental underpinnings. It is not a coincidence that the surge began days after Cohen was appointed to its board on Jan. 11. Since joining in an official capacity, the co-founder and former chief executive officer of online pet-supply retailer Chewy Inc. has moved quickly, taking control of the company\u2019s strategy and pivoting it faster toward e-commerce. He has hired nine executives \u2014 five of whom had experience at Amazon.com Inc. \u2014 including a new chief operating officer and chief technology officer. Several of the additional hires also came from Chewy, a sign of confidence from former colleagues in COhen\u2019s abilities. Now, the company is raising the funds needed to implement his plan.\n\nEarly Monday, the company announced it will sell as much as 3.5 million shares worth as much as $1 billion in an \u201cat-the-market\u201d stock offering. It said the funds will be used to \u201caccelerate its transformation\u201d and strengthen its balance sheet. The video-game retailer also announced that its revenue for the five weeks ended April 2 increased by 18% compared with a year earlier, negating a part of the naysayers\u2019 thesis that it is a declining business. While GameStop shares slumped in early trading Monday on news of the share sale, they recovered a bit as the day wore on, pointing to investor optimism for Cohen\u2019s plan.\n\n It is a prudent and necessary move. With GameStop\u2019s share price up nearly 900% this year, the company will be able to raise significantly more funds to expand its e-commerce capabilities. The turnaround plan outlined in its latest annual report includes building fulfillment operations for faster delivery times, overhauling its website and starting a U.S.-based customer service operation. All these initiatives are needed to improve GameStop\u2019s customer experience and will require significant investments.\n\n GameStop\u2019s latest executive hire may tip off even bigger ambitions. Last week, the retailer said it had appointed Elliott Wilke as its chief growth officer. Wilke spent the last seven years in senior roles at Amazon, including stints at Amazon Fresh, Prime Pantry and Worldwide Private Brands. His experience at the e-commerce giant\u2019s private-label business may mean GameStop intends to some day launch its own branded hardware products such as gaming mice, keyboards and other higher-priced items such as gaming PCs. If successful, this kind of move could generate higher profit margins much the same way as Amazon\u2019s AmazonBasics and Costco\u2019s Kirkland Signature product lines.\n\nIn another noteworthy development, GameStop has ramped up its offerings in the PC gaming hardware market in recent weeks. The retailer is releasing five-page weekly ad circulars focused on this niche, selling items such as $400 gaming monitors and $1,000 Nvidia graphics cards. PC gaming is a large and growing area and is not cyclical like the retailer\u2019s core console-gaming market. On the back of its better-known brand, GameStop should be able to take market share from other PC e-commerce players such as Newegg and Micro Center.\n\nIn just a few months, Cohen has revamped GameStop\u2019s senior management, adding executives with the required relevant technology backgrounds, while setting a clear vision for the company\u2019s future and moving further into attractive product areas. This is an impressive amount of progress in a short time frame. With the coming fund raise, the company will have the capital to fully execute on Cohen\u2019s vision. The so-called smart money should take notice.",

So naturally if you were to look at most of the tickers that make up those composites you will see that they are down from where they were 1-2 months ago.

The new CPU and GPU power share tech is next level and is going to make it difficult for Intel to keep up until they start to offer their own GPU, until then Nvidia will still own the GPU market. AMD is a strong CPU and GPU producer and may knock Intel off their thrown sooner rather than later.  Full disclosure I hold stakes in all 3 of these companies.",

Now they have their eyes set on Nvidia in the GPU arena. I do not think Nvidia is as complacent as Intel but still have never been challenged. This last series by AMD really has pushed them into a 1-2 punch of top end CPU and GPU combos that can compete on both ends. They are still a bit behind at the ultra top end with server technology and production processes so Nvidia is on lock but with how the market is for GPUs and crypto they will sell regardless. I could see AMD push the boundaries versus Nvidia with server based gaming and other areas with their amazing momentum. I bought at 78 but anything below 100 is an amazing price.",
