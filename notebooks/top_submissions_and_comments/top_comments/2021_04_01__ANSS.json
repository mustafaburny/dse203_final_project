I use both AutoCAD (2d drawings) and Inventor (3D drawings, analysis) daily.\n\nAutoCAD is terrible, and i only use it because it can make nice technical drawings for reports. Everything in the software is so awkward and non intuitive. I could honestly not imagine a company, serious about it's spendings, use money on this. Yet it's the industry standard.\n\nInventor is amazing for 3D drawings/ solid models. Very intuitive, can easily read parameters from Excel sheets, and in general very effective at parametric design just works. The FEM (analysis) part is quite over simplified, and the competitor ANSYS does a MUCH better job. \n\nIf I were a company, I would probably not pay to have my engineers use Autodesk software, and thus, would not invest in their stock.",

That said, we will need perfect numbers to start the next leg up or a breather to let things cool off.

        "body": "I feel some similarities in our strategies. Personally I seem to look for the long term fundamentals which will make a company successful and but them when investors become short term pessimistic. My largest holding is AVGO which I began buying heavily in 2020 in the 200s. I've also added alot of LMT over the last few months when it was in the low 300s. CRSR is one I am beginnng to like as well under $35. Feel free to DM me if you'd like and maybe we could bounce some ideas off of each other.",

As of 4/5/2021, I see qqq ETF is most likely reach 330 in a week and make all time new high in a month. However, it cannot go straight up without pullback. Sometimes those pullback could be very deep. The worst thing could happen is that qqq falls to the very bottom when you truly need to cash out from it.  Find something less volatile and delivering constant divvy.  You may even build your own high yield fund by investing several stocks such as KO, RIO, and AVGO.",
