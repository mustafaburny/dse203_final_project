Oh and she\u2019s going to the Caribbean in a few weeks for another trip. \n\nThe point is that there\u2019s a lot of idiots out there and just because you lost money doesn\u2019t make you one.

Consumer cannabis extract net revenue decreased by $1.5 million as compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by a loss of market share for vaporizer products.\n\nOverall, this is another ugly \"progress\" quarter from a company that was on the brink of distress.
