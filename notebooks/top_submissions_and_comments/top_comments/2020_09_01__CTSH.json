I asked why and she said it was because she couldn\u2019t afford it. That would be understandable except she took not 1 but 2 trips around the world last year. I think she went to Morocco and then to Indonesia on the other trip. Oh and she\u2019s going to the Caribbean in a few weeks for another trip. \n\nThe point is that there\u2019s a lot of idiots out there and just because you lost money doesn\u2019t make you one.

The big trend all investors (for both Canada and US) should be cognizant of is the effect of price compression on top line revenues. \n\nAurora is selling a lot more cannabis, but decrease in sales price is weighing down revenues. \n\n&gt; Consumer cannabis net revenue1 was $35.3 million, a decrease of 9% over the previous quarter. **Total volume of dried consumer cannabis sold increased by 36%, but was offset by a 30% decrease in the average net selling price per gram** of consumer cannabis1 as the Company's value segment brand, Daily Special, accounted for a greater percentage of consumer cannabis net revenue, at 62% of flower revenue compared to 35% in the prior quarter. Consumer cannabis extract net revenue decreased by $1.5 million as compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by a loss of market share for vaporizer products.\n\nOverall, this is another ugly \"progress\" quarter from a company that was on the brink of distress.

Those are *not* my recommendations, just my top performing holdings.\n\nI'm self taught and ignorant about a lot, but try to learn. But I do have an investing philosophy. One of the big investing mistakes I think we all make is believing that how things are now is how they will always be, so I try to buy for a better future. And along with fundamentals I buy what I believe in, and what I've seen and used.\n\nI do socially responsible self-directed investing. So I try not to buy anything that makes money directly from fossil fuels, war, harming people or animals,, prisons, poor treatment of immigrants, refugees, or asylum seekers, or, predatory financial industries, or any other industries that cause people, animals, or the environment harm. I think there's a fair argument to make that I'm breaking this rule to include tech companies like Facebook and some biotech, so that's my failure to work on. But my investments since the early 2000s have beat all the markets, and all the funds, just by choosing to have principles and trying to invest in companies that do good.\n\nI also own other green energy, tech, grocery, railroads, data/commercial real estate, biotech. In the early 2000s I bought the companies that have become big tech, right now I'm buying transportation, biotech, 5G, AR, VR, and green energy companies along with companies I think will do well during the upcoming COVID-19 repeat. Despite the awful world we live in, I believe a better future is possible.",
