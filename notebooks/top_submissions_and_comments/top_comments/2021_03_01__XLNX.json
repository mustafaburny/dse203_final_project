Luckily, they're one of the causes of the chip shortage, since they were selling out in the summer and putting in big orders, so while it hurts their stock now, they're still doing fine fundamentally.\n\nI'm actually down 18% on AMD, and unbothered. But I do some firmware engineering and I'm really thinking the Xilinx tech is going to be integrated to speed up i/o on new datacenter offerings that will come out in a few years. Normally I only care about technicals, but this one I really think is going to do well in the 2-5 year range. I don't hear any analysts saying that they're buying Xilinx to use the tech, everybody seems to think they're just doing it defensively because Intel bought Altera.\ud83d\udc7c",

XLNX is currently around $125 per share, while AMD is about $81 per share. According to the exchange ratio, XLNX should be valued at about $81 x 1.7234 = $139 per share. Of course, there may be risks that the merger doesn't actually happen but AMD got regulatory approvals in the US already. Just waiting for China now. I'm not sure how options work when a company's shares get converted though...",

        "body": "Yes, it makes a lot of sense, the problem is, it makes too much sense, and so too many people are already doing it and the prices are too high. Apple isn't actually in this group, though, they're trading almost exclusively on consumer preference, not tech, and they're a chip supplier to nobody.\n\nThe only reason I hold AMD is that I think the market doesn't understand the two patents AMD announced recently; I think they're part of a single future server product, based on my electronics engineering experience, and the market analysis think these are separate things. Including the public engineering analysis I've seen. They'll likely grow their server market share anyway, but that's already priced in. I think they're going to use their Xilinx acquisition on their x86 server chips, to speed up IO and offer mixed-type server chips with programmable IO interconnects. Nobody else thinks they're doing that, so the smart money is that I'm just a nutcase.\ud83e\udd23\n\nBut once the details of the new US fabs are more clear, and they get closer to being operational, then there will be a lot of opportunity for speculative investment in small-cap competitors for those retail products. I don't see that hitting AMD or Intel, but the microcontroller vendors, MCHP, NXPI, SLAB, TXN, etc could come under pressure.\nNvidia isn't that exposed on the graphics side, but their networking side could get disrupted. Hard to know at this stage.\nI don't think any of this risk has been priced in, because the fab details aren't clear enough. But there is certainly risk there for all these companies.",
