I can of course invest this directly via IB in any set of mutual funds/indexes, but my bank is offering to invest it on my behalf in some mutual funds (Accenture, Black Rock) with around 6% fixed income pa. Dividends are monthly (but I don't need them).\n\nHere's the issue - I know that the returns through my bank will be lower, and after fees my returns will be 5-6% pa. BUT they are offering me leverage of 1:1, thereby matching my investment. They will charge around 1.6% financing on the $100k they will put in, with the caveat that they assume no risk on their contribution and if things go real bad, a margin call could risk all of my investment (I don't understand this point well).\n\nWhat's the catch here? It seems too good to be true that they will double my investment for 1.6% of the combined returns? I will ask them if they will match my investment for funds of my choice (maybe index funds or something), but if they don't, this still seems like a good option. Isn't it better to invest \"$200k\" instead of $100k? I assume this also only applies to the dividends, with any capital gain on the fund going to the bank?\n\nWhat questions should I be asking? What calculations should I be making?",
