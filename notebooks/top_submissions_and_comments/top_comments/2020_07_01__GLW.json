[A couple days ago, Corning reported that they will ramp up production for vaccine bottles.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/13/coronavirus-vaccine-corning-glass/)\n\nCorning also makes glass for phones and electronics.

Spend time using electronics, [which motivates people to buy electronics.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-corning-stock-to-ride-strong-demand-for-phones-and-tvs-analyst-says-51593618555)\n\nSo far, based on my \\*very\\* technical analysis of looking at the stock price chart, it seems to me that Corning is one of the few companies that hasn't bubbled up off of COVID hype, and is still down compared to their prices from January this year. \n\nSo, my advice: don't buy the bubble, buy the bottleneck",

Valor glass. Same Corning update suggested that this sales levels would materialize upon the product\u2019s \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d by the market. Reasonably likely that demand from clinical trials and production of Covid vaccine/treatments alone would be sufficient to satisfy the threshold for \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d if not more; not surprising per se, covid is merely a catalyst. If true, then the marginal contribution of Valor sales to the bottom line will be substantial.\n\nLinks to referenced sources:\n\n [Pharmaceutical Glass Packaging 2017](https://s22.q4cdn.com/662497847/files/doc_news/disclosure/valor_FAQ.pdf)\n\n[Examining Supply Chain Risk For Pandemic Preparedness](https://pharmablog.syntegon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/06/whitepaper-Corning-Valor.pdf)",

The big question I haven't been able to answer through googling is how quickly companies can take drugs from phase 3 completion to filing the NDA. I imagine it takes a year if they're being aggressive, so if we say \\~3mo until phase 2/3 studies finish, 1 year to NDA, and 6mo to approval, that's almost two years from now, if we're very lucky (I'd say luck is on our side with how many companies are taking their shot at this) \n\nThat being said, from the perspective of Corning, I think drug companies can be pretty sure if they will see approval soon after Phase 3 completion (and publication of the results), so I imagine they will put in their big order of vials before the NDA is filed.",

For some officials to say, \"we will not go back into lockdown or close businesses\" and then a couple days later close down businesses, they must be receiving enough intel/pressure to know they're going to lose far more tax revenue in the long run if they try and keep everything open through a huge holiday weekend and just shut everything down on Monday 7/6.

Apple only has a limited amount of devices it needs chips for and they have plenty of margin to cover the cost so they're fine. \n\nSwitching from x86 to arm, it should be a performance loss, but arm chips are like real good now. The chip in the latest iPhone gets 1327 points single thread in Geekbench. Your full on \"best gaming\" processor is like 1,720 points.

And as you pointed out, the Geekbench single core score is 1327. If we keep apples to apples and go with the fastest mobile processor Apple uses, the i9-9880H in the 16\u201d MacBook Pro, it scores 1265 single core on Geekbench. [And for the coup de grace, Intel sells it to OEMs for $556.](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/192987/intel-core-i9-9880h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-4-80-ghz.html) Get the leading processor in mobile single core performance for $399, get the screen, battery, cellular modem, software, and profit margin all for free. Or pay $556 for a slower chip and still have to build the rest of the computer around it. \n\nNow obviously the i9 doubles the multi core performance, but on the other hand, only doubles? For that much of a price difference? And the GPU built into the i9 nearly quintuples the GPU built into the phone. But these aren\u2019t traditional strengths for Intel. Right now if you want multi core or GPU, you go to AMD. Intel stakes it\u2019s claim in the industry on being *the* fastest single core performance, for the smoothest gaming/microfinancial trading/what have you. And Apple is catching up in a phone for a fraction of the price. It feels like a steamboat being outpaced by a rowboat. \n\nAnother note on GPU, if you want more GPU performance, it scales really nicely with area. You just make a bigger chip. Now it\u2019s harder to cool and more expensive, but those are two of Apple\u2019s greatest strengths here already. Obviously the same is true of multicore. Apple just needs to make it bigger. I know their chip design people know that. The processors coming in Apple Silicon Macs are coming to dominate. Within two years they expect to have a chip that\u2019s a replacement for the freaking Mac Pro. From there? What if they bring back Xserve and make another go at the server market? At that point it\u2019s a matter of interest, not a question of capability.",

For some officials to say, \"we will not go back into lockdown or close businesses\" and then a couple days later close down businesses, they must be receiving enough intel/pressure to know they're going to lose far more tax revenue in the long run if they try and keep everything open through a huge holiday weekend and just shut everything down on Monday 7/6.

This has started to decay a bit in recent years, but the last time AMD had the better CPUs in the processor space (a couple of decades ago) you still could not buy a PC with an AMD processor because of various contracts Intel had with the PC manufacturers.\n\nThis is no longer an accurate description of the market. AMD and Intel are both widely available in basically every single OEM's product lineups. I'm sure there's a few random OEMs out there that only use one chip manufacturer for accidental reasons - they got a good wholesale deal, or they have a limited lineup of models and it was easier to use a single chipset - but in general AMD is equally available from all the big OEMs.",

Their CPUs are currently smashing Intel in terms of price to performance, and thir GPUs are significantly cheaper than Nvidias, alebeit with less performance.\n\nNvidia is the market leader in terms of GPUs, have just signed a deal with Mercedes and their next generation of GPU is said to be coming out later this year. With a significant performance increase, you'll be able to get a 2nd tier GPU from the new generation, which will outperform the 1st tier from the previous generation, giving them an even more sizable lead over AMD.\n\nSomeone mentioned in a post here that the future could be APUs - essentially you wouldn't need a GPU becuase the computer's CPU is so powerful it runs all the graphics requirements. And at the moment AMD and Intel do offer some APUs, but right now they are no match for having a dedicated GPU. We're probably 10 years or so away from APUs taking over, if they do.\n\nI personally hold a position in Nvidia.",
