        "body": "Guy below me explained it well. I wasn't saying all companies will go bankrupt. Some are very healthy companies and chips will be needed now more than ever. Very low chance of them going bankrupt unless a catalyst comes forward in the near future (I'm not a psychic). But like I said, just cause a company is in an industry with a positive outlook does not mean today, Nov 19, 2021, is the perfect time to hop in.\n\n(I'm not a financial advisor)\n\nMy picks on Semiconductors is Skyworks $SWKS for potential growth, Qualcomm $QCOM for stability. Skyworks is a smaller market cap company who supplies chips to industries in IoT, infrastructure, medical, defense, and more recently, automotive. Would I hop in right now? Nope, but I'm eyeing it.\n\nPS ratio 5, PE ratio 17, PB ratio 5, no LT debt in the past 7 years until last quarter actually. Industry has positive outlook (chips). Great margins, Gross 50%, netting 30%. Since 2014, lowest ROE has been 19%. In other words, for every investor dollar they have, they are making 20 cents. Very effective return industry, and market wide (be careful when other companies have high ROE. Taking on debt will increase ROE but as I mentioned, Skyworks has had no long term debt in the past 7 years until last quarter. Some companies take on debt which makes their ROE attractive). Debt-to-Equity ratio has been 0 since 2014 (no debt) until last quarter which puts them at ratio 0.42. Still a very low ratio. Trading volume is relatively low and high enough for liquidity purposes. \n\nBy far the greatest company I have found in the semiconductor industry. The only thing that pushes me away is the high PS ratio. Would consider only purchasing below $110. But guess what, if it doesn't reach it, that's fine too. I missed it, big deal. There's always, or will be, another one.\n\nQualcomm is a stable company with similar ratios. But at a $200B market cap, not much room for a high multiplier like $SWKS.",

        "body": "How about making your own ETF for Undervalued Dividend King Blue Chip Telecommunications stocks?  As often happens, the worst performers of the recent past become the best performers in the near future. So my recommendations for this fictional ETF are T, VZ, VIAC and SWKS.  All way down from their highs and unfairly so and all big dividend payers. T especially, though their div gets reduced to \"only\" 5% after they spin off Warners-HBO and then you get Discovery-Warners stock plus the original T stock.  The market seems to be pricing in a complete failure by HBO Max-Discovery-Warners as well as Paramount Plus. I disagree on both counts. You can burn through Netflix and Disney in a few months and have nothing left you are eager to watch, so people need multiple streaming subs to stay entertained. I also don't buy that movie theaters are ever going to be what they once were, only for big wide-screen type epics would I ever bother going to a theater again and I used to go to the movies 100 times per year.",

The most undervalued is VIAC which reportedly has been hijacked by hedge fund short sellers manipulating it downward despite plenty of good news for the actual company in the real world. Two others are the big telcos T and VZ, both very cheap with large dividends. JUst a buyer's strike for the last 3 months or so.  Then there is SWKS, a big Apple supplier and also diversified chip company.  Maybe the cheapest high-end chip company. All four of these have been bad losers recently, but IMHO all are now coiled springs.  I al down 100 K on paper with these but if I had cash I would buy them all now without fear.  Meanwhile 90% of my money has always been in AAPL and today is a great day for AAPL holders, and because AAPL's PE is still 30% lower than inferior company MSFT's, I recommend that as well.",
