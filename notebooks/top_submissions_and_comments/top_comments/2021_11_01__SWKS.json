        "body": "Guy below me explained it well. I wasn't saying all companies will go bankrupt. Some are very healthy companies and chips will be needed now more than ever. Very low chance of them going bankrupt unless a catalyst comes forward in the near future (I'm not a psychic). But like I said, just cause a company is in an industry with a positive outlook does not mean today, Nov 19, 2021, is the perfect time to hop in.\n\n(I'm not a financial advisor)\n\nMy picks on Semiconductors is Skyworks $SWKS for potential growth, Qualcomm $QCOM for stability. Skyworks is a smaller market cap company who supplies chips to industries in IoT, infrastructure, medical, defense, and more recently, automotive. Would I hop in right now? Nope, but I'm eyeing it.\n\nPS ratio 5, PE ratio 17, PB ratio 5, no LT debt in the past 7 years until last quarter actually. Industry has positive outlook (chips). Great margins, Gross 50%, netting 30%. Since 2014, lowest ROE has been 19%. In other words, for every investor dollar they have, they are making 20 cents. Very effective return industry, and market wide (be careful when other companies have high ROE. Taking on debt will increase ROE but as I mentioned, Skyworks has had no long term debt in the past 7 years until last quarter. Some companies take on debt which makes their ROE attractive). Debt-to-Equity ratio has been 0 since 2014 (no debt) until last quarter which puts them at ratio 0.42. Still a very low ratio. Trading volume is relatively low and high enough for liquidity purposes. \n\nBy far the greatest company I have found in the semiconductor industry. The only thing that pushes me away is the high PS ratio. Would consider only purchasing below $110. But guess what, if it doesn't reach it, that's fine too. I missed it, big deal. There's always, or will be, another one.\n\nQualcomm is a stable company with similar ratios. But at a $200B market cap, not much room for a high multiplier like $SWKS.",

As often happens, the worst performers of the recent past become the best performers in the near future. So my recommendations for this fictional ETF are T, VZ, VIAC and SWKS.  All way down from their highs and unfairly so and all big dividend payers. T especially, though their div gets reduced to \"only\" 5% after they spin off Warners-HBO and then you get Discovery-Warners stock plus the original T stock.  The market seems to be pricing in a complete failure by HBO Max-Discovery-Warners as well as Paramount Plus. I disagree on both counts. You can burn through Netflix and Disney in a few months and have nothing left you are eager to watch, so people need multiple streaming subs to stay entertained. I also don't buy that movie theaters are ever going to be what they once were, only for big wide-screen type epics would I ever bother going to a theater again and I used to go to the movies 100 times per year.",

The most undervalued is VIAC which reportedly has been hijacked by hedge fund short sellers manipulating it downward despite plenty of good news for the actual company in the real world. Two others are the big telcos T and VZ, both very cheap with large dividends. JUst a buyer's strike for the last 3 months or so.  Then there is SWKS, a big Apple supplier and also diversified chip company.  Maybe the cheapest high-end chip company. All four of these have been bad losers recently, but IMHO all are now coiled springs.  I al down 100 K on paper with these but if I had cash I would buy them all now without fear.  Meanwhile 90% of my money has always been in AAPL and today is a great day for AAPL holders, and because AAPL's PE is still 30% lower than inferior company MSFT's, I recommend that as well.",

This one is a good overview but it focuses more on futures but the stuff is generally applicable to stocks as well: \"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications\". Use z-lib or some other book pirating sites\n* Try and stay away from price action because that's the most suspect of all technical analysis. On the other hand, algorithmic/system trading is arguably the most rigorous of technical analysis based strategies.\n\nIf you want to learn about fundamental analysis\n\n* Learn about multipliers and other fundamentals e.g. P/E, EBITA, EV.\n* Learn how to make financial models e.g. Here's Martin Shkreli teaching how to build a financial model with IBM as an example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fASInVKShnM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fASInVKShnM) (disclaimer, I think this particular valuation turned out to be wrong so focus more on the techniques/models used rather than specifics about the companies) and here's DeepFuckingValue valuing GME [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U). I think they make this type of dry stuff more \"accessible\" for the average person?\n* Read some books. I've heard intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham is good, although I haven't read it so see what the others here think\n\nBut honestly, just buy ETFs and save enough to retire.",

After that, click on the Portfolio &amp; Management tab to see the funds they are investing in and the percentages.\n\nAs an example, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund:\n\n[https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vttsx](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vttsx)\n\n&gt;scares me a little due to the risk.\n\nWhen going 100% stocks during your younger years, you will definitely experience market volatility. In 2008, a portfolio like this lost approximately 40% of it's value but only those that sold their holdings to move to 'safe investments' (bonds, stable value) ended up locking in their losses. Those that did not sell and stuck to their asset allocation strategy, ended up in a far better position after the recovery (even if they bought at the all time high just before the crash).\n\nI previously sent you this link too:\n\nBogleheads thread about shifting to bonds:\r  \n\r  \n[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=328019](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=328019)\n\nThis Dave Ramsey rant is one of my favorite, it reminds us to \"ride the wave\":\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saxGhOb3kn0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saxGhOb3kn0)\n\nArticle I like on Bob, the world's worst market timer:\n\n[https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/)\n\nThe biggest lesson I wish I learned when I was younger: I should have focused more on increasing my *contribution rate* and not so much on my *investment returns*, the contribution rate (how much you are actually investing) can have a greater impact on your success.",

She is a light spender so in the eyes of Uncle Sam she only made like $20K last year. \n\nThey also advise us on taxes and things to even assist my personal wealth building, such as what income point filing jointly or separately provides a net benefit to our marriage.",

But he wasn't really an agent, although he obviously helped them.  He was a \"journalist\" but his job description was mostly to \"entertain\" American visitors.  These Americans were carefully vetted before being invited to Russia and upon arrival he did things like get them drunk, make Russia look really good, and try to get them in slightly compromised situations.  Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.  That was the majority of KGB \"spy\" operations.\n\nWhen it comes to Evergrand, cui bono? China.  So whether intentionally carrying weight for China or just useful idiots victimized by CCP intel operations, NYT is carrying water for the **CCP who desperately wants to unload assets before the rest of the world catches on**.  This is the exact **same play they ran for the pandemic** when they vacuumed up PPE across the globe while denying human to human transmission.",

Except, it's not doing what it's normally doing on the daily candlestick chart... it's trading flat when it's normally trending down right now, which is actually kind of weird and strong.  \n\n\nAnd the reason for that is because most of the retail numbers are actually pretty good and most of the macro indicators are really good. Jobs from July on were just revised up by almost \\*700,000\\* jobs. In these earnings reports, there's some mention of inflationary troubles for some companies, but there's also significant news about how companies are starting to bring prices down to move volume, which is expected... inflation, it turns out, likely is actually transitory... just not \"transitory is like a month\" like all of the ADHD newb kids think.  \n\n\nOil's going down. At the port, shipping container backlog is down 25%. There's just a TON of great macroecon data.  \n\n\nFor retail, margins suffering in the short term doesn't result in market insolvency in the long term, and the big drag on the market was V... Visa has a ton of issues, almost none of which have to do with retail or inflation and everything to do with the fact that their business model is being disrupted by BNPL and Visa's starting to lose vendor interest.  \n\n\nIf you actually zoom out the graph, the market's actually still on a very strong upward leaning bullish streak for the month... these Bear theses need major work.",

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

It's not the wheel, which alternates between put-selling and CC selling. \n\nYou can take advantage of the leverage options provide by synthesizing long shares through a deep ITM call, or a backspread like a ZEEHBS or ZEBRA. If you want to buy and hold the shares, that's a totally legit strategy. I personally don't like covered calls. It's weird to me that they seem so popular. The return is incredibly low and you constantly have to defend them, if you want to keep the stock. Not worth the time and effort IMO.",

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",
