The biggest companies on earth are abandoning their data centers.  It is simply more cost and risk effective.  Will it happen tomorrow? No. But it is a fact that pure cloud is going to be the dominant way IT departments function in the future.

        "body": " \n\nHey there, this is Tom, this is one of my accounts, not sure which as I tend to lose passwords and end up making new accounts... :). I just finished reading this post and I want to stress I have no hate or anger towards the OP, but I'd like to offer my side of story if you may:\n\n1. I think the OP should have disclosed he is managing a competing youtube channel in the same niche as me. Its a smaller channel and it is pretty much the same content and audience. Not saying he did this to clout chase, as I am sure his motives are pure, but he needed to disclose this fact and omitting it is kinda weird... (especially since he posted this exact post in multiple YouTube promotion groups...)\n2. He couldn't find my intro video after viewing it once: That is because it will only auto play for first time visitors, for repeat visitors the page plays the recent video posted instead of the intro. That point amused me...\n3. I only do small cap stocks and trendy stocks: here is an excel spreadsheet which I keep of every stock I covered, Its open to my subscribers to audit me at any moment. You will soon find out I cover large cap blue chip stocks (apart from 2 stocks) like CRM, MSFT, ORCL, FTNT, TSLA, TWLO and many others. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bR4KloyKmRXqY-Eh2nG-fs4-yRqDpfnkTpCYIgh1Q3E/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bR4KloyKmRXqY-Eh2nG-fs4-yRqDpfnkTpCYIgh1Q3E/edit#gid=0)\n4. He couldn\u2019t find my credentials on social media: I\u2019ve said this many times before that Tom Nash is a stage name, I am a Russian guy and this name is not my legal name. Exposing this seems to me a bit strange after I made a video explaining that months ago. My real social media is obviously not under this name and since I want to keep my privacy I won\u2019t disclose it ever. I want to protect my own identity. I got a family and kids so I think most of you would agree that is the smart move. Saying my credentials don't show up on my fake profile on linkedin is kinda funny...\n5. I did other youtube channels, including gaming, audio and youtube education: My youtube passion is not something new, I was doing youtube for years, including educational content and even an audio channel. I could have deleted these old channels but I keep them up since its NOT a secret lol. One channel is called gearly reviews and we posted once every few months. We actually have a few videos that got millions of views there and I\u2019m proud of that channel. Which I wish I had more time to work on. My youtube educational videos are mostly gone now since it\u2019s trash but some can be found here and there and they are cringe. I do still run a youtube group for creators and I posted about it many times on my channel asking people to join if they want to do youtube. It\u2019s sponsored by TubeBuddy and we plan to revive it and post much more content there to help creators. I always did youtube on the side as a hobby and obviously I was trying to find my audience and become a full time YouTube, this was always my dream and exposing this item is kinda pointless. I even had a gaming channel called gamernomics but it\u2019s gone now since I feel I was so cringe. I\u2019m still a massive gamer though even with 3 kids... for me saying I was always passionate about youtube and using the fact I tried to break through as proof I\u2019m a fraud is strange lol. Funny enough I only broke through when I quit my job and went all in on this channel without a safety net.\n6. My guru exposed videos: I loved doing guru exposed videos but I kinda shifted away from this since it\u2019s very taxing emotionally being negative and going at people. When I moved into the stock scene it wasn\u2019t as big and in fact my views took a hit. My Ignite and NKLA videos used to get massive views which my stock videos will never get but I love it so I\u2019ll keep doing it. It\u2019s true I have no courses or affiliate links on my channel but I do have channel membership and a big Patreon community, since I am trying to make it into a viable business, don\u2019t think there is something wrong here.\n7. As far as work, and what I did. It\u2019s very simple. After graduating from Umich I was lucky to even find a job in 2009. Started as an intern at a major investment bank for 40k per year and moved my way up. Eventually moved up to senior analyst. Never claimed I was managing director or a VP or a stock broker lol. I then moved back to my country and got a job at one of the BIG4 companies (EY, PWC, DTT, KPMG). Just so you know every big4 has a multiple divisions and I ended up working for the financial division doing valuations, due diligence and a lot of transnational work related to M&amp;A. My job was to look at financials and find out how valuable the company really is. Eventually burned out and quit to decide to go in on YT and here we are.\n\nNo hate from me to the OP. It\u2019s all good. Much love Tom.",

        "body": "Thanks for this addition.\n\nI guess the buzzword for vendor is depending on where you look as all I hear is that the management interface and the distribution of ruleset is so much better on the Check Point gear. That said Check Point is not only a firewall. It's an IPS blade with a firewall. Something (some of) the others charge extra for.\n\nThe sentiment for \"all cloud\" is not my thing. I don't believe in cloud-only for a cross-sector and industry as the replacement for on-prem. Cloud may work on a broad scale for some industries and sectors but I recon we'll see more agnostic and hybrid environments being the norm when we're done buzzwording (as if that ever happens in infosec lol). At some point in time regulation may follow but some things simply don't work well in the cloud (legislation and other outside factors).\n\nAbout IaC, I see Check Point being much more on-par than for example Cisco. I haven't worked with Fortinet or Palo Alto although we had a sales meeting with Palo Alto for some of the \"Next Gen Slideware\" they had which I (personal preference) did not like at all. I really do believe that the government wide investment into Cyber Security that Isreal has made will benefit the vendors from there. Cyberark may also be one to benefit although they are far to expensive for my liking atm.\n\nAbout Fortinet. I haven't had time to proper dig into them yet but the fundamentals python code I've got really have them as a candidate for a rocket in price.\n\nI'm glad to see a fellow Security-person here :-)",

        "body": "The tech sector is in a shit spot now. Explains why it has an even worse downturn. PLTR had a sell volume of 69M today at market open.\n\nPLTR might still be dropping until about 21 or 20 maximum imo. \n\nI hope it recovers though. It is a cybersecurity company that worked on US government military contracts and with the CIA, recently had a contract with IBM but IBM had a garbage last report (with the pervious ones also being bad) also, so I do not see much +++ in the following 1-2 weeks. After that it might get better I hope.\n\nIn the long run/big picture a tech company is always a good investment unless their employees are completely braindead. I wouldn't say they are so stupid in this example since they have worked with the military and they should not be lenient work partners imo.\n\nThe behavior pattern I have noticed with PLTR is that when all the other stocks are doing poor PLTR is still doing well or it is sometimes Workhorse GRP, the traders need something to fill their daily trades even on red days.\n\nThose days are mostly just up and down jumps and lots of short selling on a 1-5 minute time range.\n\nThey did unlock the stock from the IPO either today or it might be on Friday, not sure about this information though. \n\nAny time a \"hack\" attack happens or similar security breach, this stock also tends to have a somewhat of a rising. Similar with other companies for cybersecurity like Fortinet, Qualys and Splunk.\n\nIn general I would say to stay away from this until late evening Friday 21:55 and then buy and hope for next Monday market opener to be a better restart.\n\nNon legally binding advice.\n\nI do own the stock.",

        "body": "*\\*\\*\\*Disclosure: I have roughly $30,000 invested in AMD so my opinion might be biased.* \n\nPersonally, I think it is a great time if any to invest in AMD. Main reason why is that recently the stock saw a dip from the 100 down to the mid 80s level mostly due to hedge funds deleveraging because of the whole GME fiasco so you are buying it at a discount in my opinion. \n\nAnother reason why is that AMD is a classic turnaround story. It wasn't too long ago that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy due to failing product lines, but now it has CPUs that can rival and even outperform Intel and the specs for their GPUs shows they can actually go foot to foot with Nvidia. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the market for CPUs and GPUs are still growing so I don't really expect a deceleration of the company's revenue growth. \n\nLastly, keep in mind that the Gov is still doing QE infinity, that and the trillions of stimulus they are gonna give out this year means it is a perfect environment for risk assets, so don't overthink it.",

        "body": "I think you underestimated the importance of TSMC. Just think about how many things today's use chips, TVs, cars, computer, data center, phones, cameras. About half of them are from TSMC (based on market share). Now apply the current auto ICs shortage to every sector. That's what will happen if China invades Taiwan. We are not going to see a collapse of TSM, we are going to see a Great Depression. I dont think the western powers will allow that to happen.\n\nAlso the fact that TSMC is the largest fab and has the most capacity but is still at full capacity tells you the world needs IC. Apple, AMD along takes away so much of their 5nm and 7nm slot already. The fact that Nvidia didn't produce their rtx3000s in TSMC is actually bullish because TSMC couldn't care less about it to lower its price to compete with Samsung. \n\nOn the topic of Samsung, their fab is the only threat to TSMC. However, it has been shown from time to time that TSMC process is better, in terms of performance and power. Apple once used both TSMC and Samsung to produce one of their iPhone processor. You can Google the result, but basically TSMC wins in every metrics.\n\nIntel on the other hand, is a closed fab meaning they do not produce chips for other companies. They only make their own stuff. So even they figure out their 7nm, it is not a threat to TSMC. On top of that there is no capacity in TSMC for Intel (said TSMC). \n\nThere are many other fabs in Taiwan outside of TSMC. And they are all getting the benefit from TSMC being at full capacity. It will be interesting to see if they can take all those orders in and grow or TSMC will increase its capacity faster.\n\nOther ealier concern is China. It is spending a lot of resources in chip manufacturing. However, this is no long a issue because of US sanctions. ASML and other key equipment manufacturers are not allowed or limited to sell to China. This basically put a chock hold on Chinese fans. Unless they can develop their own equipment, there is no chance for them to catch up to Samsung or TSMC.\n\n\nThis is my two cents. I'm increasing my holdings whenever I can on a 2~3% dip day. I don't see any competition in the next 5~10 years minimum.\n\n\nTLDR: This world need ICs. TSMC has 55% share in it. So you want in then buy TSMC. This is not going to fall into the hand of China, or there will be greater concern than TSMC share price.",

I hold tsm for many years and recently increases holding when the price dropped, I will grow old and retire on this stock. I hold dual citizenship of Taiwan and us, I'm so proud of this company and I get news about tsm in Taiwan as well since my family back home is also tsm share holder; tsm  is building another plant in Taiwan because they have so many order that they can't fill, in Taiwan they have manufacture factory running 24 hours  day, only close for the Chinese new years. Tsm has been making chip for apple for over a decade and would likely continue to do so. Intel is 2 years behinds TSM and I have made so much money from tsm through out the years and never actually buy and hold until last year summer that I bough the share for less than 60 and now is over 125; my gut feeling is that tsm should hit 200 by the end of 2021. I can't wait until they build the Arizona plant is us.\n\nso if you notice any Asian fund/etf,  pacific emergent market fund always have large holding in tsm, I guess if you can always invest that way as well\n\n* for those worry about china invading Taiwan,- what china wants it's the economy, tech skill that Taiwan has, ( Taiwanese people are one of the hardiest working people, 1 us dollar is 28 twd, more than 60% of twain population are  millionaire  per twd currency) when china invades Taiwan and bomb the county then it will have  nothing,  there are too many rich company and people invest in the small tiny island county.",

Sure, Apple might jump to the next process sooner, but the rate of big impact new processes is getting slower and slower over time, so they can't keep that up forever.\n\nMeanwhile, if AMD can keep competitive long enough, the whole datacenter market opens up, and they have previous experience with that market from last time they were competitive whereas Apple are literally building from zero and succeeded in spite of B2B, rather than in B2B.",

Is it allowed to operate more or less as it was, except with more pressure to hand over it's trade secrets to China?  Does China get first pick of it's output?  Does it get straight up nationalized?  Does it get destroyed in the fighting?  Is it such a strategic resource that assorted powers destroy the factories to keep them out of China's hands?\n\nI think something happening in this regard is almost a certainty inside of 10 years.

        "body": "This is probably going to be a fairly long post, so I'm going to preface it by saying I'm not a financial adviser and have no non ETF semiconductor holdings. I work in a field that has semiconductor companies as a pipeline, so I have talked to senior manufacturing managers and know some tool owners (mostly intel fwiw) which theoretically gives me an above average understanding of how a CPU goes from design to market. As far as I know everything I'm about to say is publicly available, but if this post disappears on you...I was probably wrong on that. Do your own research before making a decision either way.\n\ntl;dr, no. AMD is likely overvalued because people don't understand how the semiconductor industry works.\n\nThe first thing to note is that AMD already has a lot of growth built into its price with a P/E of ~80. I do think AMD will grow, their leadership appears competent and the job postings I see on linkedin are what I'd want to see from a semiconductor manufacturer trying to grow, but 80 is a lot.\n\nI've seen a lot of people just assume that AMD has a technology lead over intel because they won this generation, but that's just incorrect. Intel has a much more challenging process that requires significantly more manufacturing know how to actually produce economically. Intel is still best in the world by a lot when it comes to actually working on silicon. One bad process generation where AMD's safer approach won out doesn't change that. Maybe we can revisit this in a decade, but for now I'm not putting much thought into one data point.\n\nSpeaking of generations, this is a long term industry where at any given moment you are working on 3 different process generations (at least that's how intel does it. I assume others are similar). One market team, one industrial development team (one generation out), and one design team (two generations out). The industrial development team moves to the market team when the generation they developed comes to market, and the market team becomes the industrial development team. The design team doesn't actually work on real silicon, so they're always two generations out. Presumably intel will largely not be retaining a relatively large portion of this current team, but either way it'll take quite a while to see what the true effects are because the semiconductor industry is hardware and hardware is slow+hard.\n\nAlso keep in mind that each process generation is kind of radically different from each other. Some parts remain the same, eg an argon plasma surface treatment will probably be a step in the next process generation too, but R&amp;D is still the best predictor of future success in this field and intel simply spends a lot more than AMD does.",

AMC and BBBY are seeing a similar approach while shorts positions were added to BB and NOK. Any near term weakness on these high flyers may result in further buying pressure from remaining shorts.\n\n\u2022             Not everything was covered: DUK, WISH, TFC, APD, FIS, CCL, VIR, NOC, STZ, PLAN, DG and INTC all saw moderate shorting activity.\n\n\u2022             REIT\u2019s \u2013 SI rising in this space \u2013 SUI, EXR, EQIX all saw material shorting.",

It was never a gamble either because I picked an established company in a healthy sector. What'd I spend the money on instead? Weed and beer?

Intel is currently at 56$ from being 68$ February last year.   \nIntel has now hired back a number of great people that used to work there before and have made a lot of great products.   \nDo you think there will be an increase in about a year?  \n\n\nMain source:  [Intel is Staging a BIG Comeback! - WAN Show January 22, 2021 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_YBydPNp70)",

However, it makes no technical sense to me.\n\nTSMC is already overbooked for their 7nm and 5nm fabs.  They have many loyal long time high paying customers, Qualcomm, Apple, Nvidia, AMD and there is no way TSMC would delay their orders to accommodate Intel.  To increase fab capacity to accommodate Intel's core i7 and i9 lineup would require a wafer production increase by around 33 to 40% which is could require more than 50 billion dollars worth of additional factory equipment.  TSMC wouldn't risk fab spending for Intel if there was even the slightest remote risk that Intel would go back to producing their own processors in the future.  In contrast, there is absolutely no chance that Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm will start producing their own chips and end their business with TSMC.",
