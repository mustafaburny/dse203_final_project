All of these features are being disrupted by cloud-native products like Cloudflare, Zscaler, and cloud providers like AWS/Azure.\n\nThe \"cloud\" sentiment is happening whether its your thing or not.  The biggest companies on earth are abandoning their data centers.  It is simply more cost and risk effective.  Will it happen tomorrow? No. But it is a fact that pure cloud is going to be the dominant way IT departments function in the future.  We'll see \"hybrid cloud\" for a while, but it wont last.  \n\n\nRegulatory and compliance requirements are changing regulations to accommodate cloud only environments as everyone agrees this is the way forward.  \n\n\nI don't think that Checkpoint is a *bad* investment.

        "body": " \n\nHey there, this is Tom, this is one of my accounts, not sure which as I tend to lose passwords and end up making new accounts... :). I just finished reading this post and I want to stress I have no hate or anger towards the OP, but I'd like to offer my side of story if you may:\n\n1. I think the OP should have disclosed he is managing a competing youtube channel in the same niche as me. Its a smaller channel and it is pretty much the same content and audience. Not saying he did this to clout chase, as I am sure his motives are pure, but he needed to disclose this fact and omitting it is kinda weird... (especially since he posted this exact post in multiple YouTube promotion groups...)\n2. He couldn't find my intro video after viewing it once: That is because it will only auto play for first time visitors, for repeat visitors the page plays the recent video posted instead of the intro. That point amused me...\n3. I only do small cap stocks and trendy stocks: here is an excel spreadsheet which I keep of every stock I covered, Its open to my subscribers to audit me at any moment. You will soon find out I cover large cap blue chip stocks (apart from 2 stocks) like CRM, MSFT, ORCL, FTNT, TSLA, TWLO and many others. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bR4KloyKmRXqY-Eh2nG-fs4-yRqDpfnkTpCYIgh1Q3E/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bR4KloyKmRXqY-Eh2nG-fs4-yRqDpfnkTpCYIgh1Q3E/edit#gid=0)\n4. He couldn\u2019t find my credentials on social media: I\u2019ve said this many times before that Tom Nash is a stage name, I am a Russian guy and this name is not my legal name. Exposing this seems to me a bit strange after I made a video explaining that months ago. My real social media is obviously not under this name and since I want to keep my privacy I won\u2019t disclose it ever. I want to protect my own identity. I got a family and kids so I think most of you would agree that is the smart move. Saying my credentials don't show up on my fake profile on linkedin is kinda funny...\n5. I did other youtube channels, including gaming, audio and youtube education: My youtube passion is not something new, I was doing youtube for years, including educational content and even an audio channel. I could have deleted these old channels but I keep them up since its NOT a secret lol. One channel is called gearly reviews and we posted once every few months. We actually have a few videos that got millions of views there and I\u2019m proud of that channel. Which I wish I had more time to work on. My youtube educational videos are mostly gone now since it\u2019s trash but some can be found here and there and they are cringe. I do still run a youtube group for creators and I posted about it many times on my channel asking people to join if they want to do youtube. It\u2019s sponsored by TubeBuddy and we plan to revive it and post much more content there to help creators. I always did youtube on the side as a hobby and obviously I was trying to find my audience and become a full time YouTube, this was always my dream and exposing this item is kinda pointless. I even had a gaming channel called gamernomics but it\u2019s gone now since I feel I was so cringe. I\u2019m still a massive gamer though even with 3 kids... for me saying I was always passionate about youtube and using the fact I tried to break through as proof I\u2019m a fraud is strange lol. Funny enough I only broke through when I quit my job and went all in on this channel without a safety net.\n6. My guru exposed videos: I loved doing guru exposed videos but I kinda shifted away from this since it\u2019s very taxing emotionally being negative and going at people. When I moved into the stock scene it wasn\u2019t as big and in fact my views took a hit. My Ignite and NKLA videos used to get massive views which my stock videos will never get but I love it so I\u2019ll keep doing it. It\u2019s true I have no courses or affiliate links on my channel but I do have channel membership and a big Patreon community, since I am trying to make it into a viable business, don\u2019t think there is something wrong here.\n7. As far as work, and what I did. It\u2019s very simple. After graduating from Umich I was lucky to even find a job in 2009. Started as an intern at a major investment bank for 40k per year and moved my way up. Eventually moved up to senior analyst. Never claimed I was managing director or a VP or a stock broker lol. I then moved back to my country and got a job at one of the BIG4 companies (EY, PWC, DTT, KPMG). Just so you know every big4 has a multiple divisions and I ended up working for the financial division doing valuations, due diligence and a lot of transnational work related to M&amp;A. My job was to look at financials and find out how valuable the company really is. Eventually burned out and quit to decide to go in on YT and here we are.\n\nNo hate from me to the OP. It\u2019s all good. Much love Tom.",

        "body": "Thanks for this addition.\n\nI guess the buzzword for vendor is depending on where you look as all I hear is that the management interface and the distribution of ruleset is so much better on the Check Point gear. That said Check Point is not only a firewall. It's an IPS blade with a firewall. Something (some of) the others charge extra for.\n\nThe sentiment for \"all cloud\" is not my thing. I don't believe in cloud-only for a cross-sector and industry as the replacement for on-prem. Cloud may work on a broad scale for some industries and sectors but I recon we'll see more agnostic and hybrid environments being the norm when we're done buzzwording (as if that ever happens in infosec lol). At some point in time regulation may follow but some things simply don't work well in the cloud (legislation and other outside factors).\n\nAbout IaC, I see Check Point being much more on-par than for example Cisco. I haven't worked with Fortinet or Palo Alto although we had a sales meeting with Palo Alto for some of the \"Next Gen Slideware\" they had which I (personal preference) did not like at all. I really do believe that the government wide investment into Cyber Security that Isreal has made will benefit the vendors from there. Cyberark may also be one to benefit although they are far to expensive for my liking atm.\n\nAbout Fortinet. I haven't had time to proper dig into them yet but the fundamentals python code I've got really have them as a candidate for a rocket in price.\n\nI'm glad to see a fellow Security-person here :-)",
