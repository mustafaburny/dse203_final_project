Extremely undervalued after the Coronavirus fears. I think people are seeing their value and this buying opportunity wont last long. AZUL share price tripled from roughly $15 to $45 over last 2 years before Coronavirus struck. Extremely cheap to get into a company with a solid management team.\n\nTechnical Analysis. The price just crossed back over the 50 Moving Average the other day with a Golden Cross as the 10 MA crossed over the 50 MA the other day. Volume has been insane. Last month was the highest volume in AZUL history. The RSI just passed back over the 50 line by a large margin on the daily chart, first time since before Coronavirus. Also, the end of week close closed at almost the high of week, a good sign this bull run will continue. Brazilian airlines are about a month behind US airlines with Coronavirus so expect this one to do the same as all the US airlines have already done in price.  The future of AZUL is looking bright.",

Even if they get official approval, the government and general population will still be very much against foreign payment providers. Whchat, alipay and UnionPay already offer a well established, widely adopted, and arguably superior homegrown alternative. There is nothing to be gained by Chinese companies and people to adopt visa/MasterCard. It will simply be a more expensive and more beurocratic alternative, that you can't even use as no small business owner will go through the trouble of setting it up. Even for traveling abroad it will be useless, as most tourist destinations in Europe and Asia already accept the Chinese payment services just like they do American ones.\n\nOtherwise I fully agree with your post.",

Plus buying amazon and  Tesla means you won\u2019t have much left to invest and diversify your portfolio. That means you will be tied down to few shares. There are many other companies that are trading lower and it will take them time to rebound. Like Boeing, Pepsi and coca cola also solid companies not crazy growth ahead but they are stable companies. Microsoft is another good one with visa and MasterCard. Hope that helps.

Typically all merchants using Square will be using the specific processor and merchant acquirer that is Squares. This means, the fees charged to merchants for transaction processing will be going to Square, who then will pay Visa their share.\n\nThe whole system is broken to separate pieces where everyone gets a share.\n\nThere are gateways, which let people submit transactions to processors.There are processors, who process the transactions and communicate between gateways, merchant acquirers, and the card holders card issuing bank.\n\nThere are merchant acquirers who basically act as the bank for the merchant is primarily the one liable for funding transactions to the merchant, and receiving incoming funds from transactions. The Merchant Acquirer and the Card Issuing banks are where the money is actually moving.\n\nThe card issuing bank is Chase, or your credit union, whatever bank actually issued the credit/debit card in use.\n\nAnd there are the card network providers, Visa, Amex etc.. who get money because all of it is running on their services.\n\nAnd in this mix and match are some companies that do one or all parts of the roles.  \n\n\n  \nLong story short, all of financial digital services get their cut, and really they are all fighting to see who gets the most customers to have the biggest cut. Like every other business. But Visa, Mastercard, Amex, are not quite the same as Square, Paypal, etc... As currently all credit and debit card services operate off of the card services network infrastructure that those companies have implemented.",

From their 10-K, 2019 operating margins were 57.3%, while Visa's was 67.2% - so it's a 10% difference, not 20%.\n\nAs for why, that can largely be attributed to scale. Mastercard is 3/4 the size of Visa, and operating expenses for payment processing are relatively fixed, so the more scale you get the higher margins.",

If you are asking how much stocks of an individual company you should buy: I'd recommend buying 100 at a time, this way you can do options. if you can't afford 100 at a time, no worries, buy however much you like.\n2. If you are asking how diversified you should go in terms of how many companies to invest in: I'd say invest in however many companies you want to. Hard to say exactly how many is good, but it's a good rule to try to diversify into multiple different industries. For example, don't put all your money into bank of america, wells fargo, jp morgan, citi, visa, mastercard, and american express. Try to diversify into technology (MSFT, NVDA, intel, AMD, etc), energy (COP, etc), and other stocks you just like.\n\nHave fun above all: trading stocks can get stressful",
