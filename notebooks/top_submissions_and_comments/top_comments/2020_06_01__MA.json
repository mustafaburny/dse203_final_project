Extremely undervalued after the Coronavirus fears. I think people are seeing their value and this buying opportunity wont last long. AZUL share price tripled from roughly $15 to $45 over last 2 years before Coronavirus struck. Extremely cheap to get into a company with a solid management team.\n\nTechnical Analysis. The price just crossed back over the 50 Moving Average the other day with a Golden Cross as the 10 MA crossed over the 50 MA the other day. Volume has been insane. Last month was the highest volume in AZUL history. The RSI just passed back over the 50 line by a large margin on the daily chart, first time since before Coronavirus. Also, the end of week close closed at almost the high of week, a good sign this bull run will continue. Brazilian airlines are about a month behind US airlines with Coronavirus so expect this one to do the same as all the US airlines have already done in price.  The future of AZUL is looking bright.",

As more businesses want to challenge Amazon, Shopify is the go to for the means to do so - see Walmart partnership a few days ago.\n\nTrade Desk - Continued success and poised for exponential growth as programmatic television becomes more mainstream.  There are competitors, but the market is big. I have a crush on the CEO after every conference call.\n\nVisa/Mastercard - we have been catapulted into the future of a cashless society.

Even if they get official approval, the government and general population will still be very much against foreign payment providers. Whchat, alipay and UnionPay already offer a well established, widely adopted, and arguably superior homegrown alternative. There is nothing to be gained by Chinese companies and people to adopt visa/MasterCard. It will simply be a more expensive and more beurocratic alternative, that you can't even use as no small business owner will go through the trouble of setting it up. Even for traveling abroad it will be useless, as most tourist destinations in Europe and Asia already accept the Chinese payment services just like they do American ones.\n\nOtherwise I fully agree with your post.",

Plus maybe wait a few weeks before starting. That being said most companies seem good what you choose above . I don\u2019t know what kinda risk you want to take but Tesla is very volatile . Plus buying amazon and  Tesla means you won\u2019t have much left to invest and diversify your portfolio. That means you will be tied down to few shares. There are many other companies that are trading lower and it will take them time to rebound. Like Boeing, Pepsi and coca cola also solid companies not crazy growth ahead but they are stable companies. Microsoft is another good one with visa and MasterCard. Hope that helps.

Bitcoin does a great job at protecting those transactions which will mean it always has some value.

Contrast that with the USD or Euro and the confidence you have that tomorrow 2 bucks still gets you a pound of chicken. \n\nIf you cannot defend your position on bitcoin, you should reconsider it.",

        "body": "You probably should have closed 5 minutes before close but maybe QCOM rockets tomorrow and also has high IV, resulting in you making even more money.  I'll discuss my trade and perhaps my thought process will help you, but keep in mind what I did may not yield the highest profit (i.e., you might make more by holding).\n\nI bought 1 QCOM 12 JUN 20 85c at 0.52 at 11:40 am ET ([proof](https://imgur.com/a/voVXNSz), the times in the trade here are Pacific but I use Eastern in the post so people don't get confused) and closed at 3:55 pm ET at 1.87.  In light of the other activity in the option chain, I was confident that this unusual option activity (UOA) was not an arbitrage play (e.g., conversion or reverse conversion).  That said, the UOA volume on calls doesn't tell you if the \"smart\" money was short or long in the position (i.e., in the 22,000 that resulted from the 35,000 volume yesterday, how many of those 22,000 contracts is the smart money long or short on, it's one or the other).  I did not look at the history to see the skew between calls and puts, but perhaps selling calls might have netted more premium in the event of a decline in QCOM (e.g., instead of buying puts at a higher premium and profiting when the stock declines, maybe they were looking to sell a call at, say, 0.50 and with a market decline, buy to close their calls at, say, 0.25).  But I ultimately concluded that the smart money being short on the calls was highly unlikely in light the QCOM's presence in the 5G arena and then some; and, therefore, I was fairly confident that the smart money was bullish on QCOM and therefore long on all of these calls.  How confident?  1 contract worth, lol...but this more or less stems from me selecting--in a testing type way--UOA to participate in and gauge my analysis of the UOA.  I want to see if I am analyzing things correctly before I go to 5 or 10 contracts.\n\nWith such large activity on the call side, the market maker who is short all of these calls is in a risky situation since they are short \\~22,000 calls at this strike price alone (remember, other UOA was present on calls at other strike prices).  That means the market maker may, but not necessarily, start buying stock to hedge its position against these short calls.  Why does this matter?  If the market maker chooses to hedge, this can cause a rally because the market maker is buying TONS of stock.  Perhaps that's what happened today, or maybe the market maker didn't hedge and the rally is attributable to something else.  To me, it seems like the market maker hedged by buying shares because of the absolutely staggering increase in volume on the stock (not the option) starting at around 2:40 pm.  Who knows, maybe this volume wasn't the market maker.  I welcome any thoughts on my analysis.\n\nNow, why did I close at 3:55 pm?  I looked at one thing (because the position was already doing very well):  The volume on the 12 JUN 20 85c at the time.  It was around 20,000-21,000 (I don't remember exactly).  I interpreted this to mean that the smart money had closed most, if not all, of their long calls.  We'll find out tomorrow morning when we look at OI.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/Pkd9wly) is a picture of the option chain after close (it shows OI and volume).  I'm guessing the OI will be around 5,000 or less.  If the smart money is closing, I wanted to follow suit and so I did.  Why does it matter?  If the rally was indeed a result of the market maker hedging its position on all of the short calls it held, then after it's need for the hedge disappears, so too does its need for the shares and a sell off by the market maker can (but not necessarily) occur.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/viVMkyu) is a picture of the afternoon rally.  I got one of the highest prices when I closed.  Within the last 5 minutes after I closed my position, the premium dropped to around 1.70.  You can see the last trade in the option chain picture is 1.71.\n\nHope all of this helps.  Again, I welcome anyone's feedback on my analysis!  And who knows, maybe I missed out on profits by closing at 3:55pm.  Time will tell.  Regardless, I am very happy with this trade.  Good luck to you all!\n\nEdit:  Another possible scenario I thought of is the smart money wanting to enter a large position in the underlying in a short period of time and so to offset the increased cost of the shares they buy in a vast quantity, they buy calls beforehand to reduce their basis in the stock by selling the calls after their entry causes a rally.",

        "body": "\nAs an engineer I implore that you take a look into Cloudflare Workers and Fastlys media optimizations. You have organizations like Reddit using Fastly because the companies are supermassive and can't always commit the same concentrations to processing or security like smaller, lazer focused, mature startups. Fastly and Cloudflare aren't startups anymore - they are pioneers in the modern CDN market where a CDN service is built around specific optimizations. In the case of Cloudflare - it's security. In the case of Reese's, it was peanut butter.\n\n\n\nCloudflare Workers is impressive because it compiles down to web assembly when you're computing requests at the network level.\n\n\nThe point of the thesis is that the demand for all CDN and cloud *infrastructure* has accelerated. The inherent value of the product is evident in Akamais long term survival.\n\n\nLyft, Facebook, Shopify, Stackoverflow, NPM and hospitals are all market mover enterprises that use Cloudflare.  We use Cloudflare at my job for error logging and speed performances (fintech)\n\n\nSeries D invested by Google, Microsoft, Baidu, and Qualcomm:\n\n\n\"So lastly, I wanted to talk about some of our customer wins for the quarter. We had some incredible wins, like a credit reporting service that signed a three-year deal worth $800,000 per year; a major gaming platform with a deal worth over $1 million per year; a reinsurance provider who will pay us $750,000 over three years to protect their network; and a U.S. government agency using a broad set of our platform's features to secure nuclear research for over $150,000 per year. But let me focus on some customers that are uniquely relevant to this moment.\n\nA company, many of us are relying on to deliver food to our homes while we shelter in place signed a deal for over $600,000 per year in January. In March, their demand was up so much, they increased their deal by more than $500,000 per year. One of their goals was to ensure that they could decrease their dependency on Amazon Web Services. They found Cloudflare was not only faster and more robust but also significantly more cost effective.\n\nOne of the largest telemedicine providers in the United States turned to Cloudflare as the crisis set in. They had to shift the majority of their physicians from clinics where they had legacy on-premise security hardware to their homes where, obviously, they did not. As a highly regulated industry, security of patient information is critical. They onboarded their physicians onto Cloudflare for Teams so they could keep serving patients.\n\n...\n\nAnd JD Cloud really fit that bill incredibly well. And so we signed an agreement with them. It's going to take us a little bit of time for us to get that online, but I'm incredibly excited about it. We're adding 50 new cities per year to a total of 150 PoPs across China that will augment the existing network that we have with Baidu\"",

Vinh thinks the request would be granted, and that it would be accompanied by a patent license agreement between Qualcomm and Huawei. Qualcomm for months has been trying to secure a 5G technology license agreement with Huawei, but to no avail.",

        "body": "You probably should have closed 5 minutes before close but maybe QCOM rockets tomorrow and also has high IV, resulting in you making even more money.  I'll discuss my trade and perhaps my thought process will help you, but keep in mind what I did may not yield the highest profit (i.e., you might make more by holding).\n\nI bought 1 QCOM 12 JUN 20 85c at 0.52 at 11:40 am ET ([proof](https://imgur.com/a/voVXNSz), the times in the trade here are Pacific but I use Eastern in the post so people don't get confused) and closed at 3:55 pm ET at 1.87.  In light of the other activity in the option chain, I was confident that this unusual option activity (UOA) was not an arbitrage play (e.g., conversion or reverse conversion).  That said, the UOA volume on calls doesn't tell you if the \"smart\" money was short or long in the position (i.e., in the 22,000 that resulted from the 35,000 volume yesterday, how many of those 22,000 contracts is the smart money long or short on, it's one or the other).  I did not look at the history to see the skew between calls and puts, but perhaps selling calls might have netted more premium in the event of a decline in QCOM (e.g., instead of buying puts at a higher premium and profiting when the stock declines, maybe they were looking to sell a call at, say, 0.50 and with a market decline, buy to close their calls at, say, 0.25).  But I ultimately concluded that the smart money being short on the calls was highly unlikely in light the QCOM's presence in the 5G arena and then some; and, therefore, I was fairly confident that the smart money was bullish on QCOM and therefore long on all of these calls.  How confident?  1 contract worth, lol...but this more or less stems from me selecting--in a testing type way--UOA to participate in and gauge my analysis of the UOA.  I want to see if I am analyzing things correctly before I go to 5 or 10 contracts.\n\nWith such large activity on the call side, the market maker who is short all of these calls is in a risky situation since they are short \\~22,000 calls at this strike price alone (remember, other UOA was present on calls at other strike prices).  That means the market maker may, but not necessarily, start buying stock to hedge its position against these short calls.  Why does this matter?  If the market maker chooses to hedge, this can cause a rally because the market maker is buying TONS of stock.  Perhaps that's what happened today, or maybe the market maker didn't hedge and the rally is attributable to something else.  To me, it seems like the market maker hedged by buying shares because of the absolutely staggering increase in volume on the stock (not the option) starting at around 2:40 pm.  Who knows, maybe this volume wasn't the market maker.  I welcome any thoughts on my analysis.\n\nNow, why did I close at 3:55 pm?  I looked at one thing (because the position was already doing very well):  The volume on the 12 JUN 20 85c at the time.  It was around 20,000-21,000 (I don't remember exactly).  I interpreted this to mean that the smart money had closed most, if not all, of their long calls.  We'll find out tomorrow morning when we look at OI.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/Pkd9wly) is a picture of the option chain after close (it shows OI and volume).  I'm guessing the OI will be around 5,000 or less.  If the smart money is closing, I wanted to follow suit and so I did.  Why does it matter?  If the rally was indeed a result of the market maker hedging its position on all of the short calls it held, then after it's need for the hedge disappears, so too does its need for the shares and a sell off by the market maker can (but not necessarily) occur.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/viVMkyu) is a picture of the afternoon rally.  I got one of the highest prices when I closed.  Within the last 5 minutes after I closed my position, the premium dropped to around 1.70.  You can see the last trade in the option chain picture is 1.71.\n\nHope all of this helps.  Again, I welcome anyone's feedback on my analysis!  And who knows, maybe I missed out on profits by closing at 3:55pm.  Time will tell.  Regardless, I am very happy with this trade.  Good luck to you all!\n\nEdit:  Another possible scenario I thought of is the smart money wanting to enter a large position in the underlying in a short period of time and so to offset the increased cost of the shares they buy in a vast quantity, they buy calls beforehand to reduce their basis in the stock by selling the calls after their entry causes a rally.",

        "body": "\nAs an engineer I implore that you take a look into Cloudflare Workers and Fastlys media optimizations. You have organizations like Reddit using Fastly because the companies are supermassive and can't always commit the same concentrations to processing or security like smaller, lazer focused, mature startups. Fastly and Cloudflare aren't startups anymore - they are pioneers in the modern CDN market where a CDN service is built around specific optimizations. In the case of Cloudflare - it's security. In the case of Reese's, it was peanut butter.\n\n\n\nCloudflare Workers is impressive because it compiles down to web assembly when you're computing requests at the network level.\n\n\nThe point of the thesis is that the demand for all CDN and cloud *infrastructure* has accelerated. The inherent value of the product is evident in Akamais long term survival.\n\n\nLyft, Facebook, Shopify, Stackoverflow, NPM and hospitals are all market mover enterprises that use Cloudflare.  We use Cloudflare at my job for error logging and speed performances (fintech)\n\n\nSeries D invested by Google, Microsoft, Baidu, and Qualcomm:\n\n\n\"So lastly, I wanted to talk about some of our customer wins for the quarter. We had some incredible wins, like a credit reporting service that signed a three-year deal worth $800,000 per year; a major gaming platform with a deal worth over $1 million per year; a reinsurance provider who will pay us $750,000 over three years to protect their network; and a U.S. government agency using a broad set of our platform's features to secure nuclear research for over $150,000 per year. But let me focus on some customers that are uniquely relevant to this moment.\n\nA company, many of us are relying on to deliver food to our homes while we shelter in place signed a deal for over $600,000 per year in January. In March, their demand was up so much, they increased their deal by more than $500,000 per year. One of their goals was to ensure that they could decrease their dependency on Amazon Web Services. They found Cloudflare was not only faster and more robust but also significantly more cost effective.\n\nOne of the largest telemedicine providers in the United States turned to Cloudflare as the crisis set in. They had to shift the majority of their physicians from clinics where they had legacy on-premise security hardware to their homes where, obviously, they did not. As a highly regulated industry, security of patient information is critical. They onboarded their physicians onto Cloudflare for Teams so they could keep serving patients.\n\n...\n\nAnd JD Cloud really fit that bill incredibly well. And so we signed an agreement with them. It's going to take us a little bit of time for us to get that online, but I'm incredibly excited about it. We're adding 50 new cities per year to a total of 150 PoPs across China that will augment the existing network that we have with Baidu\"",

And from what I've been reading that tends to be the case for all UOA moves.\n\nAnyway found this https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-likely-to-sell-smartphone-chips-to-huawei-analyst-says-51590681654\n\n&gt; The government recently issued new rules that will make it difficult for Huawei\u2019s chip manufacturing arm, HiSilicon, to get access to U.S. semiconductor manufacturing hardware.\n\n&gt; Vinh argues that as a result, Huawei won\u2019t be able to use HiSilicon to source chipsets for its cutting-edge smartphones in 2021\u2014and that the company will instead use Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chipset in its flagship phones, the Mate 50 and P50.\n\n&gt; Qualcomm would need to apply for a license from the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security to sell those chips to Huawei. Vinh thinks the request would be granted, and that it would be accompanied by a patent license agreement between Qualcomm and Huawei. Qualcomm for months has been trying to secure a 5G technology license agreement with Huawei, but to no avail.",
