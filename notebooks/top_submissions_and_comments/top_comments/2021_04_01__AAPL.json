Are you looking for a set-and-forget strategy that requires little mind share and little management?\n\nAre you looking to turn 40k into 100k in a short period of time? How desperately would you need the 40k in 3 months? in 12 months? in 3 years?\n\nEveryone here is recommending VOO and VTI because its the best \"set and forget\" strategy. If you want low stress, benchmarked returns, reliable growth, pick this. Any other strategy has good reason to think that it won't beat a VOO/VTI strategy.\n\nBut if you're feeling more appetite for risk, I would take that 40k and invest it in 4 different stocks in completely different sectors. I would pick one of the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and drop 10k in there. Those stocks are ripping right now, and their market dominance is really showing. I would pick a high growth stock in a sector you enjoy. I personally like cloud software and cyber security stocks (ie. CRWD, NET, TWLO, etc). I think green energy is beaten down real good and will see good returns over the next 4 years. Take a look at companies in that space (ie. TSLA, CHPT, ENPH, ICLN?, etc). And fintech is pretty hot as well with higher risk plays in this space (ie. SQ, IPOE, FUTU, COIN, etc).\n\nThere are so many sectors and so many stocks that it can be easily overwhelming.\n\n\nBut my personal advice? Take $30k and dump it into VOO or VTI. Take the remaining 10k and pick 4 stocks you REALLY REALLY like. Something you use every day, something your personally passionate about, something that you will defend to your dying breathe at dinner parties and barbecues. Then buy $2500 of each of those 4  stocks.\n\nThen benchmark your individual stock picking performance against VOO/VTI. Are you better than broad market or worst?",

If you've never read SEC filings before then I suggest starting with something like [Apple](https://investor.apple.com/sec-filings/default.aspx). You don't need to invest in Apple, but reading the SEC filings of a stable company with nothing to hide (they make money hand-over-fist, they don't need to risk the bad PR) serves to illustrate what an honest report looks like. It's your baseline so that if you come across something fishy in a different company's filings you won't fall for it.",

That\u2019s like picking up 5 objects from in your home and saying that the average Facebook market sale value is $100, therefore your portfolio of items from in your house is worth $500. So if you picked up a broom, a garbage can and 3 apple cores, you might have a bit of a hard time selling for $500.\n\nSimilarly, with patents, not all of them are valuable and you can\u2019t take an average and assume that would apply to each individual one.\n\nAlso, if you believe markets are efficient, then the current market value of the patent is embedded into the stock price and likely it would be the delta between what was embedded vs. the sale price.",

If you've never read SEC filings before then I suggest starting with something like [Apple](https://investor.apple.com/sec-filings/default.aspx). You don't need to invest in Apple, but reading the SEC filings of a stable company with nothing to hide (they make money hand-over-fist, they don't need to risk the bad PR) serves to illustrate what an honest report looks like. It's your baseline so that if you come across something fishy in a different company's filings you won't fall for it.",

        "body": "**Highlights:**\n\nApple is selling a single CPU across a wider range of products than any competing Intel or AMD CPU is ever sold. This speaks volumes as to what Apple believes it has its hands on, namely: a CPU fast enough at the quad-core level \u2014 because, scaling-wise, the M1 is effectively a quad-core chip, with four low-power cores to handle low-power workloads and provide a little extra performance boost \u2014 to address a huge range of markets, while drawing so little power, it can also be sold in a laptop.\n\nPart of the reason Apple can get away with doing this is that it\u2019s been selling badly underpowered systems at certain price points. The old 21.5-inch iMacs included a $1,099 option with a dual-core CPU and only a 3.6GHz (no turbo) quad-core at $1,299. Only the six-core iMac, at $1,499, had a CPU powerful enough to even arguably be shipping in a 2021 PC at that price. That matters because, when these systems get reviewed, they\u2019re going to be compared in part with the hardware they replaced. The M1 appears to be faster and more power-efficient than current x86 CPUs, regardless, but it\u2019s going to compare particularly well when the other systems are underpowered relative to what a PC OEM would have been selling at the same price point.\n\nBut lopsided configurations are only part of the equation. Apple couldn\u2019t position the M1 this way if it wasn\u2019t an excellent CPU in its own right. The M1\u2019s dramatically higher efficiency and improved performance relative to x86 allowed Apple to standardize on a single CPU core across a wide range of products and price points. This is in complete opposition to the way PCs are traditionally positioned.\n\nx86 OEMs almost never standardize a product family on a single CPU. If a vendor offers more than one thin-and-light laptop in the same product family, the upper-end SKU will offer a higher-end chip. Workstation and gaming boutiques that offer premade systems follow the same pattern. Step up the price stack, and the amount of CPU horsepower available increases.\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious historical reason for this. For most of the past four decades, higher CPU performance cost more money and was more difficult for companies like Intel and AMD to deliver. In the modern era, performance advances have slowed, and minimum spec requirements have slowed with them. Apple is betting that the M1 is good enough to serve a much larger range of markets than x86 can typically address and that the M1\u2019s innate performance is good enough to satisfy consumers at this range of price points.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t seem like a fusillade across x86\u2019s metaphorical bow, consider the issue from a different perspective: According to Apple, the M1 is the right CPU for a $699 computer, and a $999 computer, and a $1,699 computer. It\u2019s the right chip if you want maximum battery life and the right CPU for optimal performance. Want the amazing performance of an M1 iMac, but can\u2019t afford (or have no need) for the expensive display? Buy a $699 Mac mini, with exactly the same CPU. Apple\u2019s M1 positioning, evaluated in its totality, claims the CPU is cheap and unremarkable enough to be sold at $699, powerful and capable enough to sell at $1699, and power-efficient enough to power both a tablet and a pair of laptops priced in-between.\n\nNo single x86 CPU is sold this way or positioned as a solution to such a broad range of use cases. There are three reasons why. First, PC customers generally expect higher-end systems in the same product family to offer faster CPUs. In the past, both Apple and x86 systems were sold in such fashion.  Second, Intel and AMD both benefit from a decades-old narrative that places the CPU at the center of the consumer\u2019s device experience and enjoyment and have designed and priced their products accordingly, even if that argument is somewhat less true today than it was in earlier eras. Third, no single x86 CPU appears to be capable of matching both the M1\u2019s power consumption and its performance.\n\nApple\u2019s willingness to position the M1 across so many markets challenges the narrative that such a vast array of x86 products is helpful or necessary. It puts Intel and AMD in the position of justifying why, exactly, x86 customers are required to make so many tradeoffs between high performance and low power consumption. Selling the M1 in both $699 and $1,699 machines challenges the idea that a computer\u2019s price ought to principally reflect the CPU inside of it.\n\nApple\u2019s gamble, with the M1, is that its custom CPU performance is now so high, at such low power consumption, that the choice of chip inside the system has become irrelevant within a given product generation. It challenges OEMs to consider how they might spec higher-end systems if some of the higher price tag didn\u2019t have to pay for a faster CPU. It threatens both AMD and Intel with the idea that a CPU with just four high-performance cores is fast enough for the company to 1). Call it an eight-core chip and 2). Position it against the 6, 8, and 10-core Intel and AMD systems that sell for $1,500+ in the desktop and laptop markets.",
