        "body": "I worked for them back when three year contracts were a thing... the amount of stories I could tell... My favourite was one where a young girl who was no older than sixteen had somehow used her phone without registering on her devices data that she used 20 gbs of data. So I call in and say \u201clook dude, there\u2019s gotta be a mistake, she has a blackberry curve and they didn\u2019t take SIM cards so unless she switched IMEIs (something she would have to have done over the phone or online and would have left a paper trail) in the last couple weeks this didn\u2019t happen\u201d. The other guy (we have to call in to Telus office from the store) proceeds to argue with me and say he can\u2019t do anything. She basically got saddled with (I think) a $1700 phone bill and Telus wouldn\u2019t do anything despite it being obvious the mistake was theirs. We also all knew when we sold you garbage, such as the Motorola keyboard phone, the Blackberry Storm, and several other hot garbage devices that were defective as fuck.\n\nAlso, they were charged pay and talk clients to add features and minutes (.25 a minute) when they called the number, charging for things like automatic texts and honestly as a rep, I felt like it was my job in the end to protect the customer from my employer. I will say it has gotten better, and out of the three carriers, I trust Telus more than the other two.",

        "body": "Simple my guy\n\u25cfRetail investors In 2020 have increased by a fuck ton compared to 1900\n\u25cf Coca cola is a consumer product. People need drinks and they are dominant in that market. People have always needed the demand for drinks for 100 of years. If you notice most food and beverage  companies have been around for 100 years but it's not the same for tech. Many tech companies have fallen off after a few years of growth( IBM, Motorola and many other companies)\n\u25cf If the demand for the products of a company simply reduces then the growth of thay company also reduces. This is a cycle we cannot measure and it is purely based off what the company  and its competitors can please its customers  for.\n\u25cf I agree companies will have growth for 20 years too but it's not all companies. It's only a fraction of the companies that will have growth in the next 20 years and they will get exhausted too once the company has no new products to offer which will meet the demands of its customer. The company share prices either declines or offer a good dividend to attract investors.",

Like Radio Shack, they catered too much to the hobbyist crowd, and essentially turned into a glorified RC car shop. GameStop has a chance with adding Razer, Corsair, Thermaltake, EVGA, MSI, and ASUS gear that appeals to a much wider audience. Hell, they could make themselves the best brick and mortar for liquid cooling, which is something that's sorely lacking even considering Microcenter. \n\nI don't think they should focus on stocking every component for every use case, but I think it would go a long way for them if they essentially browsed r/buildapc and kept popular products around while they're popular. Like the 011 Dynamic XL cases everyone has nowadays. A limited selection of AMD/Intel cpus + compatible, typical use case motherboards. Toss in some gamer branded ram like GSkill and a small selection of 650-850W psus, and they're a quick stop for console gamers and pc gamers alike.",

You might be right about tsla and it is definitely richly valued, but as the future moves to a greener future, I expect the tides to turn pretty quickly. I expect tsla to get a bigger piece of that pie than most. You might want to buy a Ford Mach E over a Tesla and that\u2019s fine. There will be a lot of others that think the same way. It reminds me of when LG and Motorola had their \u201ciPhone killer\u201dphones 15 years ago and I had to hear about people telling me how Apple was doomed.

Things like gluing the battery to the board, not allowing people to replace it using software (users will get a \"unable to verify if this a genuine battery\" error, which is straight bullshit. If you call a rep to discuss repairs, their go-to policy is to convince you to just buy a new item. \n\nThat isn't an argument against the quality of Apple products though. In general, they have pretty good build quality (although 2018 MacBooks with their butterfly keyboards would beg to differ, and unfortunately I have one of these).\n\nFurthermore, their shitty policies encourage other companies to do the same. It seems that Apple sets the bar for what is acceptable (removing headphone jack, not shipping chargers, etc), and since consumers are enamoured with their products, they accept this change. This in turn emboldens everyone else to do the same, which normally would have gotten them burnt, but since Apple normalized it they remain unscathed.\n\nAlso, your Dell/MSI laptops were probably significantly cheaper. You're paying a premium to have higher quality products, which is a fair trade. Paying a premium to own less of the physical thing you just bought (software blocks), and then defending the company that does that is just shooting yourself in the foot. It's possible to enjoy something and still be able to criticize it and expect better.",
