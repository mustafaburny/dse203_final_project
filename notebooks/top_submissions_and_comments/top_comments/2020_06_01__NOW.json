The speed at which it is recovering is also normal because every market participant knows the story of past US recessions and economic downturn - they know if you sell your holdings, you\u2019ll regret it down the road. So what\u2019s the point of selling right now if your actually investing for years, decades? None. Especially when it\u2019s super easy to get a loan for rock bottom rates, cash is very accessible for all the big boy investors and institutions. \n\nEveryone constantly downvoted bulls in March for even thinking that a V shape market recovery was gonna happen, for ever thinking we were gonna see ATHs again this year. Don\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten. There\u2019s a lot of remind me bot posts I got coming due soon from March . \n\nOnce again bears, hold this L . Scoreboard don\u2019t lie. You never win consistently. Keep being wrong and stay salty about this. I\u2019m sorry you missed out on the greatest 50 day rally in stock market history.

Now 4 years later, this has more or less come true, and the current business plan that Tesla has set out or implied is to ramp battery production to at least 1 TWh/year and continue growing vehicle deliveries by &gt;40% yearly for the next 5-10 years. Also providing autonomous cars in the Tesla Network, but this is more speculative imo.\n\nFor the last 10 years people have laughed at Tesla for setting such targets, and they have just continued to hit them, or hit very close to them. The business plan that they laid out justifies the valuation. You can of course argue that they are unlikely to hit these targets, but to just say 'lol fundamentals' or 'just hype' is really missing the point here. Betting on Tesla and Elon Musk has proven to be a very good bet in the past.",

Combo that with the ability for anyone to purchase stocks now (robinhood) means more greedy people with little understanding of how a true market works. It truly is a \"stocks only go up\" market. Ride the wave and cash out when you're happy. No point in crying about it in WSB where your post is probably gonna be removed from votes.",

        "body": "this was on yahoo, and credit goes to this dude named Brent. But i thought it was a great read and good insight so i'll post it here. sorry for the wall of text!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nILL TELL YOU WHY YOU SHOULD BUY AND HOLD.....\n\nok so I am not a professional trader. I am an engineer about to wrap up my MBA. I got into trading after research and learning. I researched the company in depth, while they traded low for awhile and had low stock price this is why it is going up and its not artificial....\n\n1. There is not another offering. The S-3 filed today is the results of LAST WEEKS offering.\n2. CEO has a long history of success in the kids production industry. Andy Heyward, look him up. Top employees and content creators came from high profiel projects such as \" The Lion King\" and \"Frozen\"....I hear those movies became popular (sarcasm). This team is leading their entire platform of shows!!!!\n3. They merged two great market segments into one company, Baby Genius and Kid Genius are now \"Genius Brand\" They own\"llama llama\" which already has a large fan base, ontop of the watchers of their youtube channel.\n4. If you look at last years financials compared to last quarter (March 2020), revenues are down BUT when lookign at financials you need to understand their capital structure (equity base, capital base, mix) and if they prefer net income or cash flow. While revenues are down they lowered their operating expenses and paid off debts. This raises the value of the company which makes sense since they planned to offer stock, less debt and operating expense means higher value per share.\n5. They describe in detail what they are doing with the capital raise from MAY 29, 2020 offering. They are developing content and establishing supply channels.\n6. Their platform is set to launch June 15th. This is alread agreed to be on EVERY PLATFORM. They paired with a successful company with history of success in the two different revenue models for the platform. Free to watch with ads (generate ad revenue) and paid subscription base (revenue).\n7. Their platform already has 4000+episode or hours (cant remember exactly which) of content that they own. They are also workign on deals to add other content to their platform.\n8. They have a unique offering that no one else does. A \"Netflix/Hulu\" just for kids....not only that but it is quality shows with educational purpose. Some may dable in that market but GNUS has chosen a strategy of focused market segment....educational, positive for kids 2-11 years old. There is nothing else out there and there wont be for at elast 1-2 years.\n9. The company has been trading low not because of poor performance but because a lot was happening behind the scenes. They were creatign content, the fruit was growing and Juen 15th it will harvest.\n10. Revenue streams....I covered their subscription models from the streaming platform itself, they also own the rights and licenseing for the toys, the images, the music...all of it. They have already signed a deal with Mattel to create the toys and AMazon and Walmart for distribution. HUGE SOLID distribution of products.\n11. Think of the Genius ( no pun intended) timing. Release the platform just as kids are home all day due to summer and COVID. So parents will want to let their kids watch shows, why not the free platform that streams cartoons that enrich your kids? All summer form June to December kids will be gettign pumped full of Genius brand shows.....then hits Christmas! The Toy sales alone will be insane.\n12. They have the rights to the last product Stan Lee created before his death...and Disney doesnt! That alone has potential to be sold off to Disney so that they can keep the monopoly on Stan Lee items and Marvel universe. The CEO is also tight with Warren Buffet and even has a show based around him mentoring kids on finance and international business.\n13. If you still arent convinced, I cant help you but look at Disney+, Netflix, HULU...for years they had to establish the stremaing market so you cannot comapre apples to appels per se but they incurred HUGE debts to create content and then they finally started catching on. GNUS has the advantage to enter an established market and eat up market share.\n\nGNUS is going UP UP UP!",

        "body": "MCD is a good dividend play, good yield and growth. V has a low yield but high growth. I own both. \n\nI own dividend stocks because it makes it easier to hold things like SHOP, AMZN, PAYC, NFLX, GOOGL, NVDA (negligible dividend but I\u2019ll take it). The dividends pay my living expense and the non-payers just sit in my portfolio and get bigger. All my stocks have a job, though not the same exact function. \n\nWould I have been better off with a portfolio of 100% SHOP calls? YOLO FTW? That would have done even better than QQQ, VUG, MCD or V, right? Well yeah, but I want to preserve my wealth as well as grow it. I also want to preserve my sanity. I want to sleep well at night, most nights. If I doubled my  net worth tomorrow it would not have a dramatic effect on my life, but if I lost it all I\u2019d be ruined. I\u2019m too old for that shit. \n\nSo it all depends on your goals and life circumstances too. If you\u2019re young and in accumulation mode, go for capital gains. Dividends literally do not matter to you; total return is all. If you\u2019re old and in withdrawal mode, dividends have a place (so do bonds). Chasing yield rarely ends well though.",
