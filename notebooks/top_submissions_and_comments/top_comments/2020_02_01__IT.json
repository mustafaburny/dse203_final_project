Maybe he\u2019s one lucky mother fucker, but I highly doubt that you just coincidentally buy calls before a massive price increase, and coincidentally convert to puts right as it starts to fall. \n\nThis ain\u2019t the 90s. Screenshots aren\u2019t proof. It\u2019s stupidly easy to fake a web image and make your own graphs and all that. \n\nIf he really did that, good for him. I am just 99% sure that he didn\u2019t.\n\nEDIT: read comment chain below. Go look back at his screenshots. Almost all of them have perfectly rounded numbers. A $XX.00 cost on three of the four screenshots (one was $2.24, the rest were $305.00, $95.00, and $100.00...), a $X,XXX,XXX.00 current value, a $X,XXX,XXX.00 unrealized gain/loss. Except for his most recent post. What kinda account rounds to the nearest dollar in certain locations and not in others? (EDIT 2: apparently this is a somewhat common feature on other apps, so who knows. Still, the test seems way too suspicious)",

JIT for every company is different based on what commodity they are producing.  Automotive parts distribution centers for example consider 3 months supply JIT.  Apparel retail  has already started moving to South American suppliers as an alternative to China, so even if they run a tighter JIT, they have already been forced to find new suppliers in order to get goods quicker and more consistently.  People will work around it,  companies that don\u2019t will be Fucked. But I promise most supply chains are already diversified way more than r/all seem to think.",

Here are my big lessons on the market. \n\n1) Earnings are wayyyy too risky to hold through. Do not hold through earnings. Buy 1-2 weeks out when IV is still low, watch that shit swing up right before the bell on ER day. Sell \\*minutes\\* before 4pm. \n\n2) If a company drops after ER, and if they only missed ER by a little bit, then buy that fucking dip and watch it rip in the coming days/weeks. \n\n3) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. They will fuck your life up. \n\n4) Play the big names, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, V. \n\n5) Red days usually mean green days are around the corner. Load up on red days, sell on green days. \n\n6) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. \n\n7) Do not play biomedical. See EPZM, AIMT. \n\n8) Listen to the old heads here, they have a lot of game. \n\n9) Trust your gut. \n\n10) SELL INTO STRENGTH.",

        "body": "Some DD for all of you regarding \u201ctons of money coming from China to the USA...\u201d i.e US stock market...\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s very difficult to get money out of China to the USA for investment purposes. The annual limit for currency conversion in China is $50,000 USD. Furthermore, the purpose of these conversions must NOT be for investment purposes. It can be for education, vacations, hookers, whatever. Now, of course people can lie, but note that getting caught won\u2019t turn out well. \n\nMy clients who transfer money to the USA for investment purposes do it via a proxy \u201ccountry,\u201d the most popular being Hong Kong. A few years ago (5+), before these currency restrictions went into effect, a lot of wealthy Chinese moved a significant bulk of their assets into HK. They purchased property, life insurance, stocks, etc. Many purchased life policies with the goal of liquidating it after 2 years into cash with very low gains (~0.5-2%). Why do this? Simple. Get money out of China. \n\nEven if these Chinese investors could get money out under some kind of lie, they would still be limited to $50k per person (a family of 4 can convert $200k a year). However, trying to justify little Pang Pang\u2019s college expenses at $200k a year is near impossible. Conclusion is simply that FXI going down due to liquidation has nothing to with SPY going up. \n\nSo what about all those Chinese cash buyers of homes in the USA? Most of them had assets outside of China already. Or, could somehow justify a housing expense for their kids\u2019 education when wiring money from China to close escrow.\n\nSource: industry veteran who had been doing these transactions for a long ass time.\n\nPS yes, there are other ways to get significant money out of China, but that\u2019s a discussion for another day.",

        "body": "\n&gt;I really appreciate you taking the time .....I totally see it now with my MA example. \n\nSure thing, glad you got it. I hate to see people losing money that they shouldn't have to, especially if I can help prevent it by simply helping them work out the numbers! \n\n\n&gt;I could sell the feb 7 $277.5 put and collect Friday\u2019s bid of .85 that would be premium of $850 on 1000 shares. \n\nYup, that's correct (keeping in mind that at Monday's open the prices are likely gonna be different; but you got the idea).\n\nAlso, again, I'd recommend not hitting the bid, but rather trying first at mid price or maybe even a bit better. Eg, I see a 0.85 x 0.90 market on those puts (from Friday). I'd try to sell that put for maybe 0.88 first, and then lower my price penny by penny til I get my fill. I also would lower it all the way to the bid, as I would consider I'm being completely ripped off of I have to go all the way there (unless I had a very strong need to do it, like to close a position to prevent massive losses; but not to open a new one).\n\n\n&gt;And the way to protect myself from a loss would be to close the position early before Im down \n$850 and use my premium to prevent loss ?\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure is clear - and, again, because of Put-Call parity, it applies to both a short put and a covered call trades - is that this premium you receive is not really \"a cushion\", not really a way to protect you from losses.\n\nLooking at the short put trade may actually help to see this thing I'm gonna talk about more clearly, but remember the exact same thing applies to CC, just maybe a bit harder to see as things are a bit less explicit.\n\nOnce you sell that put, you don't \"make 850 USD\". You are making a transaction in which 850 USD are exchanged for something worth 850 USD. You have 0 profits of losses initially. So there isn't really an 850 USD cushion.\n\nYou're effectively getting 850 USD now to assume a liability valued by the market at 850 USD now. \n\nIf AAPL goes down, or if IV increases, the premium of that put is going to increase, meaning that you'll be at a loss: you'll have 850 USD cash, and a liability of more than 850 USD market value. \n\nSay AAPL moves in such a way that the put is now worth 1.00. You're at a loss of 0.15 per share, or 150 USD. You can close everything and take that 150 USD loss. More explicitly, you initially received 850 USD to assume a liability, and then you paid 1000 USD to rid yourself from that liability: a 150 USD loss. Notice that the 150 USD loss doesn't even require you to close your trade: you're at a loss simply because you have 850 USD cash and a liability worth 1000 USD cash. It's an \"unrealized loss\", which doesn't mean \"unreal loss\", it's very real! \n\nIf the position is going against you, you can close it at any time, and take (or realize) the loss. A common threshold people use in short put trades is to not let the loss become bigger than the max profit you were looking at. So in this case, this rule of thumb would lead people to close the short put by buying it back for 1.70, if it starts going that way. People usually talk about this by saying stuff like \"close for a loss at 2x the premium received\". \n\nSo this way of \"protection\" is really just getting out of the position - at a loss! - in order to prevent the losses from possibly getting bigger, much bigger. Sometimes people resist it thinking that they may want to hold longer \"to see if it comes back\": problem is, it may also go further! \n\nThere are many other ways to protect yourself, too.\n\nFor example, you could buy a put at a lower strike. It reduces your profitability, since you'll be spending part of the premium you got to acquire this protection. But it effectively limits the max you can lose. Eg if you buy the 270 put, you'll be paying around 0.62 (mid of 0.60 x 0.64 that I see here), but if AAPL tanks to, say, 250, you'll be forced to buy it for 277.5 (your short put) but you have the right to sell it for 270 (yourong put). The trade off is that now, on 10 contracts, the max profit you're looking at is 230 USD (850 USD from selling the 277.5 usd, 620 USD from buying the 270 put). **This is exactly a vertical spread.**\n\nAlternatively, you could short a bit of stock: this reduces the effect of the put increasing in value (this increasing your losses) as the stock price goes down: the profit on the short balances put some of the losses on the short put. People usually think about doing this kind of stuff when the delta of their short put gets too big and scary. Disadvantage is that if the stock moves up, you lose on the short stock position, and this loss can eventually even get bigger than the profits from shorting the put... so it has to be managed actively. **This is usually referred to as managing or hedging delta (and can be done in other ways, too, like reducing the size of the short put position, or selling OTM calls basically transforming it into a strangle, etc).**\n\nSo many possibilities...\n\nIf you want to explore more about this, check whether your trading platform has some good support for risk analysis for options. You didn't mention what it is, so I'm gonna comment on a few popular ones around here. \n\nToS has an OK tool in the Analyze tab: it works well for simple positions, it's pretty easy to use, but it simply cannot handle a more complex position with many legs without slowing down to the point where it becomes unresponsive for 10s of seconds.\n\nIB has absolutely amazing support for analyzing options portfolios in the Risk Navigator tool: it can handle whatever book of option you throw at it with fantastic performance, and IMO it has an incredibly superior model to ToS's, both in terms of its default settings as well as in terms of offering incredibly powerful ways to tweak it if you want (you probably don't, at least not initially).\n\nRobinhood has nothing. Well, it calculates your \"break even\" for single legs... But frankly, I wouldn't trust even that number without verifying it myself every time as RH is just... well, it's RH. \n\nTastyworks is something I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think this aspect would've changed much, since all I see is they trying to push a \"novel\" risk analysis approach: it sucks in this area. (it emphasizes too much this notion of \"probability of profit\", which is really absurd IMO as it isn't anywhere close to reflecting risk, especially in non-trivial positions). \n\nI'll share a couple of screenshot from IB later when I get to my competition so you can get a sense of what it looks like, and how you can explore ways to possibly protect yourself from big losses.",

        "body": "&gt;That $1.84 loss that you cited is also what I pocket as my profit is it not ?\n\nNo, it's really a loss.\n\nYou'll be selling something for less money than you paid to acquire it, even accounting for the premium received from selling the calls. It's a loss. \n\n&gt;So on 1000 shares thats $1840 in my pocket for 5 trading days assuming MA stays above $285. \n\nNo, at 1000 shares and 10 calls, your account will be worth $1840 less than it is worth today, in the best case scenario.\n\nIf you do what you described, you'll lose 1840 USD with absolute certainty. Maybe more, if MA tanks more than 10% in the coming week. \n\nI'd suggest that you read the calculations again on my previous comment. \n\n\n&gt;So far I have been successful because of the bull market and being conservative with ITM calls. \n\nUnderstanding that your success comes from the bull market is very good (some people would think it comes from ... ? some sort of natural or inherent edge of the strategy?) \n\n\n&gt;I am set up to sell naked or cash secured puts , I just don\u2019t feel comfortable yet doing so. \n\nTake some time to really think about this.\n\nThe trades you said you've been doing (buy shares AND sell ITM calls) and the alternative I mentioned (just selling an OTM put, same strike as the call you'd consider in a CC) are ***exactly the same***. You just feel uncomfortable with selling the puts because you don't see it yet that it's exactly what you're doing (but with 1 less step, so less overall costs).\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable with the risk profile of selling puts, you probably should review your understanding of CC, as you're probably not fully understanding your risks on CC trades. \n\nThis is actually a common theme here, by the way - you're definitely not alone in this fear. At least once a week (usually more) there are posts about people comfortable with selling a CC but uncomfortable selling a put (even if \"cash-secured\") at the same strike and expiration, even though it's absolutely the same position.",

I was hoping you could answer a few questions (please excuse me in advance if these questions sound trivial as I have no experience in real estate/home renovation/development/etc.)\n\n1.) I believe someone else has asked why the property manager who works for you has been so loyal this whole time? From an outsiders perspective it would seem that someone who is able to handle the responsibility of managing all your properties in addition to being able to turn what you basically write are eyesores into quaint turnkey rentals on a tight budget, wouldn\u2019t this employee/subcontractor constantly be approached by headhunters from larger real estate/commercial firms with more lucrative offers of employment? \n\n2.) I live in MA and ever since \u201808 have seen those highway billboards which advertise \u201cwe buy ugly homes\u201d. Now I don\u2019t know whether or not you are familiar with what I\u2019m referring to, but wouldn\u2019t these types of large companies be after exactly the type of properties you are interesting in buying up and renovating? Do you ever face competition from these bigger companies? \n\n3.) Ive seen a lot of people writing that they marvel at the market in MO where you\u2019re able to scoop up properties in the 10k range. Living in MA, which is an extremely expensive state to both buy and rent, I too am astonished that even the most dilapidated home could cost such a small amount of money. \nI remember many years ago when I worked on Cape Cod for the summer, my boss at the time asked if I\u2019d be interested in purchasing his \u201cstarter home\u201d for only 5k. I was a kid back then, with maybe a couple grand in savings, but out of curiosity went to go check out what 5k could buy in Falmouth, MA. When I got there, I wasn\u2019t much surprised to see it was inside of a trailer home community. However, the home (if you could call it one), was horrific. It was actually built on foundation, so it stood apart from the trailer homes surrounding the property, however, it was literally a studio apartment built as a home. The linoleum floor was peeling away everywhere you looked exposing wet moldy wood which stunk to high hell. It was a dump, no one would even consider buying as it was completely unlivable and would surely cost less to demolish and build one of those tiny homes that weren\u2019t in style or known about back then in its place.\nThis is a long winded way of asking what exactly does the phrase \u201cgood bones\u201d mean when looking at homes? Is it mold/rot/insulation problems/pipe issues/sewer plumbing/etc? Or is it mostly referring to the foundation upon which the house rests and the wood/stone which holds it together? \nThanks in advance for any insight you could provide!",

        "body": "Now it's much easier, knowing the exact contract!\n\n\n&gt;My profit would be 315.94-314.10 = $1.84\n\nThat's backwards. Profits are calculated as Sale minus Purchase. \n\nYou're gonna have to buy stock for 315.94. The short 285 call means you're gonna sell stock for 285 (if assigned). You get 29.10 premium for hitting the bid, so you could consider that your sale price is increased by that amount to 314.10 - however, I'd recommend you keep that separate in your calculations, it's easier. \n\nSo you'd calculate your profits as: 314.10 - 315.94 = -1.84. A loss. \n\nHere's how I'd calculate it, which will lead to the same result, but I prefer it more explicitly. Think of cash flows. You disburse 315.94 to acquire shares and receive 29.10 to sell the calls. Under the assumption that the Stock stays above the 285 strike price, you'll then receive 285 when you sell the stock as a result of assignment. Cash flows into your account increase your cash balance, and out of your account decrease it: so money you receive is positive, money you pay is negative. \n\nWith all the cash flows explicit, you'd calculate your profits as: -315.94 + 29.10 + 285 = -1.84. Same value (as expected), just a tad more explicit. \n\nSo your trade generates a guaranteed loss, in the best case scenario, of 1.84 per share. It's worse if MA goes below 285.\n\nWhy's that? \n\nBecause hitting the bid is a really, really bad idea.\n\nMarket orders (or marketable limit orders, ie, the ones that cross the bid-ask spread for an immediate fill) are in general a really bad idea in options, because bid-ask spreads can be extremely wide. This is especially the case for deep ITM options - and 10% ITM for MA (around 23%-ish IV) at 1 week to expiration is super deep ITM. \n\nIn the very least, you should sell that Call for 31.07. \n\n(this is based on the 315.94 MA price you mentioned, and on the bid-ask prices on the options chain for MA that I'm looking at right now, which are stale since this is the weekend; but let's go with it for a moment, for the sake of the explanation). \n\nHere's how I got that number: if MA is at 315.94, a 285 call has 30.94 premium just in intrinsic value. It must have some extrinsic value, too, since there's time until expiration.\n\nLooking at the 285 put, same expiration, I see a 0.13 x 0.27 market. Selling a covered call at strike 285 is the same as just selling a put at that same strike: this means you have at least 0.13 in extrinsic value. Add that to the intrinsic value, you get 31.07 premium that I mentioned. I also said \"in the very least\" because this was calculated based on the bid. But like I mentioned before, you it's a bad idea to trade options crossing the bid-ask spread, so you should look for more than that. \n\nThis idea of looking at the price of the put is due to what's known as Put-Call Parity. Essentially, it's the fact that `Stock = Call - Put (same strikes and expiration)`. Technically, for American options this may not hold due to potential early assignment, but in general you just assume it holds since early exercise is rarely optimal. \n\nFinally, notice that, once again due to Put-Call parity, selling the 285 covered call is exactly the same as selling the 285 put. In other words, you can achieve the very same risk profile by either having +100x MA -1x C285, or by having just -1x P285 (both on the Feb 7 expiration). \n\nSo if you don't have stock yet, and are looking to establish that position, you can instead simply sell the 285 put - better on commissions, better on less bid-ask spreads to deal with.\n\nHowever, if you already have the stock and want that position, you just sell the call (after finding out what price you should get!).\n\nAs a final note, I'm not exactly sure what your reasons for such a trade are, and while they may be valid, it's something that I'd definitely not do. If MA was part of any long term holdings, selling the 285 call is an almost guaranteed way to end up without MA in the portfolio, and there's super low reward in that (between 0.13 to 0.27). If I didn't have MA and was looking for a short term play (in which case I'd definitely do it by selling the 285 put, rather than buying stock AND selling a call), this would be one of those plays in which the reward is so meaningless, and the potential losses - even if unlikely - can be so insanely devastating comparatively, that it's definitely not worth it for me.",

Combined we make right around $200k a year. We have about $95k in retirement accounts and about $10k in savings. We want to continue to grow our retirement savings, and still be able to travel.\n\nWe\u2019re not against taking risks and playing the long game. Thought our single largest Rollover IRA has been fairly flat for the last 10 years (currently at $52k). It\u2019s in a managed account with a financial advisory firm and in a fidelity account. The fees are $628 per month. I believe the fees are destroying my gains. It looks like the fund choices are producing, but the bottom line has felt flat (slightly upwards over the last 10 years). \n\nOut of that $95k, $18k is in a separate Fidelity account in a S&amp;P 500 fund/product. And we have  5 shares of Amazon (totaling about $10k now) and a few shares of Visa &amp; MasterCard (totaling $2.5k). \n\nOur home is valued at about $360k and we have about $250k left on the mortgage. Out two vehicles were both PreOwned, but not inexpensive and we owe about $20k on the 2016 Mini Cooper and $33k on the 2013 Porsche Cayenne. We have about $20k credit card debit we\u2019ve been grinding down the CC debt over time. From as high as $45k or so, to $20k). \n\nMy wife is very good with money. I am not. We money becomes an issue, I tend to look for a different employer. (My job is in pretty high demand and I have a good bit of experience).  \n\nThe two other upcoming expenses we foresee will be buying a preowned Airstream travel trailer and replacing our floors in our home. Other than that, it will be retirement savings. \n\nAny advice would be welcome.",
