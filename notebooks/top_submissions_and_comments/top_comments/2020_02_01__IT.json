Maybe he\u2019s one lucky mother fucker, but I highly doubt that you just coincidentally buy calls before a massive price increase, and coincidentally convert to puts right as it starts to fall. \n\nThis ain\u2019t the 90s. Screenshots aren\u2019t proof. It\u2019s stupidly easy to fake a web image and make your own graphs and all that. \n\nIf he really did that, good for him. I am just 99% sure that he didn\u2019t.\n\nEDIT: read comment chain below. Go look back at his screenshots. Almost all of them have perfectly rounded numbers. A $XX.00 cost on three of the four screenshots (one was $2.24, the rest were $305.00, $95.00, and $100.00...), a $X,XXX,XXX.00 current value, a $X,XXX,XXX.00 unrealized gain/loss. Except for his most recent post. What kinda account rounds to the nearest dollar in certain locations and not in others? (EDIT 2: apparently this is a somewhat common feature on other apps, so who knows. Still, the test seems way too suspicious)",

Here are my big lessons on the market. \n\n1) Earnings are wayyyy too risky to hold through. Do not hold through earnings. Buy 1-2 weeks out when IV is still low, watch that shit swing up right before the bell on ER day. Sell \\*minutes\\* before 4pm. \n\n2) If a company drops after ER, and if they only missed ER by a little bit, then buy that fucking dip and watch it rip in the coming days/weeks. \n\n3) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. They will fuck your life up. \n\n4) Play the big names, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, V. \n\n5) Red days usually mean green days are around the corner. Load up on red days, sell on green days. \n\n6) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. \n\n7) Do not play biomedical. See EPZM, AIMT. \n\n8) Listen to the old heads here, they have a lot of game. \n\n9) Trust your gut. \n\n10) SELL INTO STRENGTH.",
