        "body": "Rationale: Broadcom is currently worth over $800 on a DCF basis, and more like over ~$1200 if it were stretched on the valuation/in line with other stocks.  I know that puts the price off the charts technically and is laughably high, but it is what it is.  I have no idea why its trading where it is.  Usually there is an issue with the stock but its really a straightforward business with a large moat and is universally recommended by analysis's on the street.  The cash flow growth is 11% on average and the dividend yield is almost 5% right now.  Its trading at historically low RSI levels on the monthly (this is where it was before it rocketed 300% the last time around).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith that said, this is my set up.  A 2 year time horizon to see this rocket and a short term put hedge to get us through this virus situation (no idea if further impact will be worth the option but just like to limit volatility on uncertain events).  Taking a chance here and hoping it pays off down the line.",

It's basically a slow steady gain over time.\n\nHowever you could make a lot more with individual company stocks after everything that has happened the last month. There is several stocks that have fallen a lot that have dividends and very likely to also fully recover over the course of the next 1-2 years. \n\nStocks like AT&amp;T, Broadcom, Boeing (wait for FAA approval), ViacomCBS, WellsFargo, and some others.\n\nAll of those are profitable companies that that have at least a 7% dividend or more right now. If those stocks go back to where they were 2 months ago, then you would make way more than 29% than you would from SPY over 1-2 years. Plus get the dividend every year after that. Plus the stocks would go up more over long term of years too. \n\nSo if you want to make as much as possible then buy stocks of companies that dropped a lot with dividends. Just make sure they are profitable companies. But if you do not want to do research and just want to take the easy way then buy an versatile ETF like SPY. You will make less but don't need to research.",

        "body": "I personally have my portfolio designed mostly around generating consistent, safe, and growing income. Before investing in any company you need to identify the strength of the business model, long term growth potential, competitive advantage, and quality of management. Any one of these areas being weak can ruin an investment. If the company cannot continue to grow, then it will not be able to continue raising its dividend. If the business model is not sustainable, then the dividend will always be on shaky ground. If there is no competitive advantage, it\u2019s very easy for a competitor to come in and ruin the growth profile. As we have recently seen with the airlines and Boeing, poor management can put blue chip businesses in precarious positions. Quality should always come before dividend yield. \n\nThat being said, I do have positions in Amazon, Google, and Facebook. I have also considered a position in Tesla but haven\u2019t had the chance to enter at a valuation that I was comfortable with. \n\nCompanies I am targeting during this recession: KO, JNJ, PEP, MSFT, AAPL, DIS, MMM, O, LOW, V, SPG, AVGO, ABBV, CAT, and BAM.\n\nAs always do your own research and analysis on any company. If you aren\u2019t fully convicted in your investment, you won\u2019t have the stomach to hold through major downturns. Also, not all of these companies have reached valuations that I would buy at yet, they are just on my radar.",

        "body": "I'm looking really hard at building positions or adding to existing positions for tech titans and the \"boomer blue chips\":\n\nFor tech:\n\nGOOG, AMZN, and MSFT are all flush with cash to be insulated during the downturn, but are well positioned to capitalize on tailwinds (shift to the cloud for Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud, growth in e-commerce, Microsoft Dynamics) - sure these stocks are only 15-20% down from their peaks, but they're all well positioned for continued growth.\n\nI like V and MA due to the continued shift to online payments in NA but more importantly to credit cards worldwide.\n\nAVGO has strong financials, a healthy dividend, and is a leader in semiconductors - the upcoming shift to 5G and continued push for LTE makes it quite attractive. AMAT is another growth stock in the same vertical that is also attractive and just made a couple recent acquisitions in the space that look promising.\n\nEA is another good stock with strong financials and promising growth in mobile apps - the scheduled release of 2 new gaming consoles late this year has historically correlated with a surge in new game purchases which is why I like them.\n\nIn addition, the Chinese middle class will continue to gain purchasing power and strongly prefers online shopping esp. compared to the West - the market leader in that space is BABA, a clear buy in my opinion.\n\nNon-tech:\n\nSNY has a healthy dividend and strong scale in the pharma space - they have a couple patents on some promising drugs for rare diseases that have high barriers to entry and have strong financials.\n\nJNJ is a tried and true blue chip (Dividend aristocrat) that struggled recently due to the litigation on baby powder, but is well positioned fundamentally and is a strong defensive play.\n\nHUM is among the market leaders for Medicare Advantage plans, and with the Democratic push for a public option, they will likely gain significant business through regulation.\n\nLMT and GD are true and tried blue-chips in the defense industries that are insulated from a recession due to gov. contracts. LMT has the F-35 contract with the government for the next decade in addition, and both stocks offer healthy dividends.\n\nDIS is attractive simply b/c I think Disney + will be a huge long term hit and is well positioned for growth in theme parks and movies to offset hits in their network business.\n\nWMT is arguably one of the few viable potential competitors to Amazon in e-commerce where they are positioned for huge growth in the future due to their established supply chain, strong brand name, and huge inventory and have a solid dividend.\n\nOnce the market shows sign of recovery, I am intrigued by companies in construction and consumer discretionary spending:\n\nCAT, HD, and PHM are attractive stocks with healthy dividends and strong fundamentals - due to housing shortages in the US, once the economy picks up CAT will be in high demand for its equipment. HD remains an attractive home improvement blue chip stock that will likewise benefit. PHM offers a diversified set of housing offerings esp. in the entry-luxury category which makes them an attractive builder to me.\n\nMCD and PEP are strong blue chip stocks with healthy dividends well positioned for growth. PEP has less exposure than KO in soft drinks which is taking a hit due to a shift towards healthier preferences and more in other healthier snacks and drinks. MCD has pushed strongly for growth in China and re-franchising stores which should benefit their operating margins.\n\nFinally, LK is an attractive long-term play as potentially the Chinese \"Starbucks\" and leading coffee chain in a primarily tea drinking nation - with the growth of the Chinese middle class, there is strong growth opportunity here.",

Usually there is an issue with the stock but its really a straightforward business with a large moat and is universally recommended by analysis's on the street.  The cash flow growth is 11% on average and the dividend yield is almost 5% right now.  Its trading at historically low RSI levels on the monthly (this is where it was before it rocketed 300% the last time around).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith that said, this is my set up.

Aside from the usual bug schedule (which cisco is no better/worse than anyone else) their hardware is rocksolid, it really comes down to the software for the API on the devices, or the software of tools to manage it.\n\nCisco is only a leader in the market when you look at the entire breadth of their portfolio because: No one else is spread as thin. Only Juniper comes close and IMO and while i like SRX, it's not a while lot better than Firepower. Their ability to automate though?

It's usually difficult to calculate given all the variables, but this site should help.\n\n\" say I expect the stock to hit $35.50 at some point that day and I would  sell it, I would want to buy a put option because I expect the stock to  go down on Monday. This protects me and provides me with the opportunity  to sell my 100 shares at $36.62 still, when the current price is  $35.50. Correct? \"\n\nNo. If you expect a red Monday and you already own 100 shares of Cisco you plan to sell, you are already dealing with a loss. Furthermore, if you expect the price to go down further you would be good to buy a put contract on Cisco. \n\nIf you want to hang on to your shares of Cisco because you expect them to go up, but want \"insurance\" against that, you could also buy a put contract in case the price goes down.",
