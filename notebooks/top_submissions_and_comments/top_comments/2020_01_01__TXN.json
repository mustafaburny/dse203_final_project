How much do you have?\nMany baby boomers are in this situation. \nI'll give you the same advice I gave my dad.\n\n1) I advise to sell your house/downsize/move to cheaper area.\n2) sell your useless shit. Extra cars, boats,  etc..\n3) scrape all your cash together and invest it\n\nNow, lets say you have 300k, for example. You need about a 10% return to get a 30k income. Then you have probably 20k from SSI benefits,  so 50k salary. Not bad. But how do you get a safe 10% yield? Well, you pick stocks very carefully. Try to get 5% from dividends, and 5% from price appreciation. \n\nHere are some of my picks:\nABBV\nM\nSKT\nCTL\nIRM\nNEE\nTXN\nIBM\nBX\nAPO\nBAM\nKHC\nAMGN\nTSM\nOTEX\nTER\nUL\nNVO\nTM\nMRK\nBMY\n\nnow that is a diversified folio! You should get 4-5% paid out in dividends,  and then be able to pull 4-5% off each year in gains. That'll get your 10% and then the money should last if the market holds up in the 2020s. If it goes down, just stay invested. Lower your purchases, live off social sec for 1 year. Like that.  Alright good luck peace",

        "body": "OK so today we're going to learn how to write spreads like not a retard.\n\nFirst of all, go get a TD Ameritrade account if you haven't got one and grab thinkorswim.\n\nNow, we're going to look at one of the credit spreads I wrote today. TXN 1/24 $133 / $134 calls for 35c. TXN is trading at 129.52. There's a 75% chance this spread makes $35. There's a 25% chance of the spread losing $65. We're going to subtract the average loss from the average gain.\n\n    (35*.75) - (65*.25) = $10\n\nSo if we could make trades like these over and over we'd eventually run a profit of $10 per trade. Wow. That's pretty good and 75% is within our win rate tolerance (&gt;70%) and TXN isn't going to have a dividend during that time. I'm going to make that trade. $35 pocketed.\n\nNow I know that 25% of the time I'm going to lose. So you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to write another trade. \n\nHow about INTC 1/24 $62 / $63 Calls @ 18c? Again. We're going to analyze this trade. Breakeven is $62.18, Intel is trading at 59. POP is 84.91%. Max win is $18, max loss is $82. \n\n    (18*.8491) - (82*.1509) = $2.91    \n\nNot quite as lucrative but it's still positive. The win rate is higher so I'm going to make that trade.\n\nNow what have I done here? I have a 63.75% chance of keeping $53. I have a 3.75% chance of losing $147. I have an 11.25% chance of losing $47. I have a 32.5% chance of losing $47. I've made my chance of winning a little lower but I've also almost completely negated the large loss. I also have made the possible loss quite palatable. \n\nAs I write more trades, the percentage of winning them all will go down but I will have more and more percentage that's positive. As we write contracts with positive EV, our net EV rises. So if we have an average percentage of 75% and our EV rises, there are more and more statistical positions able to show that profit. Right now our options are $53, -$47, and -$147. If we write a fourth option on another stock with a $10 EV the same as TXN, and a 75% success rate we'll have a 47% chance of $88, a 31% chance of keeping $18, an 16% chance of losing $12, a 5% chance of losing $112, and 1% chance of losing $212.\n\nThe big losses are now at the extreme tail and highly unlikely. We've gone from 63.75% chance of seeing a massive profit to having a motherfuckin 78% chance at least some profit. If we do  get unprofitable we're most likely going to be out $12. Now we won't swing as hard on our capital and we won't be sweating buckets and writing dumbass posts on how credit spreads suck.\n\ntl;dr: Find the average profit from a deal and make sure it's profitable before you write it. Write small contracts. Write a lot of them. It'll make profit more consistent and your account less swingy.",

Your primary options for these would be Intel and AMD with Texas Instruments, Broadcomm, etc. as more behind the scenes players that still have a lot of base. Compare prices and valuations of those companies. \n-If one is significantly cheaper than another and you can't for the life of you figure out why, buy it.\n\nThis one worked out great for me with AMD recently and would have been a dream come true if I'd had money for nVidia before they hit big.",
