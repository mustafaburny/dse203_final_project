Ive made good money day scalping bounces off support, holding for like 30mins to a couple hours... \n\nSo I'm a tech tard. I know the cloud software sector really well as well as the semiconductor sector. If you were looking to park money in a stonk then I would stick to tech long term although there are some serious discounts in the banks, REITs &amp; cruises long term (I ignore the airlines due to dilution and possibly long term weak demand, as opposed to the cruises where Americans will fucking flock to even if it was the end of the world)   but there discounts are value plays so beware; personally I 'feel' best investing in the best. I dont want to risk my company losing to another so I go with the fastest growth/strongest market positioning. \n\nIn stonks you cant go wrong with ROKU SQ TSLA long term. All leaders, fast growth, the future of consumer tech (RST is the new FAANG). I'll get hate on here but ROKU SQ TSLA could run 500% easy over the next 5 years. No joke.\n\nIn cloud you will pay a premium to own the best but I would go for it. My favorite positions are AYX (actually not cloud but its a data science platform) DDOG/ESTC (observability/APM/API/SEIM) CRWD OKTA (cybersecurity, ZS is a distant-er 3rd). ESTC AYX probably the best value proposition of these companies right now. CRWD is still a buy and going to new highs by next year easy. \n\nAlso check out SE PDD BILI as Chinese stonks, INSG for 5G, and then basically the entire semiconductor sector especially AMD NVDA MU MRVL XLNX. \n\nPeep VTIQ which is the future Nikola motors as well. Peep INMD which is a high gross margin, high growth aesthetic medical device company thats trading at a massive discount. Peep DXCM PODD also in medi devices; peep VRTX CRSP EDIT NVTA TWST in bio - can also buy ARKG. Hope thats helpful",

If the underlying is tanking due to macro-circumstances, you should not be super excited about opening a CSP on it. JC Penney is a good recent example.\n\n* Bid/Ask spread\n\n* Risk/reward, per exit strategy. If you open XYZ $100p for $5 when XYZ is at $100 and it falls to $20 and stays there, are you really going to just dump the stock for a 75% net loss? You'd have to write CCs for a long time to make up that loss.\n\n* Due diligence on the underlying. Basically the same point as the previous, but it also is a key factor in your forecast.\n\n* An 80% exit is pretty high for only a 70% PoP. Optimal exit for a 45 DTE entry is 50% or 21 DTE, whichever comes first. 75% or expiration is a close second. Source (for SPY, but there are individual stock backtests linked in there too, like for C and MU): https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-strategy-performance/\n\n&gt; Has anyone implemented a similar strategy before? How did it turn out (returns, drawdowns, etc)? What risks am I missing out on?\n\nMany of use on r/thetagang and here are running The Wheel, but a critical factor for success in The Wheel is doing due diligence on the underlying and only entering on those you'd look forward to holding long term.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/",

Why go for a business trip/meeting when they can just use Zoom or Facebook? Not making the shift is foolish, even a blind man can see better than this oracle. What's more BRK is backed by Buffet, if he croaks, so does the stock, he is the face of the stock, regardless of whether he acknowledges it or not. What's more, he doesn't bother about learning technology because he doesn't need to anymore, in 10 to 20 years he wouldn't even participate in the stock market anymore. But the landscape would be vastly different from before, already we see tech giants ruling the market now, I wonder what will happen in the future?",

Boeing, Tyson Foods, GE, IBM, Oracle, all the commodities companies are going to be seeing double digit percentage decreases in their sales and revenues.  I feel like Boeing has to go bankrupt, and so many of their suppliers will too.\n\nThe market for many products, e.g. commercial real estate, airplanes, oil drilling equipment, has literally disappeared, and the stock market has not priced that in yet.\n\nThe Fed has propped up an enormous bubble with their actions, but the economy doesn't reflect what they have created.  \n\nAt some point the central banks will have to let SOME investors get wiped out, and that is going to be a very unhappy day on the stock markets.\n\nFord and GM are in staggeringly bad financial shape, nobody is saying anything about it.  Every major airline is going to be going through a bankruptcy cycle, Disney is likely to lose 75% of their revenue for the year.  How the hell can the indexes be at these levels?",

So why buy Berkshire instead of an index?

Their banners are more and more lowering quality of search and overall search use is dropping due to apps and closed websites. They are big but a niche. Their model works for specific products only.\n\nFacebook is a developing world family and friendship automation. A lot of room to grow in places like Bangladesh. But technology which delivers value to customers is actually simple and they can easily be replaced. They are based on soft value not tech. \n\nAmazon us big in USA. It is a big country which used mail order catalogs way before internet. You can not have a store everywhere in America. Rest of the world isn't like that. They have been adding value to their offering because they want to offer the most for least like all retail but eventually someone will take this over. Just that their competitor can not be in USA or Europe. Europe is too small.\n\nData means nothing to customers. Customers want value for money. Data maybe can help speed up selection within millions of products but this doesn't really work as good as they promise. Ads and e-commerce recommendations are very much off once shoppers are not super easy predictable. Data and AI are a hype.\n\nMicrosoft also is a business software company with some diversification. In business it succeeds just like SAP and Oracle etc. It enters and it is hard to get it out. Not many players there as well as CIOs don't take much risk. But it's success is not because of them but simply because of digitalisation and globalisation. Microsoft itself hasn't created any relevant competitive value. They are just a big political entity in the right time and place. If something changes for them it will also change for SAP Oracle IBM etc. But they appear to be different because of hardware and games (more consumer) and Bill Gates always spent a lot on his PR.",

That's like those tards that bought up all the TP at walmart and then were caught trying to return it in two weeks because nobody was buying. Yea sure some people didn't have enough in the bathroom (savings) and maybe ran low until they implemented purchase limits (unemployment being raised by $600 a WEEK), but fucking again, what TP factories blew up? people aren't shitting more except traders figuratively, so you wait for the next shipment or two that was coming anyway and now you got your TP. Like seriously? They just dumped like 2-3 Tah-rilllllion dollars and most of it to companies to pay people, and to go directly to the one's no longer at companies. So most people have the cash they would normally expect because most people don't make shit. You know how much of that was to pay Buffett what he normally expects? Anybody over 100,000 didn't get what they usually make and if anything they probably sold part of their holdings in the crash. Instead, you have people wondering whether they should get their cash from unemployment or from their employer, worried that they'll get hired back too soon and lose some of it. Yes, hoard cash when the government is pumping out trillions and sell when the market is at a 40% discount. Oracle. Genius.",

        "body": "&gt;Can you explain this? The US industry has been outsourced a lot, how is it industrially powerful?\n\nYes the US produces and licenses several of the most critical technologies around the world. Take semiconductors, the EDA semiconductor design market is controlled by primarily by two American companies Cadence and Synopsys. Without it chips couldn't even be designed. In semiconductor equipment manufacturing USA has KLA Tencor, AM and Lam which are essential to producing chips. This is just one example in the semiconductor industry and the US has several other companies producing high value content and products for the world.\n\nThe US only outsource the low value and admin stuff to developing countries to do as these products are of low Gross Margin or low cost contribution. This makes sense commercially since given future industry is driven by high value industries like high technology manufacturing and digital computing so naturally firms will focus more on . This is also one of the core reason why Trump and China hawks want to fight China as they seek to deny or slow China's ability to domestically produce high value goods such as semiconductors and supercomputers. \n\nIn fact US components are so important that you can even see their impact on companies like Huawei who has stated that it is hard to live without US components. This is why US is industrially powerful. Their products are critical to building modern day technologies and without it it is very hard to live without them.\n\n&gt;It's mostly services, but I don't see how one can say the US doesn't rely on imports with a straight face.\n\nYes but imports to the US are mainly low value products . Low value products have low cost contribution and the main Gross Profit is retained by the firm who outsources the production of the product. US doesn't really rely on imports in the sense that the US does not need to import any high tech products from anywhere as the US has the domestic capability to mass produce high tech goods efficiently.\n\nLook at China they rely on imports to survive. Without semiconductors the Chinese technology space will literally come to a grinding halt. This has been mentioned by Jack Ma before when he was in Japan where he referenced the US control over core technologies like semiconductor. This is why the US does not rely on imports since they are technologically self sufficient.",
