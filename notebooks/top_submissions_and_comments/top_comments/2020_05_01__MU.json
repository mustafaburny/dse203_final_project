A long time ago I had a position in a company called visteon I think it was VSTN, pretty sure they\u2019re not around anymore. Was planning to hold through earnings and it dipped before and I panic sold. Lost 30k which was a very large portion of my account at the time. Had I held through earnings I would have made back the 30k and another 50k. Learned not to panic sell. I probably wouldn\u2019t trade a company like that now either way though.",

OK I did that, I did crypto, OK now I own Tesla, I get it. But there has to be more to investing than just Tesla.\u201d*\n\n**No, all there is to investing is owning Tesla, in call form specifically. Mr Camillo clearly has not read that many posts here.**\n\n*\"The fingerprints of tiny investors are all over the options market. Trades consisting of just one contract now account for 13% of total volume, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by John Marshall. That supports a view that \u201cindividual investor active trading is playing an increased role in market volatility.\u201d In some popular stocks, like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Alphabet Inc., small options trades account for nearly a third of total volume.\"*\n\n**CMG options? Really? Not AMD? Or DIS? Or MSFT? Or TSLA? Or MRNA? Chipotle???**\n\n*That\u2019s been true for Ameer Umarov, a cab driver in Arizona with an interest in math and a passion for video games. Months ago, when he realized the coronavirus was growing into a global health crisis, he reactivated his Amazon.com account to make some purchases. Not for masks or hand sanitizer -- for books on stock trading. Two a week, at one point.*\n\n*When equities started surging in late March, Umarov stayed away, scared by the volatility. He was ready to act by the first week of April. He bought shares of Boeing Co., a bad decision that set him back more than $4,000. But a stake in Halliburton Co. brought him $9,800, after he sold shares on the day of a 16% rally late last month. A few other purchases -- Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology Inc., among them -- yielded mixed results. All told, Umarov is down some $400 since he began.*\n\n**Definitely more losses than that.**\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble, but a highly intellectual gamble,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s about knowledge and risk, but especially for guys like me, it\u2019s all about sheer luck.\u201d*\n\n**He gets it.**\n\n*This month, he stopped buying books and instead signed up for a virtual trading boot-camp. He paid $4,100 for two days of 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. classes, where he learned about concepts like support, resistance, and trading on gaps. To Umarov, the course is a long-term investment, and he\u2019s decided eventually he wants to make trading his full-time job.*\n\n**I really hope that's not code for True Trading Group.**\n\n*\u201cI have no idea how it\u2019s going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will be stupid not to try.\u201d*\n\n**Sums up this sub entirely.**\n\n**BTW, Ameer, you should reveal yourself. I assume you are reading this.**",

Ive made good money day scalping bounces off support, holding for like 30mins to a couple hours... \n\nSo I'm a tech tard. I know the cloud software sector really well as well as the semiconductor sector. If you were looking to park money in a stonk then I would stick to tech long term although there are some serious discounts in the banks, REITs &amp; cruises long term (I ignore the airlines due to dilution and possibly long term weak demand, as opposed to the cruises where Americans will fucking flock to even if it was the end of the world)   but there discounts are value plays so beware; personally I 'feel' best investing in the best. I dont want to risk my company losing to another so I go with the fastest growth/strongest market positioning. \n\nIn stonks you cant go wrong with ROKU SQ TSLA long term. All leaders, fast growth, the future of consumer tech (RST is the new FAANG). I'll get hate on here but ROKU SQ TSLA could run 500% easy over the next 5 years. No joke.\n\nIn cloud you will pay a premium to own the best but I would go for it. My favorite positions are AYX (actually not cloud but its a data science platform) DDOG/ESTC (observability/APM/API/SEIM) CRWD OKTA (cybersecurity, ZS is a distant-er 3rd). ESTC AYX probably the best value proposition of these companies right now. CRWD is still a buy and going to new highs by next year easy. \n\nAlso check out SE PDD BILI as Chinese stonks, INSG for 5G, and then basically the entire semiconductor sector especially AMD NVDA MU MRVL XLNX. \n\nPeep VTIQ which is the future Nikola motors as well. Peep INMD which is a high gross margin, high growth aesthetic medical device company thats trading at a massive discount. Peep DXCM PODD also in medi devices; peep VRTX CRSP EDIT NVTA TWST in bio - can also buy ARKG. Hope thats helpful",
