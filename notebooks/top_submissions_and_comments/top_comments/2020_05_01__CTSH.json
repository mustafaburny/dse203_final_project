I do believe the market is overvalued, but am also aware of the fact that I cannot time shit. \n\nHowever, there are sectors (and companies) that I believe in and think are well positioned to succeed long term. I have a watch list of equities and am slowly DCA'ing into them on market pull backs. \n\nI am cognizant of the fact that many may find my investment strategy to be foolish. I am also aware that I am no smarter (and very well may be dumber) than said people. I may underperform the market significantly.

        "body": "India needs to get over its divisive politics and high levels of corruption and red tape to take advantage of this opportunity. There is a reason why Walmart is yet to realize any benefit despite significant investments. \n\nIndia is going through significant structural issues and the country's current leadership doesn't seem to have a clue on how to shore up its economy and has resorted to divide and discrimination based on religion, region and caste to keep their subjects distracted. There is significant pain in their banking, real state and automobile sectors  which drive bulk of their GDP. There is hardly any growth in India for the last 3-4 years.\n\nEven with COVID, India has hardly done any mass testing for COVID and yet the infection rates are spiking by the day. There is hardly any movement of goods or people across state border and all citizens are quarantined in their homes. The government has done nothing to supplement incomes for their citizens despite a huge population not having a steady job. The last time the government got some money in its coffers, it spend most of it building huge statues of political leaders.\n\nUS and other importers will need to be more cognizant of where they want to shift their supply chains.  India has its own set of major issues and non-inclusive policies by Modi are definitely not helping their case.",

        "body": "Perhaps people should realize that Robinhood is new Fintech. It's geared powerfully towards casual long-term investors. My use of the word casual really means those who *do not really care to become experts at finance and investing on a trading platform*. I feel like it has the potential to be a robust platform for time-sensitive trading, but it feels a bit too infant for that. I love using it for holding, DRIP, or longer term swing trades. Honestly, I give RH 5 stars for my personal use. But, if you're in that boat of people who has $25k+ and don't want to get marked as a pattern day trader, I'd try to be cognizant of the tech and culture behind the platform as well. Give RH time, and those time-sensitive nightmares may be ironed out.",
