There is a reason why Walmart is yet to realize any benefit despite significant investments. \n\nIndia is going through significant structural issues and the country's current leadership doesn't seem to have a clue on how to shore up its economy and has resorted to divide and discrimination based on religion, region and caste to keep their subjects distracted. There is significant pain in their banking, real state and automobile sectors  which drive bulk of their GDP. There is hardly any growth in India for the last 3-4 years.\n\nEven with COVID, India has hardly done any mass testing for COVID and yet the infection rates are spiking by the day. There is hardly any movement of goods or people across state border and all citizens are quarantined in their homes. The government has done nothing to supplement incomes for their citizens despite a huge population not having a steady job. The last time the government got some money in its coffers, it spend most of it building huge statues of political leaders.\n\nUS and other importers will need to be more cognizant of where they want to shift their supply chains.  India has its own set of major issues and non-inclusive policies by Modi are definitely not helping their case.",

My use of the word casual really means those who *do not really care to become experts at finance and investing on a trading platform*. I feel like it has the potential to be a robust platform for time-sensitive trading, but it feels a bit too infant for that. I love using it for holding, DRIP, or longer term swing trades. Honestly, I give RH 5 stars for my personal use. But, if you're in that boat of people who has $25k+ and don't want to get marked as a pattern day trader, I'd try to be cognizant of the tech and culture behind the platform as well.

If the United States is essentially open for business come summer end many businesses still appear undervalued even at these market levels (in my eyes at least). Obviously this is a big assumption but it is nonetheless one possible scenario.",

        "body": "I agree with all your points. In terms of business similarity (not at all investing prospect similarities) I think of tech companies as:\n\n- chip/components/data center hardware: NVDA, AMD, INTC, QCOM, TXN\n- fabrication: TSM (I don't follow anything else sorry)\n- PaaS: MSFT, AMZN, IBM/RedHat, GOOG (trying aggressively)\n- SaaS/Software: MSFT, GOOG, ORCL, IBM/RedHat, ADEB, FB, AMZN\n- Consumer Electronics: AAPL\n- Ads: GOOG, FB\n\nobviously there are many other companies that I don't follow, and the categorization isn't 100% clean either. AAPL's services (music, icloud, etc) are forms of SaaS. FB is technically ads, but they are also a complete marketing SaaS especially globally where many businesses rely 100% on FB for their entire online presence. Ads also depends on your reach. Both GOOG and MSFT have consumer electronics, but I don't use that to drive investment. I won't be surprised if GOOG or MSFT cancel a major line of their hardware any time.\n\nThere are many other consumer electronics companies but nothing as fully integrated as AAPL in that area, including MSFT and GOOG.\n\nRedHat is active in the datacenter space and probably why IBM acquired them. IBM is more of a global tech projects coordinator, and manages a lot of banks infrastructures, but are feeling the pressure from other PaaS providers. I don't have any investments in it though. \n\nTech companies always have their toes in many businesses because of the nature of software. I can't think of one with more toes than MSFT (maybe GOOG second), which could be unfocused waste depending on their management. It certainly feel like it was for MSFT for most of the 2000s.\n\nTo answer OP's question though, I think any of these companies are probably fine with equal chances, though you will introduce yourself to company specific short term volatility. Who knows when a random bad news for AAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, etc might hit affecting the stock price in the short term. Balancing (depending on the amount) or using an etf like others mentioned is a good idea, though I don't think any of your picks will be bad in the long run either.",

General purpose quantum computer might offer infinitely more than that. All the buzz about AI and machine learning on supercomputers currently is nothing more than a fancy algorithm (maybe not even that fancy) which takes huge amount of time and resources for self learning. Google\u2019s AlphaGo AI played insane number of games with itself before it managed to beat Ke Jie in human vs machine. With quantum computer where computing power doubles every time you add one qubit. The AI might become an actual AI. Quantum cryptography will finally bring information security. Bringing closer possibility of teleportation. Think about all the jobs it will create which you can\u2019t even imagine now. Yes, it might sound like a cheap sci-fi novel, but that could be our or our grand kids future. So not everyone\u2019s investment horizon.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m very hyped about quantum computing. It\u2019s super exciting, and equally terrifying.\n\nThat said. I\u2019m not saying that it will be IBM who will make a breakthrough.

What does matter is the growth of earnings per share because growth over time generally increases stock price at the same pace (if not faster) as as the growth in earnings.

Here is a 15-year chart of BRK.B vs S&amp;P500TR (untaxed dividends included):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/gd1ogo/brkb_vs_sp500_with_dividends_very_similar/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nThe airline loss for Berkshire was less than $3.5 billion. To put that in persepective, Berkshire had **operating earnings of almost $2 billion PER MONTH** in Q1 of 2020\n\nAnd quoting Bryant24 on SeekingAlpha:\n\n\"People always bring up IBM, he bought that in 2011 so it wasn't all that recent. It didn't work out as well as he'd hoped but he still made a little money on it. Also I give him credit because he got out in the $160's after he saw they were not doing as well in the cloud as he had expected. The stock has traded down in the lower $100's for the last couple of years so he at least made a good decision to get out.\"\n\n\"He bought his position in Heinz in 2012 and the deal with Kraft was done in 2015, so again not all that recent. He's also made money on KHC through it's dividend, I think the share price is about at the Berkshire cost basis. He had some KHC preferred shares that paid a really high coupon for several years. So he's returned well over 5% per year on his KHC investments and it's actually preforming pretty well right now. Again, not a great investment so far, but far from the disaster people make it out to be. It has been a disaster for those that bought it at 90.\"\n\n\"The airlines were actual losers but he was up a decent amount on them and then we had a pandemic. So perhaps he shouldn't have bought them, but things happen and the loss from the airline investment was tiny and immaterial in the scale of Berkshire. My point to all of this is people go out of their way to bring up Buffet's disappointing trades even nearly 10 years later and they way overstate the losses. Most are not educated on the trades and just repeat how big of a disaster IBM was when it was 9 years ago and not really a disaster.\"",

        "body": "The present giants are not the same as dinosaurs of the past.  They learned the goods and the bads from giants of yesterday.\n\nIBM is a dinosaur. It became a dinosaur with the emergence of personal computers. But while many dinosaurs have been dead for years, IBM is still alive because -- IMO -- it has done one thing right: IBM Research.   IBM Research is what has kept IBM alive, staying with the youngsters.  \n\nGuess what. The current giants have learned from this. They all have invested heavily in research.  Most interestingly is Google. Most of their products are \"betas\", which are experimental research projects that are deployed to the public.\n\nAnother thing the giants have learned is that they need to be very flexible and adaptive to rising trends.   Microsoft raised because of the dominant of software, which by the way was the dead sentence for hardware giants.   But this dominant almost killed Microsoft, turning it into a dinosaur, when software became a commodity and not a specialty product.  Demanding customers to pay for each version of Windows and Word was no longer the right thing to do, Microsoft adapted to a model the sells software as a service.  And they have survived. They have also excelled due to Microsoft Research. This has allowed them to stay at the forefront.\n\nGoogle, Apple and FaceBook will be the dominating players in the near future because -- IMO -- data, data about people, and the interconnection of people have become more important than anything else.\n\nIt is very possible that data will become cheap in some sense, a commodity.  Although data has become more open, certain types of data can be very expensive to collect.  So I think Google and FaceBook will continue to have a promising future.\n\nApple is in a very interesting situation. It doesn't sell a product.   Other cellphone companies sell utilities. But Apple sells the experience of people connecting to people. It's like FaceBook in some way.  People inherent want to connect to other people. This is a lasting value. As long as Apple excels at this, it will be around for a long time.",
