        "body": "I did not downvote your comment, but I would add a couple of pointers: \n\nTypically, the people who are most vocal about impending doom are not investors. If someone is worried about a decline in their portfolio, it\u2019s either because they are overextended, or they have no ability to generate new capital. If one is overextended, then any decline pushes the person closer to the edge with their investments. If one has no ability to generate new capital, then it\u2019s more prudent to preserve what capital they have and not tie everything up in risk assets.\n\nIf you have the ability to generate new capital (typically through labor), then it rarely ever makes sense to liquidate all of your holdings and sit in cash. Instead, it\u2019s much better to lean in to any decline and buy more. This discipline is what separates people though. It\u2019s a very hard skill to learn (continued purchases throughout any market condition), but once one masters the skill, they will experience great things in their portfolio. \n\nWhile I agree with you that holding cash can be appropriate at certain times, being mostly in cash rarely makes sense. These posts (like the one OP created) are usually the result of someone who lacks the discipline (above) and missed out on gains and are now trying to conjure up an excuse as to why they think the market should go down, when the more relevant thing would be to simply buy on Monday, and then buy again the next time the OP has more free capital available. Repeat this buy step on a regular cadence and one day in the future the OP should end up with a much larger account then when he started.",

        "body": "**Tesla - Buy**\n\nCurrently a 10/11. Tesla has built the correct engineering team through survival of the fittest in order to compete to win. Tesla has Musk. Musk may be crazy but SpaceX is the first to build reusable rockets. Nasa and the Soviets didn\u2019t even do the reusable part although to be fair, they were probably just focused on one-time to space. Musk is meeting that checkpoint and extending it. Andrej Karpathy is probably the best young AI application scientist. Great business/technical leadership - Musk, Andrej Karpathy.\n\n**Square - Buy**\n\nCurrently a 7/11. Squares main revenue currently comes from point of sales technology which is highly saturation. It has shown the ability to pivot through a cash app and opening a bank charter. Fin tech has massive potential and Square is well positioned. Square is one of the places where engineers want to work for. Great business leadership - Jack Dorsey.\n\n**Sea Limited - Buy**\n\nCurrently a 5/11. Sea Limited is competing very well in e-commerce, e-payments, and video games in South East Asia. These are probably the backbone of the economy of South East Asia as they don\u2019t produce rockets or cpus there. This company is limited by the fact that it does not compete in the wealthiest countries in the world. Great leadership - Forrest Li, Tencent backing but not micromanagement on like competitor Lazada by Alibaba.\n\n**Peloton - Buy**\n\nCurrently a 5/11. Peloton has potential to have the name brand \u201cit\u201d factor that wins in luxury goods. Some wealth people spend money on Gucci, some are frugal, but most are willing to spend something if they think it\u2019s good for their health. This seems to be a product that looks like another fitness bike but somehow has a cult like following.\n\n**Airbnb - Buy when IPO**\n\nCurrently a 8/11. In a world where wealth inequality rises, Airbnb provides a platform for travel housing for the rich with offerings for the middle class. In many cases, Airbnb provides a more authentic travel experience that money is trying it\u2019s very hardest to buy. Airbnb is what timeshare could have been: myriad options, enjoyable to interface with as long as money is not an issue, and huge margins for landlords. Great business leadership - story of Airbnb founders is legendary.\n\n**Draftkings - Hold**\n\nHype is too obvious and potentially too niche for valuation - however sports gambling is way less technically competitive in a field compared to CDN or AI and where deals and politics matter more. Draftkings is good at getting exclusive deals and has buddied up with ESPN. The fall back may be that middle class and poor people who want to gamble aren\u2019t going to expand that much. The ones that have money to gamble are more sensible will not gamble and then ones that gamble against the house don\u2019t have money. Most sports fans get enjoyment from watching the sports and hot takes by Skip Bayless. Wealthy sports fans have courtside seats and suites.\n\n**Fastly - Hold**\n\nCurrently a 4/11. CDNs are essential but vulnerable to saturation. The competition skills is more technical than other tech companies. Fastly shows good signs because it\u2019s CEO converted to CTO which shows that the company has a very technical voice at the top. Great technical leadership - Artur Bergman.\n\n**Livongo/Teledoc** **- Sell**\n\nIt seems to be too early in the telemedicical market, and companies trade at huge multiples. Although these two companies are the leaders, their competitive advantage seems that medicine is a slow moving, heavily regulated field where winners will win more by showing up. Online medical services also seem very promising for mental illness which is big in America even among the wealthy, but teladoc merge dilutes this.\n\n**Docusign - Sell**\n\nThe moment when Docusign becomes a full-fledged solution suite instead of feature, it becomes a huge buy.\n\n**Rocket Companies - Sell**\n\nRocket companies are leading in technology adoption in the refinancing and mortgage industry. It is not clear that technology is the decisive factor.\n\n**Okta - Sell**\n\nOkta is by far the best single sign on solution. The valuation is already high and this seems more like a feature than full-fledge solution suite.\n\n**Virgin Galactic - Sell**\n\nSpaceX is too good to buy Virgin Galactic even though at this early in the stage, none, one or, both may succeed.\n\n**Zoom - Sell**\n\nZoom is a great company with people willing to work 13-14 hour days for their potentially inflated stock. Issue is that their evaluation is already so high and doesn\u2019t naturally grow into a huge field like Tesla may grow into energy industry.\n\n**Slack - Sell**\n\nSeems to be an expensive lesson for those who bought it. They are the best work chat tool, but work chat tool is not a feature and not a product.",

        "body": "If this borrowed money is a 1-time investment, then there are quite a few risks:\n\n1. Stocks can go down and/or sideways for years. Look at what happened to Microsoft in the 2000s. From 2000 - 2010 it went sideways and down quite a bit. The only way to avoid that would have been to buy more shares on a regular cadence.\n2. If the money is callable (e.g. tied to a margin account), then you run the risk of being liquidated at the worst time (see #1)\n3. If the interest rate is over 4%, I wouldn't touch it. It's far too hard to \"guarantee\" returns beyond that on a YoY basis\n4. Behavioral risks; if you dont have the means to pay on this borrowed money, you might panic and sell at the worst time (too many red days for your liking). This would result in you owing on a loan while also having lost value.\n\nNow, all of these negative things aside, if you can borrow money for an extended period of time (e.g. 15-30 years) then your odds of success go up. In America, folks with homes are able to borrow money at under 3% (and in many cases at or under 2.5%). $100,000 spread over 30 years at 3% is only $422/month. If you can afford to take on that extra $422/mo payment (e.g. you have extra money each month and this payment will not impact you), then it may make sense to take on a loan since you've locked in such a low fixed rate. You could then put that money in the market and most likely (eventually?) earn more than $422/month. Over the next 30 years, many people have the expectation that the market will go up at some point.\n\nGood luck.",

So essentially a ton of people bought a ton of upside calls today could account for this massive IV increase. \n\nHowever, from a trading perspective this seems super exploitable. Essentially here's what it's implying. \n\nIt's saying Yesterday there was an X % chance for Tesla to be &gt; 800 (or pick any other upside strike) by September 18. Now Today, despite Tesla going down 4-5% at this current point, there is still an X % chance or even &gt; X% chance for Tesla to be &gt; 800 by September 18. That's insane!\n\nDespite 1 day passing by and a 4-5% drop in stock, the probability, according to MM, didn't change or even increased at certain points in the day! And it's not like there's that many days until September 18 anyways.\n\nI feel like this isn't a supply/demand issue. I think actually it's possible this market got broken due to outsized, black swan moves from stocks like CRM, ZM and DOCU who didn't even have an earnings yet that MM are so pressed to selling vol they jacked up everything arbitrarily across all names, which includes Tesla and CRM but should include others, which I haven't delved into.",

So we don't want to sell any more options at an x volatility. So retail keeps on buying at x+y and then x+y+z, etc. We keep on making sales at these 'inflated' prices and they keep on buying them.\n\nI presume this phenomena is happening in AAPL. Got steamrolled in CRM (what a move) and ZM (today). So we keep on offering at higher and higher levels (and retail keeps on buying) which is nuts.\n\nBecause the big tech stocks make up a huge portion on the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY), we can get a little hedge on buy bidding up calls in the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY). Because we are bidding up calls, we are now impacting VIX.\n\nThis is the only explanation I have for you. I think you are probably OK selling a little vol here (but I would go smaller size because of this craziness... vol can still go higher).",

I would bet that a senior trader/partner has taken over these names (TSLA AAPL CRM FB GOOG etc) to make sure that the firm doesn't get clobbered too much.\n\nWe all know to respect the markets, but at some level the 'madness' has to end. Of course, nobody knows when that will happen. Notwithstanding, the 'edge' you get selling at x+y+z volatility is more than you got at x+y which is more than what you got at x. You may be wrong at the x and x+y levels, but at the x+y+z level you made up for your losses (from x and X+y) and then some. Thus, the snowball effect of implied volatility becoming actual volatility might be true at the x and x+y level and overstated at the x+y+z level. (There has to be some edge selling options because you need a balance sheet selling options versus buying options).\n\nSo I do agree with what you are saying that the implieds will eventually be overstating what is happening with actual volatility. Unfortunately, nobody knows what level this will be. Thus, selling vol in small pieces at higher and higher levels is probably the safest way of doing this (and this is probably what the market makers are doing). You should have enough edge that you can scratch a trade if it doesn't feel right...",
