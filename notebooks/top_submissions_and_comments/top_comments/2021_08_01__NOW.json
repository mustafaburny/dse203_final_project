It felt like I was losing money to hit the sell button, but in reality I made a great profit and locked it in. I still have a ton to learn. It shouldn't have been that hard. If it was in the 90s right now I probably wouldn't even be having these thoughts, which is scary in itself.\n\nI guess this is why it's important to have an exit strategy and execute it?

It's a person calling out a dam burst and there's no way you can time it or convince enough people in time to prevent it from happening. I myself believe in the things you say and have been expecting a crash for a long time now. None of these highs make sense or look sustainable in the long run. I am greatly concerned that the people do not understand that each subsequent crisis or string of bubbles is adding more dimensions to the unpredictable nature of the problem.

Folks, I know you don't want to plow through the SEC filings and nit pick them. But you really have to. Zy had already been borrowing massively from the dubious Perspective Credit Holdings II, **second line** in their s-1. When a company tells you it is in trouble, believe them. They RUSHED to IPO, with no revenue in Covid, because they were going to have to fork over everything to their creditors unless they had a big cash raise. They had a 100 million credit facility on December 31, 2020. They had liens on substantially all their assets when they IPO'd. Perceptive Credit Holdings will own every patent of ZY within days, now. Read your SEC docs, folks. Rely on teams with great lawyers and auditors that provide us with well crafted SEC filings in a timely manner. Edit: I mean it could still be salvageable because they raised about 548Mil in the IPO to service their debt, but the evidence was in the s-1s. And the analysts have only downgraded to hold, left them with a $12 instead of a $54. lol. who knows. My point is related to the SPAC vehicle and the SEC filings. Follow your teams and follow the quality, and please don't compare ZY to $DNA, they really do not match.",

I know very little about them.\n\nCHPT - Chargepoint - Their business model relies on the sales of cloud services to partners that provide colorful reports on charger utilization. The partner provides the power and in many cases the maintenance as well. Each charger nets them at least $300/year in revenue, with more if the customer buys a maintenance plan.\n\nEVGo - EVGo builds the infrastructure and pays for the power, and profits based upon how they bill customers. Their primary revenue source is customers using the network. Their prices are a bit high, but they are working on getting really valuable locations.  \n\n\nBLINK - They revenue share with the site hosting the charger and are mostly installing low-reliability chargers at usage prices that make gas look dirt cheap. Without a major change in their business model, I don't see this going far, but the upside is that low information site hosts (often in the hospitality industry) find them appealing.\n\nVOLTA - Advertising based free charging. The way I see it, these guys have figured out a way to buy billboard space in high traffic areas for &lt;$100/month in operational costs. Its a really clever business model. Not sure how sustainable it is, but maybe?\n\nElectrify America &amp; Tesla Superchargers - Automaker subsidiaries, so not independently traded. Probably closest business model-wise to EVGo, though with slightly different pricing strategies.\n\nI've probably left out some other charge equipment manufacturers, but I can't think of them right now.",

        "body": "Yep, at the end of the day: all investments are return mechanisms.\n\nYou lay out money today (principal) to get a return over time.\n\nTherefore, when the 10 year is at 1.2%, it doesn't even make sense to invest in bonds so people have been heavily investing in equities because the current S&amp;P earnings yield is around 3.3% (The S&amp;P PE ratio OP provided does not include Q2 earnings which means the real S&amp;P PE right now I think is between 29-30)\n\nA return of 3.3% with the ability to reinvest itself compared to 1.2% which is stagnant... not a hard decision to make there.\n\nThis is incredibly simplifying things but this is the general view that Buffett and Munger hold with investing. It's all about opportunity cost, and the benchmark they largely compare investments to (and discount future cash flows with) is the risk-free rate of return, which is the 10-year note.\n\n**EDIT:** The kicker of this highly unusual market is that many investors, like Buffett, seek 10% returns. If you see above, the TTM earnings of the S&amp;P is far from 10%, even with expected growth priced into the equation. BUT by pure investing standards, when the S&amp;P TTM earnings yield is over double the return of the 10-year yield... equities are without question the smarter investment. BUT (x2) is a 3.3% yield today (probably 4.5% by January 2022) a return you want to lock yourself in for the long term?.. BUT! (x3) Sitting in cash, or even government bonds, you're guaranteed to lose money with inflation..\n\nTLDR: The market is both objectively cheap and historically expensive. Some people call it a \"logical bubble\". Only time will tell what will happen, but remember the job of the investor is to not get sidetracked by macro factors and instead continue to assess the earning power of companies for the long term.",
