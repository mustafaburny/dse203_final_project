        "body": "**tl;dr -** Took out a $50k loan from a LOC and credit card cash advance and yolo'd it into GME call options back in Nov/Dec at $17. Peaked at \\~$7.5M (incl. withdrawals), almost $8M if I include my wife's $5k investment. Cashed out some for a house. Diamond handing the rest for future generations. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm no DFV, but I created a new throwaway to post my proudest (financial) achievement. I had to wait 2 months for submission requirements, then this keeps getting removed because \"A Gain/Loss/YOLO should be a picture of a closed gain, a closed loss, or an open position &gt; $2,500.\" which I think this clearly qualifies for. Maybe it's because it has to be a picture submission? Let's see if this works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:** I wasn't a trust fund baby, we grew up relatively poor and I was always hungry. I started working in high school to support my family, and worked 3-5 jobs through college, graduating with loads of student debt. While I have a steady job now, there's no way I would be able to grind my way to financial freedom. The system is too broken for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**At the Beginning:** I read DFV's DD on GME after their last Nov earnings. I told everyone about GME when it was at $17, and at $14, but as many apes here know, it's hard to convince people even when the DD and facts are out in plain sight. I recognized it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, so I dumped the rest of my gambling money (roughly $15k from an original $30k borrowed from a LOC) into GME options. Lost most of it over the next month or so, but then saw this $1.4B company make $1.7B in profit, so I took a $20k credit card cash advance and kept playing. At my lowest, I was down from $50k to $15k, and then the money started raining.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Rollercoaster:** Like everyone else, I checked the price constantly. Post-market until 8pm, read DD until midnight, and watching the German / pre-market prices a few hours later (Thank you German apes!). I saw the price go up to $480+ and \\*knew\\* it was going up to $1k. Then the manipulation started. I held on at first, but then even IB restricted purchasing (options). Even though my heart told me to hold, I knew rationally the momentum had been stopped. With a heavy heart, I sold around $330 and told my wife to do the same. Better to accept defeat in battle and to fight another day.Over the next few weeks, we saw the price crash. I bought at $150 in premarket a few days later, and again at $120, $100, $80, $60, $50. Before I knew it, I was (almost) all in again. The price was wrong, and naturally, it shot back up over $300. I had peaked around $2.5M before dipping back down to under $1.5M. At the $340 peak, I saw my account surpass $5M, and felt that was \"good enough\". I sent the screenshot to my wife, and followed the very wise adage of \"Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell\" and cashed out 1/3 of my holdings. I was lucky because within 5 minutes, it started crashing hard, to below $200. What a deal, I jumped back in the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Performance Summary:** I've stopped going all-in with FDs after learning from the brave souls who have gone before me here on WSB (and from my own previous bankruptcies). Instead, I've been selling calls to reduce my risk, while providing a solid income that I can use to buy more shares (and sometimes more FDs, because who can resist tendies?). I cashed out on June 19th to buy a house at $7.2M + $300k previously withdrawn, at peak wealth at around $7.5M, which is why the graph stops here. My wife's initial $5k investment went up to around $350k at its peak.The remaining is still in GME shares/options. I've been bleeding out, down over $1M (again) since then, but that doesn't matter. Shorts have to cover, and I'm already buckled in. I'm holding for my grandchildren and their grandchildren. To the moon. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bonus Graph:** We Canadian apes get a TFSA where profits don't get taxed. While I played various option strategies on my margin account, I mainly bought and held long term options and shares in this account. My double down of $19k in January went here, which eventually grew to $6.5M. Tax free. Come at me, CRA (jk, plz don't).",

You're killing it right now but trust me when I say that you can lose the money just as rapidly as you made it if you continue playing options and concentrating everything in one bet. I've had periods where I was down 80% of my entire net worth because highly concentrated high risk investments that run up thousands of percent in a year can also run downwards just like that.\n\nTake it from someone who's managed to have multi-million dollar swings multiple times in his life-you really don't want to feel like the asshole who threw away his family's retirement because he didn't take some serious profits. You don't have to sell it all, but if you're not setting aside 2-3 million right now you're a  moron. Will you be able to look your wife and/or kids in the eye and realize that you pissed an awesome life for them away because you couldn't stop gambling?\n\nDiversify out enough that you and your wife will be fucking fine forever. That means $2 million on the low end and more like $3-4 million to be on the safer side, especially if the two of you don't have high paying careers where you could make that money back in a few years. Then gamble with whatever else and if it blows up so what, you could both work part time and still be comfortable as fuck if you have $2-3 million paying out dividends every year and still growing.\n\nDo what you want, but trust me that you're gonna feel like an asshole and an utter failure to your family if you fuck this up gambling. I've fucked up enough to learn to take profits.\n\nAlso, I did most of my GME gambling in our Roth IRAs so totally tax free ftw. Too bad I can't touch that money for another couple of decades lol",

        "body": "**tl;dr -** Took out a $50k loan from a LOC and credit card cash advance and yolo'd it into GME call options back in Nov/Dec at $17. Peaked at \\~$7.5M (incl. withdrawals), almost $8M if I include my wife's $5k investment. Cashed out some for a house. Diamond handing the rest for future generations. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm no DFV, but I created a new throwaway to post my proudest (financial) achievement. I had to wait 2 months for submission requirements, then this keeps getting removed because \"A Gain/Loss/YOLO should be a picture of a closed gain, a closed loss, or an open position &gt; $2,500.\" which I think this clearly qualifies for. Maybe it's because it has to be a picture submission? Let's see if this works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:** I wasn't a trust fund baby, we grew up relatively poor and I was always hungry. I started working in high school to support my family, and worked 3-5 jobs through college, graduating with loads of student debt. While I have a steady job now, there's no way I would be able to grind my way to financial freedom. The system is too broken for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**At the Beginning:** I read DFV's DD on GME after their last Nov earnings. I told everyone about GME when it was at $17, and at $14, but as many apes here know, it's hard to convince people even when the DD and facts are out in plain sight. I recognized it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, so I dumped the rest of my gambling money (roughly $15k from an original $30k borrowed from a LOC) into GME options. Lost most of it over the next month or so, but then saw this $1.4B company make $1.7B in profit, so I took a $20k credit card cash advance and kept playing. At my lowest, I was down from $50k to $15k, and then the money started raining.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Rollercoaster:** Like everyone else, I checked the price constantly. Post-market until 8pm, read DD until midnight, and watching the German / pre-market prices a few hours later (Thank you German apes!). I saw the price go up to $480+ and \\*knew\\* it was going up to $1k. Then the manipulation started. I held on at first, but then even IB restricted purchasing (options). Even though my heart told me to hold, I knew rationally the momentum had been stopped. With a heavy heart, I sold around $330 and told my wife to do the same. Better to accept defeat in battle and to fight another day.Over the next few weeks, we saw the price crash. I bought at $150 in premarket a few days later, and again at $120, $100, $80, $60, $50. Before I knew it, I was (almost) all in again. The price was wrong, and naturally, it shot back up over $300. I had peaked around $2.5M before dipping back down to under $1.5M. At the $340 peak, I saw my account surpass $5M, and felt that was \"good enough\". I sent the screenshot to my wife, and followed the very wise adage of \"Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell\" and cashed out 1/3 of my holdings. I was lucky because within 5 minutes, it started crashing hard, to below $200. What a deal, I jumped back in the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Performance Summary:** I've stopped going all-in with FDs after learning from the brave souls who have gone before me here on WSB (and from my own previous bankruptcies). Instead, I've been selling calls to reduce my risk, while providing a solid income that I can use to buy more shares (and sometimes more FDs, because who can resist tendies?). I cashed out on June 19th to buy a house at $7.2M + $300k previously withdrawn, at peak wealth at around $7.5M, which is why the graph stops here. My wife's initial $5k investment went up to around $350k at its peak.The remaining is still in GME shares/options. I've been bleeding out, down over $1M (again) since then, but that doesn't matter. Shorts have to cover, and I'm already buckled in. I'm holding for my grandchildren and their grandchildren. To the moon. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bonus Graph:** We Canadian apes get a TFSA where profits don't get taxed. While I played various option strategies on my margin account, I mainly bought and held long term options and shares in this account. My double down of $19k in January went here, which eventually grew to $6.5M. Tax free. Come at me, CRA (jk, plz don't).",

You're killing it right now but trust me when I say that you can lose the money just as rapidly as you made it if you continue playing options and concentrating everything in one bet. I've had periods where I was down 80% of my entire net worth because highly concentrated high risk investments that run up thousands of percent in a year can also run downwards just like that.\n\nTake it from someone who's managed to have multi-million dollar swings multiple times in his life-you really don't want to feel like the asshole who threw away his family's retirement because he didn't take some serious profits. You don't have to sell it all, but if you're not setting aside 2-3 million right now you're a  moron. Will you be able to look your wife and/or kids in the eye and realize that you pissed an awesome life for them away because you couldn't stop gambling?\n\nDiversify out enough that you and your wife will be fucking fine forever. That means $2 million on the low end and more like $3-4 million to be on the safer side, especially if the two of you don't have high paying careers where you could make that money back in a few years. Then gamble with whatever else and if it blows up so what, you could both work part time and still be comfortable as fuck if you have $2-3 million paying out dividends every year and still growing.\n\nDo what you want, but trust me that you're gonna feel like an asshole and an utter failure to your family if you fuck this up gambling. I've fucked up enough to learn to take profits.\n\nAlso, I did most of my GME gambling in our Roth IRAs so totally tax free ftw. Too bad I can't touch that money for another couple of decades lol",

They may be experiencing some problems right now, but it is not at all clear that those problems will precipitate a broader period of \"significant trouble\" for China.\n\nSecond, if the Chinese economy does experience a rough patch, or the Chinese do start to decouple from the global market, you should probably expect a global recession and the global equities markets to tank.\n\nThird, if you have to ask the questions in the first place and you have to ask how to short China, you probably shouldn't be trying to short China. If you think that the Chinese role in the global market will be declining and other emerging markets will pick up the slack, you're better off taking the long side of the trade with an ETF like EMXC (or FRDM if you want to bet on more free countries) that excludes China.",

Gelsinger needs to (and I think he is)  identify all the negatives (or current issues they face, including internal bureaucracy) and quickly address the vision on how to rectify these issues. At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction.  Once he does that,  and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal,  he might have the most successful turn around story ever.   I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years.  If successful I'll be rewarded. If not,  another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",

        "body": "While investing in Chinese companies listed on US exchanges you have to remember 3 additional types of risk you are taking on in addition to your normal investment risk.\n\nFirst is fraud risk. Chinese companies arent held to anywhere near the same standard as American companies. As Luckin Coffee showed, new IPOs and smaller Chinese companies can easily get creative with their accounting. While BABA, JD and other mega caps are less likely to suffer from this problem, generally the risks are much higher with Chinese companies than with their American or European equivalents.\n\nSecond, US political risk. The US government is finally waking up to the fact that China has been competing with us in order to supplant us for the last 20-25 years, and is beginning to take action. China's multinational corporations, especially those listed on US exchanges, are the some of the easiest places to apply pressure.\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is political risk from the CCP. The Chinese government can be arbitrary, and political concerns supercede economic ones. They can and will crush certain businesses just to make a point. This is real.\n\nAll that being said, I think sentiment for Chinese stocks is about as low as it can be right now. Short of the CCP nationalizing their largest and most profitable companies, or the US banning chinese stocks from US exchanges or US brokers from dealing with them (both real possibilities, although not the most probably outcomes), I dont think Chinese companies, especially Chinese tech companies, have that much further to fall. Selling here is likely selling near the bottom.",

Unfortunately I think the main deciding factor there is how much the service will cost the company, rather than how good it is for the actual employees. It's basically bidding for a contract from what I understand. Lowest bidder wins.\n\nRobinhood might actually be able to steal some market share there though if they come up with an offer to not charge anything for actually managing the assets, and offer expanded employee choice, while making their money off of payment for order flow. I'm sure they could make some good money from a firm that wants to front run bi-weekly automatic purchases! (Is that legal? I have no idea.)\n\nFor my account growth, about $47k was additional deposits and $18k was market growth (mix of unrealized and realized gains, but only time I usually sell is to move money from one company into another if I see a better opportunity.) I don't really do options trading (I suck at it) or try to time the market (also suck at it) so execution price and crashes don't really impact me at all.

I remember earlier this year I think it was Morgan Stanley, late in 2020 they release a sell rating for PLTR and then earlier this year they raised the PT for PLTR and later I saw that they started buying PLTR a month before the PT was released.
