        "body": "[From the penultimate quarter:](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/14/asml-holding-nv-asml-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcr/)\n\n&gt;With 10 shipments this quarter, we have shipped 23 EUV systems year-to-date. \\[...\\] We're still planning to manufacture 35 systems this year, but due to the pace of customers' node ramps and their fab readiness, a few systems may end up being shipped early next year. But despite this potential shift of shipments to early next year, we are still targeting EUV revenue to approach EUR4.5 billion this year. \\[...\\] We are on-track with our EUV cycle time reduction plan to get to 20 weeks by the end of the year, enabling a capacity of 45 to 50 systems. With respect to demand for next year, we currently have an EUV systems backlog of EUR6.2 billion, exiting Q3 with around 65% of this backlog planned for shipment next year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[...\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are preparing also to be able to ship more, because, to your point, if you would really already follow the order intake and then add 12 months lead time, it's never going to work. So, you have to prepare for more because you would expect that there is a decent chance that you see some upside next year and you want to be ready. So, this is where the 12 months lead time is actually -- actually, that is more than 12 months, it's more like 18 months. But if you then prepare yourself, because you do expect this, then you could of course accept POs with a delivery time that's way within that 18 months. So, yes, we are preparing for more, and time will tell whether the customers need it in that timeframe 2021. I think they could, but time will tell. There's a real opportunity there.\n\n[From the most recent quarter:](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/20/asml-holding-nv-asml-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcr/)\n\n&gt;As Roger mentioned, we shipped nine systems and recognized revenue on eight systems in Q4, bringing the total to 31 systems in 2020 with a revenue of EUR4.5 billion for the year. This translates to about 60% growth in EUV systems revenue, reflecting the expanding use of this technology in high volume manufacturing. Based on customers' growing EUV demand in advanced nodes, we currently expect the growth of around 30% over last year, translating to around EUR5.8 billion in EUV system revenue for 2021. We continue to improve the EUV manufacturing cycle time to enable a capacity in our factory to meet the growing EUV demand. We will continue to drive the EUV 0.33NA product roadmap, which is aligned to our customers' node cadence.\n\n[From the video interview for the most recent quarter:](https://www.asml.com/-/media/asml/files/investors/financial-results/q-results/2020/q4/video-transcript-q4-fy-2020-roger-dassen-3ef67y.pdf)\n\n&gt;We are making good progress in our manufacturing capacity. Primarily, as we said before, by driving down the cycle time. The one limiting factor that we have this year really is the orders that we placed into the supply chain. We had to adjust that during the COVID situation. So that will be the limiting factor for this year.\n\n[From the quarter before those two, in the middle of last year:](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/15/asml-holding-nv-asml-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcr.aspx)\n\n&gt;Secondly, as you will appreciate, with the ramp that we're doing and with the increase that we're seeing in EUV, obviously that also means that from an inventory perspective, that leads to an uptick as well.\n\n[From the last report prior to the pandemic going global:](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/22/asml-holding-nv-asml-q4-2019-earnings-call-transcr.aspx)\n\n&gt;In the short-term you may expect that inventory levels will continue to go up a little bit, that's a dynamic on the one hand. \\[...\\] Also, I would expect that in a one to two year timeframe, you might expect inventory levels to go down for a number of reasons. First off, at that stage we talk about 2021; there is a significant buildup of our capacity for EUV. But once you are there and once you are at those levels, then the further build up of inventory will no longer have an impact on your inventory levels. And secondly, as we mentioned before, the way we believe we will be able to get an increase in our capacity from the 35%-ish that we have for this year to the 45%, 50%, that we talked about for 2021, will primarily be the reduction of cycle time, and of course the reduction of cycle time will then kick in and further reduce working capital requirement.",
