        "body": "Not great. UFC has a deal with ESPN that guarantees minimum revenue for most of its cards. Its growth is largely priced in, you aren't going to see an unexpected surge in profit. Audiences are not a huge part of their revenue, which is why their shares soared during the pandemic. UFC revenues are also volatile - a fighter getting COVID, for example, can cause a PPV to collapse, costing the company millions. This happened with Khamzat and it's unclear if he will ever be the same fighter again (he retired due to long covid then un-retired after Dana and the president of his country convinced him to try again). Several cards this year have been cursed like this, and the risks increase as UFC is under pressure to put up more events to meet the terms of the ESPN agreement. UFC is also undergoing a number of pay disputes with fighters that risks the viability of the business should it significantly worsen - for example, the expected Ngannou v. Jones superfight looks off the table for the foreseeable future.\n\nOther risks include ESPN moving away from MMA - UFC got a very good, 5 year deal from them as Disney wants to use MMA to drive subscriptions to their paywalled ESPN+ streaming service. They may not get such a good deal when this is re-negotiated and ESPN has significantly more leverage to dictate the terms. Moreover, UFC's non-paywalled content has largely gotten mediocre ratings.\n\nFinally, Endeavor is not just UFC. It's a huge holding company. A quick Google shows UFC's group makes up only about a quarter of their revenue. While that is an important asset, you aren't just buying UFC here - you see also holding stinkers like Miss Universe.",

        "body": "whoa\n\nLet me explain processors. You have designs imposed on top of transistors. The meme stocks of the day, Nvidia, AMD - they just *design chips*, but do not manufacture them, so they're all contracting out to fabs (which hurt margins), the cutting edge of today being taiwan semi. AMD is yielding off of old Keller designs and nvidia has cuda for crypto / etc., but neither of those are moats\n\nHere's a list of all the semicounductor fabs in the world: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_semiconductor\\_fabrication\\_plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)\n\nMost of them fucking suck in terms of density, because, most things aren't iPhones and don't need cutting edge nodes (cough cars cough cough).\n\nBut, if you'll notice, intel isn't *that* far behind. In fact, they're among the closest to taiwan semi, and we get into niche things like 7nm not really being 7nm (it's more about transistor density, where intel 10 is close to taiwan 7, etc.)\n\nAnd in terms of durable competitive advantage - chip fabs are like nuclear reactors, highly capital intensive, highly complicated, hard to run == giant moat.\n\nFor value investors, you buy from pessimists, and intel pessimists follow jimmy crames saying they don't have 7nm, while Pat is investing 20 billion in new fabs building out that moat. Even if they fab crappier chips there's a shortage, companies that need chips (like fucking everything) will buy from intel if it's attractive. Also USA national interest won't let intel go under, especially with the alternative consolidating into taiwan  \nThat's not to mention the top line consumer initiatives like their new GPU line and continuing processor line, which could adapt to RISC-V / ARM if needed (they have the cash flow for R&amp;D to do it).",

        "body": "There is a translation that was done of the video.  I will paste it here.  \n\nThere is also a slide in an old investor deck showing thorough fire testing and penetration testing (slide 13 here: http://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Microvast-201406-LpTO-Battery-Introduction-Charged-EV.pdf\n\nAnd here is the translation of the russian penetration test YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW4x_BTTwUY\n\n00:00-00:42\nWe are e-bike lovers. The Poltava company Prom Elektronika begins to use Microvast cells in its batteries, from which it will collect powerful and not so expensive batteries. This is a new technology that the vendor claims to be very successful. Why is it interesting? It is interesting because these elements are presented by the manufacturer as elements that can withstand about 7.000 charge-discharge cycles. This plate has a charging current up to 20 amps. This plate has a discharge current of up to 60 amperes.\n00:42-01:12\nThis plate is not very big, as you can see. It is easy to install and, most importantly, according to the statement of our suppliers and according to the passport that we have, this plate does not burn during crash tests. Now we will carry out crash tests of this plate and try to check how true this is. I mean will it burn or not.\n01:12-01:56\nNow we take this plate. I feel terribly sorry to crash it, but in order to make sure that this is true, we have to destroy one plate because we love to check everything and to be convinced of everything ourselves. That is, we take the plate and lay it down. We have seen many times how li-ion elements burn, and we cannot extinguish them. We take, well, we find some penetrating object. Give us this thing and now we will try to break through this plate in some place with a blow.\n01:56-02:31\nThis plate is broken, and so far we do not see a fire. We don't even see any warming here. That is, in principle, I would like to leave the element for a few minutes so that it stands.\n02:31-02:46 \nIf it was an ordinary Li-ion plate, it would have already caught fire through the penetration of this thing.\n02:46-03:22\nWe'll take it now. Please give me this tube again. Now we will take another test method. Let's try to destroy our plate this way.\n03:22-03:59\nWe see that it does not want to burn. Give me one more time. The plate stubbornly refuses to burn. There is no fire, no heating.\n04:01-04:32\nWell, what can I say, I think that this plate will be a very good solution for our batteries, since believe me, the safety of our cells is very important. Here you can watch our influences, traces of penetration, breakdown, everything is there, everything is whole. Thank you for your attention.\n04:32-04:57\nNow we will try to make one more test. Let\u2019s see how it resists. We brought here a fully charged plate, and as you can see, it has already been welded. That is, despite the fact that we pierced it, despite the fact that we crashed it, it is still trying to work.\n04:59-05:42\nIt is short-circuited, let's wait now, will there be a fire now, because if the batteries are usually so short-circuited, they usually burn. This plate, as you can see, became warm. Despite the fact that we pierced it, it is trying to work. I will repeat, we brought here a fully charged plate. Notice how it burned out because it works, plate was fully charged for up to 19 amp / hours.\n05:42-06:03\nWell, you see how. The ability to perform is shown, the penetrations are shown, and the endurance of short circuit shown. I think this will be a very great offer for our consumers and we will try to make wide use of it. Thanks.\n06:03-06:49\nWell then. That is, we short-circuited this plate, you saw how, with the help of this pipe. Here are the results of our welding this plate to the pipe. You see, our output contacts are burnt on this plate, they are almost completely burnt out. The plate is hot. Well, it's warm, but I can hold it in my hands. That is, here the degrees are between 40-50-60 c. Well, in principle, there is nothing burning. That is, we punched it twice, we short-circuited it. The plate passed all the tests that were written in the passport.",

Fed chair Ben Bernanke is more worried about inflation than providing liquidity to the market and Cramer gives him a piece of his mind.\n\nI looked this up while reading Bernanke's book *The Courage to Act* where he mentions the episode.  Apparently he didn't watch the clip.\n\nNot using this to say \"omg a crash is coming\", just found it to be an interesting piece of financial history.  I don't really like Mr. Cramer but do feel his critique of Bernanke being out of touch with the real world was valid at the time.  I also feel that a similar critique could be made towards Jay Powell nowadays.  Politics and speculation aside, however, I think the video is worth a watch just to see how crazy things were back then.\n\n([Cramer's comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGwgKqTKMFQ) on the episode 10 years later are worth a watch, too)",

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

I don\u2019t think Intel would go out of business but they are slowly loosing market share.\n\nAnd one of the reason why their revenue is so high is because they do design and fab, whereas AMD is fabless. Market share is a better comparison. AMD has 22.5% of the x86 market Q2 2021 vs 18.3% Q2 2020. And the main reason why AMD didn\u2019t gain even more is because of supply constraints, which should normalize in 1-2 more years.\n\nI do agree Pat Gelsinger is trying his best to turn the company around, but changes in this industry take many years to materialize so in the meantime, you just have to take his word for it. IMO, the culture at Intel has become that like of a slow behemoth with fiefdoms where people are resistant to change. And compared to competitors, their employees are underpaid, not helped by their stagnant stock prices. So they are not attracting anywhere close to the best people.",

        "body": "Less bad then you might think. Most people fundamentally misunderstand what caused the supply crunch thus fundamentally misunderstand who is adversely affected.\n\nCovid didn't suddenly cause a massive spike in demand in order to precipitate a crunch. There was some demand increase in consumer electronics sector as more people purchased equipement to work from home but this is rather minimal and mostly focused on products that people didn't already have and are using lower end semiconductor processes, think webcams, mice, keyboards. Take a look at LOGI to see how this side of the demand increase played out.\n\nNow, so what -actually- caused the supply crunch? Well actually it was automakers and other traditional industries that forecasted a massive decrease in demand cancelling or scaling back their supply contracts. This caused foundries to either spin down for retool or sell capacity to someone else. Both are having a significant impact on auto chips right now which are mostly produced on the less advanced 32nm+ node processes.\n\nThe latter is why this affects TSLA less (though they are ultimately still affected which I will address later). They went ahead and purchased the depressed capacity, similarly AAPL/GOOG/QCOM/MRVL all took advantage of this to buy up capacity and lock in cheaper rates for the next couple of years while autos and industrial companies were panicking about a sustained economic recession.\n\nHowever this still ultimately does affect TSLA (and NIO, LI, etc that took similar approaches) in that purchasing capacity during the dip doesn't protect you from increased requirements going forward due to growth. So while they aren't needing to cut production like traditional autos that stupidly cancelled their contracts they aren't able to grow capacity because the same companies that cancelled are now willing to buy capacity at a premium and are buying everything they can.\n\nThis has some big follow-on effects for the semi-conductor industry though, especially combined with developments over the last few years w.r.t geopolitics. Firstly all the big foundries (INTC/TSM/Samsung) are building out new fabs now. These take 2-3 years to online but once they do come online we are going to see a massive supply glut which will drastically lower the prices of NAND, consumer electronics chips etc and free up the older fabs for the next gen of auto/industrial chips which will slowly upgrade from 32nm+.\n\nThe boom/bust, crunch/glut cycle is nothing new for semi-conductors but there has just been a perfect storm of factors to make this particular cycle very noticable for the first time of people outside of consumer electronics.",

I see more downside risk in the event intel makes a breakthrough (although that is highly unlikely for awhile) or a negative event occurs. \n\nRegardless, AMD\u2019s run up is backed by fundamentals and reasonable expectations. There are definitely major downside risks since it has a P/E of almost 40, but it can definitely grow into that P/E if it continues its current trajectory.

However I looked into it and here are some reasons why the OP is an idiot.\n\nHis argument is that INTC is a good investment because of the automotive chip shortage.\n\n1). INTC doesn\u2019t make automobile chips\n\n2). Neither do the car companies\n\n3) car computer modules are created by companies who then outsource in bulk the components.  So something like Chrysler will buy a module from Bosch who will buy the from the cheapest bidder.\n\n4) there is a chip shortage.  However the current issue is that because it\u2019s outsourced through several rings of suppliers car manufacturers have almost no control over their supply chains and no clout over their actual producer(TSM).  So when they cancelled and then restarted their orders the auto industry set their supply chains back a few months. \n\nThe shortage is that, several months worth of production.  It might sound big for Toyota to make 1.5m fewer cars this year.  But that\u2019s 15%.  It\u2019s not a total shutdown.\n\n5). If this were an EV issue then companies that don\u2019t really sell EVs, most of them (Nissan/Renault, Stellantis, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Mazda, etc) wouldn\u2019t have been hit either, no?\n\nFinally, Ford has what?  100k LiON batteries to put in cars this year?  In their production run of 7m cars?  Ford can try and blame EVs, but the truth is their whole industry blundered bigly.  Ford just blundered worse cause they\u2019re so bad at managing supply.\n\nYou\u2019re arguing a secular increase in chip usage due to EVs.  Hey genius, there\u2019s a secular increase in chips due to everything.   It\u2019s why TSM is putting $100b into capex this year.",

        "body": "So as a person that\u2019s been an investor for decades AND I have worked in the tech industry for decades, I personally have sold all my Intel stock. I held Intel for about fifteen years but I\u2019m now very convinced that their glory days are behind them. They certainly will be a billion dollar company for decades to come but they are just far too behind the next big race. Here is why. \n\nThe actual architecture and nature of the cpu race has changed. For years it was all about raw performance, we saw this with x86 architecture (which is intels bread and butter) we have seen this for 30 years, higher clock speeds, more cores. But two major shifts happened in the industry that Intel just isn\u2019t prepared for. One is the rise of mobile devices led by the iPhone with android soon to follow. Power consumption became the driving metric for better battery life. Most mobile phones use a cpu architecture called\u201cARM\u201d vs Intels x86 architecture that powers most windows devices. ARM CPU\u2019s use considerably less power then their x86 counterparts and now that the worlds primary computer is their phone, arm has considerable market share. The next thing that happened was ARM CPU\u2019s became incredibly powerful and could rival (and sometimes just destroy) X86 CPU\u2019s in performance while consuming less power. The industry term now is \u201cperformance per watt\u201d This is why Apple is switching out their entire product line to ARM even on Mac\u2019s which over the last decade or so ran Intel CPU\u2019s. \n\nAnother tech shift is cloud computing with the rise of AWS, Azure and Google cloud. Electric costs are out of control for big data centers so these guys are turning to ARM CPU\u2019s for server side work as well. This is a MASSIVE shift in the industry that no one knows about except people that work in the industry. So Intel is being directly assaulted on both the server side and the mobile side in a war that they were WAY late to the party on. I don\u2019t see them recovering easily from this shift. \n\nNow of course none of this happens over night and it will probably take a decade but their hay-days are behind them. Then you look at what AMD is doing and they are actually making decent products after all these years. So even on Intels home turf they have a fierce competitor. Hope that helps.",

Undervalued means that the company should be valued more than what the stock price represents and as such it should and will go up at some point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, regarding Intel. I am not sure how much you follow Intel but their new processor Alder Lake will be released this year. They are finally getting into the gaming GPU market with their GPU Alchemist which is due in the beginning of 2022.\n\nBoth of these are rumored to be good and compete at the top. Intel also has a roadmap to improve even more in the gaming GPU market in the upcoming years.  \n\nRegardless if this GPU competes at the top of the gaming GPU market, it takes market share from Nvidia and AMD and adds profits to Intel from a market they were not in at all up to this point. \n\nBased on older CPU prices compared to AMD, Intel also has the ability to sell cheaper than at least AMD.\n\nIntel got a contract from the US government to build a foundry on US soil to combat the control China has on the chip market.\n\nIntel are noticing a very massive growth potential in the automotive market with the chip shortage and are changing their factory in Ireland to manufacture chips for cars.\n\nIntel are going to invest $95 bil in boosting up chip manufacturing in Europe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntel is way undervalued for what they have going for them in the future.",
