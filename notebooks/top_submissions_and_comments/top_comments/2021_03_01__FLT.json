Regulations are going to slow down drone companies in the future I\u2019m unsure about American regulations on drones. However drone delivery Canada has been working with regulatory bodies and are finding success. They are now partnered with air Canada.\n\nThey way I look at it is. I get in early and watch this sucker grow. I\u2019m sure people who invested in electric cars companies early on are reaping the benefits. I give Drone Delivery Canada until 2025-2030 or so to be well known such as Tesla.",

Company partnered with Air Canada, who is looking to expand its income diversity after what happened 2020-2021. So they have big backers. \n\nStill a small stock (less then 2 cad) so monke brain over here can by a decent amount of shares for bargain bin prices. \n\nShare seems to be below a good evaluation, considering that they are still a relatively new company in a very new industry. \n\nThe industry prospects seem to be far more greater than just delivery (ie Amazon and Fedex) but could expand into farming, the oil industry, security sector, recreation, and maybe even flying cars. \n\nCompany has some decent financials (not profitable) but last time I checked they have a few million in cash to keep them afloat. Minimal debt as well (most of it is invested in land or machinery, so dissolvable assets) and the operational costs are minimal.\n\nThey just got their first job. And I think they are sending supplies to a remote indigenous community somewhere here in Ontario. \n\nStock has grown from 0.88 cad to 1.87 cad over the past few months. \n\n*not investment advise and the numbers and facts could be off, I\u2019m just going off memory",
