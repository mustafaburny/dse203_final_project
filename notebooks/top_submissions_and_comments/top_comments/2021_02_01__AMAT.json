        "body": "If you're playing the chip shortage you gotta have a basic understanding of how chips are made and what each company does. You have chip designers, manufacturers, and suppliers.  The best positioned will be the suppliers and the manufacturers.  TSM is the manufacturer everyone knows, but you gotta understand how a chip is made. TSM still  requires supplies for chemicals for vapor deposition and photo resist, machines needed for photolithography, etc. Etc.  Target the companies that make machines for manufacturing and the suppliers of materials that TSM needs.  LRCX, AMAT, KLAC are some examples.\n\nMy personal favorite is applied materials, which constantly beats earnings, had a record backlog of orders last quarter, and looks like it'll get even more business with the shortage.  Applied Materials is a key supplier of equipment to TSM. TSM also committed to spending billions of dollars on capital upgrades. Who do you think they'll be buying machines from to address the shortage? Applied materials.  Also, TSM is opening up a new factory in Arizona that'll likely need new capital equipment to get up and running. Applied materials is right next door in CA. \n\nFinally, did you Al see the news? Apple id partnering with TSM to make oled displays.  Guess who got into the digital screen market and who has products for manufacturing OLED displays?  Applied materials again.  For a while, the foray into digital screens hasn't been a smashing success for AMAT, which some bears nitpicked on, but it's very possible now that the Apple-TSM deal will rub off on Amat because TSM buys a ton of Amat products.\n\n Imagine how bullish the upcoming forward guidance may be for AMAT during the next ER. It could be monstrous due to the shortage and if there are some easter eggs in the display division that may be changing course from a laggard to a highly on demand area, the response from the market may be outstanding.  But just based on last ER from AMAT, I'd expect this upcoming ER to be a smashing success. Hell, we may even get lucky with a raised dividend they have so much cash.",

In the end, quality always matters. As a part of my framework, I allocate roughly 5% of my portfolio to purchase speculative stocks which don't yet meet my criteria for a core position in my portfolio. Speculative plays include things like IPOs, SPACs, etc. They can also include items like Gamestop, AMC or Blackberry. \n\nHaving a dedicated allocation of your portfolio to take on these items offers multiple benefits:\n\n1. If the play finds support at zero, its a maximum of 5% across my account.\n\n2. Since this 5% total is between any of my new or speculative stocks, it limits exposure overall (e.g. a blend of GME, AMC, BB, + CCIV, IPOE) limits your risk as opposed to dedicating all 5% to one play.\n\nIf a speculative item does well and I start to gather more data to support my position on it (e.g. understand what the company is actually doing/their roadmap, their customers/contracts, and sector risks; hard data/math: volatility, geometric mean, Sharpe/Sortino ratios) I consider adding it to my core portfolio (purchasing more and elevating it out of \"speculative\" status). \n\nOnce added to my core portfolio, it becomes something that I purchase on a regular cadence (e.g. every pay period I purchase my core portfolio). \n\nRisk management takes incredible discipline, but having a strategy and sticking to it (until something materially changes with your strategy to warrant changes) will give you the best results in the long-term, especially if you're buying individual securities. \n\nGood luck",

Sure, they've got hype and good press, but their business is not set up to be competitive in the space tourism sector. Air launch is expensive and a fair bit of hassle, meaning their tickets will be very high price. It may seem at the moment that they're close to launching paying passengers, but let's look at their competitors 3-5 years down the line. You have SpaceX with both Crew Dragon (just announced their first all-civilian flight) and Starship (coming soon\u2122\ufe0f, but will have huge implications for space tourism), as well as Blue Origin, which is less ambitious but about in the same product slot as SPCE. Both of these companies have huge financial backing and are on track to have significantly lower costs, higher launch cadence, and better product. SPCE may have a small niche somewhere in that market, but I don't think long-term it is a good play.\nSource: am space nerd. \n\nDisclaimer: not financial advice, no position in SPCE",
