Yet it executes barely any transactions every second, its energy usage is humongous (1 transaction = carbon footprint of 1 000 000 Visa transactions and energy usage of an average US house for 38 days... ONE TRANSACTION!!!), transaction verification is centralised in China and is pretty much innaccessible on a large scale in most developed countries (because of energy cost)...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're now in the third generation of blockchain technology, BTC looks good on paper because it defined what cryptocurrencies should be in theory, but once you think about general usage then it doesn't make sense to use it except for those who are absolutely in love with the technological aspect... As adoption increases people will not want to use the crypto that costs them high transaction fees and with which transactions take minutes to hours (while they stress about having entered the right wallet address), they won't give a crap about decentralisation just like they don't understand or care about the technology behind the chip that lets them pay without swiping their card in the machine, what they want is something that simply works! I can transfer Algo from one wallet to another in 10 seconds max (when under heavy load like during the crash) and it costs me 0.001$, that's what the general public will want if they're to be sold on replacing what they already use to pay for things!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's like a car enthusiast daily driving a car from the 50s in 2021, yeah it's the \"pure\" experience and as simplified as it gets to drive a car as we define it today, but since then things have evolved and you'll never get the public at large to go back to all the compromises that come with the experience!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf Bitcoin released today and we had started with the second generation of coins it would be considered to be absolute shit.",

Not a single one even entertains crypto for b2b transactions. We can send a bank wire for $500k that costs less than it does to send $5 worth of bitcoin, arrives immediately, and is secured.

Will update this post with interesting or humorous tidbits as I hear 'em\n\n- Guy at 26:00 calls out $HOL for not having any successful launches yet projecting daily launches by 2025 \ud83d\ude02\n- 52:30 \"Even if SPACs themselves have flaws, maybe they're identifying some underlying problems with traditional IPOs, and maybe we have to ask what they're telling us about the market that could be improved\"\n- Ah this hearing is meant to be a catchall for companies going public in general. As such you have the usual back and forth between witnesses &amp; reps who are either for regulation / investor protection or deregulation / more streamlined access to public markets\n- Over an hour in and no one has brought up the fact that SPACs are highly flexible. You have the ol' Tontine structure, as well as certain newer SPACs which grant no warrants at all, which addresses the dilution issue. This space could very well end up self-correcting once a bunch of sub-par teams either fail to find targets or don't pass merger votes\n- Same guy that called out $HOL makes this weird claim at 1:02:55 that you can vote in favor of a merger while dumping commons, then hold onto warrants for risk-free profit? Don't you have to vote no to get NAV back? Couldn't make heads or tails of the strat he was describing, nor did I see any issue with it. Then this gem: \"All throughout the SPAC process, everyone has their own set of incentives where they can make money.\" No shit Sherlock? He did get cut off before finishing that thought but it probably wasn't going anywhere coherent lol\n- OK they briefly made the point I brought up re: flexibility and self-regulation at 1:15:40\n- There seems to be a consensus around forward-looking statements being sus as an initial pricing mechanism. I don't think they'll be going away entirely, but it's safe to assume the safe harbor loophole is going to be closed. In other words, more legal risk for pre-revenue/growth companies\n- Rep at 1:36:00 poses that if the motivation to invest in a pre-DA SPAC is the management team, they may actually more closely resemble management companies per the '40 Act and should be regulated as such. Not familiar with what that would entail materially but it doesn't sound great\n- Lmfao at the last exchange of the hearing being a general bemoaning of celebrity involvement in SPACs. They'd only need to take 1 look at this sub to see that most of those get soundly shit on\n\nOverall, I wouldn't characterize the discussion as \"relaxed\" the way [Reuters](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/nk8dky/capital_calls_congress_seems_relaxed_over_spacs/) did, but it wasn't doom or gloom either. I think government will ultimately push some light regulatory nerfs through (warrants as liabilities + removal of safe harbor) and let the market sort the rest out. Which leaves me with the same concerns expressed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/nhnkio/announcements_x_daily_discussion_for_may212021/gyznrg6/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ni40hi/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gz7qjvi/?context=3).",

        "body": "Because he's *right*, and they should be scared of his influence (and us). After watching George Gammon's videos all night, I've been studying Paul Franke's article this morning titled *The Great 2021 Bond Market Collapse* and making sure what I've been reading/watching are correlating with his hypothesis. Below are the most important notes from his article I sent to my spouse; Burry is absolutely right to short TLT *and* TSLA (TSLA is grossly overvalued). Regarding treasuries, this is scary shit. I want to warn my family about a financial collapse but know they'd look at me like I was crazy... I probably shouldn't even bother telling my therapist. She'll just tell me to \"stay in the present.\" hah\n\nThe Great 2021 Bond Market Collapse  \nhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4413979-great-2021-bond-market-collapse  \nCPI = Consumer Price Index  \nGDP = Gross Domestic Product  \nYOY = Year Over Year  \nNote 1:  \n\u201cTo artificially drive interest rates lower for the common good over the last 12 months, the FED under Chairman Powell has purchased nearly $4 trillion in Treasuries, added mortgage securities, and even acquired corporate bonds to stabilize prices after the coronavirus pandemic recession of 2020. In total, measured from the Great Recession bond buying program begun under Chairman Bernanke in 2008, **the FED\u2019s balance sheet has risen $7 trillion. For perspective, $1 trillion in FED assets was accumulated over the previous 95 years of the central bank\u2019s existence**. These quantitative easing efforts have injected $7 trillion in paper money and liquidity ($23,000 per U.S. citizen, $92,000 for a family of four) into the financial system the last 12 years, **producing the biggest bond/stock bubble in the financial world\u2019s history.**  \nAt some point soon, if interest rates are not allowed to free float again, **either capitalism will be supplanted by complete government management of the economy like other socialist experiments that ultimately failed miserably, and/or confidence in our currency by foreigners could implode.\u201d**  \nNote 2:  \n\u201cWell, with loan rates still being held underwater by record Federal Reserve interference in the world\u2019s primary bond market, the 2021 rate picture could quickly become the most detached from reality since 1966. **The projected 6% gap between nominal GDP growth in the second half of the year and the current 10-year Treasury rate is absolutely horrible news for bond investors.**   \nAnalysts are boosting their growth and inflation forecasts, with Americans on the cusp of getting stimulus checks under President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion package. The average projection for nominal gross domestic product hit a 32-year high of 7.6% in Bloomberg surveys. Even after doubling to 1.6% since November, 10-year bond rates can barely keep up with the growth upgrade, leaving the gap between the two likely to be the largest since Lyndon Johnson was President.   \nNote 3:  \n**The last time nominal GDP to bond market yields was this out of whack with reality came during the rising inflation 1960s and spiking inflation 1970s.** While some of us have been suggesting investors look to inflation hedges since the FED announced \u201cunlimited money printing\u201d efforts last March, the reality of 3% to even 4% YoY CPI gains by the summer is only now sinking into mainstream thought on Wall Street.\u201d  \nNote 4:  \n\u201c**Warren Buffett** (CEO of Berkshire Hathaway), in his annual report letter to shareholders released late in February, specifically mentioned **fixed-income investors face a \u201cbleak future\u201d as inflation and economic growth accelerates after the pandemic.** Jamie Dimon (CEO JP Morgan Chase) correctly and aptly recommended investors shun the Treasury market back in early December. **He said he would not touch the U.S. government bond market with a 10-foot pole**, much less consider buying securities at today\u2019s record low yields.\u201d  \nNote 5:  \n\u201cIf the FED refuses to raise short-term savings rates and/or allow long-bond yields to increase a further 1-2% this spring, **we could see a complete loss of confidence in the dollar\u2019s exchange rate, forcing foreigners to liquidate U.S. financial assets.** And we desperately need overseas capital with our staggering structural sovereign deficit borrowing needs of $2+ trillion each year, alongside the $5-7 trillion mountain of annual refunding requirements.  \nNote 6:   \nIf they (FED) don\u2019t allow a bond market rout (likely cascading to a stock market tank similar to 1987), **even bigger issues with our currency will hit like a bomb later in 2021.** Compared to a relatively stable U.S. currency situation for decades, none of us in America have experienced a true currency crisis, **or what repercussions a 30-50% drop in the dollar would unleash on world trade and wealth movements.** \\[For example, given a Yuan to dollar value increase of 40%, the Chinese economy would almost overnight become the largest in the world, passing America with a gracious wave as they zoom by the former #1.\\]  \nNote 7:  \nThe flip side is a **FED adding fuel to the inflation fire by continuing to interfere in Treasury security, corporate debt and mortgage markets.** If that is our future, I fully **expect a dollar tank will be the release valve for those wanting to express their disappointment in America\u2019s failing economic experiment in socialism.** A total train wreck in the dollar\u2019s exchange rate could quickly lead to even higher inflation and interest rates in 2022, nicely above 5%.\u201d  \nNote 8:  \n\u201cMy gut feeling is the March 2021 world is looking a lot like the middle of 1987, which I traded. A weakening dollar, record money printing, a super-strong +50% stock market advance over six months, spiking commodity prices, an upturn in the economy, and a zig-zagging lower bond market were ingredients of the 40% equity market crash over less than seven weeks into October 1987. Sound familiar? **The scary difference to consider is today\u2019s stock market is the most overvalued in history, based on total market capitalization to GDP output, price to tangible book value, and price to underlying business sales.**  \n**Playing the FED\u2019s current game of manipulation, guaranteed to outline amazing losses in asset purchasing power, spells real trouble for funding Uncle Sam going forward, at a time of record need.\u201d**  \nNote 9:  \n**\u201cTLT remains the \"poster child\" bond investment to Avoid or Sell. I am modeling another 20-30% price decline, on top of the 13% loss in 2021 to date,** assuming coronavirus herd immunity is being reached into June and the FED realizes its aggressive easing mantra has reached checkmate.  \nI have been short TLT off and on since December. **My battle plan today is to reenter a small short position in the $136-138 area**, on a minor rebound following last week's beat down. This position is a good candidate for a straight 10% stop-loss level (buy-stop in this case) on my sale price. If my thesis is correct, more intense bond selling is right around the corner with robust and upgraded economic/inflation numbers reported by the government.  \nReal estate holdings, **REITs**, oil/energy conglomerates, and utilities as income alternatives seem to **have better odds of maintaining their purchasing power years down the road.** However, these investments may also suffer losses in a stock market debacle, before rebounding.\u201d  \nNote 10 (holy shit):  \n**\"I can think of just two events that could prevent a bond market implosion the rest of 2021. Scenario #1: the FED talks the big New York City banks into intentionally crashing the stock market first, thus relieving the building consumer confidence, spending and inflationary pressures. Scenario #2: variants of the coronavirus unaffected by current vaccination formulas make a big comeback in April-May, forcing new economic disruptions, lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, like those appearing in Europe this weekend.** So yes, we may be stuck with a number of rotten realities to choose from right now.  \n**If you pair short sales in weaker securities like bonds against relatively undervalued names continuing to witness strong buying, your portfolio can rise in value even if the wheels fall off our financial markets.** That's how I am positioned.\u201d  \n   \nThe 1987 stock market crash: Original news report:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0\\_8YEglCFdU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_8YEglCFdU)  \n\n\n*tl/dr: The market is fucked.

And how high interest rate are we talking about here?  We are near zero percent, even if we were to go to 2%, that's still nothing.  Most people would risk borrowing at 2% for the chance to expand production for your lemonade materials, and I bet that even you wouldn't hesitate to expand to many more locations when you know that the demand for lemonade is still strong.  This is why inflation is a better problem to have than deflation.
