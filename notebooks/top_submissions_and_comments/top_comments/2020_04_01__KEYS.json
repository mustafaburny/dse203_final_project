        "body": "Full memo from Pichai:\n\nHi everyone,\n\nIt\u2019s now been well over two months since we closed the first Google offices in Asia out of an abundance of caution around the spread of COVID-19. We couldn\u2019t have imagined then how much could change, and how quickly, for so many people around the world. Our thoughts remain with those who have lost loved ones and with those who are currently battling the disease.\n\nWe\u2019re only a quarter of the way through 2020, and it\u2019s already been the most unusual year in memory. None of us could have predicted that most of us would now be working from home during the biggest global pandemic of our lifetimes.\n\nDespite these strange circumstances, it\u2019s been remarkable to see us step\u00a0up to\u00a0meet this challenge by doing what we do best: being helpful. We\u2019ve continued to show up for people in moments big and small, whether it\u2019s providing accurate and authoritative information to keep families safe; supporting products and infrastructure to keep our and others\u2019 services running; and delivering great content to keep people\u2019s spirits up in tough moments. We\u2019ve also committed more than\u00a0$800 million\u00a0in grants, loans and ad credits to help small businesses and others affected by COVID-19, and Google.org has committed\u00a0$50 million\u00a0(plus an additional\u00a0$2,500\u00a0in gift-matching per Googler) to help communities all over the world.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, many teams have been focused on helping governments and public health officials slow the spread of the disease. We\u2019ve released insights based on aggregated, anonymized data to help public health experts measure the impact of social distancing measures. We announced a joint effort with Apple on contact tracing designed with strong privacy protections. And we\u2019ve invested in ramping up testing (including through Verily) and the production of PPE and lifesaving medical devices.\n\nI am so proud of the way we\u2019ve come together across the company, and I want us to continue living\u00a0up to\u00a0our important mission in the weeks and months ahead. It won\u2019t be easy. Just like the 2008 financial crisis, the entire global economy is hurting, and Google and Alphabet are not immune to the effects of this global pandemic. We exist in an ecosystem of partnerships and interconnected businesses, many of whom are feeling significant pain.\n\nThe clear lesson from 2008 is that preparing early is key to weathering the storm and emerging in a position to continue long-term growth, as we have done over the past decade. So I wanted to share with you our current plans on what we think is the best path forward.\n\nWe are reevaluating the pace of our investment plans for the remainder of 2020. That starts with taking a more critical look at the pace of hiring for the rest of the year. For context, we hired 20,000 Googlers in 2019 and had been targeting a similar number for 2020. We have already onboarded more than 4,000 Nooglers and Characters in the first quarter, and thousands of additional new hires are starting soon. Not only are we facing delays in getting everyone their essential equipment, such as laptops and security keys, there are challenges in getting Nooglers\u00a0up to\u00a0speed, trained and productive on their new teams.\n\nWe believe now is the time to significantly slow down the pace of hiring, while maintaining momentum in a small number of strategic areas where users and businesses rely on Google for ongoing support, and where our growth is critical to their success. By dialing back our plans in other areas, we can ensure Google emerges from this year at a more appropriate size and scale than we would otherwise. That means we need to carefully prioritize hiring employees who will address our greatest user and business needs. Your leads will be in touch with you about how this will work for your team.\n\nBeyond hiring, we continue to invest, but will be recalibrating the focus and pace of our investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non business essential marketing and travel.\nIf you have additional ideas about how we can free up or redeploy resources to make us more efficient and support our priorities, I welcome your thoughts and invite you to share them by replying here.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, the bright spot for me has been watching everyone pitch in to help your teammates and communities, and to make things better for the people we serve. We\u2019ll need that same level of energy, ingenuity and teamwork in the weeks and months ahead. Working together, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll emerge from this challenge in a strong position.",

A $400k house that's appreciating at 10% a year is throwing off a free $40k annually. If you buy it you don't make $20k a year anymore, you make $60k as long as you're pulling the appreciation out at regular intervals. Which, surprise surprise, plenty of people were doing.\n\nNow obviously that couldn't last forever, and when it ends you walk away from the mortgage, mail the keys to the bank, and keep the $40k/yr you cashed out in the meantime. Your credit score takes a hit, but that goes away eventually.\n\nThe banks were paying your stupid neighbors to live in their houses and your dumbass was like, \"Free money? Fuck that, I'm too poor to get free money.\"\n\nA lot of you are going to bitch and moan about what I just said. Or say it's clearly stupid and would never last. Or it's morally wrong.

        "body": "There are many problems with not putting a sizeable down payment. For civilians the biggest one is PMI, which is a huge burden to pay monthly. Luckily VA loans do not have this.\n\nHowever the ideal is still to put 20% down for these reasons:\n\n1.Without equity in the home you will be underwater (owe more then the home is worth), from the moment you get the keys. If you get into trouble, or decide to sell, you will need to take out a loan just to pay the fees in order to sell. \n\n\nClosing costs, and agent fees are often 10-15% of the homes value, so you are exposing yourself to a very bad situation if your finances or job prospects take a turn for the worse. \n\nIf you are buying in the near future, there is a real chance that the bottom is going to.fall out of the market, so there is a even more of a chance of being underwater. \n\n2.Your principal is higher at the inception. This you are paying interest on a higher number, and your monthly payment will be higher. You can somewhat alleviate this by putting extra money in later, but it won't change the higher payments or all the interest you will be paying. Remember that mortgages are front loaded with interest so even a few years in you will have very little equity with no down payment. \n\n\nI have a friend who was stationed out here for 4 years, and picked up a beautiful $800k house zero down. He pays the minimum mortgage, and meanwhile drives a Tesla and lived a pretty lavish lifestyle for a officer. \n\nHe left to Florida, and now rents it. \n\nWhen it was new he was having no issues finding a renter to pay enough to cover his $4000 a month mortgage/maintenance fee nut. Now that it is a few years old he is struggling, and having to throw a few $100 every month on top of the lowered rent. \n\nIf he sells in this market he may get close to the sale price of 800k, but to sell for 800k, means he will end up having to write a huge check since he has hardly any equity.",

        "body": "Think of a roulette table. This analogy works in about half a dozen ways.\n\nThe roulette operator is a Union employee of the casino, it's not her money. Market makers get Hedge fund money because they're not correlated to the market. Losses just happen sometimes, cost of doing business.\n\nThe roulette dealer doesn't place a bet on red just because a dozen people put a bet on black. They don't put a bet on black either. If they payout they payout, the cash cart comes around with more chips. Market makers neither bet against the players nor with them as a hedge. They just take the bets, it's not the end of the world. People will give them more Capital, either the government or the institutions.\n\nThe table pays a big jackpot. People get their picture taken with a big check and more people come to the casino. They make it all back eventually. Paying WSBGod 1 million in TSLA call money means that 200k people see it on r/all, and a new casino full of traders comes to YOLO their second mortgage. There is a sucker born every day, but outlier million dollar losses happen once a month.\n\nRoulette has a large house edge. If they spin ten times, payout twice, the bets collected from the other 8 rounds means there's still more cash in the drawer than at the beginning of the day. Market makers can afford to pay the losses because 78% of options purchased expire worthless. They take that 5% edge and wherever you buy a put that expires worthless, their loss cushion gets a little bit bigger.\n\nA casino doesn't have just one roulette table. A man puts all his chips and his car keys on 00 and gets paid a jackpot of 75 grand, but the floor has 25 tables, with 4 people each who think today is the day, and put a thousand dollars on Odd. The house is still profitable.\n\nRoulette isn't the only game the casino plays. If all the roulette tables pay, there's keno, blackjack, and poker. If options is losing money, there's always futures and bonds and good ol fashioned commission.",

It can be argued that what the Fed is trying to combat, is not just the market crash and pandemic, it is systemic deflation.\n\nSince credit *is* money then deflation means there is less credit in the system and austerity is closing like a boa constrictor.  Too much inflation is bad but too much deflation stops growth.\n\nThe more deflated the economy the less likely you are to get credit to start a business or credit for a mortgage etc.\n\nHowever, in doing the initial tranche of credit easing and seeing the market reaction the Fed then effectively handed the keys to the printer to the Treasury (Donald Trump).  They are now using it to go fucking wild.

You can build a solution based on an SQL database or you can build a solution in Excel. Both will work, but the two are not one and the same. Many clients are perfectly happy with a nicely formatted Excel file if it means they get a new tool or have to do less than they did before. I am very confident when I say that half of EY works on old Excel spreadsheets for that matter.\n\n&gt;\tSome were doing this, yes, just to claim they are using \u201cblockchain.\u201d That was 2017-8. The focus now that the hype has died down is utility.\n\nThis couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. It is absolutely hype-driven because it is classified as an emergent tech.\n\n&gt;\tHow can this tech make my supply chain more efficient/costly? How can I upgrade my existing ERP accounting systems? How can I better manage my inventory so that my entire organization (and partners) can see where things are and when on a as needed basis? Etc etc etc.\n\nAll of this can indeed be implemented with blockchains, but it will be implemented less efficiently than if it was done with regular databases using cryptographic keys. This is not a new problem.\n\n&gt;\tYour inexperience and lack of education on blockchain in general is starting to shine through with this statement.\n\nOkay, cool, I\u2019m not going to try and convince you otherwise.

Every leader with half of brain knows this now and thus acts accordingly to protect these institutions of global power.  That's all they are.  Production = power.  If the US lets the banks fail in 2008, you basically just handed over the keys to the next country in line that's willing to cheat the game harder (china).\n\nChina figured this out and acted swiftly to consolidate power ala propping up their state-owned entities, stealing IP, etc.  Basically taking all the shortcuts.  The US has known this for a long time as well but our democracy is the weak point which is why Donald Pump acts like a fucking dictator",

Then you have to hope the police is smart enough to get your money back after years (doubtful) see QuadrigaCX.\n\nThe only way to \"hedge\" bitcoin is to buy a special physical device (and make sure it's not counterfeit) and hold the BTC on it... because anything else is opening yourself to attack. **If you don't own the keys, you don't own the crypto.** Even temporary presence on an exchange is a risk, a danger.\n\nImagine telling grandma her whole life savings is gone, police can't do anything and there's no paper trail of the money... that's what BTC is a way for malware authors to get payment and criminals to launder money (it is not anonymous there's tracing services but it's so much money only state actors can afford it). Or imagine being the software engineer who made a million in Silicon Valley tried to use BTC to transfer all the money back to Canada and got all his BTC stolen by Quadriga.\n\nThere's good uses for it too and if you have the skills you could buy some for fun, but it's never going to get widespread adoption. A bank would just make their own digital coin instead of letting whales launder their money by accepting BTC.\n\nAs for inflation, overrated... as soon as you get your pay, you put it in something that can make you money. Nobody stuffs money in the mattress or has more than a few months expenses.",
