I'm a millennial and I played it really early on, and it was really popular among a smaller crowd at the time. And it wasn't really marketed towards kids at that time (I was in college as were most people I knew playing it). It wasn't until it started moving towards its full release that it started to get uber popular with kids, partly through gamimg becoming a bigger thing on YouTube I think.\n\nEven Fortnite might have had that cycle with some people. I was subbed for UT4 and got into the Fortnite beta, played it and didn't care (this was before it got BR). Maybe there were people younger than me who liked it and stuck with it and eventually it evolved.",
