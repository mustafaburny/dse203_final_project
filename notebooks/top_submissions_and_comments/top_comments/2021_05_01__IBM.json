IBM sat for about a decade before I sold it off, Chi-Chi's crashed and burned. Went through the various market crashes, 2008 was especially bad. Down 39% on that one. I've done very well overall, though after I hit a couple of big targets portfolio-value wise, I basically handed over my accounts to my financial planner. I retired at 52, started a little business with my wife (record store and pop culture stuff), did that for almost a decade and then moved to Florida. I feel we've built sufficient net worth, and liquid assets, to see us through about 25 more years, though not likely we'll live that long.  Other than the stuff being managed for me, I've got a nice 'play' account, mostly full of weed stocks right now. Biggest mistake has always been one of patience - I tend to get in too late and out too early. My longest held stock is EBAY, which I've had since 2005, so while I've had accounts for &gt;30 years, I don't own anything that's just been sitting there for all that time.",

If you mean a shift to wind/solar then its more complicated.  XOM (any oil company) trades energy, and that is an advantage they do have, but the actual tech behind wind/solar is not something they have much of.\n\nThat said, other companies in history have managed to make those kinds of transitions and survived.  IBM started in the mechanical calculation market iirc and transition to electronic.  A LOT of other companies failed to do so and no longer exist. \n\nThe reality is that the future will require a hybrid approach.  Hydrocarbons will not go away. But they will exist in an integrated market.  The question is whether or not XOM wants to become the dominant player in a shrinking pie or a late entry to a diversified portfolio.\n\nIn my experience working with the various majors XOM is likely the least suited to an integrated portfolio.  They are one of the least creative and slowest to exploit new opportunities out there.  But the things they do they do well.  Very well.  \n\nStill unsure if its a good move for them, but if they ever want to walk back to the market cap daddy this is the only way.  But its also a huge GE sized risk.",

No doubt they are a massive juggernaut but where exactly is Amazon a monopoly?\n\nIf I want to buy online goods I can go to Alibaba, Ebay, Pinterest just to start. Ebay and Alibaba aren't tiny little companies getting bullied around by Amazon.\n\nIf I want to host my website on the cloud, instead of AWS I can go to Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM or Alibaba Cloud. Again, these aren't companies who are being abused by Amazon having too much market power.\n \nIf I'm in the digital marketing game, well Amazon certainly isn't a monopoly. Google is the king at the top of the funnel, and Facebook owns the rest of it. \n\nAnd regular old retail? Walmart and Target are no slouches of their own. Shit, I even saw a Barnes &amp; Noble the other day.\n\nSaying Amazon is powerful, sure. Saying they are abusively powerful to the point of monopoly requiring anti-trust action? Where?",

Two of your index funds, VOO and SPY, are the same thing. VOO has a net expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY has 0.09%. I would sell those and buy FNILX which is the same but 0% expense ratio. VTV is a basket of good solid companies with an expense ratio of 0.04%. V is a good choice. KO is good too. It\u2019s gone up in the past few months but it might go up more. I bought KO at the end of January and my position is up 12%. IBM was down because folks thought it was done, but maybe it still has life, so it\u2019s been going up too. I bought IBM at the beginning of February and my position is up 21%. Anyway, I would suggest roughly equal amounts of money in FNILX, VTV, V and KO (or something else you choose). When you have a little more money, choose another company in another sector and keep building from there. A lot of folks just like the index funds, but personally I like to own shares in individual companies. You decide!",

Just 10 years ago Exxon Mobile was by far the largest company in the SP500, and the top 10 included companies like GE, Walmart, Chevron, and IBM, none of which even crack the top 25 anymore. 10 years before that, the only company still in the top 10 is Microsoft, which also spent a long time trading sideways or making marginal gains before really taking off. \n\nThe point of buying the fund is that you most likely aren't going to be picking the right stocks, so you get to benefit from the rising superstars as they come up and the ETF will naturally rebalance itself to give you more exposure to better performing companies and less exposure to companies trending down. As long as the market in general continues to trend upwards they'll be okay. If all you do is buy the current top stocks that, as you put it, are \"driving most of the ETF's performance\", you'd have massively underperformed the market.\n\nI don't think that the correlation between good and bad stock performance caused by ETFs is nearly as bad as people are stating. Most of the money in ETFs is slow moving, on the retail side it's Bogelheads and old school buy and hold mentalities, and on the other side it's stuff like pensions and retirement funds. The reactionary retail investors are all in on meme stocks, ETFs like ARK, and shitcoins.

In my view when he's talking about circle of  competence all it means is situations he understands. In the case of IBM he thought the buisness was undervalued on paper. Thus he put considerable effort into learning about the buisness. For example he interviewed IT professionals at Berkshire and had them explain why they chose IBM thus he felt he had enough information to understand the company. Ultimately he obiously realized that he was out of his depth and the buisness wasn't improving as he thought it would so he sold. It wasn't an emotionally charged decision it was a rational consideration of the facts. If Buffet makes an error in judgement he will sell below what he paid the game he plays is to minimize losses.

So I am guessing at a 3X-12X increase in price (not factoring in inflation) using a PE ratio of 12 (which is low for tech).\n\nLike I said my numbers may be well off, but the fact seems to me that what PLTR offers is there is no good alternative to and as one company uses their software others also need to use it to remain competitive (i.e. it is supposed to help business run better). I am not concerned so much with demand for their software, just them being able to execute quickly enough. You do have PLTR partnering with IBM so something like that should help them implement their software faster, but still there is a long way to go. Last quarter they had something like 330M in revenues. I am looking to see them grow that to 5-15B per quarter, so yeah, its ambitious and there is a long way to go.",
