THAT makes less sense than any of it. What we all took a day off and didnt worry about it then remembered it exists on Tuesday?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is money makers and institutions suppressing the market to buy at lows, they've been doing it ALL FREAKING YEAR. Any bit of news on that shows a hint of negativity about oil, energy, infrastructure/construction, COVID, fucking \"chip shortages\" that never really happened, and all other forms of bullshit have caused catastrophic and disproportional drops in the market, led by growth stocks being trashed. The \"all time highs\" are being propped up by giants in the market, and everything else has been trading sideways since April/May, with little spurts of an up and down that confuse everyone.\n\nThe reason we know this is fuckery is that retail sentiment hasnt changed- no one in retail gives a shit about any of those factors and knows they are FUD, unfortunately we don't control the market  AT ALL so we are just watching them do what they want to shake us out.\n\nThe GME squeeze started as a \"fuck you\" the hedge funds- it had an opposite effect: they realized they could come into Reddit, post whatever they want, spread bullshit, and tank stocks whenever they wanted. And my theory is that it's revenge for what retail did with both GME and AMC. We're seeing a strong reaction by market makers and institutions that do most of their trading in dark pools after or before normal hours of trading which have basically rendered retail unable to react fast enough. \n\nIt's sick but honestly, what did we expect? They have the money, the control, and the agencies in their pocket that will never prosecute or legislate. We never had a chance.",

You make educated guesses on how well businesses that you have no say or involvement in will do. You give them money, and the price changes or stays the same but not necessarily based on any metric you could measure or could have foreseen. Doing this successfully will give a person money orders of magnitude more than being a regular worker at those companies. And the in-between people who help you make those educated guesses and pass the money between you and the business do extraordinarily well too. Like that seems almost hard to believe, and doesn't square with any of the lessons about hard work and the value of a dollar that I learned growing up.\n\nI mean I get compound math, I've read all the literature, and I max out my 401k in Vanguard low-fee ETFs, and would encourage anyone I care about to do so also, but it still seems fake to me.\n\nTo me, \"Internet says GME and Bitcoin will go up and whaddaya know\" doesn't seem any more ridiculous than traditional analysts and economists in whenever the \"good old days\" of investing was. In fact, the traditional investors who lament the state of \"retail\" investors to me seem like the gym coach from South Park saying \"It's not real wrasslin'\". From my research, nearly any policy that could be enacted to clamp down on this \"overspeculation\" and bring back real values-backed investing would almost certainly be opposed by the financial community on the basis of interfering with a free market.

It did seem to go through a squeeze cycle, with a smaller one 8-10 weeks later. \n\nI'm fairly risk averse (...looks at my PLTR swing trades crashing and burning...) but, even then, it felt like a safe play to make a quick buck, and can understand why so many people gave in to that FOMO. \n\n\nThen came the anti-hedge fund crowd who muddies the early thesis, and further drove the hype/FOMO, and somehow we now have a cult.",
