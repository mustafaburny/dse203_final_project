The ADR exists to make it convenient, because the ADR Sponsor will open a brokerage account in Japan, UK, Germany, France, Singapore, etc, fill out the paperwork in Japanese, buy shares in JPY, make appropriate regulatory filings on your behalf. However, the **actual foreign share** is held **in America** by an **American bank**. ADR holders can still vote as if they were shareholders. It\u2019s almost like the old days where $1 was backed by $1 of gold in a bank. \n\nChinese stocks are ADRs. But they aren\u2019t backed by shares of the underlying security. They\u2019re shares of a shell company called a VIE. VIE stands for variable interest entity. \n\nThe VIE is an ostensibly independent company that has negotiated **a contract** with a Chinese company for a share of ALL future profits. The VIE then sells shares **of itself** and these become listed in the USA as ADRs. Someone who owns an ADR of a VIE does not own a share of a Alibaba. They own a slice of a company in the Bahamas contractually \u201cguaranteed\u201d payments by Chinese companies. It\u2019s more like an annuities contract to future profits, but written to break Chinese law. \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the entire structure of VIEs was invented explicitly ~~break~~ *circumvent* Chinese laws prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies. \n\nFinally\u2026 contracts are only as good as the legal systems that govern them. \n\nI have strong faith that neither American nor Japanese courts want to fuck up ADRs of Toyota. They may tinker at the margins, maybe with taxes or disclosure. But they won\u2019t invalidate the structure leaving you with nothing.  \n\nI have approximately 0 faith that China\u2019s courts will respect the legal structure of VIE ADRs when it becomes inconvenient for them. The linchpin of a VIE is just a contract governed by Chinese law, circumventing Chinese law, between a Chinese company and a barely nonfictional \u201ccompany\u201d in the Cayman Islands.\n\nEdit: note as well that many Hong Kong listings of mainland companies are also the VIE structure. Hong Kongers are not allowed to own Chinese A shares either.",

The announcement puts significantly more pressure on MSFT to acquire the NED vertical, especially considering the national security risks associated with this critical IP being vital to the $22B US Army IVAS contract. The Department of Defense has conducted a thorough review and I\u2019m sure they have identified that Microsoft not owning the rights to the \u201cMiracle *MicroVision* Display Engine\u201d represents a national security threat. It would make sense for the DoD to put pressure on MSFT to acquire this IP to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.\n\nor\n\nB) Microsoft gave MicroVision the green light to announce the relationship because MSFT is about to announce acquiring the NED vertical.\n\nEither way it is BAFF (*Bullish as F#cking F#ck*).\n\nAlso, MVIS is positioning itself to be a global leader in automotive LiDAR with best-in-class tech in terms of resolution, specs, and scalability. The IAA Mobility Summit in Munich is coming up in September and MicroVision is hosting the DVN Automotive LiDAR Conference and Expo in Frankfurt in November. Soon the whole world will see we have best-in-class automotive LiDAR.\n\nPosition: 13,450 shares at $7.46 avg, will be adding more JAN23 $42 LEAPS tomorrow. \n\nThis is the way.",

Well the people already positioned in good places hold large 401ks or stocks or and inventory of homes made soo much money. Im 32 and my 401k went from 100k to 220k last year. This market proping has made the well off, better off. So now they are putting all the newly earned money in assets, stocks, homes. Over paying for homes and property isnt a big deal when you made a ton of money against a struggling middle/lower class. This has created alot of inflation for assets which has made it even harder to break out of your current situation. The divide is growing, Shit I think there will be a huge wealth inequality in the younger generation based off home owners before 2020 and after the pandemic. My peers are buying homes they may be able to afford, on 2 incomes over a 30 year period. But people arent afforded the extra slack or cash to deal with all the obstacles life comes with. This will likely lead to a lower birth rate, higher mental illness, higher divorce rates and likely a growing of inequality. Just my opinion. Im currently looking to buy some land in New England around the White Mountains. Maybe im paranoid but land and homes seems to be the new asset to horde. I think the repercussions of global warming will be exponential and can see many wealthy east coasters slowly moving more north over the next 50 years.",
