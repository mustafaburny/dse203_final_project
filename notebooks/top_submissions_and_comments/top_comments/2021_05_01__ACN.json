What I have learned is that most cybersecurity firms are just *firms* with less than 50 employees and contractors. Even the most famous firms that usually expose stuff or get big corp or government contracts are small to mid size firms.\n\n2. Consulting firms such as Accenture and big4 accounting firms are the ones doing a pivot in cybersecurity since last decade. So, they are getting a ton of business in IT audit. They have the money to finance a successful pivot.\n\nFireeye if they want to justify its valuation needs to reinvent itself radically. I don't know how to do a valuation on them. They have some products which seem to be more like advanced anti-virus. They have consultancy services. That's about it. \n\nThe idea of being \"audited by FireEye\" needs a culture shift. As an accounting grad, I can tell you nobody gives a fuck about which business got audited by which firm since Enron. \n\nThey have 3 thousand employees, the revenue growth isn't crazy, the product line is nothing out of the ordinary. On the other hand, they are hiring like crazy (which is one my favorite metrics for valuing a stock).\n\nAnnual report: https://investors.fireeye.com/static-files/4e67a74c-2889-4d35-b14e-04e2e55ecb07",

The issue isn\u2019t typically in the form of H1B visa developers, it\u2019s in the fact that the majority of the work is done outside of the client location and time zone - because clients refuse to pay for what they actually need, and companies need to cut costs in order to implement more for less. Even without language barriers, the lack of face time and disconnect from the business - those driving the requirements - typically causes issues, and would for developers on any visa or country of origin.\n\nYes, Accenture and other firms tend to throw bodies at problems when they don\u2019t have the expertise to meet the need. That\u2019s not true of every instance for any of those companies.\n\nAll consulting firms are guilty of this same shit - the big 4, the \u201call onshore, all citizen\u201d teams, etc. Not to mention the large tech companies are loaded with sponsored international developers.\n\nYou sound like an uppity little shit, with your \u201cany company that wants ME better not use THEM\u201d attitude.
