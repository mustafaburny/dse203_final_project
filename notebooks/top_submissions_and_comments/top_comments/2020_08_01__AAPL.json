Even services like Dropbox and Box don't work in China.\n\nThat's because the Chinese government has some crazy draconian laws that applies to *all* companies, foreign and domestic. FB/Google/Twitter decided they don't want to comply (for good reasons), but companies like Microsoft and Apple do. The CCP doesn't specifically target any American companies.\n\n&gt;We should reciprocate.\n\nShould we copy their Great Firewall as well and ban any apps that doesn't allow government backdoor for data access? Winnie the Pooh can unilaterally ban any site/app he doesn't like, and that's what makes their government terrible, do we really want our President to have *exactly* the same type of power?\n\nIf there are privacy/national security concerns, then legislate through Congress and punish all apps/software that doesn't abide by the law, be it Facebook or WeChat. \n\nHowever I feel extremely uncomfortable that \"national security concern\" is now just the magic keyword that gives the President unlimited power to do whatever he wants. What's next, banning CNN and MSNBC because the FBI \"uncovered\" some connection between the networks and some foreign government?\n\nFurthermore speaking from personal experience, WeChat is used by millions of Chinese Americans as a chat app, very often with friends/relatives back in China. It's very similar to Line and WhatsApp in that regard. Using this logic Trump can ban all phone calls or emails or texts to China because there is a risk of the CCP government monitoring on their side.",

Also adding to all my REIT positions except stag. Eyeing baba and tencent if China gets a big pullback. Adding some to JPM when it was mid 90s\n\n\nKey is price you pay, valuation, that ultimately determines gains.  I love tech, but I ain\u2019t buying any of this right now, and haven\u2019t bought any since late 2018, just enjoying my gains and piling into undervalued stocks like reits and schwab.\n\nBe patient, the market is going to be there everyday for the rest of your life and recessions gonna happen, don\u2019t rush your buys and don\u2019t panic when shit hits the fan..\n\nI\u2019ve held thru tech bubble, 2008, covid.   Buy good shit that will last thru the tough times, always drip, dividend growth beats high dividends over the long term.  Never believe the analysts, it\u2019s educated guesses at best.  Understand the businesses and what the future holds and not what the next 6 months hold.\n\nDon\u2019t panic sell, don\u2019t fomo buy",

I'm friends with her. I spent the last month on phone calls with her trying to help out as much as I could, hand holding at some points. My job is sorta on the line cause if it fails then we all fail yada yada\n\nCome time to demonstrate the product, that work still isn't done. Maybe 20% done total, essentially just what I did. Client's boss is on the call too and gives a speech on how he's disappointed and we're so far behind on it.\n\nAnd then guess what happens. Not prompted whatsoever, that developer lies and says it's my fault and throws me under the bus by saying that she's done, but I put in a config change so the product isn't working (I didn't). I didn't speak up at the meeting since it would be unprofessional for the team to be arguing in that setting (our own boss specifically said not to do that)\n\nNot a trading post, just fucking fuming right now and need to vent. Idk what to do at this point. I have access to the code so I'm just thinking about screensharing with everyone what actually happened.\n\nThose of you who have jobs, what would you bros do\n\nidk apple 600 eow",
