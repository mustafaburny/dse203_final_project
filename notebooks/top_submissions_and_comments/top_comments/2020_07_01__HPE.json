For some officials to say, \"we will not go back into lockdown or close businesses\" and then a couple days later close down businesses, they must be receiving enough intel/pressure to know they're going to lose far more tax revenue in the long run if they try and keep everything open through a huge holiday weekend and just shut everything down on Monday 7/6.

This is how good their reputation is. They're the best.\n\nBet against shit companies. Not the Rolls Royces of the industrial world.\n\nIf you're gonna bet against a foundry, bet against UMC or something.

This has started to decay a bit in recent years, but the last time AMD had the better CPUs in the processor space (a couple of decades ago) you still could not buy a PC with an AMD processor because of various contracts Intel had with the PC manufacturers.\n\nThis is no longer an accurate description of the market. AMD and Intel are both widely available in basically every single OEM's product lineups. I'm sure there's a few random OEMs out there that only use one chip manufacturer for accidental reasons - they got a good wholesale deal, or they have a limited lineup of models and it was easier to use a single chipset - but in general AMD is equally available from all the big OEMs.",

Their CPUs are currently smashing Intel in terms of price to performance, and thir GPUs are significantly cheaper than Nvidias, alebeit with less performance.\n\nNvidia is the market leader in terms of GPUs, have just signed a deal with Mercedes and their next generation of GPU is said to be coming out later this year. With a significant performance increase, you'll be able to get a 2nd tier GPU from the new generation, which will outperform the 1st tier from the previous generation, giving them an even more sizable lead over AMD.\n\nSomeone mentioned in a post here that the future could be APUs - essentially you wouldn't need a GPU becuase the computer's CPU is so powerful it runs all the graphics requirements. And at the moment AMD and Intel do offer some APUs, but right now they are no match for having a dedicated GPU. We're probably 10 years or so away from APUs taking over, if they do.\n\nI personally hold a position in Nvidia.",
