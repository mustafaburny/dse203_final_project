        "body": "SoftBank Nears $40 Billion Deal to Sell Arm Holdings to Nvidia\n\nUnion of Arm, Nvidia would create a powerhouse in the chip industry\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank recently has been involved in a series of big asset sales after being under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. 9984 1.03% is nearing a deal to sell British chip designer Arm Holdings to Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said \u2014 assuming it isn\u2019t derailed at the last minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world\u2019s smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics\u2014and play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year\u2019s biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm\u2019s customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals. Most or all of that is already under way or completed and its shares are up more than 20% this year. Among the sales: big chunks of its holdings in China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and T-Mobile US Inc. following the wireless provider\u2019s merger with Sprint Corp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank has also purchased options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks this year. The sheer size of the bet has had an outsize effect on the overall stock market, driving prices higher, the Journal has reported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt SoftBank, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been working with a small team to negotiate the Arm deal including the chief executive of the chip company, Simon Segars, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, as well as Rajeev Misra, CEO of the firm\u2019s giant Vision Fund, and Akshay Naheta, another executive at the fund.",

AMD tends to trade sideways within channels and those channels are wide enough to crush your 10% OTM options in a single day.\n\nI would recommend buying and playing the two events themselves, either day before (if you want to bet on a gap up) or day of. Buy weeklies and sell during the events. As we have seen from NVDA and AAPL recently, even very strong announcements get sold off in the short term and that selloff plus IV crush will destroy your profits 30 days out.\n\nI personally think the Zen3 event will be the bigger of the two. AMD will be launching CPUs that beat the best Intel has to offer, and probably at lower prices. Zen3 has the potential to be a huge leap forward.\n\nYour description of the NVDA \"battle\" is misguided in my view. NVDA is crushing AMD on market share and NVDA has the performance crown. With the very aggressive pricing of the 3080, NVDA has tried to cut AMD off at the knee because price:performance has been AMD's only selling point. The 30-series launch has been dramatic on Reddit, which is full of children who can't even afford shares, but it is actually a tremendously successful launch. NVDA cannot produce cards fast enough to meet what they've said was a 5-10x increase in demand over the 20-series at launch and initial inventory of both cards were similar. The \"huge driver issues\" have already been solved. The scalper/bot situation is bullish for NVDA because it shows demand is through the roof.\n\nConsoles are generally priced in, AMD inked those deals a long time ago.",

Due to their lithographic issues outlined [here](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm) Intel have been forced to turn to TSMC for chips.\n\nThe second part of your statement would be true in a completely free market, but TSMC's management have stated that they don't view Intel as a long term customer (while they do view AMD as one). This is pretty evident given the fact that once Intel sort out their process they'll abandon TSMC and go back to in house manufacturing only, meaning TSMC's long term interests are aligned with ensuring AMD sees long term growth over Intel. From the comments TSMC management has made over the past few years and the execution of their business plans, I believe that TSMC management is focused more on long term value generation than short term profit, meaning your scenario wouldn't be likely to occur.",

The benchmarks where cherry picked and highly in favor of intel, not going to go into specifics. They were just bullshit. If you are really interested i suggest you look it up yourself.

I also keenly watch what new company Jim keller goes too as he's a genius and made apples soc, ryzen, tesla's insane 21x improvement soc, etc. Right now he's in Intel trying to save their burning so perhaps Intel's new architecture is going to win but I doubt it.",

Some undervalued tech wont be as affected and will continue upward movement(see INTC) and some relative strength will remain in the sector. But expect more bleeding from the ones that had yuge run ups (ZM)\n\nNext leg up will be fueled by recovery plays to build on top of the already strong tech sector.

Again, just because you dont like Trump isnt a good counter argument.  Get over it.

So per core they are doing better and also more gpu speed / cores.   They sacrificed cores for that, hence the lower multithreaded.  I'd guess intel figures most people using thin and light notebooks don't really need 8 cores and would rather have more GPU., probably a good tradeoff for most people\n\nThere will eventually be a tigerlake - H is rumored to actually have less GPU onboard than tigerlake-u since I guess its assumed those will use discrete graphics anyway.  So Intel probably will sell a lot of tigerlake.  It shouldn't really lose much ground on laptops if any in the next year or 2.  I do own a lot of intel shares, and fully expect it to get back to $60 ish in the next 3-6 months.  There is actually a shortage of laptops / chromebooks right now because of the wfh / school from home thing even for the older cpus so Intel should do allright",

        "body": "SoftBank Nears $40 Billion Deal to Sell Arm Holdings to Nvidia\n\nUnion of Arm, Nvidia would create a powerhouse in the chip industry\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank recently has been involved in a series of big asset sales after being under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. 9984 1.03% is nearing a deal to sell British chip designer Arm Holdings to Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said \u2014 assuming it isn\u2019t derailed at the last minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world\u2019s smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics\u2014and play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year\u2019s biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm\u2019s customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals. Most or all of that is already under way or completed and its shares are up more than 20% this year. Among the sales: big chunks of its holdings in China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and T-Mobile US Inc. following the wireless provider\u2019s merger with Sprint Corp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank has also purchased options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks this year. The sheer size of the bet has had an outsize effect on the overall stock market, driving prices higher, the Journal has reported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt SoftBank, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been working with a small team to negotiate the Arm deal including the chief executive of the chip company, Simon Segars, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, as well as Rajeev Misra, CEO of the firm\u2019s giant Vision Fund, and Akshay Naheta, another executive at the fund.",

Due to their lithographic issues outlined [here](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm) Intel have been forced to turn to TSMC for chips.\n\nThe second part of your statement would be true in a completely free market, but TSMC's management have stated that they don't view Intel as a long term customer (while they do view AMD as one). This is pretty evident given the fact that once Intel sort out their process they'll abandon TSMC and go back to in house manufacturing only, meaning TSMC's long term interests are aligned with ensuring AMD sees long term growth over Intel. From the comments TSMC management has made over the past few years and the execution of their business plans, I believe that TSMC management is focused more on long term value generation than short term profit, meaning your scenario wouldn't be likely to occur.",

But expect more bleeding from the ones that had yuge run ups (ZM)\n\nNext leg up will be fueled by recovery plays to build on top of the already strong tech sector.  The vaccine is coming whether you like it or not. Put your political b.s. aside.  This is going to be a green light for getting covid impacted businesses going again at almost 100%. Again, just because you dont like Trump isnt a good counter argument.  Get over it.  Position yourselves accordingly; things like (good)airlines, cruise lines, retail, restaurants, DIS...  might even add in financials\n\nPersonally, I'll be leaving a little bit of reserves to savagely go balls deep into Palantir when they do their ipo later this month.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk",

They now have a proprietary chip with none of the backwards compatability slow downs that come with Intel based chips.

So per core they are doing better and also more gpu speed / cores.   They sacrificed cores for that, hence the lower multithreaded.  I'd guess intel figures most people using thin and light notebooks don't really need 8 cores and would rather have more GPU., probably a good tradeoff for most people\n\nThere will eventually be a tigerlake - H is rumored to actually have less GPU onboard than tigerlake-u since I guess its assumed those will use discrete graphics anyway.  So Intel probably will sell a lot of tigerlake.  It shouldn't really lose much ground on laptops if any in the next year or 2.  I do own a lot of intel shares, and fully expect it to get back to $60 ish in the next 3-6 months.  There is actually a shortage of laptops / chromebooks right now because of the wfh / school from home thing even for the older cpus so Intel should do allright",

        "body": "Letter from Jensen: Creating a premier company for the age of AI\n\nHi everyone, \n\nToday, we announced that we have signed a definitive agreement to purchase Arm. \n\nThirty years ago, a visionary team of computer scientists in Cambridge, U.K., invented a new CPU architecture optimized for energy-efficiency and a licensing business model that enables broad adoption. Engineers designed Arm CPUs into everything from smartphones and PCs to cloud data centers and supercomputers. An astounding 180 billion computers have been built with Arm \u2014 22 billion last year alone. Arm has become the most popular CPU in the world.   \n\nSimon Segars, its CEO, and the people of Arm have built a great company that has shaped the computer industry and nearly every technology market in the world. \n\nWe are joining arms with Arm to create the leading computing company for the age of AI. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. Learning from data, AI supercomputers can write software no human can. Amazingly, AI software can perceive its environment, infer the best plan, and act intelligently. This new form of software will expand computing to every corner of the globe. Someday, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet \u2014 the internet-of-things \u2014 thousands of times bigger than today\u2019s internet-of-people.   \n\nUniting NVIDIA\u2019s AI computing with the vast reach of Arm\u2019s CPU, we will engage the giant AI opportunity ahead and advance computing from the cloud, smartphones, PCs, self-driving cars, robotics, 5G, and IoT. \n\nNVIDIA will bring our world-leading AI technology to Arm\u2019s ecosystem while expanding NVIDIA\u2019s developer reach from 2 million to more than 15 million software programmers. \n\nOur R&amp;D scale will turbocharge Arm\u2019s roadmap pace and accelerates data center, edge AI, and IoT opportunities. \n\nArm\u2019s business model is brilliant. We will maintain its open-licensing model and customer neutrality, serving customers in any industry, across the world, and further expand Arm\u2019s IP licensing portfolio with NVIDIA\u2019s world-leading GPU and AI technology. \n\nArm\u2019s headquarter will remain in Cambridge and continue to be a cornerstone of the U.K. technology ecosystem. NVIDIA will retain the name and strong brand identity of Arm. Simon and his management team are excited to be joining NVIDIA.  \n\nArm gives us the critical mass to invest in the U.K. We will build a world-class AI research center in Cambridge \u2014 the university town of Isaac Newton and Alan Turing, for whom NVIDIA\u2019s Turing GPUs and Isaac robotics platform were named. This NVIDIA research center will be the home of a state-of-the-art AI supercomputer powered by Arm CPUs. The computing infrastructure will be a major attraction for scientists from around the world doing groundbreaking research in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars, and other fields. This center will serve as our European hub to collaborate with universities, industrial partners, and startups. It will also be the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute for Europe, where we teach the methods of applying this marvelous AI technology.  \n\nThe foundation built by Arm and NVIDIA employees has provided this fantastic opportunity to create the leading computing company for the age of AI. The possibilities of our combined companies are beyond exciting.   \n\nI can\u2019t wait. \n\nJensen\n\n[https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/09/13/jensen-employee-letter-arm/](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/09/13/jensen-employee-letter-arm/)",

        "body": "SoftBank Nears $40 Billion Deal to Sell Arm Holdings to Nvidia\n\nUnion of Arm, Nvidia would create a powerhouse in the chip industry\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank recently has been involved in a series of big asset sales after being under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. 9984 1.03% is nearing a deal to sell British chip designer Arm Holdings to Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said \u2014 assuming it isn\u2019t derailed at the last minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world\u2019s smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics\u2014and play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year\u2019s biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm\u2019s customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals.

SB were originally going to be forced to split up part of ARM to keep their terms with the UK gov, but selling it to Nvidia would allow them to keep it together, while Nvidia paying them in shares means that they still can profit off it. \n\n3. According to SB, they have resolved their issues with the Chinese ARM section\n\n4. Share dilution May be an issue in the short term, but ARM can easily bring Nvidias earnings up to make up for that\n\nThe valid point you make is worry for their competitors, but that can be resolved without fully blocking it. Like with what the UK Govt did with SB, they can make terms for the sale. There\u2019s no reason Nvidia would want to cut any of their competitors off however, because selling IPs is how ARM makes money. This parts just my speculation, but enough to show there\u2019s more than a 0% chance this goes through. \n\nDisclosure: I have a fair amt of shares of NVDA",

        "body": "Serious answer. Nothing about this looks good. So the dip in June was also the day that dividends got paid. So of course you're gonna see a slight sell off, right? It bounced off the 50 day moving average and immediately reversed.  This dip happened because of a few giant scumbags taking all their tendies off the table, leaving the entire market holding their wee-wees. NDAQ bounced last week off the 50 DMA and  stopped a couple points shy of the 120 moving average yesterday. Everyone thought it was over. Well, it dipped AGAIN. It crossed the 120 day average, which is typically a pretty damn bearish sign. NDAQ is currently sitting well below the 120 day moving average and it's like we went back in time to June levels.\n\nLet's tally all the bad things, eh?\n\n\\-VIX is looking fuck. Google Backwardation. [VIX Futures.](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VI*0/futures-prices)\n\n\\-We are sitting in a massive gamma trap. Too many calls. Not enough puts. Too little liquidity. Everyone hodling because bull market.\n\n\\-Everything is inflated out the ass. Are things like NVDA and AAPL the giant fucking companies their stocks say they are? Well, yeah. And eventually, they'll 100% grow into those evaluations. Tech obviously isn't going anywhere. But what about smaller companies like TWLO, ZS, ZM, etc? Absolutely not. Those stocks are a couple years ahead of where they should be.\n\n\\-Everyone now knows that a few whales pumped up the market over the last couple months by fucking over the options market. Nothing is behind most of these prices. It's scary as hell from an investor standpoint.  You really wanna pump money into a market that got bicycle pumped to shit by JPOW, Mango Man, and some scuffed bullshit when a pandemic is raging on, not getting any better (Brazil, India, etc) with an extremely controversial election coming up? FUCK NO.\n\n\\- Dollar looking like hot shit.\n\n\\-No stimulus that's worth a shit. Mortgage defaults are at like 4.5%. I'm 99% sure that's why RKT crashed so fucking hard. Yeah, they made an absolute killing, but MORTGAGE DEFAULTS.  RKT is a fantastic investment in a normal environment.\n\n\\-Consumer spending  and confidence are going down like hell.\n\n\\-Most of the hedgies and huge portfolios have definitely made their profits for the year and are going to be looking for a reason to exit the market while it still has legs.\n\n\\-Metals. Look at em. They're doing that 2012 and 1980's bullshit again. Getting all of the same indicators.\n\nI am going to be completely straight-faced and unsurprised if we get a hot circuit breaker tomorrow. All it's gonna take now is another few percent before that snowball gets tumbling.\n\nThis market is manic as fuck. I might be biased because I'm loaded out the ass in bear stuff for a change, but this does not look good. I would love to hear other opinions.",

Just folds like toilet paper so IMO it needs more than this news to gain back to $500+ and actually hold it through a market drop. Be careful and lock in profits if they do moon because I really don't think it will hold unless tech rallys as well. \n\nThe news has been out for a while and logically would be \"priced in\", but maybe Wall Street forgot about it when NVDA dumped from $580 to $470 in a matter of days\n\n[https://wccftech.com/arm-may-be-acquired-by-nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-before-the-end-of-this-summer/](https://wccftech.com/arm-may-be-acquired-by-nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-before-the-end-of-this-summer/)",

        "body": "SoftBank Nears $40 Billion Deal to Sell Arm Holdings to Nvidia\n\nUnion of Arm, Nvidia would create a powerhouse in the chip industry\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank recently has been involved in a series of big asset sales after being under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. 9984 1.03% is nearing a deal to sell British chip designer Arm Holdings to Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said \u2014 assuming it isn\u2019t derailed at the last minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world\u2019s smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics\u2014and play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year\u2019s biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm\u2019s customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals. Most or all of that is already under way or completed and its shares are up more than 20% this year. Among the sales: big chunks of its holdings in China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and T-Mobile US Inc. following the wireless provider\u2019s merger with Sprint Corp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank has also purchased options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks this year. The sheer size of the bet has had an outsize effect on the overall stock market, driving prices higher, the Journal has reported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt SoftBank, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been working with a small team to negotiate the Arm deal including the chief executive of the chip company, Simon Segars, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, as well as Rajeev Misra, CEO of the firm\u2019s giant Vision Fund, and Akshay Naheta, another executive at the fund.",

        "body": "Serious answer. Nothing about this looks good. So the dip in June was also the day that dividends got paid. So of course you're gonna see a slight sell off, right? It bounced off the 50 day moving average and immediately reversed.  This dip happened because of a few giant scumbags taking all their tendies off the table, leaving the entire market holding their wee-wees. NDAQ bounced last week off the 50 DMA and  stopped a couple points shy of the 120 moving average yesterday. Everyone thought it was over. Well, it dipped AGAIN. It crossed the 120 day average, which is typically a pretty damn bearish sign. NDAQ is currently sitting well below the 120 day moving average and it's like we went back in time to June levels.\n\nLet's tally all the bad things, eh?\n\n\\-VIX is looking fuck. Google Backwardation. [VIX Futures.](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VI*0/futures-prices)\n\n\\-We are sitting in a massive gamma trap. Too many calls. Not enough puts. Too little liquidity. Everyone hodling because bull market.\n\n\\-Everything is inflated out the ass. Are things like NVDA and AAPL the giant fucking companies their stocks say they are? Well, yeah. And eventually, they'll 100% grow into those evaluations. Tech obviously isn't going anywhere. But what about smaller companies like TWLO, ZS, ZM, etc? Absolutely not. Those stocks are a couple years ahead of where they should be.\n\n\\-Everyone now knows that a few whales pumped up the market over the last couple months by fucking over the options market. Nothing is behind most of these prices. It's scary as hell from an investor standpoint.  You really wanna pump money into a market that got bicycle pumped to shit by JPOW, Mango Man, and some scuffed bullshit when a pandemic is raging on, not getting any better (Brazil, India, etc) with an extremely controversial election coming up? FUCK NO.\n\n\\- Dollar looking like hot shit.\n\n\\-No stimulus that's worth a shit. Mortgage defaults are at like 4.5%. I'm 99% sure that's why RKT crashed so fucking hard. Yeah, they made an absolute killing, but MORTGAGE DEFAULTS.  RKT is a fantastic investment in a normal environment.\n\n\\-Consumer spending  and confidence are going down like hell.\n\n\\-Most of the hedgies and huge portfolios have definitely made their profits for the year and are going to be looking for a reason to exit the market while it still has legs.\n\n\\-Metals. Look at em. They're doing that 2012 and 1980's bullshit again. Getting all of the same indicators.\n\nI am going to be completely straight-faced and unsurprised if we get a hot circuit breaker tomorrow. All it's gonna take now is another few percent before that snowball gets tumbling.\n\nThis market is manic as fuck. I might be biased because I'm loaded out the ass in bear stuff for a change, but this does not look good. I would love to hear other opinions.",

I'm basically betting that they'll get good subscription numbers in the first week. Especially if their subscription price is cheaper than Amazon Prime. \n\n- TSLA: Risky buy but Battery Day should give it a nice pump. \n\n\nI'll throw my extra money at NVDA and TSM leaps",

Also Sell if you have a negative day past .50% and watch Nvidia instead, or simply wait for the dip to bottom.\n\n  Adobe has consistent growth and is a brand name tech stock.
