A decline is understandable, but I think I was a little surprised to the extent of the decline/how not well this held up vs something like Guardant (GH) - not an apples-to-apples comparison, obviously but kind of interesting.  I think Exact will do fine over time, but all I'm saying is that how not well it did during this is perhaps something to keep in mind.\n\n3. I'd rather PAYC than PAYX but PAYX is fine.\n\n4.
