        "body": "I\u2019m bullish AF. But, if you look at the market Cap of Palantir and Compare it to something like Autodesk who also sells very expensive software, albeit completely dissimilar software in very differently sized packages, you\u2019ll see that Autodesk turns a profit. Palantir is still in the red as far as earnings go. Autodesk\u2019s market cap is roughly 50% greater.  \n\nTwitter has roughly the same market cap as Palantir. It adds very little to the world as far as actual products go, and has roughly the same market cap as Palantir.\n\nNow, imagine in the not so distant future when Palantir\u2019s software is used by every organization in the world. Here they will transform disparate data sets into meaningful  information that is profited off of when acted upon because it adds warp speed to data analysis. This is when you will see the value of Palantir realized. It also seems as though analyzing qualitative data is the first and best step towards developing thoughtful A.I..\n\nTherefore, we are at the beginning of the period where Palantir begins to show value. 40 billion market cap and high volume trades are good signs. But, this is a long hold. If Karp is only half of the backbone that Palantir maintains, to me it is obvious this company is going to be flying beyond the moon.\n\nIn the next 4 years I would say 5x current valuations. In the next 10 possibly 20x. If both Palantir and society are able to really grasp the value they are adding to society, this company is going extremely far.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
