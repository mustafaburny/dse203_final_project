        "body": " \n\n* How old are you? What country do you live in? **Will turn 62 in April. US.**\n* Are you employed/making income? **Yes.** \n   * **Current salary is $115,000, with additional compensation I should gross $123,000ish in 2021. Employer's Safe Harbor contribution to my 401k is additional 5%. This income level is relatively recent as until 2018 I was employed by a non-profit and total AGI was mid $70k.**\n   * **Also have retirement distribution from ex of $23,000 annually, paid monthly. This could end at any time.**\n* What are your objectives with this money? **See below.** \n* What is your time horizon? **I think I'd like to keep working for another 8-10 years but potentially part-time toward the latter part of that.**\n* What is your risk tolerance? **I don't mind a little risk but considering my age I want to keep an eye toward shifting conservative over the coming years.**\n* What are your current holdings? **Will post below.**\n* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses? \n   * **Mortgage balance of $178,000 on value of about $330,000 is it; P&amp;I is $1,000; annual property taxes are $5,500, homeowner's insurance is $1,100. Rate is 3.63% and I have 21 years left.** \n   * **I pay revolvers in full every month.** I had Federal ParentPlus Loans but with my salary change in 2018 I was able to buckle down and pay off $56,000 in two years. I do have a $10,500 balance and am waiting to see if there's possibile forgiveness coming, but there's $10,500 staged in savings to pay that off the minute that possibility goes away so it's a wash. I'm thinking my income will probably preclude forgiveness but I can wait a month or three to see what happens.\n* My current employer had a 401k with Voya Retirement through 12/31/2020 but as of this year moved to a different PEO so now we'll be with Insperity. **Voya has their own target date funds that don't have tickers but I'm split 70% in 2030 target and 30% in 2025. Total balance is about $62,000.** \n* **I have an IRA that I opened at TD Ameritrade in 2018 for a rollover from a lump sum distribution from ex. There's $10,000 in that.** I had a little bit of 'fun' with it since it was found money. There's about $5,000 in Vanguard Wellesley (VWINX), $4,000 in SPDR S&amp;P 400 ETF (MDYV), and the rest split between a couple of stocks (CGC and EXFO).\n* Fidelity HSA opened 12/31/2020, and I plan to roll over the annual maximum amount from my employer's HSA with Optum Bank. I was only eligible for an HSA fairly recently but I've got my contribution at the annual max of $4,600. **Current rollover in process of transfer to Fidelity is $2,700.**\n* **Chase IRA - $2,300**\n* **Prudential 403b - total about $352,000**\n   * Vanguard Target 2025 (VRIVX) - $231,000\n   * Lord Abbett Developing (LADVX) - $39,000\n   * Calvert US Large Cap (CISIX) - $30,000\n   * Vanguard 500 Index Admiral (VFIAX) - $27,000\n   * Vanguard Wellington (VWENX) - $25,000\n* **Life Insurance: $100,000 term life ($25 month) with cash value of $4,000, plus $115,000** (employer benefit.) Kids are grown and flown, not too worried about insurance as a priority.\n* **At full retirement, SS is currently slated to be $2,569.**\n* **2009 car in great shape with 53,000 miles worth about $5,000**. I work remote, no commute, no need to replace that anytime soon. \n* **Cash: $30,000** in checking, money markets (not including the aforementioned $10,500 earmarked to pay off the ParentPlus loan.)\n* No other assets. I don't like thinking these thoughts, much less typing them but the only other financial consideration I can think of is my father is 89 and there might potentially be a small inheritance. I don't anticipate anything more than high five figures. My intent would be to pass that to my kids as gifts over 1-3 years, depending.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Since we're technically being terminated from ADP TS in order for my employer to change to a new PEO, I should have an opportunity to roll over my Voya balance of $60k, to either Fidelity or TD Ameritrade. I think the investment options will be better than those offered by Insperity. Does this sound like a reasonable? I can't roll it to Prudential as the plan doesn't allow incoming for inactive employees.\n* Should I leave the 403b with Prudential or roll it over to TD or Fidelity, too? The annual fee for being an inactive member have gone from $45 to $60 recently, and in an emergency I wouldnt' be able to borrow against it. \n* I carefully watched my compensation for 2020 and was able to max out my 401k at just under $26,000. I'm planning to do the same this year - starting out around 20% contribution and refining in the 4th quarter. All of this was pre-tax.\n* I feel like I should be thinking about Roth and splitting my 401k contribution and potentially making some conversions - thoughts?\n\nI never anticipated making a fairly significant income jump this late in the game. Not complaining but I need to think at a different level in a very short period time. Am I on the right track so far with the short- and long-term investments? Go more or less aggressive? Would I benefit from a financial planner? Seems to me I'm not in that type of wealth category and should be able to DIY but I really don't know. \n\nHope I haven't overdone the on-background. Thanks for any and all advice!",
