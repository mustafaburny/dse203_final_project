I follow a group and have learned more in 2 months than i ever would have by myself. I have all the scripts in tradingview if you want help. Let me know. From there its finding these trends and placing appropriate sized positions on them, in addition to watching the market, like spy, and hedging/buying insurance appropriately.",

Google has Bing, Firefox, Opera, etc. Apple has Samsung, Motorola, etc. Facebook has Snapchat and Twitter. Each have respective competitors.\n\nI think the fear is warranted that big tech is getting bigger, but to claim they are being 'anticompetitive' and pushing out competition is a stretch.\n\nI personally like big tech and all the innovation they are developing.",
