        "body": "That is when factors that Nikola can't control come into effect. Their positioning on everything I think is to prop stock price until then, which used to include the now canceled Nikola World. \n\nThings that happen in Dec.\n\n1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. \n2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.\n\nQuarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. \n\nRest is storytime:\n\nIf this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.\nSell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. \n\nSo how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the \"new management\" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. \n\nSo the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:\n\nhttps://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98\n\nOkay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.\n\nFantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.\n\nBut there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.\n\nNow we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone. \n\nI know that was long story time. But if you believe they are fraud, then think about what you would need to do if you knew it was a fraud and had millions locked up and you wanted out with out seeing the inside of a jail cell.",

Now if your a contractor working for another company, you\u2019d be stupid to admit there is a problem publicly, so these companies express optimism knowing they have nothing to lose.

The fed successfully destroyed the concept of a savings account being viable in 12 years.\n\nBut there is something even more sinister which crippled people's pocketbooks.

IIRC only stores in the NE and west coast have places that offer those anymore. Price matching is dead at Walmart. Companies like qoutient used to offer 300 plus printable coupons and now barely carry 100. Some of it has gone digital, but in a decade grocery stores have basically killed any type of deal shopping by the masses and instead have pivoted to selling more expensive products through better marketing.\n\nJust goes to show you how there can be a gradual trend over years that can erode buying power.\n\nI used to see people in front of me in line with a coupon coupons here and there, now it's more cartful of stuff and insert credit card.

        "body": "That is when factors that Nikola can't control come into effect. Their positioning on everything I think is to prop stock price until then, which used to include the now canceled Nikola World. \n\nThings that happen in Dec.\n\n1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. \n2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.\n\nQuarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. \n\nRest is storytime:\n\nIf this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.\nSell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. \n\nSo how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the \"new management\" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. \n\nSo the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:\n\nhttps://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98\n\nOkay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.\n\nFantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.\n\nBut there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.\n\nNow we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone. \n\nI know that was long story time. But if you believe they are fraud, then think about what you would need to do if you knew it was a fraud and had millions locked up and you wanted out with out seeing the inside of a jail cell.",

The fed successfully destroyed the concept of a savings account being viable in 12 years.\n\nBut there is something even more sinister which crippled people's pocketbooks. Grocery and mass market retailers. For example alot of places stopped double coupons around 2013 citing costs and american recovery. IIRC only stores in the NE and west coast have places that offer those anymore. Price matching is dead at Walmart. Companies like qoutient used to offer 300 plus printable coupons and now barely carry 100. Some of it has gone digital, but in a decade grocery stores have basically killed any type of deal shopping by the masses and instead have pivoted to selling more expensive products through better marketing.\n\nJust goes to show you how there can be a gradual trend over years that can erode buying power.\n\nI used to see people in front of me in line with a coupon coupons here and there, now it's more cartful of stuff and insert credit card. I'm thinking online grocery trends mean even less direct savings because it's more click and order.",

        "body": "Happens very often. Happened with CVNA last month. I made the following post about it, which mods removed after it gained significant traffic:\n\nPeople have been complaining that this sub has gone to shit in the last several months. There was a post earlier today arguing this, citing a lack of quality DD being posted here since March.\n\nIt is not that there has been a lack of DD posted, but nearly all quality DD gets deleted by the mods. DD on CVNA was posted yesterday only to be removed by mods, while CVNA shot up 30% today. I have seen users post similar comments in the daily threads over the past few months, saying they posted DD that was removed by mods, only for their predictions to have been right. Some of these users posted their DD in the daily thread instead, some didn\u2019t, but I remember many of these comments ended up ringing true.\n\nNow now now, OP, you might say, mods just want quality DD with charts and fundamentals and \u201cInsider Information.\u201d This is why they let fucking VALE and PRPL guys post pump and dumps, leaving such as the few DD that doesn\u2019t get removed. Even though PRPL guy posted numbers that were undeniably false and proven false by the Earnings Call. Mods let these pump and dumps happen.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the real fucking kicker. On the surface those seemed like fine DD to those who didn\u2019t know better. HOWEVER, I, too, posted \u201cDD\u201d on PRPL: /r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3k4lf/ive_had_a_vision_from_god_and_he_showed_the/\n\nMods let me keep my PRPL \u201cDD\u201d up, where I cited \u201cvisions from god\u201d as the reason to buy calls. This got 137 upvotes and nearly 100 comments. It got legitimate traction and attention. So mods definitely saw it. And they let my post tagged as \u201cDD\u201d remain. This completely disrupts the argument that mods want a certain standard of quality DD when my post with 0 fundamentals, analysis, or any legitimate indication or information to stay up.\n\nYou could say that posts like mine are part of the problem. I wouldn\u2019t dispute you. I will say though, that based on how many people have been getting their DD posts deleted, I was sure my post would be deleted, or at least have the flair changed to Shitpost or Satire. I flaired it as DD cuz I thought it was funny, which it was, while fully expecting it to be removed. This proves that the mods left it up to fuel the Purple pump and dump, instead of suppressing what was truly low quality DD. Instead they surppressed DD like CVNA that would have captured many of us with 10 baggers today had they left that DD up instead.\n\nMods here want you to lose and are entirely to blame for the deterioration of this subs quality as a forum to spread useful information to help us make money. I would go as far to argue that, in my eyes, I am becoming convinced that this sub might be being moderated with those with nefarious intentions to leave everyone here holding heavy bags, though we would need more evidence.\n\nTLDR: if mods delete this post you will know they don\u2019t want you to know the truth.",

It's *designed* to help avoid the cytokine storm that has killed so many people with Covid, administered later on in the infection after the body's immune response has had some time to fight the virus, but is going overboard and damaging the lungs as a result. Donald, being a retard, likely ordered his military doctors to hit him with everything they had right out of the gate, thus he's on the dexamethasone far too early. It is making him feel manic and euphoric as it suppresses his immune system while he most needs it to be responding to the virus. This makes him feel much, much better in the short term (best in \"20 years\") before a possibly devastating crash when the reality of the situation hits.\n\nDo you know what we call that? It's called a bull trap\n\nThis is a confluence of events that could have biblical repercussions. We're talking about a president that is setting up not only his own collapse, but an economic collapse for the entire country.

But she turns around immediately, to look over her shoulder at you: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d The gravity of her tone briefly catches you off guard, but you collect yourself: \u201cWhat? Nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d She stares at your face a bit longer, and then satisfied you aren\u2019t lying\u2014because she trusts you more than any human being she\u2019s ever known\u2014she turns back to her mirror and hair brushing.\n\nAnd you know why tonight, of all nights, she noticed you watching her: she could sense your fear. She doesn\u2019t know what SPY is. Or a call. But something primal in her knows what you did with those things, and how it is eating you alive inside. Because she loves you. \n\nSuddenly, you realize fully that you do not deserve the connection that allowed her to sense that in you, the connection that you lied in the face of. As her humming resumes, you start drafting your goodbye.",

Two of many things.  They also aren't doing this in one country or region: they are doing it globally.\n\nNow keep in mind their products can also be reprogrammed to tap into other industries via software updates at any time.  That's crazy powerful.\n\nYour oven breaks, you'll replace it in the near future. Your phone breaks, odds are unless it's the middle of the night you're canceling your plans to go replace it right away.\n\nSo the future value of AAPL is pretty insane when you really think about it.

And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted. I just wish he would back away from financial markets, because that is not going to be about real economy and employers and employee. Not him tinkering with printing money and buying APPL bonds.\n\nHe is not wrong though.",

They think tsla 500 eow is just a normal thing but don't realize like that is ungodly amounts of money in market valuation.  Tesla reached 1000 pre split like 3 to 4 months ago.  We are half that now post split. Insanity.  Zoom is crazy too.  The markets something something irrational, you something solvent",

The company filed bankruptcy and as part of the restructuring dropped their outstanding shares into warrants, at a conversion of 2.5%. The warrants are good for three years for the new ticker, DEN. Long story short, the company fucked you big time. Turned your shares into shit, restructured, launched new shares at around $17 a share and now have a shit ton of cash and you have a warrant for the new stock. Good luck. \n\nPlus side, the warrants are up 96% premarket today, told you to buy the dip....lol",

There is a reason they have already been able to enforce the patents against random Chinese companies.\n\nDon't believe me? Lets look at what happened when Google Waymo, one of the largest companies in the world, tried to sue Uber for LIDAR patent infringement:\n\n[https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html](https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) **rejected 53 out of 56 claims in Waymo's 936 patent**...One of the reasons for the rejection is that some of the core design solutions were **previously patented by another lidar manufacturer, Velodyne**. Coincidentally, Velodyne used to sell its lidars to Waymo before the latter decided to build a product of its own from scratch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Theoretically, **Velodyne could now accuse Waymo of infringing its own 558 patent**, based on the USPTO's recent ruling.",
