I looked into them about two years and maybe things have changed since then but I couldn\u2019t really find anything that stood out with them and the stock has always sort of dragged behind others on the sector.\n\nVisa and MasterCard are great because they\u2019re so widely used, don\u2019t actually offer credit, and basically run the payment processing sector. Sure, there are smaller players who are making noise but the reach Visa and MasterCard have is incredible. American Express found its niche in great service, attractive rewards, offering no limits, and being viewed as a card for wealthy or sophisticated people or businesses. \n\nDiscover just hasn\u2019t been able to find that niche or special thing that makes them stand out. Unlike Visa or MasterCard, they take on more risk because they actually offer credit to customers which can be a concern if the economy turns for the worse and people start struggling to pay off debt. Discover started making some noise a few years back via their rewards and sign up bonuses but now every credit card and bank offers them and those rewards aren\u2019t cheap for the providers. Who they cater to is important too, American Express caters more towards businesses and wealthy individuals while a company likes Discover caters more towards college students, lower and middle class individuals, and regular Joes which all tend to be hit harder and have more trouble paying back debt during tough times.\n\nLike the other user said, their delinquency rate has increased as of rate and there has also been some concern over raising operating costs. That makes for a nasty combo of the economy takes a turn for the worse, something people have waiting for for what seems like an eternity. \n\nOne thing I will say about Discover is that from a value perspective, they\u2019re probably one of the more reasonably valued companies in the sector. I love and hold Visa but it\u2019s getting a little heated right now valuation wise. I believe MasterCard is in a similar boat. American Express is relatively reasonable. That said, it\u2019s valued the way it is for a reason. Wall Street isn\u2019t confident the growth is there for Discover and basically sees them being stuck where they are with the added of risk of offering credit that Visa and MasterCard don\u2019t have.\n\nI\u2019d personally pass. Not a bad company and I\u2019ve had nothing but good experiences with them but I think you can see better growth elsewhere.",

There is also a ton of risk in the medium to long term since technologically there is no reason why everyone really needs to go through them for processing payments.

Have to also have a sense of the current market. If it's a good bull market but there's a bad day then stocks are likely to all fall to lower bollinger, but will rebound to mid bollinger in coming days, or top bollinger. \n\nAnother way to use it is if a stock starts a move up or down, it usually won't stop until it tests the bollinger it's heading towards.

Your credit card is issued by your bank, and you're given a credit account by the bank. Visa/Mastercard are companies that just allow you to make transactions with the card - they don't hold any of the actual loans. They're just a middleman that takes a small cut of the transaction you make between your bank's credit account and the seller's account. That's why OP's saying Visa etc isn't nearly as risky - it's because when shit hits the fan like 2008, they're not screwed because they don't deal in loans that could go default (and did go default back in 2008).",

        "body": "Visa seems to be great for the long term (5+ years) as society continues to transition to being cashless, MA &amp; Visa are simply in the business of processing transactions so unlike Square they do not face risk from credit card debt. The only knock on Visa is that the stock is priced very high relative to their revenue/income growth rate. It is priced high because it is seen as a very safe investment with a bright future. They run the risk that any sort of societal change that hurts their business model means a high probability they won't reach their peak stock price ever again since it's priced in so high relatively to how much money the company actually brings in. For ex: Who knows if there's technology that will be invented that could disrupt Visa and Mastercard's business. For all we know Apple could announce some sort of tech that undermines Visa/Mastercard's business model and Visa's stock price in that case is very likely to not recover if they can't regain market share. That is why Warren Buffet pushes you to know a business inside and out before investing, so you truly know the economic significance/dominance a company has for it to continue to grow. I know Visa is gaining market share over MC in Asia, while MC is dominating Europe from what I've heard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for Facebook, Facebook is trading at a discounted price relative to how much revenue/income growth they have. If you take Facebook's average 20% growth annually and projected the next 10 years they should be trading around $260ish. The reason Facebook is trading lower is because of the fear of government intervention that will break them up. The thing with Facebook though is that it is so intertwined with our other accounts like spotify, and that they dominate social media there isn't any reason to believe the company will die (they own Instagram and WhatsApp if you didn't know).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVisa is probably the safer investment, and is a better long term play. However, Facebook imo is worth the risk given the discount their stock price trades at. We have at least already seen the EU and US embarrass themselves with the Zuckerberg hearings showing their ignorance to tech. That doesn't mean if the market has a correction/recession that Visa is susceptible to never reaching its peak stock price again. It took Microsoft until 2017 to recover from the 2000 .com bubble. Context matters when evaluating stock prices!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: In terms of opportunity cost you will find out faster whether or not Facebook is a good investment or not. Visa you run the risk of steady increases hoping the price never crashes (at least if you buy Visa at its current price), if you buy Visa after its price crashes and average down you could be fine, assuming the price crash/dip is a true overreaction (fortunately, there are a lot of overreactions in the stock market thanks to bots nowadays).",

        "body": "Come on man, you still aren't counting any costs or using any facts. \n\nOkay, I got some time and this is pretty simple, so here's some actual math. I don't think facts will change your mind, but maybe OP or someone else reading this will learn something.\n\n* You state $1400-$1800 in rent revenue. /u/kileek states that this would either be an undesireable condo or small, but I looked up actual condos for sale in Victoria, and found [this one](https://www.point2homes.com/CA/Condo-For-Sale/BC/Victoria/James-Bay/500-Oswego-St/82583898.html) for $300,000, so I'll use this as a comparison. It's pretty nice, but it's a 545 sq ft 1 bed 1 bath. I found several similar apartments, pretty close to that condo, renting for $1175-$1695 ([here](https://www.kijiji.ca/v-apartments-condos/victoria-bc/bachelor-available-at-1039-view-street-victoria/1480133121), [here](https://www.kijiji.ca/v-apartments-condos/victoria-bc/rockland-1-bdrm-2nd-floor-corner/1480132252), [here](https://www.kijiji.ca/v-apartments-condos/victoria-bc/1-bdrm-available-at-976-humboldt-street-victoria/1480133124), [here](https://rentals.ca/victoria?types=condo&amp;beds=1%2B&amp;active-listing-id=293490)). The $1695 one looks nicer to me, so let's use $1600 for rent (halfway in your range so I think that's fair).\n* 20% down payment and 30 year amortization, variable rate mortgage (at 2.65%) is actually a $965/month payment. Use the mortgage calculator here:  [https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-payment-calculator](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-payment-calculator) \n* That building lists its condo fees as $459/mo.\n* Assuming the tax assessment is also $300,000, the property taxes are $1500 a year, or $125/mo. Property tax estimator here:  [https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/residents/property-taxes/estimator.html](https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/residents/property-taxes/estimator.html) \n* You probably want some insurance eh? If you google [condo insurance Victoria](https://www.google.com/search?q=insurance+cost+victoria+condos&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA767CA767&amp;oq=insurance+cost+victoria+condos&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33.6547j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), the ads suggest it will be $40/mo. \n* Most rules of thumb say to try and save 1% of the value for maintenance, but the condo fees do a lot of the heavy lifting here. Let's say OP needs to save 0.25% for maintenance, that's $62.50 a month. \n* If you looked closely at the $1695/month apartment up there, you'll notice that actually included water and cable costs. Is OP going to pay those? [Water bills are $128/month](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/in-victoria-less-is-more-when-it-comes-to-paying-for-water/article1215390/), so let's hope not (even though a lot of those Victoria apartments do include water in the rent).\n\nLet's only count those costs okay? Even though there are obviously more costs (and we didn't count lower fees or anything to close the sale).\n\nSo we rent it for $1600, and our costs are actually $1651.50, so there is actually negative cash profit for OP. But you're building equity, you'll rightly say. You're right, your mortgage payments are paying roughly $450 of principal every month. So this property actually \"profits\" $400/month, even though there is no cash for OP. \n\nWhat could OP get with just margin? First some facts\n\n* XRE paid $0.81 per unit of distributions in 2019 ([source](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/individual/en/products/239843/ishares-sptsx-capped-reit-index-etf#distributionsDialog)).\n* Current market price $19.49.\n* [Interactive Brokers' margin rate is 2.25%](https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/index.php?f=45266) using OP's $60,000 down payment as an account cash contribution.\n* [IB requires you to put up 50% of the value](https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/index.php?f=202&amp;p=stk) (so you can only use margin to pay for half).\n\nOP's $60,000 means they can buy $120,000 of XRE. That investment would bring in $4987.17 a year, minus $1350/yr in interest, means OP actually takes home $3337.17 a year in cash, or $278.10 a month (compared to the condo's cash flow of -$51.50). \n\nAs you can see, OP does not make \"literally twice as much\" with the condo, and he doesn't have a dime of cash flow. Yes, if you are counting the mortgage paydown as profit (which it is), the condo does make a bit more, but it isn't close to twice as much. \n\nIf any of my numbers are wrong, I'd be happy to hear how. None of the numbers you've stated other than rent have even been close.",
