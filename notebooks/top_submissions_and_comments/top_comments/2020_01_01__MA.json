While College is important, people enter it for purely economic incentives. \"You can't get a job without a degree\", and other existential anxiety bullshit. The goal posts have now shifted, \"You need an MA to get a decent job.\"\n\nLots of people I served with didn't enlist for schooling... hell most people don't end up using their benefits and just pass it on to their kids. I think an important part of the discussion is the ineptitude of the K-12 system preparing kids for modern life post High School.\n\nSo you have cohorts of people who seek direction in life, and what's the most obvious choice? I've had this discussion with a friend of mine (we just graduated). He does very well in school, but is really disenfranchised by the idea that he now has to sell and leverage himself on the job market. The institutional aspect of \"apply and get accepted if there's space\" is gone, and now you're at the mercy of someone spending less than 30 seconds on your resume.\n\nObviously other factors at play that I haven't mentioned, but this is one that's been a common line through the people I've spoken with.",

They simply branded it, as they will be basis points on every transaction done through apple pay.\n\n If these are the thoughts you trade off, I wish you the best of luck in choosing index funds.",

        "body": "They do, but the sentiment remains the same.  It is not as cut and dried as that though.  When the Congressional Black Caucus sets the tone that the black community will remain extremely disgruntled because only \u201crich white folks and exploitive big cannabis MSOs\u201d are the only ones profiting and therefore further repressing urban communities, it has a negative ripple effect that cascades state by state for years.\n\nExample:  Boston, MA and Cambridge, MA have yet to approve any adult rec licenses because they are forcing social equity programs first via an unlevel playing field with \u201cprogressive\u201d bonus license app scoring requirements.  In other words, those representing the minority community are holding up legalization in those communities until minority operators jump to the front of the line.  13 months later, there still aren\u2019t any qualified minority applicants, and now the municipalities want to even fund the seed capital for them, while existing qualified applicants have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees and rent while their applications are held up.  \n\nThat type of greed and stupidity helps nobody as it kills any momentum that legalization could have had to help pressure Republicans to support the Safe Act and States Act.  It also does nothing to help minorities gain invaluable industry experience working in the legal cannabis businesses so they can present themselves in a more favorable light to potential financial backers in the future.  At the end of the day, the minority community wants to immediately be successful without creating the conditions to do so for their own constituents.  It would be like demanding to be a surgeon without first going to medical school.  \n\nIt\u2019s a very complex, multifaceted issue.  If the industry was allowed to progress over the past 13 months, instead of just holding things up, there would have been a much better track record to point to regarding legalization not increasing the types of criminal activity some key Republicans fear.  So the key takeaway issue is, it\u2019s not just Republicans holding things up.  It goes much deeper than that, and vocal members of the Congressional Black Caucus and many municipal activists are equally to blame for not working together to help create the conditions to get the Safe Act over the finish line.",

Watch those and you'll be surprised when you see stocks continuously bounce off of a lower bollinger up to the mid band, or bounce off a 200 day moving average. \n\nObviously a stock can dip below a ma or lower bollinger but usually won't without news, or a market correction. Have to also have a sense of the current market. If it's a good bull market but there's a bad day then stocks are likely to all fall to lower bollinger, but will rebound to mid bollinger in coming days, or top bollinger. \n\nAnother way to use it is if a stock starts a move up or down, it usually won't stop until it tests the bollinger it's heading towards. So if a stock has 210 200 190 top mid bottom bollinger, and it starts to rise to 195, it likely won't reverse until at least 200 test.",

Do they have licenses to operate in other states too? \n\nI only ask because I know they bring in a ton of revenue from Florida but a lot of companies like GTI are vertically integrated and operate in triple the states. Yes, the amount of locations per state is less than TRUL\u2019s FL combined but companies like GTI and CURA are slowly making their stamp in different parts of the country.\n\nSo dumb question - despite the revenue TRUL brings in, are they missing out on potential opportunities that 5 years down the line can bite them in the ass? \n\nWith the revenue and cash they bring in, they won\u2019t go bankrupt but their lack of expansion could be a negative at some point? Maybe the answer is simple or I don\u2019t have enough info but I\u2019ve always wondered this and maybe someone can help me out. Thank you",

I want to nearly triple my position at some point if we break down again towards $1.00, but need to see more operational progress on opening dispensaries outside of FLA during early 2020.  They really haven\u2019t gotten shit accomplished over the past year in Massachusetts, but should have a good adult use location open in Worcester, MA before April.  If that timeline slips and they have to draw down more of the GGP facility, I\u2019m probably scaling out of another 70k shares.  Make no mistake, 2020 is going to be a complete shit show for most Canadian L.P.s, plus select U.S. MSOs (Cough, cough...MedMen), but I think the real winners will slowly start to reveal themselves.  Was thinking the top few extractors are the best place to be, but want to see another quarter or two before aggressively diving back into them, but only at my target price levels.
