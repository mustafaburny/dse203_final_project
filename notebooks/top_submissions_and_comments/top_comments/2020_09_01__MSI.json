Sales were initially meh, i think blackberry sold double the units in 2007 and people were skeptical that a computer company could take on heavyweights nokia, samsung, motorola, sonyericsson, etc.\n\nAnybody feel that way with tesla? It doesnt show signs of going away, but i cant shake the ambiguity of whether its selling battery tech, autonomous driving, green energy, or some hodgepodge of all the above.",

        "body": "It's not that easy. The problem could bethat POSCAPs (Conductive Polymer Tantalum Solid Capacitor) have trouble providing sufficient voltage to the gpu in time under high frequency (not the gpu clock, gpus are digital and operate as binary switches) scenarios with quickly alternating loads and therefore voltage requirements. This means the gpu doesnt have a high enough voltage when load increases quickly. NVIDIA provided the board partners with base kits using MLCCs (Multi-layer Ceramic Chip capacitors) which seem to have better capabilities concerning this issue. That means the Nvidia founders edition (currently unavailable because of mass orders of resellers and cryptominers) could be fine. Capacitors in general deteriorate over time, that is why long-term effects cannot be predicted. The board partners can modify PCB designs within specifications for efficiency reasons or better performance (overclocked designs). Some of them have changed the capacitor design. EVGA confirmed this problem, however no retail cards with POSCAP designs have been sold to customers yet. Other Vendors like Gigabyte have not commented yet. MSI however suspects a driver problem for the cause of the crashes. All in all there is a supply problem at the moment for the new cards and third party vendors could have to change board designs and scrap existing inventories. I cannot say if there are liabilities on NVIDIAs side. There are a lot of questions. If supply continues to be limited for the founders editions and additionally board partner cards, interested customers could wait for AMD cards yet to be released. The information base is unclear if you ask me to speculate on that. BTW: NVIDIAS website seems to have suffered a data leak. People who tried to pre-purchase cards could see other customers personal data.",

NVDA just customized it integrated it with a GPU in an all in one package.\n\n&gt; Samsung, Apple hell anyone.\n\n&gt; \"Sorry we aren't going to license our IP (ARM) to you but you are welcome to buy our chips.\"\n\n&gt; Those companies have no way around that. Period.\n\nThat's a majority of ARM's business.  Doesn't make logical sense.  NVDA wouldnt be able to fill the demand.  It'd get jammed up in court for real antitrust violations.\n\n&gt; Oh NO, they might lose millions which they makeup by billions being the sole provider of ARM chips.\n\n&gt; Apple sued Samsung. That took nearly 15 years to resolve.\n\nYea and Google bought Motorola for $12B for a portfolio of patents that ended up being worthless because the courts ruled they had to be licensed under FRAND terms and the value of that IP porfolio ended up getting dumped for $2B.\n\n&gt; NVDA already manufactures themselves. Now they have captive buyers.\n\nNVDA cant meet that production demand and the cost to do so would be an insane risk to their business.  It's far more profitable to add more engineers to your team that focus on cores and earn a royalty from the entire mobile stream than it is to try and create a manufacturing monopoly that will most certainly get struck down in court.  The entire reason they bought ARM is that they dont have to produce those chips themselves and can build tighter integration with their GPU's.\n\nYou clearly just wanted to pick a fight.",

The FE cards are ringers with better coolers which cost more to produce than standard msrp. A loss leader to generate hype. These are also the cards sent out for review to the media and influencers. So right now you can find tons of reviews detailing how great these are. Those reviews will stay at the top of search results for the next year pumping up MSI, EVGA, etc while they catch up. \n\nNvidia has shown it's card, now it's AMDs play. But don't think nvidia is gonna sit there and take it. As soon as amd makes their play, big green will drop the Ti or super variants with full aftermarket support. \n\nAnd when nvidia buys ARM they'll be able to enter the processor market, and start going after the market share that AMD has robbed from Intel. \n\nIf I wouldn't have crashed my RH account listening to you retards, I'd be all in on nvda leaps.",
