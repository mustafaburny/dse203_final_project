        "body": "See a lot of misinformation in the comments. FLT is one of the few delivery companies in the world, and the only public drone delivery co in Canada. Their market cap was at once $300m and now about $150m. One of countless drone companies to take advantage of investor hype to build a drone company. $300m market cap at no revenue is insane.\n\nEven now at $150m aggressively over valued. They are now setting value with some contract announcements so the pressure is on. \n\nI know the ownership and have been to their facility and can tell you the tech is not the issue. The issue is the INSANE amount of infrastructure and regulation that would be required to integrate drones into an already over-saturated traffic management system.\n\nWe are about 10 years away until we see drone deliveries for every day items, apart from highly remote areas (FLT existing contracts), or depot-to-depot transportation in other countries with less red tape. \n\nNot to say FLT can\u2019t be successful as a drone company, but they will need to survive off other area until the world is willing and capable to accept drones in built-up areas, and in the meantime accept a more realistic valuation as such. Investment-wise the rise has long passed.",

And as that Chinese electric car company grew and took 1/3 of the 1 billion person Chinese market, my ETF kept buying more on the way up.\"\n\nAlthough in that same vein, getting ahead of the tech curve might be one of the few ways for someone outside of the professional investor/institutional world to realistically get ahead. The trick is having the fortitude to hold for 1-2 decades. The financial crisis in '08 blew me out of so many hilariously good positions, like SBAC because the iPhone was just invented and 3G means more cell phone towers... It's not always rocket science. Anyone with some specialized insight into the future, whatever it may be, should consider putting a small well thought out speculative position on and leave it be. Small enough to not hurt if it goes nowhere, but big enough to care enough to check up and manage every few months.\n\nWow, just looked up an email from over 10 years ago. These names are probably in the mainstream investing language now, but wow... 10-100x if they were held. And it wasn't complex quant investing or anything, just looking ahead, positioning, and waiting.\n\nQuotes from the email circa 10 years ago: \"NVDA... They are also making a leap into scientific computing, where there's a lot of money to be made. They're the first major player to enter that arena to fight Intel and AMD in a long time, and their architecture is much more suited to scientific computing than the traditional CPUs that currently rule the top 100 supercomputer list. I think I'll see how that works out before selling NVDA\"\n\n\"I might want to put some money in AMD as well. They're here to stay and may still be undervalued...\"\n\n\"Universal Display Corp and LG Display (PANL/LPL) are also the leaders and partners in OLED screen development, which is bound to catch on eventually. Lower power use and much better image quality mean that it's just a matter of time before more devices adopt this new display technology and it becomes a new standard. I actually expect Apple to eventually partner up with LG (I think LG is their main LCD supplier) and use and use an OLED display on either a new product or a new Iphone version, which will kick OLED production into overdrive.\"\n\nFood for thought... MicroLED is likely going to grow 1000x over the coming decades. AR and LIDAR sensors for AR will probably not just be used for face unlock and will get some killer apps, the next Snapchat or TikTok might be AR based. Self-Driving is going to be powered by thousands of companies, not just NVIDIA and Waymo. Quantum computing? AI providers in the military contracting space? Clean cargo ship tech to get in front of green regulations? It's endless, and so many people know about these little niches of information that very few others do. Even mundane spaces see world changing innovation every day. Getting in front of a curve is inherently speculative but it is also entertaining, educational to follow through development, and can be extremely profitable.\n\nThat's my appeal for pulling a few pennies out of the ETF pile and doing some a little different, especially if you have a \"wheelhouse\" that you know a little bit more about.",

If one analyst comes out with a short and 39 say Intel is fine, it's unlikely the short piece actually does anything. But if you have three analysts covering you, which is very common for small-cap companies, one short piece can actually fuck your shit up. \n\nAlso since companies often use their equity as collateral for a loan, the higher stock price could afford more reasonable loan terms, which could help the company's actual business.",

The speed at which it is recovering is also normal because every market participant knows the story of past US recessions and economic downturn - they know if you sell your holdings, you\u2019ll regret it down the road. So what\u2019s the point of selling right now if your actually investing for years, decades? None. Especially when it\u2019s super easy to get a loan for rock bottom rates, cash is very accessible for all the big boy investors and institutions. \n\nEveryone constantly downvoted bulls in March for even thinking that a V shape market recovery was gonna happen, for ever thinking we were gonna see ATHs again this year. Don\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten. There\u2019s a lot of remind me bot posts I got coming due soon from March . \n\nOnce again bears, hold this L . Scoreboard don\u2019t lie. You never win consistently. Keep being wrong and stay salty about this. I\u2019m sorry you missed out on the greatest 50 day rally in stock market history. That\u2019s gonna be a good story to tell your grand kids at least.",

        "body": "Options are contracts.  They are not stocks, they are a contract stating that the holder has the right (the choice, or the *option*) to purchase/sell 100 shares of a specific stock at a specific price on a specific date.  Calls are for purchasing 100 shares on a later date, puts are for selling 100 shares on a later date.\n\nLet's say a stock, we'll call them AAAA for simplicity, is at $100 today.  If you were to buy 10 shares of this company, that would cost you $1000.  You would own 10 shares of that company for $1000 though.  If you instead buy options, you would likely be able to get a couple options instead for the same price.  Let's say that a $100 call on AAAA for next friday costs $5 per share, or $500 per contract.  For that same $1000, you could have 2 calls on AAAA.\n\nIn both scenarios, you're looking for the value of the stock to go up obviously.  If you have 10 shares and AAAA goes up one dollar, you gained 10 dollars.  If you have 2 calls (which is 200 shares worth of an option) and AAAA goes up by a dollar, those calls increase in value as well, although not quite as much, we'll say it increases by $0.50 per share.  That's still a lot.  Instead of making $10 from your $1000 investment, you made $100 instead.  It's not quite that simple though.\n\nCalls (and puts) have an expiration date.  If the call is expiring on the 12th (next Friday), then the value of the stock needs to be decently close or above the value stated in the contract, or the \"strike price\".  In our $100 AAAA calls, if the stock goes below $100 (especially on the Thursday), the value of the call will plummet.  And remember, since these are just contracts, you don't actually own anything with the money you spent.\n\nSince you also spent $5 per share in order to get the call, the value of AAAA needs to not only be above $100 on the 12th to be redeemed (nobody should ever execute a right to buy at a higher than market price, obviously, you'd just be throwing away money for no reason) but it needs to be above $105 in order to make a profit.  You had already paid $5 per share for the right to buy those shares later at $100 per share.\n\nNext, and here's what many people do in order to make their profit instead, *you do not have to hold your contracts.*  If you buy a call on Monday, you don't have to wait until it expires on Friday to make money.  If AAAA jumps to $120 on Tuesday, you could sell your 2 calls for likely $23-$24 per share.  That would turn a $1000 investment into $4600.  What a hell of a gain, right?  If you just had 10 shares, you'd have only made $200 on a 20% stock jump when people who are options trading just made a $3600 or a 460% return.\n\nLastly, the reason that so many people avoid them.  *Options can expire* ***worthless***.  If the stock drops to $95 on Tuesday, those calls are suddenly only $2 per share, you just lost $600.  If it drops again to $90 on Wednesday, those calls are suddenly less than $1 per share, you're at an $800+ loss.  If you had 10 shares, you'd have only lost $100.  On Friday if you still have those calls, if AAAA never hits $100, your calls will expire and you'll have lost the full $1000 investment with absolutely nothing to show for it.  That money is gone for good, no amount of wishful thinking is going to make it come back to you.\n\nPuts are the opposite of calls in a way, they're the right to sell 100 shares at a certain price.  You get a put when you believe the value of the stock is going to drop.  Let's say you have a $100 put on AAAA and the stock drops to $80 on Friday.  On Friday, you would purchase 100 shares of AAAA at market value ($80, or $8000 worth) and then immediately sell it to whoever wrote the contract for $100 per share, or $10000.  That's quite a profit right there too, you made money when a stock decreased in value.  You can't really do that with standard stock trading.  Puts do still come with the same risk as calls in the fact that they too can expire worthless if the value of the stock is above the strike price.  If you have a $100 put on AAAA and the value on Friday is $105, it would be absolutely stupid to purchase 100 shares at $105 to sell them immediately for $100.  Remember, these contracts give you the *option* to buy/sell at a certain price, it doesn't mean that you have to when they expire.\n\nI hope that helps!  If you've got more questions, I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.",

This can be FOMO in anticipation or FOMO in reflection. In both cases, you feel a negative emotional reaction to missing or potentially missing a big move.\n\nAs you know, negative emotions are very bad as a trader and can limit your Trading Vision - preventing you from seeing a much clearer move that fits within your own defined strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"missing out\" in the stock market. There are infinite opportunities presented to you every single second. So focus on that. Focus on the stream of infinite opportunities and how you can interpret and decipher this data stream to pluck out trades within your own strategy boundaries.\n\nStick to your rules, manage your emotions, and focus on what is right in front of you.\n\n**I'd love to hear some thoughts from other traders who very recently learned this lesson. What made you learn it? Was it a big trade that went wrong or a big trade you missed? I'd like to hear your story and your interpretation of the lesson you learned :)**",

Wrote them down to remind myself during the next crash. \n\n1. **Don\u2019t sell.**\u00a0Unless you are able to predict the top and bottom, selling would mean you make a loss and miss out when the market rebounds. I made the mistake of selling PayPal at a loss, thinking I would switch my funds to buying Microsoft, which was doing well with their video conferencing app. At the time, PayPal was slow moving compared to the other tech companies. I sold PayPal and did not manage to get into Microsoft early enough to ride the gains. As a result, I not only missed out on the opportunity on Microsoft, I missed out my gains for PayPal had I held. PayPal has since gained 20% from my average price.\u00a0\n\n2. **Don\u2019t panic, average down.**\u00a0During a crisis, don\u2019t panic! (I know, easier said than done) Determine value of the stock and its fundamentals. If the fundamentals are still intact, ignore the noise and just average down. Divide your spare cash in 3 pockets. Every time the stock drops 10%, buy in. The economy will eventually recover and this is how you make use of the opportunity to make high returns.\u00a0\n\n3. **Follow the trend.**\u00a0The market may not always make sense. During this crisis, despite rounds of weak economic data (unemployment, GDP decline etc.), the market has rallied 25%. Follow the trend, ride the wave, don\u2019t try to go against it. Shorting this market will only hurt you. Don\u2019t fight against the Fed.",

        "body": "I watched a 60 Minutes episode on Elon as it aired maybe 8-9 years ago (on TV, what's that?), and I remember thinking his answers were very well-thought-out, structured, and logical. They were grounded and not filled with hyperbole, and he appeared to be thinking deeply on the questions (even the 'simple' ones) and answering them in a concise but sufficient manner -- what you would expect from a good engineer rather than a salesman.\n\nI also remember looking him up and following his path from Tesla to SpaceX to PayPal/X.com. So here you had someone who was extremely ambitious, highly intelligent, but also knew how to deliver. He thinks bigger picture and ahead of the curve. That's what I value most in founders, and I think engineers make the best founder/CEOs because engineers are logical and no bullshit.\n\nIt's extremely rare to find that mix of ambition, intelligence, and engineering mindfulness. Is he a good human being? I don't know. His impact on humanity has probably been net positive so far. He has his views and opinions that don't necessarily align with mine, but some of his big ideas do.\n\nIn contrast when watching the Trevor Milton interview last week, the things that struck me were:\n\n1. \"be in the current/things are easy\" ... This is the exact opposite of what it's like to be visionary imo. The toughest problems are extremely difficult, and if people just took the easy path, we'd have very little real progress in the world. This is mostly a copycat mentality. There's a 'current' because someone else has already busted open the dam.\n2. comparing his previous company with Amazon ... Anyone who describes their business as \"it's like Amazon but\" gets a thumbs down from me. It's a total namedrop cop-out, and then he says something like \"we didn't know what we had at the time\" as the reason they failed I'm guessing? Pretty lame answer, and it completely misses the distinguishing factor for Amazon's success vs. everybody else from the early years. They didn't just sell books; they mastered supply chain. Again, just shows really short-sighted thinking and misguided analysis imo.\n3. he doesn't come off as brilliant to me ... Seems like a nice enough guy and isn't stupid, but that's not really enough for me to be wowed. A lot of his advice is typical and cliche. I almost groaned aloud when he said something to the effect of starting Nikola Motor because he wanted to turn something ugly into something sexy.\n4. generic hyperbole and what? ... He talks about easily getting world-class people because of how sexy his company is, and I feel it's just sales-pitchy associating with something that's supposed to be impressive (CEOs and presidents, billion-dollar companies, etc.). He also says the Nikola Motor logo is a hexagon with six angles because he teaches that there are six ways to look at everything. But then he doesn't explain what those six angles are. Why six? Why not eight? Sixteen? Thirty-two? Maybe there's actually a reason for six, but it comes across to me as a half-baked retrofitted narrative. That logo is generic as shit, and I doubt he was adamant it had to be a hexagon. It wouldn't surprise me if it was done somewhere like 99 designs.\n\nAnyway, that was a lot more than I intended to write. I might just be grumpy because I missed out on the huge upswing, but that was my thought process for cutting out early last week. Maybe they can still be successful as a copycat, but they're being valued as an innovator. Best of luck if you're in it!",

Typically all merchants using Square will be using the specific processor and merchant acquirer that is Squares. This means, the fees charged to merchants for transaction processing will be going to Square, who then will pay Visa their share.\n\nThe whole system is broken to separate pieces where everyone gets a share.\n\nThere are gateways, which let people submit transactions to processors.There are processors, who process the transactions and communicate between gateways, merchant acquirers, and the card holders card issuing bank.\n\nThere are merchant acquirers who basically act as the bank for the merchant is primarily the one liable for funding transactions to the merchant, and receiving incoming funds from transactions. The Merchant Acquirer and the Card Issuing banks are where the money is actually moving.\n\nThe card issuing bank is Chase, or your credit union, whatever bank actually issued the credit/debit card in use.\n\nAnd there are the card network providers, Visa, Amex etc.. who get money because all of it is running on their services.\n\nAnd in this mix and match are some companies that do one or all parts of the roles.  \n\n\n  \nLong story short, all of financial digital services get their cut, and really they are all fighting to see who gets the most customers to have the biggest cut. Like every other business. But Visa, Mastercard, Amex, are not quite the same as Square, Paypal, etc... As currently all credit and debit card services operate off of the card services network infrastructure that those companies have implemented.",

This is what I have come up with so far:\n\nFB 25%\n\nMSFT 10%\n\nBABA 10%\n\nTSLA 10%\n\nENPH 10%\n\nAPHA 10%\n\nPINS 10%\n\nGAN 7,5%\n\nAMRS 7,5%\n\nAlso planning to add 7k of sth payments related in the future. Probably PYPL or maybe V/MA/SQ.\n\nAny advice to the overall portfolio from you experts would be appreciated. Thank you :-)",

Nobody can pick the top or bottom but you can get close in my experience.\n\nMost of the credible big wigs on financial media I follow (and I follow a lot) say we are a month or two from an adjustment downwards based on the reasoning when the Q2 numbers come in, and we realize just how bad and big the economy is, it\u2019s gonna be a stomach punch to the markets.  \n\nSeventy percent is quite respectable.\n\nAs far as the one stock you are looking for that\u2019s a pretty wide open question.  Were it my money I would most probably pick a tech stock - something near the top of the list of the Nasdaq 100.  But I would so that partially because its more bulletproof to the harder times ahead than other sectors and will likely grow.  How much is a matter of evaluation.\n\nRemember the rule don\u2019t try to predict try to get the probability on your side.\n\nI would look at cyber security or electronic payments companies like PayPal and such - they are only growing as we digitally transform society.\n\nI was looking at Schroedinger SDGR, based on the whole theme of digital transformation but didn\u2019t get in and it\u2019s tripled in the last four months approximately.\n\nOn the smaller side I like Limelight networks when you look at what they do for the money you pay.  \n\nBut like Schroedinger, they\u2019ve kinda had their rebound run already and might not grow that much short term now that this run is well in but have perhaps a long term hold type of play in them.\n\nI\u2019m a trader not an investor so I don\u2019t look super far out and like to make my money in intermediate to short terms.\n\nLet me know what you figure out and congratulations take that profit off the table when it\u2019s available cause nobody can predict the future though the Dow futures are predicting a up day tomorrow right now.",

SQ has an amazing ecosystem for small merchants but is now also a bank that can loan money. Add to that their popular payment and investing app for consumers and the ability to take this abroad and scale to epic proportions. Everything is backed by a visionary leader.",
