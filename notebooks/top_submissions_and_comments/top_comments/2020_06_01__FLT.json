        "body": "See a lot of misinformation in the comments. FLT is one of the few delivery companies in the world, and the only public drone delivery co in Canada. Their market cap was at once $300m and now about $150m. One of countless drone companies to take advantage of investor hype to build a drone company. $300m market cap at no revenue is insane.\n\nEven now at $150m aggressively over valued. They are now setting value with some contract announcements so the pressure is on. \n\nI know the ownership and have been to their facility and can tell you the tech is not the issue. The issue is the INSANE amount of infrastructure and regulation that would be required to integrate drones into an already over-saturated traffic management system.\n\nWe are about 10 years away until we see drone deliveries for every day items, apart from highly remote areas (FLT existing contracts), or depot-to-depot transportation in other countries with less red tape. \n\nNot to say FLT can\u2019t be successful as a drone company, but they will need to survive off other area until the world is willing and capable to accept drones in built-up areas, and in the meantime accept a more realistic valuation as such. Investment-wise the rise has long passed.",

        "body": "I used to work at DXC right at the beginning when it was a merged unit of CSC and HPE.  Previously I had worked at CSC.  The previous CEO of DXC (Mike Lawrie) was a strip mining vulture and like what was said in your OP and quoted, almost all of the talented and intelligent people in my division fled the company over a period of about 18 months.  Almost all of the projects I ended up on after the merger had both CSC and HPE stakeholders trying to fight each other for control of things and no actual plan.  I got tired of that and received a better offer elsewhere so I left too.\n\nThe old CSC division of the company made a lot of money on nepotistic defense IT contacts by employing a lot of former military brass who knew the right people to get the contracts.  I don't think services were delivered very well though because the bulk of the actual workforce was outsourced Indian IT.  This speaks more to your point about all the various areas where service delivery blows.\n\nThe creation of DXC was like two super tankers of failed companies slamming together to make one big fuck fest.  A lot of spin-off since then of business units that were complete failures post merger.  Last time I looked into the company was when they announced the new CEO Mike Salvino, when I read his background I assumed he was hired to ice down the company, sell the organs, and close the doors.  I'm actually surprised because your DD makes it sound like he's actually putting the shit tanker on the right track.\n\nThe stock price is very low relative to fundamentals.  I think that's been the case for years now because no one believes in this shit heap.  Maybe Salvino changes that, maybe business performance over this time period changes that, I'm interested to see.",
