        "body": "Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people.",

It's extremely odd to say the least that Unity and Snowflake are rocketing up while the rest of tech is coming down...it points to the fact that growth/tech investors are parking their money here and will be shorted later.

Bullish call-option buying has exploded. Over the past month, traders have bought almost 15 times the number of call options expiring in November of those FAANG stocks, plus Microsoft and Tesla, than the equivalent number of put options.\n\n....\n\n\nWhen call-option buying spikes, it drives call sellers to buy underlying stock, sending shares higher. When brokers sell options contracts, they don\u2019t want to take the risk of what happens to the underlying stock. Brokers only want to earn a commission selling\u2014and trading\u2014the options. Often times, brokers buy underlying stock to hedge their book of business. That way, any gains or losses on options positions are offset by corresponding gains in the underlying stock prices.\n\nSo any explosion in call-option buying generates stock buying on the Street. That\u2019s one way to explain the 20% rise of those tech stocks since July.\n\nIt\u2019s also a way to explain the recent two day collapse. Call-option trading volume Thursday in those tech stocks was down by roughly two-thirds compared with recent highs.\u201d",

I have already, within my lifetime, seen numerous digital services go out of service or move to a new platform where you are told to pound sand on previous purchases, same will be the case for your game. 70 now, 30 on the next platform, 10 on the next one when they bring it back as some \"retro\" feature so you can buy it a third time. \n\nthird, no inherent value to it. Now you are buying a game that is 60+ dollars, they can remove from your system if they want, the console can fail like with above, if they no longer support it its too bad for you. I have had older console games appreciate substantially from the nostalgia alone and that is gone now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOptical media sucks but I think it should be a staple of gaming, once they fully move off optical media its really going to sting.

But the promise is that they will become a software juggernaut serving a multitude of industries.\n\nTo quote the company's website, its software has applications to \"Animation, Film, Automotive, Transportation, Architecture, Engineering, Manufacturing &amp; Construction.\"\n\nThat's a pretty large TAM right there if they can establish themselves as a major player in just a few of those industries.\n\nTook a small position, will wait for dips/consolidation before considering making it bigger. I also don't think it's a bad idea to wait for them to really get a foothold in some of these areas of lateral expansion before buying (even if by then it's at a higher price).",
