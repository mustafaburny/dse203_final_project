You may have to have a minimum amount of money in the account but I honestly don't remember.\n\nMy understanding regarding the EH swings is large institutions/big buyers can cause price fluctuations based on the number of shares they buy/sell. Very few shares are traded in extended hours which is why you will see a huge price swing.\n\nThe earliest I can trade is 7am central time and as late as 7pm central time I think.

This is a full circle jerk and I\u2019m done with this shit. TD, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, who knows but anything is better then this neck beard infested wannabe trading site.",
