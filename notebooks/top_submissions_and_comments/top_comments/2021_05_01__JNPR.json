Chasing often results in buying high and selling low.  \nLook for solid companies with a sound business and plenty of future growth.  Learn to always check p/e and p/s ratios before buying.  See what the stock traded prior to covid, did they launch something new or improve their business during covid?  If not, why would the company be worth more now than it was pre-covid?  Always have a hold philosophy before buying (is it 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years before you think you may want to sell it?)  \nNow is a great time to start buying some of the big tech and some of the other moderate p/e tech companies that will be long-term (3+ year) winners like AMD, SKWS, TSM, LRCX, AMAT.  This does not mean go all in on them but rather start buying with a plan.  Look at the solar and green-tech companies, if you find something with a p/e below ~40, research it maybe buy a few share and keep it on the radar.  Now is a great time to start buying small positions in longterm winners that have been beaten up.  This however, is not a time I could recommend looking at too many things that are still unproven.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't look at small positions in things like weed, on-line betting, eV, big data, just keep those risks as a small part of your portfolio.",

        "body": "Be careful. That guy just told you to buy stocks that have been on a losing spree for a bit. This isn't the market cycle for frothy tech stocks. I'm a fan of semiconductor plays like , QCOM, Lam research, AMD and intel (long hold, short is hairy.) I like big tech with good earnings and decently low peg and pe multiples. Tech is presenting some good buying opportunities, but the market is rampant with companies that just simply won't make it. Stick to blues chip names that have gotten beaten up and dca into a solid position. Anything else speculative, may be comparable to catching a falling knife.\n\nApph isn't terrible and has promise. \n\nEV is solid, but very expensive for most investments right now, as most don't turn a profit. Tesla barely even turns a profit and is the first mover. To play this space, I would go with legacy automakers like Gm or ford or volkswagen, as they are on a path to integrate EVs into their lineups. \n\nOther than automakers, I would buy lithium miners like Livent or albemarle. Precious metals like palladium and rhodium related stocks may also be good buys because PGM metals are used in EV cars as well as ICE cars. \n\nRight now, industrials are good, although with the inflation narrative, stocks with pricing power are in demand. Healthcare, tobacco, oil (eh, I'm bullish, but I'm biased), food and beverage (pepsi, Coca-Cola, etc) will probably do decent under this volatility, but won't make you heaps of money either. \n\nBanks are also decent buys, I like Citi and BAC. They will do well under inflation BUT have already went on a bit of a tear so dca into a position may be smart.",

TSMC has stated that prices will go up for new orders, but they are still working through the backlog that has been under contract for some time, and the new pricing won't take effect yet. This, plus the threat of China, is what's keeping the $TSM price depressed right now. Beyond that, they have nothing but tailwinds from a business perspective for the next several years. \n\nLook for the semicaps ($AMAT, $ASML, $TER, $LRCX, $KLAC, et al) if you want plays that will see action first from the TSMC, Intel and Samsung capex spending. The fabs will benefit from this capex second, while the fabless companies ($NVDA, $AMD, $AAPL, etc.) will see the benefit of this extra capacity last.",

The other guy (we have to call in to Telus office from the store) proceeds to argue with me and say he can\u2019t do anything. She basically got saddled with (I think) a $1700 phone bill and Telus wouldn\u2019t do anything despite it being obvious the mistake was theirs. We also all knew when we sold you garbage, such as the Motorola keyboard phone, the Blackberry Storm, and several other hot garbage devices that were defective as fuck.\n\nAlso, they were charged pay and talk clients to add features and minutes (.25 a minute) when they called the number, charging for things like automatic texts and honestly as a rep, I felt like it was my job in the end to protect the customer from my employer.

People need drinks and they are dominant in that market. People have always needed the demand for drinks for 100 of years. If you notice most food and beverage  companies have been around for 100 years but it's not the same for tech. Many tech companies have fallen off after a few years of growth( IBM, Motorola and many other companies)\n\u25cf If the demand for the products of a company simply reduces then the growth of thay company also reduces. This is a cycle we cannot measure and it is purely based off what the company  and its competitors can please its customers  for.\n\u25cf I agree companies will have growth for 20 years too but it's not all companies. It's only a fraction of the companies that will have growth in the next 20 years and they will get exhausted too once the company has no new products to offer which will meet the demands of its customer. The company share prices either declines or offer a good dividend to attract investors.",

Like Radio Shack, they catered too much to the hobbyist crowd, and essentially turned into a glorified RC car shop. GameStop has a chance with adding Razer, Corsair, Thermaltake, EVGA, MSI, and ASUS gear that appeals to a much wider audience. Hell, they could make themselves the best brick and mortar for liquid cooling, which is something that's sorely lacking even considering Microcenter. \n\nI don't think they should focus on stocking every component for every use case, but I think it would go a long way for them if they essentially browsed r/buildapc and kept popular products around while they're popular. Like the 011 Dynamic XL cases everyone has nowadays. A limited selection of AMD/Intel cpus + compatible, typical use case motherboards. Toss in some gamer branded ram like GSkill and a small selection of 650-850W psus, and they're a quick stop for console gamers and pc gamers alike.",

You might be right about tsla and it is definitely richly valued, but as the future moves to a greener future, I expect the tides to turn pretty quickly. I expect tsla to get a bigger piece of that pie than most. You might want to buy a Ford Mach E over a Tesla and that\u2019s fine. There will be a lot of others that think the same way. It reminds me of when LG and Motorola had their \u201ciPhone killer\u201dphones 15 years ago and I had to hear about people telling me how Apple was doomed. Same for amazon being a joke of a company bc they couldn\u2019t make a profit for a decade.",

        "body": "They won't repair it for free, and they deliberately make it harder for consumers and third-party vendors to repair it. Things like gluing the battery to the board, not allowing people to replace it using software (users will get a \"unable to verify if this a genuine battery\" error, which is straight bullshit. If you call a rep to discuss repairs, their go-to policy is to convince you to just buy a new item. \n\nThat isn't an argument against the quality of Apple products though. In general, they have pretty good build quality (although 2018 MacBooks with their butterfly keyboards would beg to differ, and unfortunately I have one of these).\n\nFurthermore, their shitty policies encourage other companies to do the same. It seems that Apple sets the bar for what is acceptable (removing headphone jack, not shipping chargers, etc), and since consumers are enamoured with their products, they accept this change. This in turn emboldens everyone else to do the same, which normally would have gotten them burnt, but since Apple normalized it they remain unscathed.\n\nAlso, your Dell/MSI laptops were probably significantly cheaper. You're paying a premium to have higher quality products, which is a fair trade. Paying a premium to own less of the physical thing you just bought (software blocks), and then defending the company that does that is just shooting yourself in the foot. It's possible to enjoy something and still be able to criticize it and expect better.",
