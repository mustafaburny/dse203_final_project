I also typically play a game then return it for trade in value which is typically still pretty good ($30 or so) on a brand new game. The GME near me has completely reinvented itself with about 10pc gaming stations where they host local tournaments and let you play new games. I don\u2019t personally participate in tournaments, but it\u2019s neat to see in action and definitely feels like the future when you consider so many kids playing fortnite.

(GME), today reported sales results for the nine-week holiday period ended January 4, 2020.\n\nTotal global sales from continuing operations for the holiday period were $1.83 billion, a 27.5% decrease compared to the 2018 nine-week holiday period ended January 5, 2019. Total comparable store sales for the nine-week period decreased 24.7%, following a 1.5% increase in comparable store sales for the similar period in fiscal 2018. Sales results during the holiday period are indicative of overall industry trends impacting the video game industry and driven by an accelerated decline in new hardware and software sales, particularly in the month of De\u00ad\u00ad\u00adcember.",

The year before a new console release, people buy less games for the current consoles, and less games are developed because devs are focused on the new consoles. On top of that, unlike digital downloaded games, a console still has to be purchased physically at a store (in this case GameStop). They hit an abnormal low of $3.20 a share a few months ago, I bought in, and so far it\u2019s almost doubled in value. So knowing about video games has finally made me some money (take that mom)",

        "body": "First of all good job, it's nice to see original content and it's clear you put in effort. Also def see Redcards post for more concise/simple feedback.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYou discuss market cyclicality, quarterly growth/profit, market growth, and some trends. The format looks alright if you're targeting a career in SS research. For buyside there's too many false conclusions and useless data content-wise. Even for SS research the content is very sub-par. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**\"physical games will always be cheaper\"** False. Digital versions of most media are cheaper than their print/hard-copy counterparts. Long-term digital distribution should squeeze out any physical supply chain due to inherently superior economics. If you make the argument it's cheaper because you can re-sell, the counter argument is that the industry will continue to shift from physical copies because it cannibalizes the supply chain (bad for all industry participants except the physical distributors). \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**\"Ownership of digital content is a controversial topic... that could *reverse* the trend of digital re-placing physical.\"** Ridiculous assertion. Amazon is controversial among some audience somewhere does that mean we are going back to brick and mortar retail? There may be some consumer complaints but the convenience to the consumer and long-term cheaper cost to produce should prevail in the long run. In the extreme scenario, consumers boycott all digital distributors due to this \"controversy\" and revert to physical copies. Assuming that happens the digital distributors sit their with their thumbs up their ass, don't react and fail to change whatever \"controversial\" policies? The scenario makes no sense.. isn't even worth thinking about.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYou argue for growth of \"physical\" collectibles. So how does this compete with Amazon, or any other major online retail distributor? GME had an edge in the days brick-and-mortar retailers fulfilled niche retail categories. Nowadays why visit a physical store to find a niche product when I can enter a detailed, even personalized product into a search engine with 1000x the breadth/depth one 300m dinosaur has to offer. On that note, why do you need GME for it's bread and butter digital distribution in the world of Steam, Epic, Amazon, Tencent, et al. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe ease of developers distributing their own content due to go-to-mkt innovations (payments processing, web development, ancillary services[see KWS]) is another major headwind against GME, which goes unaddressed in your report. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**A few high level points:**\n\n* Every stock has a \"story\" for why the market prices it where it's at. As Redcards said, I see this pitch over and over again... GME couldn't be any more of what investors describe as a \"value trap\". You might see a small jump in the price near-term due to whatever asset sales/partnerships/article hits the news, but the business value will continue to decline year over year until all investors are left with are (depleted) net assets. And that's the \"Story\" here. To pitch GME as a long you need to provide original, compelling evidence that this story is fundamentally wrong (for example a new exec is coming in to re-vitalize a burgeoning VR division, major upcoming restructuring unappreciated, unknown market trend GME well positioned for, upcoming spinoff/M&amp;A,stock is M&amp;A target etc). Really nothing novel is presented to that end... you mention the \"potential\" of GME's entrance into esports, VR etc but the market discounts these possibilities for good reasons.\n\n\n* In the future, for everything you put in your report, make sure it has a reason to be there especially if you're pitching to a buy-side audience. You don't have to go through every segment for the sake of going through every segment. If it's not worth talking about don't even mention it. Some of the best investment pitches I've personally seen are &lt;1 page. The segment breakdown seems relatively arbitrary/unpertinent for how long it is.\n\n\n* On the other hand, ensure every sentence you do write is well-backed with quantitative evidence or sound analytical backing. The report is riddled with vague statements and outright falsities. \n\n\n* Formatting: Add subtle grey/white gradient shading to your graphs. Make sure color scheme is consistent throughout report. Get rid of useless decimals/0's (put thousands, millions, billions as units etc). Make sure all font style is the same (font sizes can be different but be consistent in how you do this). Be consistent with your spacing (there seems to be crunches in some places and huge white space elsewhere). I also recommend creating an original investment report format that conforms to your thesis instead of using an arbitrary SS format. Of course disregard if you're creating for the purpose of getting hired in SS research... \n\n\n* Your risks are too vague/general. Of course a market downturn is a risk. Of course every industry is vulnerable to a black-swan innovation out of left-field. More pertinent risks would have involved debt assessment, GME's eroding competitive advantage/market, etc.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThanks for posting this. It's nice to see original content and people putting themselves out there with a thesis. It's a good start and hope to see more from you.",

        "body": "I've done a good amount of research on GME, and at one point had a similar price target \\~$12.5 per share. Here's why I exited my long position -\n\n1. Console cycle actually doesn't increase gross profit in a meaningful way, since gross margins are SUPER slim on consoles (most of Gamestop's gross profit actually comes from pre-owned sales at \\~35%) - You can look at the past trends on this, which make sense since console sales essentially double / triple, and pre-owned sales trickle down slightly causing gross profit to remain flat-ish. \n2. In this console cycle, Amazon is a much bigger player than PS4 / Xbox One and could very likely suck up most of the sales that went to Gamestop in the last cycle, and Microsoft / Sony will be likely to promote their digital rental services which provide a MUCH superior offering.\n3. Gamestop essentially has no operating profits at this point in time... Their most recent miss was astounding and shows that they have a very limited runway beyond burning their cash in 2020. I had originally forecasted \\~$150m in 2019, which was below the lowest analyst expectations.\n4. Management missed the best shot they had in repurchasing shares aggressively at a \\~$3 per share basis in August when the EV was essentially zero - how could they have missed out on this / doing a big reverse merger or tender around \\~$3.5 or \\~$4 per share?\n5. Microsoft &amp; Sony's video game subscription services just obliterate Gamestop's pre-owned segment, and Gamestop can no where near afford to give up &gt;30% of gross profit with an operating margin of 0% as of now. \n6. It's too hard to close stores as fast as they are trying to, and if they aren't closing as many as they should its a catch-22. Also severance expenses are gasoline to the fire.\n\ntldr ; console sales won't change much, pre-owned sales are exploding, likely to go bankrupt after shredding the cash balance. value trap.",

Add in $1B of real estate and $2.2B of liabilities and you're left with about $810mm of equity or around $9/sh in tangible equity. \n\nObviously, cash and equivalents can be assumed at full carrying value, as can the prepaid expenses since it's a safe assumption that the business would not be in an overnight fire sale and have some operations before liquidating. Receivables can probably be sold off quickly at 80\u00a2 or so on the dollar. This puts discounted current assets excluding inventory at $661mm. \n\nReal estate is carried at $1B and is seen as fairly desirable.

Inventory now just needs to be sold off at above 80\u00a2 on the dollar to break even on equity, which is a little high but not impossible since they're mostly used games and therefore carrying value is already steeply discounted. \n\nI believe the brand has some value left, and the operating business could be sold off or run for a few more years for some extra profits. At easily over $4-5B in sales and a 33% gross margin, any credible investment banker could fetch a valuation of the equity in the mid-hundred millions if not much higher. GME could very easily be liquidated or acquired for around where shares trade today, especially given the recent EBITDA breakeven. \n\nCost cutting, if done by a competent manager, could result in annual EBITDA in excess of $150-200mm. This gives a pretty favorable EV/EBITDA for an acquirer when I bought -- roughly 7-10x. That shouldn't be difficult to find a buyer for.",

They bought [Impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_\\(software\\)) (online game store) and did literally nothing with it. There was a huge retro gaming movement over the last decade (still going, but starting to simmer down)...they did nothing with that (want to buy a used game? You have to go to one of those sketchy used game stores in the strip mall nobody likes to go to). They bought ThinkGeek, they didn't do anything with that.\n\nGamestop, to me, is lacking a corporate identity at the moment. They wanted to be \"the place to go to buy games\", which worked well enough when gaming was a niche activity that only the nerdy kids did (and why they were able to absorb all the Babbages, EB Games, etc). Now that it's a mainstream activity, traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, Walmart etc. all carry the exact same game selection, and I can pick them up while I'm out grocery shopping, looking for a new TV, etc. Why would I go to Gamestop?\n\nIf I'm CEO of Gamestop, I need to decide what the company wants to be 10 years from now. If the answer is \"the place where people go to buy video games\", then you might as well just start closing things down now, because that's not the answer that's going to lead you to the future.",

        "body": "Yea I agree they are fighting an uphill battle. But the closings I think will save them more than overall sales they will lose. A lot of areas became over saturated with locations over time and many customers will still have locations close enough to reach without much hassle. It will definitely free a lot of cash and resources that they could reallocate to possibly benefit them. \n\nLike you said all they have to do is give people a reason to go there instead of the Best Buy, Walmart, or target. With the new consoles this year they will have the demand there. The new consoles this year are going to be the full generational upgrade for the next 5-7 years or so. Powered by amd and my wife su! But I digress.\n\nIt\u2019s up to GameStop to make their market again. The video game industry has changed a lot in the last 5-10 years or so with how games are developed and monetized. disruptors like rising development costs, digital sales, more accessible mobile gaming, twitch and streaming/viral marketing culture. Amazon partnered with twitch for this reason, content in the games have surprising value now. Fortnite has been like the top one to beat for a couple years as far as making money, and the game is free. Sony caved finally on letting their network go cross platform because the winners aren\u2019t going to be based on units sold now. Exclusive content, like spider man for them during the time of the marvel peak.\n\nLast but not least Fortnite proved once and for all if you want to make money simply keep people engaged and regularly playing to incentivize them to spend after the initial purchase. Even if it\u2019s in small purchases over time. That\u2019s where dlc and selling undeveloped content failed. Not that GameStop doesn\u2019t already try and do this, but if they push harder or fork up some more money to drive exclusive sales or content that people want then they will come to buy it lol",
