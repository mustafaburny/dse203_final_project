        "body": "From the carriers perspective there's no money to be made in 5g in the next couple years.  Users are paying what they are paying now and probably are not willing to pay more.  There's no additional users to capture in the US.  Only thing Verizon can do is gain efficiency with 5g.  A few customers will bounce around between the big three but it will all even out in the end.  Unless you live somewhere super dense your phone probably has more than enough internet speed to make you happy. \n\nVZ also destroys every media company they buy.  Tumblr and Yahoo to name a few.  Launched a search engine that no one cares about or asked for...  Meanwhile ATT seems to be doing okay with DirecTV \n\nEven the lastest earning call showed showed that just being a better wireless network isn't enough anymore. \n\nFor VZ to play ball with ATT and be interesting to investors it's going to have to make a Netflix size aquistion which will likely be looked down on by investors.\n\nMobile bandwidth is approaching commodity status and VZ is a terrible choice for 5g.\n\nThe choices you need to be looking at are\n\nNokia and ericson - they will have equipment at every tower.\n\nJuniper pretty common router for the big players.  If they are not selling product they will likely get bought by nokia.. maybe \n\nSpectrum cause who's gonna provide the last mile to the towers?\n\nAmerican tower company and the other big guy. \n\nCorning fiber.  If it's not 5g driving it, there will be other drivers\n\nNot too sure about the dwdm players but I cannot see infinera having a bad year.\n\nWhoever does the dispatch for tower work.",

        "body": "From the carriers perspective there's no money to be made in 5g in the next couple years.  Users are paying what they are paying now and probably are not willing to pay more.  There's no additional users to capture in the US.  Only thing Verizon can do is gain efficiency with 5g.  A few customers will bounce around between the big three but it will all even out in the end.  Unless you live somewhere super dense your phone probably has more than enough internet speed to make you happy. \n\nVZ also destroys every media company they buy.  Tumblr and Yahoo to name a few.  Launched a search engine that no one cares about or asked for...  Meanwhile ATT seems to be doing okay with DirecTV \n\nEven the lastest earning call showed showed that just being a better wireless network isn't enough anymore. \n\nFor VZ to play ball with ATT and be interesting to investors it's going to have to make a Netflix size aquistion which will likely be looked down on by investors.\n\nMobile bandwidth is approaching commodity status and VZ is a terrible choice for 5g.\n\nThe choices you need to be looking at are\n\nNokia and ericson - they will have equipment at every tower.\n\nJuniper pretty common router for the big players.  If they are not selling product they will likely get bought by nokia.. maybe \n\nSpectrum cause who's gonna provide the last mile to the towers?\n\nAmerican tower company and the other big guy. \n\nCorning fiber.  If it's not 5g driving it, there will be other drivers\n\nNot too sure about the dwdm players but I cannot see infinera having a bad year.\n\nWhoever does the dispatch for tower work.",

I suppose you have to lose serious money before you learn to be prudent.  At least I did.  Up until the Great Recession I kept up a Yahoo Finance Portfolio I had around the turn of the Millenium.  It listed JNPR bought at $83, $96 and $113.  I suppose I could have sold at $220 but I sold a few months later at $24, which is where it is today.  It also shows EXDS (Exodus, had server farms) at $60.  Soon Bk.  Also ADAP at $24 (Bk soon after).   CSCO with buys at near both $40 and $60 with sells the following years at $24.  At least it is doing relatively well now 19 years later.  Heck, I even had some AMZN I bought at $40 that I had to sell a couple of years later to buy a house at $12.  I imagine a lot of folks today think AMZN went straight up to $2000 from $6.",

        "body": "\n&gt;I really appreciate you taking the time .....I totally see it now with my MA example. \n\nSure thing, glad you got it. I hate to see people losing money that they shouldn't have to, especially if I can help prevent it by simply helping them work out the numbers! \n\n\n&gt;I could sell the feb 7 $277.5 put and collect Friday\u2019s bid of .85 that would be premium of $850 on 1000 shares. \n\nYup, that's correct (keeping in mind that at Monday's open the prices are likely gonna be different; but you got the idea).\n\nAlso, again, I'd recommend not hitting the bid, but rather trying first at mid price or maybe even a bit better. Eg, I see a 0.85 x 0.90 market on those puts (from Friday). I'd try to sell that put for maybe 0.88 first, and then lower my price penny by penny til I get my fill. I also would lower it all the way to the bid, as I would consider I'm being completely ripped off of I have to go all the way there (unless I had a very strong need to do it, like to close a position to prevent massive losses; but not to open a new one).\n\n\n&gt;And the way to protect myself from a loss would be to close the position early before Im down \n$850 and use my premium to prevent loss ?\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure is clear - and, again, because of Put-Call parity, it applies to both a short put and a covered call trades - is that this premium you receive is not really \"a cushion\", not really a way to protect you from losses.\n\nLooking at the short put trade may actually help to see this thing I'm gonna talk about more clearly, but remember the exact same thing applies to CC, just maybe a bit harder to see as things are a bit less explicit.\n\nOnce you sell that put, you don't \"make 850 USD\". You are making a transaction in which 850 USD are exchanged for something worth 850 USD. You have 0 profits of losses initially. So there isn't really an 850 USD cushion.\n\nYou're effectively getting 850 USD now to assume a liability valued by the market at 850 USD now. \n\nIf AAPL goes down, or if IV increases, the premium of that put is going to increase, meaning that you'll be at a loss: you'll have 850 USD cash, and a liability of more than 850 USD market value. \n\nSay AAPL moves in such a way that the put is now worth 1.00. You're at a loss of 0.15 per share, or 150 USD. You can close everything and take that 150 USD loss. More explicitly, you initially received 850 USD to assume a liability, and then you paid 1000 USD to rid yourself from that liability: a 150 USD loss. Notice that the 150 USD loss doesn't even require you to close your trade: you're at a loss simply because you have 850 USD cash and a liability worth 1000 USD cash. It's an \"unrealized loss\", which doesn't mean \"unreal loss\", it's very real! \n\nIf the position is going against you, you can close it at any time, and take (or realize) the loss. A common threshold people use in short put trades is to not let the loss become bigger than the max profit you were looking at. So in this case, this rule of thumb would lead people to close the short put by buying it back for 1.70, if it starts going that way. People usually talk about this by saying stuff like \"close for a loss at 2x the premium received\". \n\nSo this way of \"protection\" is really just getting out of the position - at a loss! - in order to prevent the losses from possibly getting bigger, much bigger. Sometimes people resist it thinking that they may want to hold longer \"to see if it comes back\": problem is, it may also go further! \n\nThere are many other ways to protect yourself, too.\n\nFor example, you could buy a put at a lower strike. It reduces your profitability, since you'll be spending part of the premium you got to acquire this protection. But it effectively limits the max you can lose. Eg if you buy the 270 put, you'll be paying around 0.62 (mid of 0.60 x 0.64 that I see here), but if AAPL tanks to, say, 250, you'll be forced to buy it for 277.5 (your short put) but you have the right to sell it for 270 (yourong put). The trade off is that now, on 10 contracts, the max profit you're looking at is 230 USD (850 USD from selling the 277.5 usd, 620 USD from buying the 270 put). **This is exactly a vertical spread.**\n\nAlternatively, you could short a bit of stock: this reduces the effect of the put increasing in value (this increasing your losses) as the stock price goes down: the profit on the short balances put some of the losses on the short put. People usually think about doing this kind of stuff when the delta of their short put gets too big and scary. Disadvantage is that if the stock moves up, you lose on the short stock position, and this loss can eventually even get bigger than the profits from shorting the put... so it has to be managed actively. **This is usually referred to as managing or hedging delta (and can be done in other ways, too, like reducing the size of the short put position, or selling OTM calls basically transforming it into a strangle, etc).**\n\nSo many possibilities...\n\nIf you want to explore more about this, check whether your trading platform has some good support for risk analysis for options. You didn't mention what it is, so I'm gonna comment on a few popular ones around here. \n\nToS has an OK tool in the Analyze tab: it works well for simple positions, it's pretty easy to use, but it simply cannot handle a more complex position with many legs without slowing down to the point where it becomes unresponsive for 10s of seconds.\n\nIB has absolutely amazing support for analyzing options portfolios in the Risk Navigator tool: it can handle whatever book of option you throw at it with fantastic performance, and IMO it has an incredibly superior model to ToS's, both in terms of its default settings as well as in terms of offering incredibly powerful ways to tweak it if you want (you probably don't, at least not initially).\n\nRobinhood has nothing. Well, it calculates your \"break even\" for single legs... But frankly, I wouldn't trust even that number without verifying it myself every time as RH is just... well, it's RH. \n\nTastyworks is something I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think this aspect would've changed much, since all I see is they trying to push a \"novel\" risk analysis approach: it sucks in this area. (it emphasizes too much this notion of \"probability of profit\", which is really absurd IMO as it isn't anywhere close to reflecting risk, especially in non-trivial positions). \n\nI'll share a couple of screenshot from IB later when I get to my competition so you can get a sense of what it looks like, and how you can explore ways to possibly protect yourself from big losses.",

        "body": "&gt;That $1.84 loss that you cited is also what I pocket as my profit is it not ?\n\nNo, it's really a loss.\n\nYou'll be selling something for less money than you paid to acquire it, even accounting for the premium received from selling the calls. It's a loss. \n\n&gt;So on 1000 shares thats $1840 in my pocket for 5 trading days assuming MA stays above $285. \n\nNo, at 1000 shares and 10 calls, your account will be worth $1840 less than it is worth today, in the best case scenario.\n\nIf you do what you described, you'll lose 1840 USD with absolute certainty. Maybe more, if MA tanks more than 10% in the coming week. \n\nI'd suggest that you read the calculations again on my previous comment. \n\n\n&gt;So far I have been successful because of the bull market and being conservative with ITM calls. \n\nUnderstanding that your success comes from the bull market is very good (some people would think it comes from ... ? some sort of natural or inherent edge of the strategy?) \n\n\n&gt;I am set up to sell naked or cash secured puts , I just don\u2019t feel comfortable yet doing so. \n\nTake some time to really think about this.\n\nThe trades you said you've been doing (buy shares AND sell ITM calls) and the alternative I mentioned (just selling an OTM put, same strike as the call you'd consider in a CC) are ***exactly the same***. You just feel uncomfortable with selling the puts because you don't see it yet that it's exactly what you're doing (but with 1 less step, so less overall costs).\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable with the risk profile of selling puts, you probably should review your understanding of CC, as you're probably not fully understanding your risks on CC trades. \n\nThis is actually a common theme here, by the way - you're definitely not alone in this fear. At least once a week (usually more) there are posts about people comfortable with selling a CC but uncomfortable selling a put (even if \"cash-secured\") at the same strike and expiration, even though it's absolutely the same position.",

        "body": "Thank you for sharing! I was hoping you could answer a few questions (please excuse me in advance if these questions sound trivial as I have no experience in real estate/home renovation/development/etc.)\n\n1.) I believe someone else has asked why the property manager who works for you has been so loyal this whole time? From an outsiders perspective it would seem that someone who is able to handle the responsibility of managing all your properties in addition to being able to turn what you basically write are eyesores into quaint turnkey rentals on a tight budget, wouldn\u2019t this employee/subcontractor constantly be approached by headhunters from larger real estate/commercial firms with more lucrative offers of employment? \n\n2.) I live in MA and ever since \u201808 have seen those highway billboards which advertise \u201cwe buy ugly homes\u201d. Now I don\u2019t know whether or not you are familiar with what I\u2019m referring to, but wouldn\u2019t these types of large companies be after exactly the type of properties you are interesting in buying up and renovating? Do you ever face competition from these bigger companies? \n\n3.) Ive seen a lot of people writing that they marvel at the market in MO where you\u2019re able to scoop up properties in the 10k range. Living in MA, which is an extremely expensive state to both buy and rent, I too am astonished that even the most dilapidated home could cost such a small amount of money. \nI remember many years ago when I worked on Cape Cod for the summer, my boss at the time asked if I\u2019d be interested in purchasing his \u201cstarter home\u201d for only 5k. I was a kid back then, with maybe a couple grand in savings, but out of curiosity went to go check out what 5k could buy in Falmouth, MA. When I got there, I wasn\u2019t much surprised to see it was inside of a trailer home community. However, the home (if you could call it one), was horrific. It was actually built on foundation, so it stood apart from the trailer homes surrounding the property, however, it was literally a studio apartment built as a home. The linoleum floor was peeling away everywhere you looked exposing wet moldy wood which stunk to high hell. It was a dump, no one would even consider buying as it was completely unlivable and would surely cost less to demolish and build one of those tiny homes that weren\u2019t in style or known about back then in its place.\nThis is a long winded way of asking what exactly does the phrase \u201cgood bones\u201d mean when looking at homes? Is it mold/rot/insulation problems/pipe issues/sewer plumbing/etc? Or is it mostly referring to the foundation upon which the house rests and the wood/stone which holds it together? \nThanks in advance for any insight you could provide!",

        "body": "Now it's much easier, knowing the exact contract!\n\n\n&gt;My profit would be 315.94-314.10 = $1.84\n\nThat's backwards. Profits are calculated as Sale minus Purchase. \n\nYou're gonna have to buy stock for 315.94. The short 285 call means you're gonna sell stock for 285 (if assigned). You get 29.10 premium for hitting the bid, so you could consider that your sale price is increased by that amount to 314.10 - however, I'd recommend you keep that separate in your calculations, it's easier. \n\nSo you'd calculate your profits as: 314.10 - 315.94 = -1.84. A loss. \n\nHere's how I'd calculate it, which will lead to the same result, but I prefer it more explicitly. Think of cash flows. You disburse 315.94 to acquire shares and receive 29.10 to sell the calls. Under the assumption that the Stock stays above the 285 strike price, you'll then receive 285 when you sell the stock as a result of assignment. Cash flows into your account increase your cash balance, and out of your account decrease it: so money you receive is positive, money you pay is negative. \n\nWith all the cash flows explicit, you'd calculate your profits as: -315.94 + 29.10 + 285 = -1.84. Same value (as expected), just a tad more explicit. \n\nSo your trade generates a guaranteed loss, in the best case scenario, of 1.84 per share. It's worse if MA goes below 285.\n\nWhy's that? \n\nBecause hitting the bid is a really, really bad idea.\n\nMarket orders (or marketable limit orders, ie, the ones that cross the bid-ask spread for an immediate fill) are in general a really bad idea in options, because bid-ask spreads can be extremely wide. This is especially the case for deep ITM options - and 10% ITM for MA (around 23%-ish IV) at 1 week to expiration is super deep ITM. \n\nIn the very least, you should sell that Call for 31.07. \n\n(this is based on the 315.94 MA price you mentioned, and on the bid-ask prices on the options chain for MA that I'm looking at right now, which are stale since this is the weekend; but let's go with it for a moment, for the sake of the explanation). \n\nHere's how I got that number: if MA is at 315.94, a 285 call has 30.94 premium just in intrinsic value. It must have some extrinsic value, too, since there's time until expiration.\n\nLooking at the 285 put, same expiration, I see a 0.13 x 0.27 market. Selling a covered call at strike 285 is the same as just selling a put at that same strike: this means you have at least 0.13 in extrinsic value. Add that to the intrinsic value, you get 31.07 premium that I mentioned. I also said \"in the very least\" because this was calculated based on the bid. But like I mentioned before, you it's a bad idea to trade options crossing the bid-ask spread, so you should look for more than that. \n\nThis idea of looking at the price of the put is due to what's known as Put-Call Parity. Essentially, it's the fact that `Stock = Call - Put (same strikes and expiration)`. Technically, for American options this may not hold due to potential early assignment, but in general you just assume it holds since early exercise is rarely optimal. \n\nFinally, notice that, once again due to Put-Call parity, selling the 285 covered call is exactly the same as selling the 285 put. In other words, you can achieve the very same risk profile by either having +100x MA -1x C285, or by having just -1x P285 (both on the Feb 7 expiration). \n\nSo if you don't have stock yet, and are looking to establish that position, you can instead simply sell the 285 put - better on commissions, better on less bid-ask spreads to deal with.\n\nHowever, if you already have the stock and want that position, you just sell the call (after finding out what price you should get!).\n\nAs a final note, I'm not exactly sure what your reasons for such a trade are, and while they may be valid, it's something that I'd definitely not do. If MA was part of any long term holdings, selling the 285 call is an almost guaranteed way to end up without MA in the portfolio, and there's super low reward in that (between 0.13 to 0.27). If I didn't have MA and was looking for a short term play (in which case I'd definitely do it by selling the 285 put, rather than buying stock AND selling a call), this would be one of those plays in which the reward is so meaningless, and the potential losses - even if unlikely - can be so insanely devastating comparatively, that it's definitely not worth it for me.",

Combined we make right around $200k a year. We have about $95k in retirement accounts and about $10k in savings. We want to continue to grow our retirement savings, and still be able to travel.\n\nWe\u2019re not against taking risks and playing the long game. Thought our single largest Rollover IRA has been fairly flat for the last 10 years (currently at $52k). It\u2019s in a managed account with a financial advisory firm and in a fidelity account. The fees are $628 per month. I believe the fees are destroying my gains. It looks like the fund choices are producing, but the bottom line has felt flat (slightly upwards over the last 10 years). \n\nOut of that $95k, $18k is in a separate Fidelity account in a S&amp;P 500 fund/product. And we have  5 shares of Amazon (totaling about $10k now) and a few shares of Visa &amp; MasterCard (totaling $2.5k). \n\nOur home is valued at about $360k and we have about $250k left on the mortgage. Out two vehicles were both PreOwned, but not inexpensive and we owe about $20k on the 2016 Mini Cooper and $33k on the 2013 Porsche Cayenne. We have about $20k credit card debit we\u2019ve been grinding down the CC debt over time. From as high as $45k or so, to $20k). \n\nMy wife is very good with money. I am not. We money becomes an issue, I tend to look for a different employer. (My job is in pretty high demand and I have a good bit of experience).  \n\nThe two other upcoming expenses we foresee will be buying a preowned Airstream travel trailer and replacing our floors in our home. Other than that, it will be retirement savings. \n\nAny advice would be welcome.",

        "body": "You\u2019ll be fine. The best time to start was yesterday and the next best time is now. At least you\u2019re thinking about investing. \n\nI got into investing early on but didn\u2019t start taking it seriously until later. It took going through the School of Hard Stocks for me to really understand both the importance and benefits of investing. When I first started investing I tried it all. Day trading, penny stocks (also tried day trading these. Hah), stock picking, bio tech, forex, options, etc. I also had unrealistic expectations, and I think this was primarily driven by the fact that when I first started, I didn\u2019t have much money to invest. I remember seeing a 1% drop early on and panicking (which resulted in me selling)! I also remember looking at sector specific penny stocks and thinking, \u201cWell, if Microsoft is trading for $40 per share, surely this other software company that\u2019s trading at $1 per share will eventually get to $40!\u201d For some reason, those stocks never panned out. Hmm.\n\nAs I got a bit wiser (or so I thought), I went to an Edward Jones and talked to one of their investment advisors. He put me in a fund that had an extremely high expense ratio and didn\u2019t generate much in the way of returns. I ended up pulling out my money and firing the advisor, as I didn\u2019t find much value there. Another loss on my end. \n\nThen I thought that hey, I can trade off of candles and indicators. So I went and purchased a bunch of books and started studying. This proved to be fruitful but it still wasn\u2019t getting me to the place I wanted to be. Again, my expectations were that I could just plug in $1,000 into the market and have it turn into $2,000 in a few days. Not thinking about how insane a 100% return in a few days would be. Needless to say, this didn\u2019t work out either.\n\nAs time progressed, I was introduced to bogleheads, where I learned about a 3-fund portfolio. I then read everything I could about index investing and started to get a grasp on the importance of investing in a routine fashion. \n\nFast forward to today and while I still run a 3-fund portfolio for the long term in my retirement accounts, I treat my other investment accounts differently. With the advent of fractional shares (first with motif, and now with M1), I\u2019ve been able to run a portfolio of 8-15 high conviction equities which I weight against each other to generate alpha. This has worked best for me. Presently, my CAGR is over 35% and my drawdowns are less than 15% month-over-month. I change my portfolio around every couple of years, but for the most part I don\u2019t mess with it and I just contribute to it every paycheck. The hardest part about all of this was believing in myself and my ideas. Giving myself room to make mistakes and learning from it all. \nAlso treating investing as a process in which starts slowly but grows over time. \n\nAs securities investing is largely personal, and outside of the echo chamber of \u201c3 fund is the only way to go.\u201d, its hard  to find alternative investment advice. The best thing that I can tell you is to just stay the course and be patient, especially if you\u2019re planning on purchasing individual securities. \n\nPortfolio Visualizer is also an invaluable tool where you can plug in the equities you want and see how they all play with each other. \n\nGood luck! Enjoy the journey. If you ever need help feel free to reach out.",

As others have said, when it\u2019s in a 401K it\u2019s effectively just numbers on a screen.\n\nRobinhood account options, I made 35k from 2k on LK a couple months ago. That was actually life changing as I\u2019m essentially living paycheck to paycheck. I paid off all of my debts and have been shoveling a couple thousand a month profits from additional RH profits into my bank account lately. My day to day life is exactly the same though. I don\u2019t spend any more or any less than I did before. \n\nI do find myself buying options on a whim more often and losing 2 to 3k per play. But then I\u2019ll hit another 8k or 10k option play that works out and I end up a little bit again. It works until it doesn\u2019t. \n\nPart of me really wanted to put the remainder of my RH account on Microsoft earnings calls next week. So, there\u2019s that. Definitely have a gambling problem.

When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be \"infected\" with a computer virus.Virus writers use social engineering deceptions and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to initially infect systems and to spread the virus. The vast majority of viruses target systems running Microsoft Windows, employing a variety of mechanisms to infect new hosts, and often using complex anti-detection/stealth strategies to evade antivirus software. Motives for creating viruses can include seeking profit (e.g., with ransomware), desire to send a political message, personal amusement, to demonstrate that a vulnerability exists in software, for sabotage and denial of service, or simply because they wish to explore cybersecurity issues, artificial life and evolutionary algorithms.Computer viruses currently cause billions of dollars' worth of economic damage each year,  due to causing system failure, wasting computer resources, corrupting data, increasing maintenance costs, stealing personal information etc.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

        "body": "An honest (if subjective) opinion.  I joined $MSFT in 2011, when AWS had a 2 year head start (stayed there for 6.5 years). At that time the list of Azure competitors were 10-12 entities.  AWS due to their head start is still bigger, but if you look at their quarterly/annual reports - $MSFT is catching up quickly.  If one has a new flashy toy, you can bet your bottom dollar that the competition would have a similar solution within 6 months - it\u2019s that equal/competitive now.\n\nCheck their financial statements.  2 years ago AWS was still bigger than Azure revenue-wise, but Azure is growing quicker than AWS (Azure is catching up).  One of the key reasons I\u2019d argue is the following:\n\nAWS is cloud-only.  If you want to start a new project/product, they assume you have nothing on premise.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s worked so well for new Tech Startups.  MSFT has over 30 years of selling to Enterprises, and though they were sceptic at first, they\u2019re now rapidly catching up realising the benefits of moving non-core systems and/or innovation to be cloud-first.  Amazon (who has a lot of ex-MSFT people working for them) knows this  - they are acutely aware that they have no legacy enterprise to migrate.  MSFT made a brilliant decision not just to be a cloud-first company, but it is 100 times easier for a MSFT customer to migrate at their own pace to Azure rather than any other Cloud - MSFT have invested millions if no billions to make this transition as painless as possible.\n\nIMHO - AWS might still be bigger QoQ numbers-wise, but MSFT\u2019s growth rate is better (ie they\u2019re catching up quickly).\n\nEven today, if you look at their financial statement (10-K/10-Q)\u2019s - they\u2019re spending 10-12 Billion $USD a year to build public cloud datacenters.   For the uninformed, that\u2019s the same amount of cash Oil &amp; Gas companies are investing annually (it\u2019s as big as it gets).  \n\nBased on their Capital Expenditure, AWS &amp; Azure is a 2-horse race.  In 3rd place is (IMHO far behind) Google.  GCP is years behind AWS/Azure, but I won\u2019t rule them out long-term because they have enough cash to spend/buy their way into the leading duo.\n\nIf you\u2019re starting something new, any cloud will probably be fine.  If you\u2019re migrating a heave $MSFT enterprise to the cloud - Azure makes it easier than the competition.\n\nMy 2 cents worth.",

If everyone went to a school where the schools objective was to make sure kids were prepared to approach problems and people logically and reasonably, and deal with simple common day occurrences, items, and tasks, then the world would be exponentially better. A car is an item you use everyday, you should have basic knowledge of how it works. Microsoft excell is something you have a high probability of using, regardless of what job you do, you should have a basic knowledge of you to use it. To be successful in life you have to interact with other people, you should learn the basics of how people think and react to things, and how to be part of a functioning society. I could go on and on but this kind of thing really gets me riled up cause schools fail at literally everything they should be doing 99% if the time. You can take all the shop classes you want in life but if the goal of the class is not aligned with the goal of the school, then the results will be underwhelming everytime.\n\n\ud83d\ude2aI hope one day society un-fucks itself and decides to start helping the 99% ofkids that are not going to be reading moby dick and doing Boolean calculus everyday.

Dynamics AX, Dynamics NAV, Dynamics 365 are now cloud offerings.\n\nMeaning if you are on Dynamics NAV ,  there is not a lot of work being done to the NAV product, its all being done on \"Business central\" what is just NAV running Azure.

        "body": "You\u2019ll be fine. The best time to start was yesterday and the next best time is now. At least you\u2019re thinking about investing. \n\nI got into investing early on but didn\u2019t start taking it seriously until later. It took going through the School of Hard Stocks for me to really understand both the importance and benefits of investing. When I first started investing I tried it all. Day trading, penny stocks (also tried day trading these. Hah), stock picking, bio tech, forex, options, etc. I also had unrealistic expectations, and I think this was primarily driven by the fact that when I first started, I didn\u2019t have much money to invest. I remember seeing a 1% drop early on and panicking (which resulted in me selling)! I also remember looking at sector specific penny stocks and thinking, \u201cWell, if Microsoft is trading for $40 per share, surely this other software company that\u2019s trading at $1 per share will eventually get to $40!\u201d For some reason, those stocks never panned out. Hmm.\n\nAs I got a bit wiser (or so I thought), I went to an Edward Jones and talked to one of their investment advisors. He put me in a fund that had an extremely high expense ratio and didn\u2019t generate much in the way of returns. I ended up pulling out my money and firing the advisor, as I didn\u2019t find much value there. Another loss on my end. \n\nThen I thought that hey, I can trade off of candles and indicators. So I went and purchased a bunch of books and started studying. This proved to be fruitful but it still wasn\u2019t getting me to the place I wanted to be. Again, my expectations were that I could just plug in $1,000 into the market and have it turn into $2,000 in a few days. Not thinking about how insane a 100% return in a few days would be. Needless to say, this didn\u2019t work out either.\n\nAs time progressed, I was introduced to bogleheads, where I learned about a 3-fund portfolio. I then read everything I could about index investing and started to get a grasp on the importance of investing in a routine fashion. \n\nFast forward to today and while I still run a 3-fund portfolio for the long term in my retirement accounts, I treat my other investment accounts differently. With the advent of fractional shares (first with motif, and now with M1), I\u2019ve been able to run a portfolio of 8-15 high conviction equities which I weight against each other to generate alpha. This has worked best for me. Presently, my CAGR is over 35% and my drawdowns are less than 15% month-over-month. I change my portfolio around every couple of years, but for the most part I don\u2019t mess with it and I just contribute to it every paycheck. The hardest part about all of this was believing in myself and my ideas. Giving myself room to make mistakes and learning from it all. \nAlso treating investing as a process in which starts slowly but grows over time. \n\nAs securities investing is largely personal, and outside of the echo chamber of \u201c3 fund is the only way to go.\u201d, its hard  to find alternative investment advice. The best thing that I can tell you is to just stay the course and be patient, especially if you\u2019re planning on purchasing individual securities. \n\nPortfolio Visualizer is also an invaluable tool where you can plug in the equities you want and see how they all play with each other. \n\nGood luck! Enjoy the journey. If you ever need help feel free to reach out.",

As others have said, when it\u2019s in a 401K it\u2019s effectively just numbers on a screen.\n\nRobinhood account options, I made 35k from 2k on LK a couple months ago. That was actually life changing as I\u2019m essentially living paycheck to paycheck. I paid off all of my debts and have been shoveling a couple thousand a month profits from additional RH profits into my bank account lately. My day to day life is exactly the same though. I don\u2019t spend any more or any less than I did before. \n\nI do find myself buying options on a whim more often and losing 2 to 3k per play. But then I\u2019ll hit another 8k or 10k option play that works out and I end up a little bit again. It works until it doesn\u2019t. \n\nPart of me really wanted to put the remainder of my RH account on Microsoft earnings calls next week. So, there\u2019s that. Definitely have a gambling problem.

Since your goal is to be in the market for the long term, your safest and simplest way to diversify your portfolio is to invest on ETFs.\n\nThe popular ETFs are SPY and VOO which tracks the S&amp;P500 and the QQQ which is a technology heavy sector that tracks companies like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, and FB. Then you should add ETFs that round out your portfolio with dividends such as VYM: High-Dividend Yield Index Fund and SPHD: Invesco S&amp;P500 High-Dividend Los Volatility ETF.\n\nThis will serve you a good backbone for the foreseeable future. Also you can invest in VTI, VT, VNQ, XLY, BND, SMH, and GLD to have a breadth of ETFs. The only downside of ETF route is the small fees, but other than that it provides you convenience and diversification for the average retail investor. By the power of compounding interest, you should theoretically increase your gains at the market rate of 5-7% per year in the conservative scenario. Since your time horizon is 20 years, I doubt you will have much problem to recover from a recession. I recommend a brokerage that allows you to DRIP and purchase fractional shares such as M1 Finance or Fidelity, you can also choose the retirement path (Roth IRA) if you plan to buy and hold stocks for a long time. Saves you some tax money in the long run but penalizes you if you withdraw before retirement age.",

I have one account for \"rainy days\" and the other builds up money for my next stock purchase.  That said, Microsoft is a good choice.  If you have nerves of steel, then having the mindset of that you'll keep those shares until at least college might help you hold on and not panic when (not if) the price dips 5, maybe 10 percent below whatever you buy it for.  That would give time for the price to recover and hopefully pull ahead to give you a net return.",

SPXL won\u2019t go to 0 unless the SP500 crashes 33%+. \n\nThere was a guy on investing and WSB who put 100k into SPXL in 2009 and it\u2019s now over 1 million.

The price has more than doubled in 6 months. 100% of the time that Tesla\u2019s stock has had upward moves that large it had at the very least a 10-20% decline following. That means if you sold now and price still continued up to $700 and then decline 20% you could buy back at $550. However, imo, since Tesla is now at an all time low of short sellers and is being priced at a 3x multiple of GM stock. It is likely to eventually return to and retest support at $400 before continuing its trend higher. Most will not agree with me but people typically don\u2019t agree with bearish views at tops. Just like when it gets back to $400 everyone will say not to buy even though that\u2019s the best decision to make at that price.",

In this case, the IV crush got the short leg which you sold. So, in this instance, the spread actually was more profitable because the move wasn't very big.\n\nHowever, 5 days later on 11/13, they release initial D+ numbers and had a huge jump. The naked 132 calls now returned 360% whereas the 132/136 spread returned 125%.\n\nWith a big move, you are hampered by the short leg you sold. It also greatly reduced your risk to the downside if it goes against you. So if you are expecting a big move and want max upside, naked calls will do it. More risk, more reward.",

        "body": "\n&gt;I really appreciate you taking the time .....I totally see it now with my MA example. \n\nSure thing, glad you got it. I hate to see people losing money that they shouldn't have to, especially if I can help prevent it by simply helping them work out the numbers! \n\n\n&gt;I could sell the feb 7 $277.5 put and collect Friday\u2019s bid of .85 that would be premium of $850 on 1000 shares. \n\nYup, that's correct (keeping in mind that at Monday's open the prices are likely gonna be different; but you got the idea).\n\nAlso, again, I'd recommend not hitting the bid, but rather trying first at mid price or maybe even a bit better. Eg, I see a 0.85 x 0.90 market on those puts (from Friday). I'd try to sell that put for maybe 0.88 first, and then lower my price penny by penny til I get my fill. I also would lower it all the way to the bid, as I would consider I'm being completely ripped off of I have to go all the way there (unless I had a very strong need to do it, like to close a position to prevent massive losses; but not to open a new one).\n\n\n&gt;And the way to protect myself from a loss would be to close the position early before Im down \n$850 and use my premium to prevent loss ?\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure is clear - and, again, because of Put-Call parity, it applies to both a short put and a covered call trades - is that this premium you receive is not really \"a cushion\", not really a way to protect you from losses.\n\nLooking at the short put trade may actually help to see this thing I'm gonna talk about more clearly, but remember the exact same thing applies to CC, just maybe a bit harder to see as things are a bit less explicit.\n\nOnce you sell that put, you don't \"make 850 USD\". You are making a transaction in which 850 USD are exchanged for something worth 850 USD. You have 0 profits of losses initially. So there isn't really an 850 USD cushion.\n\nYou're effectively getting 850 USD now to assume a liability valued by the market at 850 USD now. \n\nIf AAPL goes down, or if IV increases, the premium of that put is going to increase, meaning that you'll be at a loss: you'll have 850 USD cash, and a liability of more than 850 USD market value. \n\nSay AAPL moves in such a way that the put is now worth 1.00. You're at a loss of 0.15 per share, or 150 USD. You can close everything and take that 150 USD loss. More explicitly, you initially received 850 USD to assume a liability, and then you paid 1000 USD to rid yourself from that liability: a 150 USD loss. Notice that the 150 USD loss doesn't even require you to close your trade: you're at a loss simply because you have 850 USD cash and a liability worth 1000 USD cash. It's an \"unrealized loss\", which doesn't mean \"unreal loss\", it's very real! \n\nIf the position is going against you, you can close it at any time, and take (or realize) the loss. A common threshold people use in short put trades is to not let the loss become bigger than the max profit you were looking at. So in this case, this rule of thumb would lead people to close the short put by buying it back for 1.70, if it starts going that way. People usually talk about this by saying stuff like \"close for a loss at 2x the premium received\". \n\nSo this way of \"protection\" is really just getting out of the position - at a loss! - in order to prevent the losses from possibly getting bigger, much bigger. Sometimes people resist it thinking that they may want to hold longer \"to see if it comes back\": problem is, it may also go further! \n\nThere are many other ways to protect yourself, too.\n\nFor example, you could buy a put at a lower strike. It reduces your profitability, since you'll be spending part of the premium you got to acquire this protection. But it effectively limits the max you can lose. Eg if you buy the 270 put, you'll be paying around 0.62 (mid of 0.60 x 0.64 that I see here), but if AAPL tanks to, say, 250, you'll be forced to buy it for 277.5 (your short put) but you have the right to sell it for 270 (yourong put). The trade off is that now, on 10 contracts, the max profit you're looking at is 230 USD (850 USD from selling the 277.5 usd, 620 USD from buying the 270 put). **This is exactly a vertical spread.**\n\nAlternatively, you could short a bit of stock: this reduces the effect of the put increasing in value (this increasing your losses) as the stock price goes down: the profit on the short balances put some of the losses on the short put. People usually think about doing this kind of stuff when the delta of their short put gets too big and scary. Disadvantage is that if the stock moves up, you lose on the short stock position, and this loss can eventually even get bigger than the profits from shorting the put... so it has to be managed actively. **This is usually referred to as managing or hedging delta (and can be done in other ways, too, like reducing the size of the short put position, or selling OTM calls basically transforming it into a strangle, etc).**\n\nSo many possibilities...\n\nIf you want to explore more about this, check whether your trading platform has some good support for risk analysis for options. You didn't mention what it is, so I'm gonna comment on a few popular ones around here. \n\nToS has an OK tool in the Analyze tab: it works well for simple positions, it's pretty easy to use, but it simply cannot handle a more complex position with many legs without slowing down to the point where it becomes unresponsive for 10s of seconds.\n\nIB has absolutely amazing support for analyzing options portfolios in the Risk Navigator tool: it can handle whatever book of option you throw at it with fantastic performance, and IMO it has an incredibly superior model to ToS's, both in terms of its default settings as well as in terms of offering incredibly powerful ways to tweak it if you want (you probably don't, at least not initially).\n\nRobinhood has nothing. Well, it calculates your \"break even\" for single legs... But frankly, I wouldn't trust even that number without verifying it myself every time as RH is just... well, it's RH. \n\nTastyworks is something I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think this aspect would've changed much, since all I see is they trying to push a \"novel\" risk analysis approach: it sucks in this area. (it emphasizes too much this notion of \"probability of profit\", which is really absurd IMO as it isn't anywhere close to reflecting risk, especially in non-trivial positions). \n\nI'll share a couple of screenshot from IB later when I get to my competition so you can get a sense of what it looks like, and how you can explore ways to possibly protect yourself from big losses.",
