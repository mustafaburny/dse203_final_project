We should easily be able to hit $25 and have a run for $30+ (IMO either end of this week or beginning of the next week unless fed tapering screws us or GME ER takes the whole sector down)\n\n1-3 month chart: looks extremely bullish. Key resistances at $20.50 -$21.00 and $30. Strong support at $14, $17 -$18. Overall, bulls are in charge.

We are slowly breaking down the $21 wall that was created back in Jan-Feb. in past 3 days we have hit $20.50-$21.00 range over 4 times and bounced back. But you can tel that it\u2019s looking bullish because while we are bouncing back at the same ceiling price, the support price is steadily increasing.

Not by far.  \n\nPre-Dell SecureWorks, Damballa, and a little In-Q-Tel-funded shop in Northern Virginia were all applying machine-learning and AI to cybersecurity.  Roughly so by today's standards (especially in SecureWorks' case), but they were all doing it quite early. Damballa came out of Georgia Tech's ATDC incubator.  They had an interesting Chinese fellow that did machine-learning analysis of covert C&amp;C channels. \n\nI had a red Passport.  That thing had I-beams in the side of it.

If the interest rates from the Bank of Canada increase even to 1-2%, people\u2019s mortgage payments are going to skyrocket, because they bought a house during a pandemic when rates were predatory to save the economy.\n\nNow that things are getting back to normal, and Canada is leading the charge of vaccines, I see the bank of Canada raising interest rates sooner than later.\n\nIn fact there\u2019s an article here that talks about rates in the US, at least, increased by 2023.
