Tlry going to $24 today\n\nYo so this is my analysis of TLRY and why I think it\u2019s bullish: \n\n 1 year+ chart:\nJust apply the Fibonacci curve. We are way below 38% and got lots to run. We should easily be able to hit $25 and have a run for $30+ (IMO either end of this week or beginning of the next week unless fed tapering screws us or GME ER takes the whole sector down)\n\n1-3 month chart: looks extremely bullish. Key resistances at $20.50 -$21.00 and $30. Strong support at $14, $17 -$18. Overall, bulls are in charge. Growing 4% a day steadily past 2 weeks with maybe 1 Rex day. \n\n1 week chart: we\u2019ve been able to hold the $18 support and forming a new one around $19.90-20.10 range. We are slowly breaking down the $21 wall that was created back in Jan-Feb. in past 3 days we have hit $20.50-$21.00 range over 4 times and bounced back. But you can tel that it\u2019s looking bullish because while we are bouncing back at the same ceiling price, the support price is steadily increasing. This creates an ascending triangle and is a sign of a strong bull coming up",

        "body": "Yo so this is my analysis of TLRY and why I think it\u2019s bullish: \n\n 1 year+ chart:\nJust apply the Fibonacci curve. We are way below 38% and got lots to run. We should easily be able to hit $25 and have a run for $30+ (IMO either end of this week or beginning of the next week unless fed tapering screws us or GME ER takes the whole sector down)\n\n1-3 month chart: looks extremely bullish. Key resistances at $20.50 -$21.00 and $30. Strong support at $14, $17 -$18. Overall, bulls are in charge. Growing 4% a day steadily past 2 weeks with maybe 1 Rex day. \n\n1 week chart: we\u2019ve been able to hold the $18 support and forming a new one around $19.90-20.10 range. We are slowly breaking down the $21 wall that was created back in Jan-Feb. in past 3 days we have hit $20.50-$21.00 range over 4 times and bounced back. But you can tel that it\u2019s looking bullish because while we are bouncing back at the same ceiling price, the support price is steadily increasing. This creates an ascending triangle and is a sign of a strong bull coming up",
