He's sometimes called the UK Warren Buffett for his extremely successful fund company, Fundsmith. \n\nNot exclusively a tech guy, but in contrast to Buffett's \"value\" style, I think Smith would call himself a \"quality\" investor. He's massively beaten the market over the past 10 years with picks like Intuit, Paypal, Microsoft, etc.\n\nRecent book by Terry Smith \"Investing for Growth\" is very well worth a read- it's a collection of all his writings with Fundsmith's annual letters and various others.",

        "body": "Hi.  Wow.  You've put a tremendous amount of work into all of this, and it's incredible of you to share.  I take a similar approach.  I use Morningstar reports (a popular analysts which you can access for free on Charles Schwab) to see if a business is good and favorably valued.  Morningstar focuses on qualitative analysis and also makes judgements about whether a business has a moat (no moat, narrow moat, wide moat).  So, my strategy is I look on Morningstar to see which companies have a wide moat.  Then I take notice on how a wider array of analysts including Morningstar values the current stock price.  All of this gives me some assurance that the company is long lasting and defensible, and it's a fair price.  Then I see which of these Wide Moat stocks are also in Ark Invest funds.  This tells me if the stock is also offensive.  I figure why not buy a business that Morningstar thinks is defensive and what Ark Invest thinks is offensive (growth).  There's actually a lot of companies that fall in this category.  They've included Google, Salesforce, Amazon, Adobe, Intuit, Ansyss, Roche, Novartis, Charles Schwab, Mercado Libre, Caterpillar, and probably a few others that I can't recall at the moment.  My last filter is that I do not buy companies that have a high debt to equity ratio.  I'm concerned about a future looming big debt crisis.  Anyways, I hope that helps you as well.",

Because it's so industrially useful, major funds (namely SLV) have been lending out their reserves and not getting them back. This is why they only serve physical delivery requests to large holders. And why they reserve the right to compensate any holders with cash.\n3. For the explicit reason of creating a contrast, Sprott Physical Silver $PSLV keeps strict control over every bar they sell. They take possession for every contract they write, and just don't lend out.\n\nSo, the plot is to cause a rise ACROSS the whole market, with emphasis on PSLV, cause requests for COMEX to skyrocket. When the reserve depletes, the squeeze begins.\nTelling note: PSLV is conspicuously absent from casual investment platforms.\n\nOr something. I'm bipolar, not autistic.

        "body": "&gt;How can they possibly diversify into safer stocks when they've tasted double or triple digit gains in a short period?\n\nI think that unfortunately, there's this perception surrounding double digit returns and how difficult it is to achieve, when the reality is that double digit returns are something that can be accomplished by owning a variety of securities. You don't even need to look that hard for those kinds of returns. Home Depot, Microsoft and Costco have done 10%+ per year 21/30 times during the past 30 years. UnitedHealth has done it 24/30 times. Nike has done it 22 times. Intuit has done it 19/26 times (since '94). All of the companies that I've listed have had years where they hit 75% or more, so while it is rare, it is not something that has never been done before. The entire list (above) has a running CAGR between 15-24% over a 3 decade period. Does that mean they'll always perform that well? Of course not, but I would argue that there's a high-probability that they'll do it again in the future.\n\nThe only thing that's changed is that we're seeing a lot more people giving recommendations and advice online. We're also seeing a bunch of new people come into the market and they are trying their hands at leveraged instruments like options. \n\nThe whole idea of \"safer\" stocks is kind of a misnomer though. Stocks inherently are not safe. You can find lower volatility items (like some of those listed above), but I wouldn't define them as a bastion of safety. The whole idea that a 3-fund portfolio comes with some sort of safety net vs a basket of stocks simply isn't true. I get that the 3-fund portfolio has been marketed so well that many people will only invest in it. If that's how they feel, then that's fine too. Like, it's not a bad option at all for someone completely new to the market, and it will probably prevent people from making mistakes like running an entire portfolio of penny stocks.\n\nI've linked this [portfolio](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=INTU&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=WM&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=MSFT&amp;allocation3_1=34) before, it's a 3 company blend of WM, INTU and MSFT. It's returns have surpassed the SPY for 27 years (including the past couple of years that I've been linking it on Reddit, so this isn't something \"new\", though you'd have to go through my post history to see it).\n\nI think as people get into 6-7 figures with their accounts, it becomes less important to get a 100%+ return, and more important to reduce the variance on a year-to-year basis with your portfolio. 20% of $300k is a $60k return in a year, which is great and absolutely attainable without taking on excess risk to get that return.",

        "body": "Sharing my reply from the original thread since the article leaves a lot of relevant info on how these platforms work:\n\nI work in FinTech (but not for Plaid or a direct competitor) and am happy to field some questions. Plaid and other aggregators aren't a new thing and frankly have been key to the emergence of nearly all personal finance platforms that use your bank account information.\n\nPlaid, MX, Finicity, Yodly, Intuit, etc help:\n\n* Authenticate user bank accounts\n* Maintain account security (the bank or company using your info does not receive any sensitive info, just an access Token that can be shut off)\n* Perform live balance checks\n* Pass transaction logs\n* Facilitate certain types of transactions\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list but are the most common cases. An account and routing number is not able to provide most of these functions\n\nSo why do these platforms exist?\n\nBanks have done their best to keep the financial system \"closed\". This is good for security but means that you can't easily share your financial information in real-time. This is good for banks because it lets them control that access by selling your information and limiting competition. Platforms like Plaid have introduced \"open\" banking, which lets you share your information securely with any app or website that passes their standards. The apps benefit by not having to build a system with as high of security or deal with compliance. You, the consumer, benefit by having access to more options.\n\nExamples of \"Open\" banking that use these or similar platforms: Banking- Chime, Varo, Empower Savings- Digit, Stash, Acorns Credit- Line, Self, Brex Investing- Wealthfront, Betterment, Robinhood Payments- Venmo, Stripe Lending- SoFi, FloatMe, Dave Budgeting: Mint, Personal Capital, You Need A Budget (YNAB)\n\nAll of these could not exist without a more open banking system. Banks are fighting back by taking various actions to try and make consumers wary of these platforms. They do this by finding ways to try and block their functionality (many have given up and now work with them by providing an API so they directly integrate- PNC is a notable holdout and does not work with many apps), lawsuits challenging the regulatory carve-out which allows this, and pushing misinformation. These app/websites love platforms like Plaid because it lets them launch faster, cheaper, and not worry about compliance or as much security.\n\nSo how do these platforms work?\n\nInstead of providing sensitive information like your account number to a 3rd party app (this is a horrible idea), you provide access a secure \"tunnel\" that the app can't see into. Plaid does this via their API and informs the user that you are using Plaid (this is the first page). Plaid receives login credentials from the user and then creates a secure link to the bank account using either an API (preferred) provided by the bank or via a login system they built. The app does not receive any sensitive info- just an access \"token\" like when you sign into an account using Facebook or when pay a merchant via PayPal so they don't see your card number.\n\nYou can see what accounts you're using Plaid with (and unlink them) at [https://my.plaid.com/](https://my.plaid.com/)\n\nAs a general rule: assume everyone is using your data if you provide it. This isn't nefarious, this is the reality of the internet. Plaid makes money partly through this (as do banks) and through subscription fees from the companies that use them. \\[I believe Plaid anonymizes the data, so it is not personally identifiable but haven't verified this\\]\n\nI hope this helps demystify this topic a bit and make it a little less alarming. I saw a LOT of misleading information that overlooked why these platforms are beneficial to consumers.\n\nHappy to talk more on the topic of FinTech in general- I've worked in the space for several years and have an abundance of experience with startups &amp; tech generally.\n\nEdit: From the Privacy Policy \"We may collect, use, and share End User Information in an aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized manner (that does not identify you personally) for any purpose permitted under applicable law.
