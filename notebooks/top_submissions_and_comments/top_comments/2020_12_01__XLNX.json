There are many reasons:\n\n* XLNX is the market leader in FPGA's, which will be more important as we are approaching limits of silicon shrinks and clock speed.\n* The paradigm of the data center will change: CXL approaching. There will be an increased need for SmartNICs and custom accelerators as CPU's are not as efficient for handling workloads\n* XLNX packaging technology developed with TSMC allows for more complex interconnects between dies as Multi-Chip-Modules are used to improve yield/binning\n* Victor Peng, CEO of XLNX used to work for AMD\n* The entire board of XLNX and AMD unanimously approved the acquisition\n* XLNX FPGA's are now implemented into AMD's ROCm stack",

In addition, some of the better known ETFs out there are focused on AI coupled with robotics (e.g. ARKQ, BOTZ, IRBO, etc.).  I think that focus misses the mark because the future growth of AI is in helping to automate white collar jobs, IMO.  I don't think there's a great answer.\n\nTesla is the darling of the AI crowd right now. I get AI exposure via funds that are invested in the biggest players, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, as well as the manufacturers of deep learning chips; Xilinx, AMD, Qualcomm, NVidia and Intel.",

I'm only saying that because I don't want to have a hand in you losing money. I don't believe that and think XLNX pre-merger should easily pass 160, but it needed to be said. Either way good luck!",

Salesforce purchased Tableau (it had a homegrown BI tool before that)? HP bought Compaq, AMD and Xilinx, AOL and Time Warner? It seems very common for companies in all industries to buy potential rivals while they are small.\n\nSo it's not a monopoly, and it's not engaging in egregious anti-competitive practices out of the norm, but they violated a FTC order is what I'm getting out of this. That sounds like they should be paying a lot more in fines, but it doesn't make sense for the FTC to attempt to break up FAcebook, soon to turn their sights on Amazon and Google",

Quite a lot of hype around reddit is thrown around all-EV companies, e.g. NIO, XPENG, Workhorse, also EV charging infrastructure companies like Chargepoint, battery makers as QuantumScape, with the thesis being they will be the big winners with EV adoption as they are purely focused on EVs. If you invest in ECAR you would not subscribe through your investment to that thesis and you would not find any of the companies mentioned above in ECAR holdings. What ECAR holdings consist of is quite a lot of legacy automakers as top holdings - KIA, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Hyundai, Ford, Renault, Volvo mixed together with very few big players in EV space as Tesla and BYD (which is also not all about EVs).  And also the holdings include quite a lot of component suppliers and IT companies which main line of business is not EV related and track semiconductor sector more however are weighted close to car manufacturer share of the ETF - Xilinx, Nvidia, Marvell technology etc. So what you would invest in is large current car manufacturers adapting to EV market and still remaining the top sellers and new EV companies not taking their share, along with the hope a lot of supplier/IT/semiconductor companies not mainly related to EVs would thrive along with EV market. Personally I don't believe it will track the EV market and its rise too well but it is an interesting mix of old car companies and tech stocks with some potential, lower risk then investing in pure EV companies but also with a much smaller chance of above-average returns in the long run.",

Now they will benefit from the recovery as well because of small businesses getting customers back thanks to the vaccine (assuming it works).\n\nAMD - first and foremost just look at Lisa Su\u2019s track record. Flawless execution everywhere she goes. Their chips are in Microsoft and Sony consoles as well as Amazon\u2019s cloud servers. Xilinx acquisition brings them to the data center market which they definitely needed. And you also can\u2019t forget that they likely have some ARM chips in development so that might be a nice surprise down the road. They need to break into the AI/ML space more and up their GPU game to really compete with NVDA. But it\u2019s safe to say they are winning in the CPU market atm. They are also used in crypto mining.\n\nNVDA - where do I even start lol. Again, great leadership. NVDA is one of the most consistent stocks on the market. Best GPUs that are used in a multitude of areas, but where NVDA really shines is in AI and ML. They are literally the driving force behind every breakthrough in these fields. If you haven\u2019t, watch the GTC conference and get your mind blown. And of course you have the ARM acquisition. They are the leader in data centers too. And you can\u2019t forget about what they are doing in the autonomous driving space as well as gaming.\n\nAll 3 have more room to run if you ask me.

        "body": "&gt; Their legacy x86 CISC instruction set is coming back to haunt them, making it hard to improve OoO performance.\n\nYou read too much ARM propaganda.\n\nx86 from both Intel and AMD are CISC frontend, RISC backend (called microcode) architectures for over decade now. This give best of both worlds - complex instructions gives good information on intent, thus allowing better OoO planning - the more you know upfront, the more you can optimize. In pure RISC environments, you can't assume as much about workload and and allowable instructions re-shuffle without additional hints generated by compilers (barriers etc.). And putting complexity in compilers instead of silicon is THE reason why Itanium failed, despite having many cool technologies inside.\n\nThat, coupled with already existing x86 ecosystems and installations means that x86 is here to stay, but will be extended by workload-specific instructions and modules.\n\n&gt; They don\u2019t have a business model that makes it easy to pursue heterogeneous computing and SoC designs.\n\nThat's not true. Both are producing SoCs that include CPU, GPU, NIC, memory controllers and FPGA (Intel only) in single silicon unit, so this is definitely not new for them. But I do agree that Intel has it harder - their monolith approach means 3-5 years idea-to-silicon lead team, while AMD can just create new chiplet unit and attach it to Infinity Fabric. AMD will take lead here, and after buying Xilinx, they will accelerate that.",
