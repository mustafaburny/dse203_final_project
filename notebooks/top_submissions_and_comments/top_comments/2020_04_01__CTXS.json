Personally, I have experience with many of these videoconferencing systems and I would rate the ones I\u2019ve used from beat to worst as follows: Skype (best UI IMHO), Bluejeans, Citrix, Zoom, Teams, Slack, Google Hangouts. Not that any of that really matters...bottom line is I think that Teams will get market share because it\u2019s included in a bundle that every business has.

However, I do believe that CSOD will see better in growth in this arena than others (not necessarily Citrix, whatabeast, long after earnings again). \n\nI do agree this is a short term play, I am intending on jumping out when my risk tolerance hits. Hopefully this play is smart and makes a fair percentage, and I believe it will. It's nice to catch a stock before it's bull-run and I really think this has potential to do that. I am likely going to split my investment into stocks (2.5k) and slowly ease into more calls (5k total, 1.5k now) if the trend is correct. For what it is worth, this following research has given me more belief that a solid recovery is about to occur.\n\n&gt; Saba acquisition has provided additional insights on improving operational efficiency, which is driving further operating margin improvement. \n\n&gt; Saba acqusition will not be a full tax-payer until 2023\n\n&gt; They believe that the Saba acquisition will cause their standalone unlevered free cash flow to be meaningfully higher than current estimations ($150M)\n\n&gt; AWS credits that were modeled as expenses\n\n&gt; Certain 2019 Capital expenditures will not be present in 2020\n\n&gt; \"And we did see some signs of good momentum going into 2020 for Japan. But I'd say APJ was mixed because of Japan's performance.\"\n\n&gt; \"we do have a plan to hit the rule of 40 in 2020 on a standalone basis and we expect to significantly exceed our original cash flow target, which was $150 million. If you recall a couple of years ago, we laid that out we expect to be meaningfully above that\"\n\n&gt; Literally they hired, AlixPartners, a world-class consulting firm with particular expertise in performance improvement and cost optimization.\n\n&gt; its Q1 subscription revenue guidance calls for 10.5% y/y growth, which means that Cornerstone is planning for roughly 30% margins in 2020 (was 10% or something)\n\n&gt; most of Cornerstone's annual revenue is already locked in\n\n&gt; consolidated 2019 results suggest Saba will net roughly $250 million in annual subscription revenue for the company. Saba is also expected to \"substantially increase unlevered free cash flow\".\n\n&gt; Saba will at least increase market share in their respective markets.\n\nWell I at least should be critical, and these are some concerns:\n\n&gt; They are taking on a huge $985 million term loan to finance the deal.\n\n&gt;layoffs that are happening across the U.S. will lower Cornerstone's billings, which could lead to a lower subscription rate given their pricing schema\n\nHowever, I really believe that investors will take note when they see the free-cash flow they are generating, their improved operational margins combined with an un-modeled acquisition that represents 33% of their current revenue.\n\nMy prediction until earnings is this: $CSOD will retest $32.50 sometime by May 1. I think it lingers around $31.50-$32.50 until just before earnings where it breaks to the upside at $33.50. If earnings are a hit, maybe we see upward of $35-$37.",

        "body": "Disclaimer: I work in cyber security, have worked for cyber security companies you\u2019d find in cyber ETFs, and have been doing security forever. Currently work for a security startup, so take my advice with a grain of salt.\n\nI would stay away from the ETFs right now. I don\u2019t think they provide a lot of value over something more generic, and I believe there will be a contraction in cyber security. Winners will win but overall it\u2019ll drop.\n\nA few reasons why: \n\nPre covid19- big vendors like Microsoft and AWS were already doing great adding security tooling to their enterprise IT offerings.\n\nTraditional AV... what consumer would buy that in a world of smartphones, tablets, and PCs that come with Defender?\n\nNetwork security gear is threatened by cloud vendors.\n\nMany security tools aren\u2019t made for modern development and IT management practices. A lot of old crap was made in the days where security teams could and would just say \u201cno you can\u2019t do that\u201d.\n\nA lot of old companies in cyber ETF fit that bill.\n\n**During** covid-19, I think a lot of companies will spend on remote work (Citrix, VPNs, Zoom, cloud services) - some of which actually benefits traditional security vendors.\n\n**Post** covid-19, I think many will try to have a GOOD remote work environment, and favor cloud based solutions, zero-trust setups with reverse proxies instead of VPNs, etc. Cisco did a good job buying Duo there, it bridges their gap between old and new. ZScaler has a huge valuation because it fit the description for that kind of modern tool to investors.\n\nThe next year will be interesting. I expect more consolidations l, acquisitions, and tamer VC funding and hopefully valuations that are more logical.\n\nTL;DR I wouldn\u2019t touch ETFs because I don\u2019t much of a lot of companies in them but there\u2019s going to be some change that\u2019ll open up the market to those innovating for real (few of which are publicly traded - but there\u2019s some).",

What you're mad about is the market artificially not reflecting this because of trillions of dollars you get to pay off for the next few decades.\n\nThis guy gets it. Also, recessions are NECESSARY for a healthy market. JPow could very well go\\* down as the worst Fed Chair is history (no easy feat, many of them have failed). We aren't bearish b/c we want to see carnage, but it is downright fucked up how strong the market is with all the credit bubbles at play, severe inflation potentially just around the corner (that all you GenZennial fucks know nothing about), 30m in joblessness is leading to discretionary spending being way down, \\~1/3 of the country didn't pay car payments, rent or mortgages for April, anxiety &amp; fear will forever alter travel/mass gatherings for a chunk of society.. BUT HERE THE BULLS ARE ACTING LIKE THE NICE 2 MONTH VACA DIDN'T JUST DESTROY THE WORLD'S ECONOMY. Get a grip. I've been traveling non-stop during the pandemic and can tell you for certain everything is NOT GOING TO BE OKAY and I'd argue all the shit the Fed and DPump did to stop the bleeding only fucked us all for the next 3+ years.\n\nFor the record, my additions to my portfolio 6 (!!) weeks ago included Amazon, Netflix, Match, Costco, Peloton, Zoom, Activision Blizzard, Clorox, Campbell's, 3M, Citrix.. but I'm STILL DOWN on the year b/c options have been all over the map.",

        "body": "So first I've been investing virtually. Couple of months, not active. I also read many articles, some books and YouTube (i'll come to this later). \n\nThan I bought some ETF' and still was virtually trading. Once I got the feeling and experience I needed I started to invest and convert from ETF to stocks. \n\nIt was all OK, I was doing ok. Had like 5-6 stock's, gaining some one digit greens. \n\nAnd then I went full retard mode. I watched some daytrading YouTubers, I almost felt the thousand of dollars waiting for me to pick them up. I thought I know some tech analysis strategies, I thought I can time the market and I thought speculating is the way to go. \n\nIt wasn't. I lost 30%. Sort of depressing. I withdrew my money and waited until the feeling I need to get this back quickly is gone. \n\nWithout being emotional I went back to the market and started my initial process. And stayed there. And making money again. Not much, but making it. \n\nThe thing is once you have a strategy and even if it does work out in some cases- you can make a root cause analysis. And see what was wrong. When you gamble - there is no process behind this. Noting to review. You can't review bad luck... \n\nMy portoflio now looks as follows:\n\nLow risk: MSFT /JNJ / PHG\nMid risk: Netflix / Roku / Citrix / SAP / 3M / Biogen\nHigh risk: Tesla / Inseego\n\nI'm not very active, but also I cut loses quickly not wishing for a recovery. Sometimes good choice , sometimes bad. I stopped thinking though about the money I have not gained, I'm rather happy about the money I haven't possibly lost. \n\nAs you see with my portofilio im picking rather safe stocks, even if they are in my mid risk strategy part - they aren't really so risky.",

Its a very rare thing on WSB\n\nI dont totally agree with the prediction of last Friday being the high, but we are nearing a correction. \n\nI think we will ride next week on the hopes of re-opening economy (which will fail - ill come to this pater) and we have some major ER coming in next two weeks. \n\nI think the market will still react more to general than economical data, but we see the conversion already. \n\nThe re-opening economy expectations are very high and this wont work out as people think. Its not a light switch. First bankruptcies after this event and people start realizing there is no magic. \n\nThere is still ink in FED printers also. \n\nI also think it won't be a rollercoaster downsides now, but rather a slower, but longer and heavier downfall. \n\nTL;DR - not a week to buy calls or puts. Maybe a moment to buy some stocks for really short term gains. And if you owe some - consider selling if the downtrend  begins. \n\nAlso for a solid downfall we'd need a couple of days VIX being over 60 in my opinion. \n\nIm sitting on 12 stocks now and i might slowly move to cash gang and wait for the downfall.

Growth has been trailing for all of these companies, except for one: Citrix.\n\nMy favorite out of all of them, including Cornerstone, has to be Citrix. Unfortunately, that Citrix ship has sailed. It had a damn check mark recovery! Citrix seems like a safe bet to go long, but this LMS industry seems like a short term play for me. \n\nI'd stick with CSDO for the earnings play with a small position of $32.5 5/15 calls. I would prefer going out to June, but there is no volume.\n\nI think I'll wait and see how Citrix behaves to decide if I want to jump in long term.",

This could be a run-up play, or it could continue going up past earnings. $CSOD is barely above its lows from the crash and is in a pretty good position to start its bull run. I think one of the biggest things investors are looking for in $CSOD is free cash flow, and according to the CEO:\n\n&gt; we now believe our standalone unlevered free cash flow will be meaningfully higher than that.\n\nI even think this \"meaningfully higher\" comment, is even higher. This quote comes from before March where we learned that their activity stats are through the roof. Their subscriptions have likely gone up, which means their free cash flow has probably grown significantly. This signals to investors a place to safely park investments.",
