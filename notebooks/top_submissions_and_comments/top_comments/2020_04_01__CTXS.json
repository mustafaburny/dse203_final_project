We\u2019ve since pivoted to Teams, because we didn\u2019t want to pay for Slack\u2019s premium version and Teams was included in our Microsoft bundle. Personally, I have experience with many of these videoconferencing systems and I would rate the ones I\u2019ve used from beat to worst as follows: Skype (best UI IMHO), Bluejeans, Citrix, Zoom, Teams, Slack, Google Hangouts. Not that any of that really matters...bottom line is I think that Teams will get market share because it\u2019s included in a bundle that every business has. Shorting Zoom is a no-brainer, just need to go 9-12 mos out.",

However, I do believe that CSOD will see better in growth in this arena than others (not necessarily Citrix, whatabeast, long after earnings again). \n\nI do agree this is a short term play, I am intending on jumping out when my risk tolerance hits. Hopefully this play is smart and makes a fair percentage, and I believe it will. It's nice to catch a stock before it's bull-run and I really think this has potential to do that. I am likely going to split my investment into stocks (2.5k) and slowly ease into more calls (5k total, 1.5k now) if the trend is correct. For what it is worth, this following research has given me more belief that a solid recovery is about to occur.\n\n&gt; Saba acquisition has provided additional insights on improving operational efficiency, which is driving further operating margin improvement. \n\n&gt; Saba acqusition will not be a full tax-payer until 2023\n\n&gt; They believe that the Saba acquisition will cause their standalone unlevered free cash flow to be meaningfully higher than current estimations ($150M)\n\n&gt; AWS credits that were modeled as expenses\n\n&gt; Certain 2019 Capital expenditures will not be present in 2020\n\n&gt; \"And we did see some signs of good momentum going into 2020 for Japan. But I'd say APJ was mixed because of Japan's performance.\"\n\n&gt; \"we do have a plan to hit the rule of 40 in 2020 on a standalone basis and we expect to significantly exceed our original cash flow target, which was $150 million. If you recall a couple of years ago, we laid that out we expect to be meaningfully above that\"\n\n&gt; Literally they hired, AlixPartners, a world-class consulting firm with particular expertise in performance improvement and cost optimization.\n\n&gt; its Q1 subscription revenue guidance calls for 10.5% y/y growth, which means that Cornerstone is planning for roughly 30% margins in 2020 (was 10% or something)\n\n&gt; most of Cornerstone's annual revenue is already locked in\n\n&gt; consolidated 2019 results suggest Saba will net roughly $250 million in annual subscription revenue for the company. Saba is also expected to \"substantially increase unlevered free cash flow\".\n\n&gt; Saba will at least increase market share in their respective markets.\n\nWell I at least should be critical, and these are some concerns:\n\n&gt; They are taking on a huge $985 million term loan to finance the deal.\n\n&gt;layoffs that are happening across the U.S. will lower Cornerstone's billings, which could lead to a lower subscription rate given their pricing schema\n\nHowever, I really believe that investors will take note when they see the free-cash flow they are generating, their improved operational margins combined with an un-modeled acquisition that represents 33% of their current revenue.\n\nMy prediction until earnings is this: $CSOD will retest $32.50 sometime by May 1. I think it lingers around $31.50-$32.50 until just before earnings where it breaks to the upside at $33.50. If earnings are a hit, maybe we see upward of $35-$37.",

Its a very rare thing on WSB\n\nI dont totally agree with the prediction of last Friday being the high, but we are nearing a correction. \n\nI think we will ride next week on the hopes of re-opening economy (which will fail - ill come to this pater) and we have some major ER coming in next two weeks. \n\nI think the market will still react more to general than economical data, but we see the conversion already. \n\nThe re-opening economy expectations are very high and this wont work out as people think. Its not a light switch. First bankruptcies after this event and people start realizing there is no magic. \n\nThere is still ink in FED printers also. \n\nI also think it won't be a rollercoaster downsides now, but rather a slower, but longer and heavier downfall. \n\nTL;DR - not a week to buy calls or puts. Maybe a moment to buy some stocks for really short term gains. And if you owe some - consider selling if the downtrend  begins. \n\nAlso for a solid downfall we'd need a couple of days VIX being over 60 in my opinion. \n\nIm sitting on 12 stocks now and i might slowly move to cash gang and wait for the downfall.

I think we will some corrections soon there. \n\nNetflix is one of the stocks I think its gonna be corrected, but not before ER. I'm actually holding Netflix stock and ready to sell as soon as its starts getting corrected. \n\nOracle- yeah pretty safe. If you plan to buy this week for short term - go with Citrix. They are having ER this week. Should rise even if it doesn't beat expectations as the outlook looks good. \n\nIdk about IBM. Haven't analysed them recently as since 2016 they were on a decline. They might be back on corona, but didn't hear anything great from them recently. Deeper analysis recommended.",

This could be a run-up play, or it could continue going up past earnings. $CSOD is barely above its lows from the crash and is in a pretty good position to start its bull run. I think one of the biggest things investors are looking for in $CSOD is free cash flow, and according to the CEO:\n\n&gt; we now believe our standalone unlevered free cash flow will be meaningfully higher than that.\n\nI even think this \"meaningfully higher\" comment, is even higher. This quote comes from before March where we learned that their activity stats are through the roof. Their subscriptions have likely gone up, which means their free cash flow has probably grown significantly. This signals to investors a place to safely park investments.",
