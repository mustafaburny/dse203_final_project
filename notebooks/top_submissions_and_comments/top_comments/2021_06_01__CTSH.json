If you do any broad based index fund investing then you are undoubtedly invested in tobacco and alcohol companies.  Tobacco is linked to the 5 leading causes of death in America (likely same in Canada).  Alcohol is related to 50% of all fatal car accidents in America (likely same in Canada).  If you wear sneakers or any type of clothing you would be surprised what type of at best adult and at worst child sweat shops they are made from in third-third world companies. If you like green energy you would be surprised at how much oil is needed to make green energy products.\n\nTrust me NO ONE really can stand on a pedestal in this day in age.  Just matters what you accept and what you choose to not be cognizant of in your daily life.  Running a google search itself consumes energy (carbon footprint).  I doubt you are outside planting trees to make up for it.    \n\nBTW, sticking to this discussion.  How many water wells has Disney (part owner) and Nat Geo dug or paid for in Namibia vs. RECAF?  RECAF cares about making money, but as far as I know they have done more for the Namibian people then Nat Geo does/has despite the latter making millions of their story to sell articles. \n\nThe problem with the green folks is they are ALWAYS hypocritical.  How did those journalist get to Namibia to do the article?  They flew.  Did they plant trees or pay for conversion of methane gases in landfills to make their flights carbon neutral?  Nope.  \n\nJust keep in mind the old adage if you point one finger at someone there are 3 pointing right back at you.",

Is there any variable that I should be cognizant of in order to avoid my broker selling my position?\r\n\nNo, your broker won't close your position unless there is a \\[potential\\] margin violation. With a long butterfly, you paid for the butterfly in full when you opened it. Broker won't close it early. They might close it a few hours before it expires, because there is a potential margin violation if you were assigned on some legs but not others, and you don't have enough excess margin to cover being short 200 shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;the market, but I was wondering if there is any chance, that anybody (or market) would want to exercise that Call that I sold (when the call goes to profit) before expiry so that it makes me cover the position? Or I can keep the butterfly as is, until the expiry date with no concern of market volatility and changes?\n\nThere is a missing sentence in the beginning here, but in general, options can be exercised at any time before and up to expiration. However, exercising them throws away extrinsic value. and gifts that to the seller (you) so there is very little reason to. You might get assigned early if you're lucky.\n\nThere are some rare cases when your short calls are at risk of early assignment, if your short calls are deep ITM include the day before ex-div, or if there is a large HTB fees. Also if your calls are deep ITM that they have little extrinsic value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;3- Can I sell the whole butterfly at anytime in time, if I find it profitable?\r  \n\r\n\nIf someone buys it from you, yes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;4- When I place my butterfly order (all in 1 order), is it possible that one of these positions wouldn't be filled at the time (due to pricing or technicality), and that put me at risk for the calls that I sold? Is there any way to avoid order submission if the broker cannot fill it altogether?\r  \n\r\n\nNo. If you send your order ticket as four legs, you get filled for all four legs at your limit or better, or you don't get filled at all. There is no in between.",

        "body": "&gt;Paysafe is a fintech company with tons of promise, especially if you believe in the future of iGaming\n\nNot quite. Paysafe is a merchant services provider. The industry often mistaken for Fintech, but in reality it's more of a commodity banking product (electronic payment processing) driven by price. Paysafe's direct competitors include companies like FIS/Worldpay, FISERV, and Global Payments (the big 3). 15 years of race to the bottom have severally compressed profit margins and increased attrition YOY. This is why you're seeing so much M&amp;A in the space. Once iGaming is legalized, Paysafe will be competing for this business against the Big 3. They'll surely win some accounts, but chances are the Big 3 will dominate the space because they can offer better pricing and technology. \n\n\n\n&gt;Paysafe stock fell 13% after an underwhelming Q1 earnings report driven by an EPS miss of $0.02, only a 5% growth in revenue, and a loss of nearly $50M\n\nThat loss is substantial. And it's due to the fact that they board \"high risk\" merchant accounts\". Think of them as a subprime lender.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s clear that the company is currently being bogged down by their latest conservative growth numbers so for this stock to break out, it will need a catalyst. That catalyst will be the legalization of online gambling that will almost certainly sweep through the U.S. Paysafe is currently live in 15 states leaving 35 more states to go. With the promise of those sweet sweet tax dollars, I believe most states will eventually cave in and Paysafe will be there to offer them the picks and shovels required to make it a reality\n\nThis won't be the boon you're thinking because once it's legal, all of their competitors will be boarding these types of accounts and have pockets deep enough to \"buy the market\" with low processing rates, rates that Paysafe can't afford to match.",
