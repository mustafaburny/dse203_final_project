If you do any broad based index fund investing then you are undoubtedly invested in tobacco and alcohol companies.  Tobacco is linked to the 5 leading causes of death in America (likely same in Canada).  Alcohol is related to 50% of all fatal car accidents in America (likely same in Canada).  If you wear sneakers or any type of clothing you would be surprised what type of at best adult and at worst child sweat shops they are made from in third-third world companies. If you like green energy you would be surprised at how much oil is needed to make green energy products.\n\nTrust me NO ONE really can stand on a pedestal in this day in age.  Just matters what you accept and what you choose to not be cognizant of in your daily life.  Running a google search itself consumes energy (carbon footprint).  I doubt you are outside planting trees to make up for it.    \n\nBTW, sticking to this discussion.  How many water wells has Disney (part owner) and Nat Geo dug or paid for in Namibia vs. RECAF?  RECAF cares about making money, but as far as I know they have done more for the Namibian people then Nat Geo does/has despite the latter making millions of their story to sell articles. \n\nThe problem with the green folks is they are ALWAYS hypocritical.  How did those journalist get to Namibia to do the article?  They flew.  Did they plant trees or pay for conversion of methane gases in landfills to make their flights carbon neutral?  Nope.  \n\nJust keep in mind the old adage if you point one finger at someone there are 3 pointing right back at you.",

Having a development machine that runs arm natively and which is already popular with developers is probably a bigger step than most people are cognizant of. It\u2019s hardly a home run at this point but it reminds me that they are still making big Silicon Valley style plays and thinking big picture.",
