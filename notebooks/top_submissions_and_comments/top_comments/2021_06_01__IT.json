Not only does it give extra time, but it helped people remember to relax. Fairly certain the prof (yes I know that references a different Mendoza professor than here), also did some research to determine the mental break with the disturbance actually helped students as they could refocus around the time minds would tire. He also did this in his lectures by creating random interruptions like tossing out candy bars at the 40 minute mark because humans aren\u2019t meant to sit still for that long without doing something else.",

To clarify: **the professor paid us to do this.** My roommate (the banana) and I were former students of his, who also had this happen during the exam. The University only gives two hours to take a midterm exam, which the prof felt was too short and didn't let his students adequately take it. He came up with a manufactured disturbance years ago and has been doing it annually ever since.\n\nBy creating a small disturbance that doesn't even last a minute just a few minutes after the exam begins, he can excuse giving extra time, and the administration allows it. The students surveyed afterwards have a majority approval of that since time is a goddamn **premium** on these tests and that extra hour is a godsend.",

        "body": "OK it's really pretty easy. Imagine you want to buy a house that is worth $100,000. You put down a down-payment of 5%, or $5000.\n\nNow let's say a month later you've done the appraisal and all the paperwork is ready and it's time to buy. But during that month something indirectly happened that affected the value of the house. \n\nMaybe Disney announced they were building a new park nearby and the value of the house doubled.\nMaybe the city announced they were building a sewage plant nearby and the value of the house plummeted.\n\nEither way, you've already got an option to buy the house at the $100,000 agreed on a month ago regardless of what the price is today. Notice I said option. You don't actually have to.\n\nIn the 1st example where the value went up, you can buy the house for $100,000 even though it's worth $200,000, instantly pocketing $100,000 profit in equity. Maybe Beyonce buys the house across the street and the house you wanted goes up to $5 million *in value*. The *cost* remains the same to you. You still get to buy it for $100,000. In theory the price of the house could skyrocket to any amount and you'd still only have to pay $100,000 since you secured that price when you put down the down payment. The possibilities for profit are endless, the sky is the limit. \n\nIn the 2nd example where the price went down and they're building a sewage plant nearby, you decide you don't want the house anymore. You're not required to buy it, but you forfeit your down payment and lose $5000. No matter how much the value of the house has dropped, you can't possibly lose more than your $5000 down payment. \n\nSo while the possible profits are infinite, the possible losses are capped at your initial down payment. \n\nLet's use that extreme example; Beyonce moves in next door and the house is worth $5 million now. You decide you just want the cash, you don't even care about the house. You want to pocket the money and you can go buy a different house. You sell the option to buy the house at $100,000 to someone else for say $4.6 Million. Not quite the full $5 million because they still have to buy the house, there's a lot of paperwork, etc. You never even owned the house, all you ever owned was the option to buy the house, but you sold that option to someone else and made a huge profit because you were smart (or lucky) and secured that option when the price was low.\n\nThis is almost exactly what call options are, with the most significant difference being that your 'down payment' is not applied to the cost of the stock if you choose to buy it. Instead it's paid like a fee for the privilege of buying the option. Otherwise it's pretty much the same. You buy an option today to lock in the price (called a strike price) to buy the stock next week, next month, or whenever you choose. If you locked in a price lower than the stock is actually worth you can either buy the stock at that lower price, or sell your option and let someone else buy the stock at that strike price. If the stock goes down below the strike price, you don't have the buy the stock, you just lose your deposit. So the profit potential is limitless, but your potential loss is capped at your deposit fee.\n\nSo let's look at a call option example using simple numbers.\n\nToday's AMC price is $50. You think it will go up to $100 by next Friday. With a traditional long sale you just buy the stock at today's price and hope it goes up. If it's $100 next Friday you've made $50. If it's $200 you've made $150. If it's $10 you've lost $40. This is how you currently buy stock. The problem is your potential earnings is limited to how many shares you can afford to actually buy, and your potential loss is... well you could lose everything if the business goes bankrupt.\n\nThis is the beauty of call options. Options are pretty cheap, and you don't have to actually buy the shares. I can buy an option to buy 100 shares for a deposit fee of anywhere between maybe $1 to $15. Even though I don't have enough money to buy 100 shares, I do have enough money to pay for an option, knowing I have no intention of actually buying the stock. Instead, if the price of the stock moves up above what I guessed it would and what I have the option of paying (the strike price), I can sell the option to someone else who can afford to buy the stock. They're happy to buy it because they're getting the stock at less than market price, and I'm happy to make money selling the option. If my prediction was wrong, I'm not on the hook for buying the shares, I just forfeit my deposit.... times 100. Wait what? Times 100?! Yes but wait it's not as bad as it sounds. 1 option allows you to buy up to 100 shares, however you pay the deposit on each share if you buy the stock, and you forfeit the deposit on each share if you don't. It's not that bad though if you consider you could be buying stock at way below market value. \n\nSo let's look at the example above again. If AMC is $50 today, and I think it will be $100 next Friday. I don't have enough money to buy many shares but I do have enough money to buy an option to buy the stock for $50 per share (the strike price) any time until the end of the day next Friday, that option only costs me a $10 deposit fee. That's all I need to put down today. Now if I'm right, and the price hits $100 next Friday, I could buy up to 100 shares for $50 each plus that $10 deposit on each share for a total of $60 per share. That $10 deposit seems steep times 100 but remember the stock is worth $100 so if I do exercise my option to buy all 100 shares I've made a $40 profit on each one.\n\n$50 strike price +$10 deposit fee X 100 = $6000 cost to buy 100 shares\nValue $100 per share X 100 = $10,000\nProfit $4,000\n\nWell why not just buy the 100 shares today for $50 each? You could, let's consider that.\n\n$50 X 100 = $5000\nValue $100 per share X 100 = $10,000\nProfit $5,000\n\nAt first glance it seems like it simply makes more sense to just buy the stock and not bother with the call options at all. In this particular case with these particular numbers that would have been the smarter choice. But what if the value didn't go to $100? Let's look at some other scenarios.\n\nFirst let's simply say you don't have $500 today to buy the 100 shares but you are expecting to have money next Friday. Well you could buy the shares next Friday but by then they're up to $100 each remember? You can only afford 50 shares instead of $100 and you have $0 profit. In this case where you don't have money right now, buying a call option today to lock in the price for next Friday would have been your better choice since you'd have 100 shares and $4000 profit instead of 50 shares and $0 profit.\n\nWhat if you don't have $5000 to buy in today and you won't have $5000 by next Friday? Well remember you don't actually have to buy the stock. You can sell the option to someone else and let them buy it. You can buy an option today for just $10 and sell it before the end of the day next Friday for a profit as long as the share price hasn't dropped below the strike price + deposit fee. If it goes to $100 you'll be able to sell for somewhere around $2000. You don't get the full $10,000 of course because the guy you sell the option to still has to actually buy the stock himself. But still you can make a ton by selling your option as long as it's still at a profit (in the money). Worst case scenario it drops below the strike price you locked in and you are required to forfeit the deposit times 100 for a total loss of $1000. But that's the maximum you could lose, even if the stock drops to zero you're not required to buy it, you can't lose more than your deposit times 100 shares. While it seems like a big risk, your risk is capped, and the potential profits are ridiculous for very little investment. \n\nSome other factors to consider are determining the strike price and the expiration, as these both affect your deposit fee.\n\nIf the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $50, the deposit is kind of high ($10 per share) because there's a very good chance you will make a profit.\nIf the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $100, the deposit is lower (maybe $6 per share) because it's less likely that the price will go that high and your risk of losing your deposit is higher.\nIf the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $150, the deposit is much lower (maybe $3 per share) because it's very likely the price will not hit $150 per share and you will lose your deposit. \n\nThe maximum strike price you can choose is capped at roughly 300% of the current share price.\n\nYou can actually choose a strike price *lower* than than today's price, however the deposit is extremely expensive because it's very likely that the price won't drop below the strike price. For example you can actually buy an option to buy AMC shares for 50\u00a2 each! But it costs almost a $60 deposit fee PER SHARE, lol.\n\nIf the call option expires and you haven't sold it, your broker will automatically exercise it for you if you have enough buying power in your account. Otherwise it will automatically sell it for you. If the price has dropped below the strike price, the cost of the deposit times 100 will be deducted from your account.",

We\u2019re trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done but we believe we\u2019re putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the longterm. The management team and refreshed board will remain totally focused on these goals at all times. We know some people want us to lay out a whole detailed plan today, but that\u2019s not gonna happen. You won\u2019t find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition. That\u2019s the philosophy we adopted at Chewy. Here are a few things we\u2019ve done so far: refresh the board, added technology and retail experience to the leadership team, paid off all our long term debt and strengthened the balance sheet, and begun laying the foundation for long term growth. Moving forward, we want you to judge GameStop based on our actions, not our words. Thank you everyone, and as my dad would say, \u201cbuckle up.\"\"",

Let's say rain, sun, or snow, bull market or bear market, their investing strategy is so close to a guarantee of 5% per year.\n\nClearly they are not beating VTI which on average produces 7% real returns per year. However, the fund is going to have way less drawdown risk and way less volatility. \n\nIf you're seeking financial independence (/r/financialindependence/) then you may have a goal of retiring early. People often cite the 4% safe withdrawal rule, but if your portfolio is 100% VTI then it's more like 3%. Under the 4% rule you could have a dollar after a 30 year retirement and it still be considered a success. \n\nLet's say my retirement goals is $100k of inflation adjusted dollars each year. If I do it by myself in VTI with the 3% SWR rule it's going to take $3.3 million to safely withdraw it.\n\nWith the hedge fund I could very well withdraw that 5% every year thanks due to their returns regardless of market conditions and lower volatility/drawdown. In order to have the same income I only need $2 million in the hedge fund.\n\nI'd be able to be retired 1.65x faster by moving my money to the hedgefund when I want to retire!\n\nIt boils down each hedge fund and the people who buy it have different investment goals!
