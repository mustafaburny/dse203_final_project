This allows them to do many things.\n\nThe most simplest use case for this is a CDN, where you put your big images, videos, etc. so you don't have to use heavy bandwidth over the internet. Latency is also improved. Cloudflare is not the only player here, the one of the oldest and biggest in this space is Akamai which was one of the high flying tech stocks of the dot com boom.\n\nAnother is edge computing. Think of the capability of running some code at the edge servers to minimize the load on your central servers running on AWS or Google or your own datacenter.\n\nAnother is DDOS security. The edge servers will initially take requests to a website. If it is under attack, it will require the client to do some hard math problem before forwarding the request to the actual website. This way the actual website won't be bombarded with requests, and bots need to have a lot more computing power to be able to affect a site.\n\nThere are a number of other things such as VPN, etc. that they can run on top of this infrastructure. See https://www.cloudflare.com/ products for detail.",

Usually there are the big highways that everyone shares and uses. However on the internet, nothing is stopping people from building their own roads except the cost, upkeep, and protection of the roads they built which can quickly spiral out of control.\n\nNow imagine that there are companies that builds and privatizes their own roads. This is where CDNs like cloudflare come in. Want to get around a traffic jam? Some people will pay an arbitrary amount use your private road to bypass the jam and clouflare will serve them. They can also provide security and other amenities along their roads. The name of the game is scalability and presence here which takes a large amount of time to build up.\n\nCDNs like cloudflare have good reputations and show little sign of stopping. You could look into Akamai to see a bigger player. Overall its an extremely safe stock considering the people behind it are really really good at their jobs.",

Even ignoring appreciation, the fact you're building equity instead of giving money away to a landlord will likely save you more than what you can make on the market most years (unless you win some crazy WSB yolo), and the monthly difference (it's not unusual for a mortgage to be cheaper than rent) can always be invested. Mortgage DP is usually 20%, which should be more than doable in most places with 200k, with plenty of surplus to throw into stocks or whatever.\n\nOther than that, if you want strong, steady growth, big tech has been where its at lately. Aim to split your money among those at about 5% of the total each--rn I'd go for FB, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AAPL for sure. Grab others in the category that suit you, TSLA is a popular one, ZM, AKAM, HYLN, NET, FSLY, NFLX, SPOT, NVDA, AMD are a few  I like to watch. I've noticed some of the traditional dividend stocks being an unexpectedly safe haven when the tech stocks dip, made some decent cash selling tech high then jumping into T, TD, SCM, BNS, KO, CAH, etc., for a few days until the dip bottoms out and it's time to cash out and buy tech back at the discount. Long term when market isn't as crazy you maybe aren't trading as much, a good policy is as one of your stocks exceeds 5% of your portfolio, look at selling it off to where its back down below 5% (when ready, not a super strict rule), then reinvest the gains elsewhere.",

Fastly initial sales increased because of Tik Tok. Fastly have many competitors such as Cloudfalre , Akamai, Imperva etc. Ark was dumb in buying the dip there. ARK also bought Alibaba when it dipped from 320 to 290 without actually understanding the political situation in China.

        "body": "There is a reason.  Once a company is no longer owned by the founders, it becomes what I call a \u201czombie\u201d public company.  Once the majority of shares are owned by funds (retirement, hedge, etc.) instead of owners and founders, the focus shifts to quarterly returns, innovation dies, growth rates slow, and the value of the company is \u201cmonetized\u201d back to the funds until it is worthless.   Salesforce just turned that corner.  Typical patterns include heavy advertising, annual or twice annual layoffs (Jack Welch style), cuts in R&amp;D funding, tight delivery schedules, service failures,  attempts to turn support into consulting (a poorly built product now needs you to pay for support), higher product complexity (it becomes a complicated mess due to rushing the delivery schedule, and saying yes to every possible customer, who basically turn your solution into garbage).  Fully monetized companies then show up in bankruptcy after years of neglect and lack of innovation.  Think Sears and JCPenney.   Oracle is on it\u2019s way, as well as most \u201cold tech\u201d.

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

This year it hasn't that much. People are timid, but I largely think that is overplayed. Many companies reported great numbers for Q3. Whether the election is contested, biden wins, or trump wins, it doesn't really matter. The private sector is marching on. Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if people riot. Stimulus will pass whether its biden or trump. Even so, we know we have until next year to sort it all out. Im keeping some cash for buying opportunities, but I'm largely bullish.

As I\u2019m starting off with a weak source of money i\u2019d prefer a safer strategy, for now. I managed to get hold of 0.02 ETH and a share of SDC.\n\nI have recently picked up an interest in investing and am thinking about starting in the coming days, on trading 212. Ive selected the FAANG companies, Microsoft, Tesla, Shopify, Salesforce, Nvidia, Adobe and Vanguard emerging markets etf. I\u2019m not sure about the percentages.\n\nis this a good pie and what percentages should i use?",

But they're also spending a hell of a lot of money to get all this other crap done. I have January calls it'll probably expire worthless. I've come to accept that unless Microsoft or the government or somebody buys a company which unfortunately is not for sale. But then again everything has its price. Including me because I've been giving $5 blow jobs behind the Wendy's dumpster near my house just to make ends meet.\nI've already lost my half my portfolio which is about $80,000 thank you AMD for moving your earnings date without telling anyone and buying xilinx. And now dunkin' donuts is going private and I knew about it and I didn't buy any calls or puts or any goddamn thing.\nThe only advice I can give you is stay out of this for a while or buy leaps for 2022. Nokia doesn't move enough to day trade you're better off investing in Erickson or Comcast or T-Mobile. Even Qualcomm I stay away from AT&amp;T though period well good luck with your investment you can always buy Tesla. I just bought Amazon and the price went down even though earnings were through the roof. The stock market is just not stable right now it's almost as if Trump is running that also as well as the country period both are in very sad state. Put your money in the bank and leave it there for a while you're better off period again this is only my opinion or is everyone says the mad ravings of a madman Good luck Chuck. Cheers",

Casting a wide net can get some misses, but there's plenty of reason to expect upside north of 50% or more on a good number as well. Hard to make that case for MSFT or AMD. \n\nI'm between 75% and 250% on several of my bargain plays of April and May. There are still plenty of options out there that haven't begun to claim their recovery gains, but we can expect that in the meantime, big tech won't see a future six months anything like what it saw the past six months. \n\nI'm investing longer term as well, but I like to keep some fluidity for shorter term trading as well, since I'm already maxing out my and my wife's RIRAs and still maintaining sizable pragmatic choices in my brokerage. \n\nBut you're right on a horizon of a year or more, the longterm value and relatively low risk with the tech giants and chip makers will beat many value plays, and the FOMO factor is relatively small given the ceiling and the uncertainty between now and then, which means that even if the liquidity I added this afternoon pays off better elsewhere, it's certainly a defensible position to stand pat and take the lower drama.",

For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

It seems everywhere you look someone has an online meeting on Zoom. Schools that are closed have classes on Zoom.   \nZoom seems to be like the Microsoft of online meetings these days, it's the de-facto industry standard for online meetings. So on that basis alone, Zoom seems undervalued (at this point in time.) \n\nThey're more popular now than they ever were, and that potentially means more money, and that in turn means the price might go up.   \n\n\nThe thing about active trading is, well, that it's active. The fund managers try to figure out what will go up and buy it, and sell it before it drops. They're more momentum players than long-term holders, so I guess based on that alone they might buy Zoom (because everyone seems to be using it these days, and that can't be a bad thing as far as the price is concerned (for now anyway.)  \n\n\nThere was a lot of hype around Zoom, and when it appeared on a lot of people's radars it was a lot cheaper than it is now.  They would have likely bought in when they first started seeing all those ads for seminars on Zoom, and notices of schools being closed and having classes on Zoom.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out. I've replaced them with Pinterest in my portfolio as my new search/advertising stock. Social search is the future and I now see the genius advertising potential of the Pinterest platform; I see them stealing advertising dollars away from Google and growing much better than Google over the next 5 years.",
