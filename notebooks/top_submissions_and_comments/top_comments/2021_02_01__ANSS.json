You ask?\n\nOne only needs to be a completely autistic baby with a concaved Fontanelle bone to see that Melvin Captial is buying time with its position in FISV.\n\nHere let me explain...\n\nWhat is Fiserv besides a horrible company name and complicated business model that only yacht owners understand?  ...its fucking portal banking with AI.  Thats right a company currently valued at $71 billion is doing what banks should do but doing it for them but for a ridiculous price and less manpower.  Don't believe me? Watch this as Louie Andersons cousin explains how FISV is making bank on handing out money from the Cares Act for BANKS, wtf?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FemgPr0ulMU\n\nHow is this company worth that much? Because institutional investors and the fact where Melvin over bought shorts on GME they over bought calls on FISV causing its artificial inflation.\n\nMelvins largest position as of Jan 30th, 2021 is FISV with 10.54 million shares, but who cares right? WRONG DIPSHITS.  Melvin also has 6.26 million (the largest call position I've ever fucking seen) in calls and as the pressure on GME continues Melvin is forced to liquidate its largest position first to maintain portfolio diversity because bitches love diversity.\n\nSo Melvin is funding this GME fight with its call options of FISV and all the hedge fund buddies are helping push the stock price up.  \n\nIt only takes a retard to see the lack luster volume on FISV during the day with the stock price moving in trend up as GME goes down. You can almost inverse the graph and over lap it but ill leave that for you fucks because I'm lazy and want easy money. All of that day rally on no news is to be followed by an immediate high volume sell off at the end of each trading day this past week like clock work. Check it out yourselves.\n\nThis will not end good for FISV as all this stock churning upwards will eventually come down when the squeeze is on.\n\nSo get your sea legs and happy rough seas!!\n\nFISV P 19MAR21 70.00\n\nThis is not financial advise I simply like the stock.\n\nI've posted this as a DD but the moderators haven't vetted it through yet which is super suspect",
