This can be fixed by spending a bigger share of the profits on capex and buying a lot of these advanced EUV machines themselves and that is exactly what they are going to do and what pissed of some investors. Intel announced they will be the first to receive the next iteration of even more advanced EUV machines soon.\n\nBy being a foundry Intel can use all their IP for their customers. This will give them an advantage over TSMC and Samson for a sizable chunk of the market. Simply because they can throw in this IP so customers can design product only intel can make. Their packaging techniques are not the same as those of TSMC and at least a sizable share of the market will benefit from these. I'm not going to claim they will steamroll TSMC but they will be able to take market share. It's a new market. It will be the same as AMD doubling their data center business by taking a few percentages of market share from Intel. In the foundry business TSMC will be like Intel and Intel will be like AMD.\n\nAs a foundry you can make whatever the client designs. Intel clearly stated they will go for a mix and match strategy where clients can combine external IP like ARM with Intel IP like packaging or networking. X86 will always have a place but Intel clearly accepted that it's not only x86 anymore and they are adapting.",

With dividend and buybacks combined they return aboud 7% per year if their revenue of profits wouldn't increase which they almost certainly will.\n\nSamsung makes most of it's money from it's foundy business and retail electronics. If it's foundry business' orders decrease they can fill up the remaining space with their own needs. (same as intel)\n\nTsmc is the real leader in the industry with customers having reserved all capacity for years ahead.\n\nFor price targets i would recomend [this DFCF tool](https://tracktak.com/dashboard).

MSFT is probably the safest and most solid tech company right now with the best credit, and tons of cash, etc, etc basically hard to find weak spots. If this person really wants serious advice I'd say count your blessings and get out of the meme stocks and into lower risk, maybe some etfs.

        "body": "If you don't understand the risks, you don't understand the company. I'm not getting  spoon fed my opinions from online articles, I'm a software developer intimately familiar with Intels problems over the last few years.\n\nWe can ignore that they've fallen so far behind in process, and assume new CEO PatG is going to fix that by throwing tens of billions in new capex at it. So higher PP&amp;E costs but hey, they have the cash flow to support it. \n\nAnd we can ignore that TSMC and others are investing even higher amounts in maintaining their process lead, including in US based (Arizona) manufacturing.\n\nLastly lets ignore that AMD has been eating market share over the last decade and is positioned to maintain or grow x86 market share in the future.\n\nBut it's hard to ignore that Intel is losing probably their best PC customer, Apple. Apple never bought from AMD, always Intel, and always Intels higher end CPUs where it makes it's best margins. Last year Apple was likely close to 10% of Intels PC CPU business (not counting chromebooks which buy super cheap shitty CPUs).\n\nThis is only starting to show up in Intels financials. Apple moved their lowest end Macbooks and Mini to Apple Silicon in December of last year, just moved low end iMacs this summer, and now is moving all high end MacBooks to Apple Silicon right now. High end iMacs and Mac Pros get their Apple Silicon by mid next year and it's over, Intel permanently loses over 20M higher end CPU sales a year.\n\nBut worse is that Apple's M1x is not only faster than the fastest of Intel's new Alder Lake CPUs, its offering that performance at  roughly 1/3 the power draw and less than half the cost. Each of those new high end MacBook Pros would have had $500 Alder Lake CPUs (actually they would have been delayed till 2022 till Intel had volume) but TSMC is building Apple's M1x Pro and Max for $150-$250.\n\nYou might say, who cares? Apple was only 8% of PC market by units, even though those were all high end. Microsoft cares. Dell cares. Lenova cares. Now they have to go toe to toe with Apple MBPs that aren't just as fast or faster at the same price points, they are offering double the battery life, and run super cool.\n\nMicrosoft already sells the Surface X using an ARM processor. Their ARM processor sucks, but Apple Silicon has just given them the blueprint for fixing that. They are working on their \"Microsoft Silicon\" higher performance PC ARM processor as I write this. As is Samsung, Qualcomm, etc, etc. They can't sit buy and bleed sales to Apple because Intel's CPUs are too hot, too expensive and use too much power.\n\nSo these things are going to take a while, and unless Intel figures out how to take the cruft out of x86 to make it run far cooler and with lower power at the same performance levels, the ARM trend will continue to pick up speed and market share. Catch x86 up in process size is only one aspect of the ARM lead, on equal process sizes x86 is still at a big disadvantage in power consumption, maybe 2 to 1 instead of 3 to 1, but still big.\n\nBut the even bigger near term threat is to Intels' dominance in servers. Amazon's ARM based server architecture has huge advantages. It doesn't offer anywhere near the same level of single CPU performance, but that matters little to the vast majority of server customers. Instead it offers far more performance per dollar and because it uses so much less power it generates far less heat, meaning more can be packed into server rooms. This has led to some of the highest growth rates the industry has seen in decades, and it's already at 10% in one measure of cloud computering.\n\n[https://www.techpowerup.com/275971/aws-arm-based-graviton-processors-sees-the-biggest-growth-in-instance-share](https://www.techpowerup.com/275971/aws-arm-based-graviton-processors-sees-the-biggest-growth-in-instance-share)\n\nIt's a real risk that ARM based server architectures could have over 50% of cloud server installs in 5 years. That would gut Intel's biggest CPU market.\n\nSo no catch phrases, just some very real, and some very likely risks.",

Pick any of the top ten companies in the country or world and you are likely to dominate the average. We have known for 50+ years that Exxon has its hands in government pockets. Easy pick. We\u2019ve known for 30 years that Microsoft would rule the PC world. You could have waited 20 years \u201cjust to make sure\u201d before increasing and you would destroy the S&amp;P.

        "body": "We are talking multiple years here if not decades. Companies like Exxon. a.) They are in a dying industry and have been unsuccessful in pivoting away from fossil fuels to alternative sources of revenue. b.) They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",

Using a 5-year average of price/earnings is ok, because it normalizes the value of the company to their earnings at the time, and shows where wall street is pricing the company over time.  Using 5-year averages on earnings, or revenue only is dumb unless you think the company is going to regress on it's revenue.  \n\nAt one point they're averaging FCF for the last 5 years and comparing that to current market cap.  That just simply doesn't work when FCF today is nearly double what it was 5 years ago, and it's not only still growing - but it's still accelerating.  The fact that MSFT had 34B in free cash flow in 2016 is completely irrelevant to the stock's price today, where they have 56B in FCF.   \n\nThe way these guys are coming up with their valuations are as if MSFT isn't growing any more - it's more useful when looking at mature dividend companies, but it's not really a good way to value a company that is going to aggressively grow for the next 5-10 years.",

A few weeks ago it was the Wu-tang NFT. \n\nThey jerk themselves off when the stock goes up a few dollars even though a few bucks is nothing compared to how much it should go up according to their DD about the MOASS. When the stock does shit, it\u2019s either part of the plan or because market forces caused it to do so.  \n\nThey delude themselves about technologies and industries that they don\u2019t even understand themselves. They don\u2019t ever reach out to people in these  industries to verify if what they assume is correct, it just is! They make up whatever shit that sounds nice in their fantasy land.  \n\nIve worked in the games industry and the shit they say about games distribution and GameStop\u2019s future role is literally orthogonal to what actual consumers in the gaming industry want.

Super undervalued by every metric massive margin expansion. Market has written it off as temporary due to the semi shortage. While I think that's certainly a piece of the equation, it's only a piece. They have shifted product mix away from smartphone chips (low margin) to more tablets and auto industry screens (higher margin). These are growing segments with significantly higher margins. Both segments growing significant double digits YoY while smartphone chip sales decreased single digits.\n\nThey've also secured long term supply agreements for customers (for a fee and guaranteed minimum quantities) in addition to being paid fees to procure/guarantee capacity for non-customers for certain technologies.\n\nThey are also in the VR space and make boatloads on Smart TV stuff (Smart TV industry wide is projected to grow at 16% CAGR) and touchscreen display stuff.\n\nAdditional bear case: Wu brothers don't care about shareholders blah blah blah.\n\nCounter: Historically they pay out 75% of net profit as a dividend as is incentivized in the Taiwan tax structure.\n\nAnother Bear Case: China/Taiwan relations get significantly worse (or China straight goes to shit). Himax is a Taiwanese company with a lot of their customers and suppliers in China.\n\nhttps://www.himax.com.tw/investors/\n\nAs of\u00a0today\u00a0(2021-11-05), Himax Technologies's share price is\u00a0$11.45. Himax Technologies's\u00a0EPS without NRI\u00a0for the\u00a0trailing twelve months (TTM)\u00a0ended in\u00a0Jun. 2021\u00a0was\u00a0$1.25. Therefore, Himax Technologies's\u00a0**PE Ratio** without NRI\u00a0for\u00a0**today\u00a0is\u00a09.16**.\nDuring the\u00a0past 13 years, Himax Technologies's\u00a0highest\u00a0PE Ratio without NRI\u00a0was\u00a0270.77. The\u00a0lowest\u00a0was\u00a07.04. And the\u00a0**median\u00a0was\u00a025.11**.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/himx/short-interest\n\nApril 15th, 4m shares short (1 day to cover). Grew steadily as price dropped since May to now (10/15 report date) 24m and 10 days to cover.\n\nPublic owns 81m shares  \nInsiders own 49m shares  \nInstitutions own 34m shares  \nHedge funds own 9m shares\n\nI've been in since well before then, but yeah. Good times. Read the Q3 investor deck.\n\nPositions: a lot of leaps and shares and maybe some CSPs and CCs",

In my little bubble, I\u2019m a foreigner, but restaurants refused my CC because payments are withheld for a month, and within a month, the meal you just ate might not cover the cost of the uncooked food. Add to that, ATMs costed a massive % of cash deducted. Like 10%.\n\nSo we ended up having someone wire us some cash, and the rate was something impressive, like I could make 33% gains from reselling the cash, but like the true tard that I am, got way too excited by the value trap because Western Union seemed very happy to offload their cash on me. Once the pandemic hit, I couldn\u2019t even spend it, so I\u2019m stuck with $500 worth of Argentine cash that is probably worth $180 right now IF I can find a buyer.",

        "body": "You clearly haven't been paying attention to the amount of institutional money coming into the market. BTC already had a 50% correction this year and bounced right back.\n\nOr the continued adoption worldwide of bitcoin and crypto currency. Smart money follows smart money and all the banks and funds are starting to get into crypto, hence why it's still early. With more money comes more stability, as we're starting to see. You would actually have to follow BTC metrics to understand this though. \n\nThere's going to be a massive supply shock, that's why everyone even the big players are accumulating. This will bring financial freedom to billions of people worldwide who don't have access to bank accounts, let alone appreciable assets. More countries will continue to adopt BTC as legal tender and benefit from it as well. El Salvador has already invested $13M profits into schools, and there are more people with a BTC wallet than a bank account. No longer will people in the 2nd/3rd world be held hostage by Western Union fees, or INSANE inflation rates.\n\nYou're thinking very close mindedly, I of course know it's a volatile space because of the timing but it's also the perfect time for a retail investor to take advantage. I've also been taking profits on the way up just as I would with any stock. Whether you like it or not, I've done my research on crypto, believe in it, found the value, bought low and made my way to amazing gains both realized and unrealized. How are your negative yielding bonds doing? How about gold? Tech is the future, defi will be a huge portion of the tech industry. There's trillions of dollars of negative yielding bonds in the market, that's trillions of dollars looking for the next best store of value and guess what everyone's buying.\n\nNot financial advice, I definitely wouldn't take any advice from anyone on this sub here otherwise I wouldn't have these gains.

He was a Serbian-American engineer, inventor and physicist who made scores of breakthroughs in the development, transmission and application of electric power. He is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.\nNikola invented the first motor with alternating current and developed technology for AC generation. In late 1886, He met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. Based on Nikola's new ideas for electrical equipment, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887.
