Then we had the computer revolution with Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Intel, and about 100 other players that pulled us through the 80s when rates were hiked way up. Then rates came back down to something reasonable (i.e. not 0%) and we had the Internet revolution with Amazon, AOL (lol I know), Google, Facebook, and others.\n\nBut *all of that* was made possible because we made big investments during the 40s-60s in things like computers, transistors, Arpanet, etc. These things take time to pay off, some of them don't pan out, but that's why you:\n\n1. Invest.\n2. Diversify.\n\nOver the last 40 years, the investment in infrastructure and basic research has been whittled away by the Republican party.

(INTC).\n\n* Selling your first double-bagger for a profit... and watching it 5x in the future. (W)\n\n* Learning about factors, Sharpes, Shiller P/Es, Buffet ratios and worrying about macros in general.\n\n* Thinking about sectors, fundamentals, valuation ratios, growth etc.\n\n* Spotting an ETF that's been beating you (with lower risk) all this time.\n\n* Learning how to buy on the dip.\n\n**Years 4-6**\n\n* Being ok selling a long-term loser.\n\n* Feeling good about buying a broad-based ETF.\n\n* Diversifying by choice and not necessity.\n\n* Not playing earnings and focusing on the long term.\n\n* Holding all your capital gains to long-term.\n\n* Thinking about share dilutions, buybacks, cash flows, cap ex., moats and network effects.\n\n* Kind of half-assed doing some DCFs and valuations, and then moving on.\n\n**Years 7+**\n\n* Thinking about position sizes, correlations, macros, yields and rates.\n\n* Playing small positions in earnings again because it's cheap beta lol.\n\n* Sticking with allocations even if they're uncomfortable. Wondering why you'd ever go 25+% on one move.\n\n* Searching out guidance on the 10Q.\n\n* Being OK selling on the dip.",

This can be fixed by spending a bigger share of the profits on capex and buying a lot of these advanced EUV machines themselves and that is exactly what they are going to do and what pissed of some investors. Intel announced they will be the first to receive the next iteration of even more advanced EUV machines soon.\n\nBy being a foundry Intel can use all their IP for their customers. This will give them an advantage over TSMC and Samson for a sizable chunk of the market. Simply because they can throw in this IP so customers can design product only intel can make. Their packaging techniques are not the same as those of TSMC and at least a sizable share of the market will benefit from these. I'm not going to claim they will steamroll TSMC but they will be able to take market share. It's a new market. It will be the same as AMD doubling their data center business by taking a few percentages of market share from Intel. In the foundry business TSMC will be like Intel and Intel will be like AMD.\n\nAs a foundry you can make whatever the client designs. Intel clearly stated they will go for a mix and match strategy where clients can combine external IP like ARM with Intel IP like packaging or networking. X86 will always have a place but Intel clearly accepted that it's not only x86 anymore and they are adapting.",

I mean, yes, it's hard to predict how high it'd go, but the trend of investing in chips, CPUs, and other advanced hardware is a follow up to present day economic and geopolitical news - ie the competition between the West and China, which is centered around chips; and the global chip shortage, which is the result of various supply issues, that is factoring into their price.\n\nThe market might seem random at times, but it's rational in the *long-term*. Global trends eventually transform into market facts. \n\nFor example:\n\n* Peak oil + climate change -&gt; rise of electric vehicle and new energy companies\n\n* Money printing + global corporate taxes -&gt; rise of bit coin and other ways to avoid taxes / hedge against inflation\n\n* Chip supply issues + competition vs. China -&gt; rise of chip companies\n\nWhat's hard in all this is picking the winners. Just because chip companies are on the rise doesn't mean all of them are doing well. Example: Intel. Just because people are dumping more money into bit coin, doesn't mean all of the currencies are doing well. Just because the market is loving electric vehicles, doesn't mean all electric vehicle companies are having gains like Tesla.\n\nThe noise is there and will always be there. You either live with it and buy into an ETF and accept modest gains, or you try to gamble on which company is going to take it all. That's where the challenge is.",

Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.

Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term.

There's a reason they are so high, and it's not because it's a great company at a low price.\n\nThis play isn't new and has been seen by many previously low float deSPACs such as OPAD, SPIR and IRNT.\n\nAs for my play?  I don't know when the unlock will happen, but I suspect it will be sometime between now and December, so in about a week or so, I will be picking up 15P and waiting for the inevitable drop that's implied by the warrant-common gap.\n\nRemember that the PIPE has a $10 cost basis and unlike dumb Redditors, they will take a guaranteed 80% return on an investment and won't diamond hand it to 0.  And relative to the current float, the PIPE is huge so the drop will be very big, possibly even below 10.\n\nSeriously, after GME everyone is always looking for the next \"squeeze\", but chances are, if you've just heard of it it's too late.\n\n\nWe are not here to carry your bags for you, stop gambling on garbage hoping for an unrealistic return and pick a solid company like SOFI.  Seriously, 2023 25c LEAPs on SOFI will print better than 90% of these shitty squeeze plays.

And if the company has value, why wouldn't small piece of that have value?\n\nBut of course... I understand why you are asking this question. Because if you just buy a stock and you let it stay there, unless the company gives dividends you will receive nothing in return. So you agree that a company that gives dividends does have value? Let's say a company that gives 10% of dividends each year, will make you back that money in 10 years and from there everything else is a bonus.\n\nNow. What is the reason why every company doesn't give dividends? The reason is growth. They and their shareholders both think it's better to invest the potential dividends back into growing the company. \n\nBut the company always will have \"potential\" to give out dividends, once they decide they don't need to grow anymore - they could start giving out dividends, but meanwhile you can think of dividends as constantly being automatically invested back into the company, however due to company growing the potential also increases an you can still cash out the \"dividends\" by selling the stock at higher price due to potential of dividends having been grown.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

The CEO sent out a company wide email basically saying expect a conversation with your manager as we're making changes.\n\nThey touched only the areas with the highest attrition (about 60% of workforce) and the starting salary.  We now have folks who have been here 1-5 years who are going to make the same as a new hire.  We now have folks who have been here 10 years who are going to be making $1-$5 more than a new hire.  We now have specialized technical experts getting paid the same as a college hire.  Good luck if the bonus this year sucks because the folks I hang out with who were absolutely dedicated to making this a place we retired from are all tooling up and looking.",
