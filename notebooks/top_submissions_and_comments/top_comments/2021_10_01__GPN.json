Its top holdings are Square, PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, fiserv, fidelity, global payments inc., American Express. \n\nThis ETF tracks cashless transactions and the data associated with those transactions. \n\nEvery sporting event I have been to this year was card only. Im not a cashless society guy, but it feels like we are going there. \n\nSorry I didn\u2019t mention Palantir, GameStop, AMC,SOFI you fucking goons.",

HPQ might be worthwhile looking at instead of HPE. \n\nDon\u2019t listen to the 100% broad ETF recommendations. You\u2019ll learn nothing from it. A bit in ETF\u2019s make sense in which case you could swap out some of the individual stocks. E.g. VOO rather than holding T, APPL, MSFT, NKE. ARKK rather than TSLA.\nIt\u2019ll de-risk it a little bit. Aside from that congrats, this is a great start.",
