Example, the news about a merger happening and not waiting for the actual merger. My best early trade was Sirius XM and I waited for the merger but the news of the approved merger was when I should\u2019ve sold and I thought I had a great profit but it will be even better when they get operating. Wrong! But my research was correct about that trade in the first place. Learned and moved forward. Next. Resist the temptation to trade!! This is really hard. I could\u2019ve bought Goog, Netflix, FB, Apple and held all of that time and made tons more than what I did as a trader. Maybe separate the two and open two accounts. The \u201cI never sell account\u201d and the \u201ctrader account.\u201d Buy dividend stocks or change the game companies in the I never sell account and reinvest the dividends into more stock and wait for stock splits. I\u2019ve tried to have them both in the same account but when you stare at it everyday and some news about something big comes, I cut myself off at the knees and didn\u2019t see it thru because I wanted to reallocate those dollars. Next, Don\u2019t be afraid to cut your losses and move on from a stock. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to take small profits all along the way. A win is a win! Sometimes taking a loss can be a win because you move on and in hindsight you find you could\u2019ve lost even more. Hope this is what you guys are looking for! Hope it helps!",

Instead of having 10 features, please do 3 things but always correctly. Google pixelbuds bluetooth connection is absolute trash, while airpods are always working as intended. \n\nFinally marketing. They have created a brand that has a crazy following. Younger people associate apple products with socio-economic status. You can tell this from memes about dating people who use android/appear green on messages.",

All the other companies (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG) don't have to make a penny from their music streaming services because all of these companies have way more profitable lines of businesses  \n\n\nThis is an excellent point. Spotify has to break even and profit from music alone while other services can offer streaming as a part of the bundle. I am not too stoked with their podcast strategy but they could turn that power around. \n\nI had a bull thesis for Spotify but it was based on the assumption that they will be able to control music discovery and knock down the rates being paid to the labels but they didn't work out and Tiktok has really become the platform where pop hits are made which undermines Spotify's position with the labels.",

But it\u2019s not much different from Walmart France buying PS5\u2019s from Sony Japan for $100 and selling them for $105. In which case the $5 of taxable profit seems reasonable.\n\nYou can say that multinational companies shouldn\u2019t be able to sell to themselves. But Apple Ireland and Apple France are different companies (albeit with the same parent company). It\u2019s just obvious because they have the same name. You can make a law changing tax\u2019s for companies with the same parent company but the companies will just reform to be separate to match the new tax structure.\n\nSo they need a consensus of countries to make this less lucrative. And countries that don\u2019t comply could be pressured into doing so (companies reporting expenses to non-complying countries face an additional tax liability).\n\nNote: my examples above are vast oversimplifications of the ip licensing and other methods used to show expenses to other countries and skirt tax laws.",

So my dividend yield is lower but my cost basis dividend yield is higher.\n\nIt's not that MSFT doesn't pay a lot of dividends, it's that their dividends/future dividends are so highly coveted that it makes the yield look low. \n\nHere's an example: Buffett bought KO between 1988-1994 for a total cost of $1.3B. Since then Buffett has made $8.5B in total dividends. They will pay out $672M in dividends to Berkshire this year on an investment of $1.3B. KO only has a 3% dividend yield, but that is irrelevant because the cash on cash return doesn't care about current unrealized gains. \n\nSo let's say you bought MSFT exactly ten years ago at $23.71, then your cost basis dividend yield would be 9.2%. \n\nMost importantly, you wouldn't have to sell shares to receive that payment. That's the problem with appreciation, you have to sell a productive asset (shares) in order to receive an unproductive asset (cash), and even worse, the cash value for your shares is net taxes. Dividends are also net taxes but you didn't have to sell an asset to get them.",

Someone working minimum wage can afford to feed themselves for a day with about 1-2 hours of work. That boost to human productivity is massive.

Including with companies and their margins. They can produce more for less and you can consume more for less. The more consumption and gdp the more room for total gross profit.\n\nThink about how insane it is that the internet age is only about 25 years old and the massive leap in productivity and utility that has added.

Considering how vulnerable we are now with COVID, a totally unexpected event, it seems like a major missed opportunity that the Fed didn't try harder to tighten and raise rates throughout Trump's presidency.\n\nI think Trump especially got spooked in 2018 when the market went down from tightening, so much so that he pulled the plug.  He viewed the stock market performance as the success gauge of his presidency.  And he was already approaching an election year.  \n\nI doubt the 2018 crash could sustain itself too much longer.  Fundamentals were strong.  In hindsight, it was a necessary pain which would have assured greater stability going forward.  You had stocks like Apple hitting PE's around 12 in 2018.  How much lower could it realistically have gone?\n\nThe Fed kept reversing course when the going got tough.  Now there's a real disaster ongoing, and they're totally backed into a corner.",

Which I can\u2019t wait for\u2026 especially if you can split a contact into two types of communication somehow. \n\nI think millions of people are afraid to even sext their husbands and wives because our devices are too linked. A photo of your tits could be simultaneously seen on a TV, a watch, a desktop, a tablet\u2026 even in a house without kids that\u2019s just too much digital scrubbing to worry about and make sexy. \n\nOf course beyond sexting it would be nice to be free from permanent records, but not all the time\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful either to have your only permanent records to be \u201cI love you\u201d and things that need to be remembered like a grocery list.\n\nThe other platform that to me makes the most sense for cannibalization is YouTube.\n\nApple has been the defacto standard for curated paid artists since iTunes. \n\nYouTube is becoming less and less the place to store a video of your co-worker doing some dumb shit and everyone in your circle and 30k strangers find hilarious. \n\nInstead it\u2019s professional content producers who provide niche service and information.\n\nWhether it be FloatPlane, Patreon, or Onlyfans people are wanting to cut through bullshit and get that high-grade content, reward creators, and never hear another ad.\n\nEnter Apple. \n\nThey already provide the tools to create and  edit content. Why not provide the infrastructure of AppleTV and change the nature of Apple\u2019s foray into streaming.\n\nI was thinking, even something as simple as the fact that rather than always having to stream every single thing. A creator could make their videos available for download and the consumer now has a video file that\u2019s actually usable, editable, offline, and works in the entire ecosystem of Apple hardware and software. \n\nFor things like Recipes\u2026 that would be a game changer.",

        "body": "Credits to /u/ixamnis\n\n\" Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I'm also going to include **EFA** and **EEM**. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. **EFA** is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and **EEM** is rated only 5.7/10. **EEM** appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. **EFA** appears to be more tilted toward the European market. \n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I'm adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**.  Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\nRead through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people.\"",

I've been using iPhones for the past 12 years and I don't see how it will change for the next 12 years. When my friends and I buy computers we just see if any online site has deals for the newest Macbook (some of us do build our own gaming PC though). Every smart watch in my social circle is an Apple Watch and no one I know can even name a current gen Android tablet (seriously do they still sell those?). A few of my friends are on Android phones and that's about it.\n\nBefore you paint us as some stereotypical Apple fanboys who are just attracted to empty marketing, most of us work for FAANG and have degrees in EE, CE, or CS. I can actually go down a rabbit hole and present a case that Apple's seemingly over-the-top marketing is actually *underselling* how far ahead they are in terms of technical lead over their competitors. \n\nPeople think Apple products are all about fancy designs and pretty colors because that's what their marketing focuses on. \n\nDifferent consumers may feel different things about Apple products, but a common emotion their competitors' engineers feel is just despair.",

Especially if you come up with a numerical output, it requires a numerical input. \n\nDon't get frustrated, I'm trying to help, and you keep brushing over my main point.\n\nEntrance strategy!\n\nYou're thinking about it backwards. You're trying to figure out how to exit a stock, before you figure out how to enter one. You have to have an entrance strategy first. \n\nThat is why you're asking this question and don't have an answer. \n\nIf you enter a stock because of a valuation, you sell when it exceeds a valuation.\n\nIf you entered a stock because of a trend, you sell when it breaks that trend.\n\nIf you enter a stock because of a growth rate, you sell when it stops growing. \n\nIf you enter a stock because of its quality, you sell when that quality diminishes.\n\nAnd yes, sometimes you'll still be wrong. You'll never find a perfect strategy, or execute it perfectly. But you'll know what you're doing and why, and that will lead to a lot more positive and consistent results over the long run. \n\nAs far as right now, you can reevaluate.

To do trade without them, you need a person always on the other side of the trade, which is not always possible in options.\n\nFor example, if I decide to sell, say a random option, AAPL 17 SEP 117.5, at that exact second, it is possible that no one(normal trader) is interested in buying that one option directly to me. If no one is buying that exactly at that time, there wont be any bid price, hence there wont be a reference price, very illiquid market.\n\nSo the job of these market makers is thus to always give you quotes and to act as buyer and sellers of last resort at all the time. So even though there may not be normal trader like me trying to buy from me, the market maker gives me a quote and is ready to buy it to me at the bid price at any moment.\n\nThen say a few seconds later, there comes another trader who now wants to buy that option. Now the market marker gives him an ask quote and transfer my option to him.\n\nThe market maker thus makes money between the bid value given to me Vs the ask value recieved from other.\n\nRemember there are hundreds of option prices for AAPL for different strike and expiry, but only one stock price, hence it is always possible that nobody may be interested in that one random option at that exact second, unlike AAPL stock where there is always demand, so MMs become more important in options market.",

        "body": "Copying and pasting from an earlier conversation I had today:\n\nNvidia has a few CMP HX partner models preparing to launch - these are the mining specific cards. They have no display output which means they can't be used for gaming. Nvidia is also revising ALL current 30 series (except 3090 I believe) to a LHR (light hash rate) version which is a physical difference in the silicon. They are doing this to nerf ETH mining performance on their 30 series cards at the hardware level.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's CMP HX mining cards make no economic sense to mine on since they are way less power efficient, and have no resale value since they can't be used for gaming. However, if Nvidia completely locks down ETH hash rate on the 30 series, they can increase their TAM by preventing miners from cannibalizing their gaming sales. So far, the CMP HX cards look like they are built on 10 series architecture so they will be able to be produced cheaper and in parallel to 30 series.\n\nLastly, the ARM deal seems to be moving along. Qualcomm has voiced concerns and said they are ready to invest in ARM as a partner if the Nvidia deal falls through. Nvidia says it has 3 other silicon manufacturers who support the Nvidia deal but details aren't known yet. Nvidia's recent rise is likely due to the probability of the ARM deal actually becoming more likely.\n\nIn case you dont understand why the ARM deal is good for NVDA, it means that all ARM-based chip manufacturers are beholden to NVDA. ARM is the most dominant CPU architecture for all mobile CPUs including micro controllers in other devices. Apple, qualcomm, samsung, amd, intel, huawei, IBM all have ARM licenses\n\nIt allows NVDA to penetrate the mobile market. Nvidia has the highest profit margins on their mobile CPUs because they don't have to rely on partners to distribute chunky desktop cards. They sell the silicon directly. Every iphone and samsung galaxy could have an Nvidia-produced CPU and GPU.\n\nThe reason ARM is used for mobile is because of its power efficiency. If Nvidia knows what they are doing (they do) then they know how they can use their proprietary access to ARM to create ultra performant and efficient server chips, feeding into their datacenter revenue.\n\nNvidia has announced plans to enter the server CPU market. When they announced this, Intel and AMD stock tanked 5% or so. My bet is that they are already working with ARM to deliver their CPU server chips\n\nTL;DR - ARM deal going through would make NVDA pull a page out of 2020 TSLA's book. Downside is ARM deal delays, pricing in approval then having it get denied. Would crush the stock.",

They have struggled to deploy their newest technologies and are &gt;two years behind - executing and management of technical risk have been tough.  They have had to consider outsourcing operations to their competitors.\n\nI also think there are major potential headwinds with the direction chip companies are taking.  Take for example apple (M1), Tesla and google.  All are moving major applications from generalist chips where intel made their name to specialized chips designed to work with their(that companies) software.  Intel has to become a foundry to compete for this business (and has announced to invest to do just that) - but there will be more competition here for that.  Even servers which is where intel has been strong and showing some movement to custom chips.\n\nI think if they can sort out their technology scaling challenges they have great assets.  The new strategy from the exec team there seems decent And semi is expected to be strong for the next few years.  And their are some macro issues in their favor (concerns about too much tech concentration in Taiwan, lack of domestic (US) chip mfg.  But they have to get a good edge back and execute well or I think they have real risk of continuing to lose market share.\n\nTo those saying US government needs will fill.  until recently used IBMs old fab in fishkill ny for a lot of defense needs.  But missles don\u2019t need the most advanced chips like you find in computers (fishkill was 90/65nm vs TSMC which is announcing 2nm).  However I think we need to see how much desire there is to preserve domestic leading edge semiconductor mfg.",

Before taxes, every two weeks I\u2019ll be making about $2700. Thank god I have no debt (love my parents so much \u2764\ufe0f), but my current portfolio is this:\n\n100 shares of CRSP\n15 shares of AMC\n10 shares of WISH\n10 shares of CLOV\n\nThe 100 shares of CRSP I really don\u2019t want to touch. I originally had 50 shares of MSFT at around $245 at its peak (then), sold it all for GME, diamond handed it, and then sold it for a slight loss at $90/share (bought in around $94/share). Used that money to buy CRSP because I felt like an idiot with my GME purchase, thinking it wouldn\u2019t ever spike again. Also, like an idiot, while I was still living with my parents back home in Ohio, I was still on my lease back in NC and gambled $2500 (about 6 months worth of rent) in the market as well and lost about $1900 leaving me with just south of 2 months worth of rent. \n\nI\u2019ve learned my lessons for sure, and I\u2019m happy that I put money into CLOV and WISH yesterday, and I\u2019m optimistic about AMC, but my goal is \n\n100 shares of BEAM, \n100 shares of FATE, \n100 shares of NTLA, \n25 shares of NVDA, \n25 shares of TSLA, \n50 shares of AMD, \n50 shares of AAPL, \n50 shares of MSFT, and \n50 shares of AI. \n\nThat said, I really want to get into purchasing calls, I just don\u2019t really know how to.

Each trade is unique and not exactly comparable. Because of this, bond traders are specialized. If you just put in an order and try to buy a few thousand dollars worth of a specific bond, you are going to overpay by a substantial amount. You need to be buying round lots ($100k worth) and know what you are doing to get a good price. Because of this, most retail investors should avoid buying individual bonds (except treasuries) and stick with bond funds.\n\nThere's many many more types of bonds than stocks in the US. There's one AAPL stock, but they probably have a dozen different types of bonds. Every city, county, school district, hospital, etc issues multiple types of bonds.\n\nAll the research saying passive investing (index funds) beats active investing is about stocks, not bonds. People just assume it's the same, but it's not. You'll make more in an actively managed bond fund than in an index bond fund.\n\nMost bonds will have lower volatility and lower returns than typical stocks, but this can be adjusted up with leverage. An easy way to invest in these are with CEFs, which often use leverage.\n\nHere's the total returns for PDI, a bond cef over the past eight years: 12%,20%, 6%, 18%, 19%, 8%, 23%, -9%, and (ytd in 2021) 13%. Because a large part of the total returns are paid out in distributions, it's best to reinvest the dividends and hold them in a tax advantaged account.\n\nIf you are in a high tax state, (CA, for example), and in a high tax bracket, it makes sense to be in a state specific municipal bond fund. One example is PCQ for California. This muni bond cef currently has a yield of 4.18% tax-free, which is the equivalent of about 8% taxable. I have about a third of my taxable account in these types of investments, because I'm quite happy to take a near certain 8%.\n\nI think everyone should have exposure to bonds. Anyone who puts 100% of their money in a single asset class really just doesn't know what they are doing. There's many types of bonds, but for some reason lots of  people here think there's one bond that yields 1% annually, and they advised avoiding that.",
