        "body": "Ok so I\u2019m actually a professional historian. And there are two things to keep in mind which make this whole analysis BS. \n\n1.\t History tells us about the past. Not he future. This should be basic for anyone investing, as \u201cpast performance does not guarantee future performance.\u201d So anyone claiming to predict the future based off of this kind of analysis, is making shut up. Or at least highly unreliable. \n2.\tmaking comparisons over 800 years is very complicated. And also in many different places around the world. Context is important. And a lot of his data is it out of context just because you can\u2019t compare England in 1300 with Russia or Poland in 1800. \n\nAlso there are actual, historical factors which have contribute to lower interest rates, and one might say that these changes and factors have already been \u201cpriced in.\u201d  \n\n1.\tIn the Middle Ages, debt was expensive in large part because the supply of credit was highly limited. The Catholic Church made any interest bearing debt essentially illegal. That\u2019s why Jews were involved, they weren\u2019t Christians so the church allowed them to lend money at interest. As debt has been more freely available this has contributed to lower interest rates. \n2.\tin MA and early modern Europe there was a lot more uncertainty and constant warfare which also contributed o high interest rates. There was less information. If you are in Vienna and want to lend money to someone in Paris, wel it takes a week for a letter to get there. That increases risk and thus interest rates. As technology has improved, and the world generally more peaceful, some of those risks have been mitigated. \n3.\tThe rise of credit bureaus and credit scores is also important. We have a society with a greater degree of trust, in certain ways. The bank can determine who will pay their loans. That allows them to offer lower interest rates. \n\nAnyway this is not to dispute the data itself but it points to the fact that interest rates will not continue to lower indefinitely. It\u2019s not some universal historical or economic law, but reflects other macro historical and technological/societal changes.",

It seems to me their business is just too narrow compared with OKTA.\n\nI really like SEA, especially because of their payments and gaming segments. I like in Bangkok, been in Thailand for 10 years. The growth is jaw dropping. I went upcountry for 5 years and when I moved to Bangkok recently, my jaw literally hit the floor. Their infrastructure, construction, transport, use of technology. Thais are very much \"plugged-in\" tech-wise. I am not just talking about young people either. \n\nI like SE Asia as region in general for growth in the years to come. MELI is very compelling. I just worry about the instability of the region in general, but also love their payments segment which is driving most of their growth, I think.\n\nI am a fan of MA/V going forward. Not so sure about SQ. I don't really wanna invest. I am, however, looking to find a fintech plays that can capture the trend better than V/MA. I think MELI, and SEA, are decent plays on that.\n\nThe e-commerce here does cash-on-delivery by the way (and that is the most common payment method here, rather than card...even app payments haven't really kicked off here yet).\n\nI don't know much about the cloud stocks to be honest (CRWD, NET, FASLY). I do love the concept of telemedicine and I am invested in LVGO. I invested in TTD over a year a go and dumbly sold it during the crash..oops! Waiting for re-entry. It is probably the stock I am most bullish on. Selling it was just dumb-greed on my part - thought I could buy back lower/didn't think the stimulus would do much for the market. Hoping it will hit mid-300s again!\n\nLVGO still seems inexpensive, despite the big run up. I can't see it being hit much in another pull-back.",

GOOGL is consistent and likely has the best valuation Rn imo. People always be discounting FB but they got cookies in the oven and a huge growth prospect, but they are plagued by controversy. NFLX is trash imo. \n\nAlso consider NVDA, MA, V, TMO, ADBE imo",
