The company is expected to guide for Q1 revenues of $100.4 bln (-9.4% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q1 gross margins of 37.8% vs. 38.4% last year.       \n* The company has not missed EPS or revenues in the last several quarters. Apple performed well across its bevy of offerings in Q3. iPhone revenues +1.5% yr/yr to $26.4 bln vs $22.0 bln estimates; Services revenues +14.8% yr/yr to $13.2 bln vs $13 bln ests; iPad +22% yr/yr to $7.08 bln; Mac revs +31% yr/yr to $6.6 bln; Wearables +16% yr/yr to $6.6 bln. Apple is benefitting from the shift to at-home work/school, which has pushed people to buy new products, apps and services. The economic stimulus measures and the lifting of          stay-at-home restrictions were tailwinds in May and June.       \n* AAPL has a $1.94 trillion valuation and currently trades at 34 times FY20 earnings.       \n* Based on the weekly AAPL Weekly Oct30 $113 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of \\~5% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).       \n* Suppliers to keep on note include: **SWKS**, **CRUS**, **AVGO**, **QRVO**, **TSM**, and **QCOM**, among others (SMH); **SSNLF**, **LPL** (for displays) and **LITE**, FNSR and **IIVI** (for FaceID).",

        "body": "I have multiple brokerage accounts and I do have on for just investing in ETFs.  Keeping it simple is a pretty solid approach.  However, I'm not thrilled with your choices.  **VOO** and **QQQ** will have a lot of overlap, so you aren't diversifying as much as you might think. **QQQ** is a great ETF, but the underlying index it uses as a benchmark contains 100 stocks.  (The NASDAQ 100).  **VOO** uses the S&amp;P 500, so it obviously contains 500 stocks. Many of the top holdings are going to be the same in both of those ETFs: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. There are, of course, differences, as well.\n\nI also don't like your choice of **VYM** because of its poor return. It has a 10 year return on investment of just 115%, while VOO is double that and **QQQ** has a return of more than 4 times that of **VYM**. **VYM** will also hold many of the companies you are already investing in with **VOO**.\n\n**QQQ** has one of the highest returns of any ETF, but it is Tech-heavy, so there may be a bit more risk than **VOO**.  \n\nYou don't tell us your age, your financial goals and how averse you are to risk, but assuming you are reasonably young (more than 20 years away from retirement) and don't mind some risk, I might suggest a strategy more along the lines of:\n\n**QQQ**: 25%\n\n**VOO**: 25%   (with the understanding that there is some overlap. The blue chip stocks in VOO will help your portfolio to be a little less volatile than putting 50% into QQQ.)\n\n**SOXX:**  10% - iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF - this is a sector ETF that invests in companies that produce semi-conductors (and related companies). The top holdings of this ETF include Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Taiwan Semiconductor, Analog Devices and NXP Semiconductors.  The might be a little overlap with this one and QQQ, but there shouldn't be much.\n\n**ICLN:**  20% - ICLN is an ETF that invests in green/renewable energy. It is a passively managed index fund that uses the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index as its benchmark. Many of its holdings are outside the US.  (If you prefer a more US focused ETF that invests in renewable energy, consider QCLN instead, but be aware that its top holding is NIO, an electric vehicle maker based in China). \n\n**ARKK:**  10% - The ARK funds are actively managed and they invest in \"disruptive,\" innovative companies, many of which are in the tech sector.  Tesla is the top holding of this fund.\n\n**VXUS**: 10% - This is an investment that tracks the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the US. The fund tracks the FTSE all Cap ex US Index fund. Top holdings include Alibaba, Tencent Holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor (a little overlap with SOXX) Nestle, Roche Holding, SAP SE, Novartis, Toyota and ASML.  While the long term track record of this fund isn't great, the recent addition of Alibaba, Tencent and other companies signal a likely more profitable future.\n\nI think an approach like this will give you the additional diversity you are looking for and a more aggressive return than the choices you've made in your post. \n\n*I'm not a professional Financial advisor and I didn't sleep in a Holiday Inn Express last night. I do own shares in many of the funds I've listed above.*",

First, sorry if you were seeking a covid related or contingent disruptor, this is not that. \n\nTheyve been rising on the clearer reality of their prominence and role in the future of 5G and the tech and signifiance of their patents and licensing deals. Most recently the bumps are due to their legal victories that have ruled them as hypercompetive and not anticompetitive (FTC has been going after them with anti trust claims), which underscores the sheer value of their tech and their control of its pricing. Apple had to settle to accept it (that they'd be paying qc0m even if they don't even use their chips for every phone).\n\nThere's too much to list and they're a very fascinating company to do your own DD on.\n\n[This article](https://www.eetimes.com/veoneer-jilts-nvidia-weds-qualcomm-on-adas-av/) is an interesting and pretty comprehensive, informative opinion on QC0M in regards to the current and near future role theyre playing in auto and ADAS. \n\nThe company has so much going for it, I really think the decades of R&amp;D is finally going to payoff. \n\nRandom example: their quickcharge (QC) 5 can rapidly charge smartphones to 50% in 5min and 100% in 15min and does NOT require special additional hardware. We will all be using this soon and thats just a fun fact.\n\nI've been taking advantage of them being out of the hype spotlight and shadow of NVDA's, which is just a temporary juxtaposition. \n\nIs all this priced in? Absolutely not, as it's not possible to be. While macroeconomic factors may delay this, I think Apple's 5G unveil later this month, assuming it is able to be as successful as it should, will break the ice and QC0M will start its ascent (my guess and closest I'll attempt to time them).\n\nTheir boom and bust with the dotcom bubble was premature IMO. (We didn't know just how valuable cellular tech would be, we had no idea what we could with it and what it enables)\n\nWhether this company will be 5-20X more valuable over the next decade, we'll have to see but even if it doesn't go that far it will definitely be trading in the 200s within 18 months and that's being conservative. No need for fomo nor need to go all in, they're a safe stock and certainly a sleeping giant.\n\nThat was pretty damn long, hope you or others find it useful.",

Independent of my cost basis, Buying calls on a stock that previously traded in the $3 range when there's an all cash offer on the table for 7.35 simply makes no goddamn sense to me. I want to see your reasoning.\nScenarios as I see it:\n\n1) Google deal closes. Call buyers above asking price become worthless.\n2) Google deal fails. Fitbit will return to it's pre offer levels... Maybe a little higher because of the value of their new products but certainly not $7.35 because if the shareholders thought it was worth that much, see NXP and QCOM, fit would be currently trading above 7.35 today. Its not.\n3) any call you buy above $7.35 might regain its IV but the subsequent breakup price would put the call farther out of the money than it is today.. more than negating any iv gain.\n\nSo what are you betting on? \nsomeone else coming in and offering more money than GOOG? If so, why wait? \n\n I'm betting on a close instead of taking profits now and selling calls for extra bucks. I disclosed my position. Let's talk yours.\n\nPs. You were the one who said selling calls at $8 has a potential for disaster. I want to understand why. If you had believed it would close with this kind of administration in power, even buying a month ago at 15% off Google's asking price is a fair bet. Selling calls out of the money is no more additional risk.",

Samsung's 5 nm yields have reportedly been pretty bad and Qualcomm supposedly snapped up most, if not all, of Samsung's 5 nm fab capacity so Apple is going to be extremely reliant on TSMC since those two are the only guys on the planet that can fab at 5 nm.

        "body": "This is the whole reason I'd invested in AMD back at 7$, Intel cant simply jump around moores law by throwing more money at the problem.  Their stock price also relies heavily on high margins, which Intel has iPhone level margins for their chips.\n\nI think the reason they've not moved beyond 14nm is because of speculative execution attacks, which along with their non-chiplet design is the entire reason they have any kind of single core performance advantage left. Without that advantage owning their own fabs is a liability, AMD can just stick with TSMC who has economies of scale from millions of ARM chips being produced by Qualcomm and Apple. Having a weak competitor who stands on the shoulders of giants and doesnt invest into RnD suddenly becomes a huge liability for Intel.\n\nThough I do agree with your assessment, its definitely priced way too high at this point to jump in now. Intel can still act anti-competitively with cloud companies in the short term, and ARM servers can still eat both their lunches as SaaS cloud continues to grow for the foreseeable future. CPU's could be going the way of the transistor and capacitor, amazing products of engineering, though who really knows who produces the capacitors in their motherboard?",
