        "body": "Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:\n\n* Congress finally passed the stimulus bill and the Internet proceed to meme the $600 stimulus check becauase let's face it, its a fairly peasant amount given context of situation. Package includes bailout for airlines, new round of PPP \"loans\" and more. Market reacts muted to the passing of the pRiCe iN bill tho QQQ traded green for most of the day (after a quick trip to red town before noon), thanks mostly to AAPL. What would we do without Tim Apple honestly?\n* WSB GME gang has collectively nutted today, at least, for those who have diamond handed and/or load-up even more long position after the ER dump. The fabled GME squeeze may be happening in earnest as shares of the gaming retailer shot up as high as 26% during intraday high to $20 without any real additional news beyond Cohen adding to his position (revealed in a filing yesterday). As long as your entry and expiry wasn't beyond retarded, you should be making decent money on GME today. Popular expiry includes calls after April given that'll bake in the much touted Q4 ER period where new console cycle sale numbers will be revealed. WSB eagerly awaits for GME call bro to post his next update. Back of envelop math should have our bro back up about 800k at the very least. GME close the day up 25% to $19.46.\n* AAPL continues its rally from yesterday's closing hours and into AH as the stock is now also an EV play. Tim Apple is up 2.85% for the day (though intraday high was higher at almost 4%) and WSB eagerly awaits it to cross the 3 trillion market cap mark. Ez.\n* In a sign of ample liquidity in the market, IAC, the boomer \"tech/internet\" stock you probably haven't heard of announced that they will be spinning off their full Vimeo stake, which will IPO in Q2 of 2021. Shares of IAC is up 14.10% for the day and closed at $183.73.\n* Can't cuck the Zuck? Facebook offered state and federal investigators a quick rub in the form of creating a new social network in return for dropping those lame antitrust shenanigan. Somehow the govt declined the offer. Those fools. They could have brought back Friendster and MySpace but boomers are still stuck with Facebook and its flat earth and fan pages. Shares of FB continues to be pressured due to antitrust investigation and fell a bit further than general macro movements, with FB at -2% for the day, closing at $267.\n* In more big corp vs big brother action, the Feds are now after Walmart (again?), with the justice department suing WMT for fueling the opioid crisis cuz they didn't babysit people with iffy prescriptions (despite WMT internal pharmacists flagging these issues). Shares cratered -2% to low $143 but has since slowly recovered as this probably won't have any real material impact on WMT in the long term and will merely be settled with some sorta peasant amount in fines. WMT closed the day down -1.21% to $144.20\n* Sell the news appears to be in full swing for vaccine stocks as MRNA, BNTX, NVAX and others are getting pummeled through the day. MRNA was down about 9.66% to just under $125, BNTX was down -7.58% to $98, and NVAX was down -10.43% to $111 during intraday low points.\n* PTON scores a flurry of upgrades and price target increases as the fitness company returns into movement land, announcing that they will purchase fitness provider Precor for $420m. This gives Peloton much needed manufacturing capacity increase and the deal was met with positive reaction from the market. During intraday high, PTON was up as much as 13%+ to $165. Shares closed up 11.65% to $161. Notable PT upgrades: Wedbush $130 to $160, Stifel $144 to $160, KeyBanc $160 to $185, and Goldman Balls from $144 to $162. No doubt Citron is gonna post something about its valuation again in the near future.\n* In other WSB meme stock land, MT continues to trade flat even with an initial morning pop, despite the AM price target increase from KeyBanc, who upped the PT to $28 from $23 while keeping his overweight rating. For PLTR, the stock tested the new $29 channel and proceed to fade through out the day, with intraday low as much as -3.5% to just shy of $27. Shares closed the day down -1.65% at $28. For TSLA, share price continues its retreat on its 2nd day of SPX inclusion, with shares down about -1.46% to end the day at $640.\n* It's a short trading week as the market will close early Thursday so plan your FDs accordingly. Notable #s releasing tomorrow: durable goods and jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET, new home sales at 10 AM ET, and EIA draw report at 10:30 AM ET. No interesting ER this week tho Paychex does report BMO on Wednesday morning.\n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/khq3x2/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_december_22_2020/ggmk6v3/))",

But it\u2019s also become a meme stock on wallstreetbets.\n\n\u201cHere's the deal. PLTR is a solid, growth company helmed by Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal) and also other billionaires. The company is not hurting for cash, but is still in its early years even though it was founded 15+ years ago. There is tremendous upside in government contracts, and other sectors.\n\nIMO, this stock will be $100+ in a couple of years, but it won't happen overnight. Still a 500% gain in 2-3 years beats the avg 8-10% annual gain of index funds or 2% for savings accounts.\n\nThis is a simple correction due to the recent run from $12 to $30 in a matter of weeks.\n\nNothing fundamentally changed with this business. \n\nHowever, \n\n1) you should ONLY invest money in the stock market that you won't need for any reason for the next 5+ years\n\n2) you should always expect 10-20% pullback in a new position and should have additional funds at your disposal to buy on dips to average down\n\n3) ONLY invest in stocks on which you did your own research and you fundamentally believe in the company's LONG TERM trajectory. This will help you weather short term pull backs and correction and you won't panic sell at the worst time\u201d",

However, some add on information EV is not market cap that\u2019s why the debt is not showing up in mostly income statement based assessment - also this does not show global coverage of PayPal vs Paysafe eg Xoom is big money earner for PayPal and as is their deal with Synchrony for deferred payment etc. these are all critical for valuation purposes and the most important is that Paysafe is not in the most mature market ie US barriers to entry include competition PayPal, Square Affirm and coming up SOFi the markets will get saturated here leaving very little for Paysafe similarly in India and China there are large payment processing companies.\n\nI may be biased but I don\u2019t see Paysafe becoming relevant outside of UK and the challenge is PayPal or Square or others can enter UK a lot more easily meaning Paysafe\u2019s ability to counter will be limited and growth challenges will drive this business into oblivion! Drastic but just to drive the point that these guys will keep showing good margins while eroding market share and become irrelevant in 5 years!\n\nAgain guys I am making a bear case for these guys feel free to challenge my assertions.",

Since you\u2019re young and time in the market is most important I recommend you play a long term game. Dont worry about price of a stock if you think they still have room to grow so identify a list of your top 5 stock picks (hopefully some are in different sectors) and keep pumping money into them every 2 weeks just like your 401k is being pumped by your paychecks. If a stock you chose dumps significantly go double down on it to drop your average (Lookup dollar cost averaging or DCA). Now that you understand this strategy what stocks?\n\nWell you seem to work for a cyber company so lets invest in some cyber companies since you know how they operate and with latest cyber attacks which will continue. \n\nMy cyber pick is $NET, sitting at $25B I think in 5 years we can see $125b to $150b. \n\nOnline gambling with sports due to new covid restrictions will make DKNG and Penn huge\n\nNow covid opened a gateway to health and bio research boost. \nMy online health growth stock is $TDOC which my company uses and is cheaper and efficient for all your medical needs and as a virtual health tech platform and especially as companies shift to using it. Easily a $250 stock in 5 years. \n\nTechnology is huge with software and data, with AI being a growth engine. \nMy stock picks are more than just 1 since prices of some are either too overpriced or revenue isn\u2019t there yet; SNOW, AI, PLTR, WDAY\n\nSocial media stock choices and streaming since we all know these platforms are great for company growth and marketing; SNAP, ROKU, and PINS. Disney is cheap to because they will find a way out of their amusement park hole from covid. \n\nCurrency related platforms through which money securely transfers from one user to the next; $SQ (owns cash app) and also invest in Bitcoin when it dips, throw in paypal if you think they have room still. \n\n\nThen of course meme stocks throw in a few stacks at EV stocks (TSLA, nio, etc) and bio stocks. \n\nSafe plays could be banks since they are cheap but your risk is low since you are young so dont throw much at safe plays but hold some to balance portfolio\n\nI know i threw a whole bunch of stocks but choose whichever sectors you understand and use and are bullish on for long term. The goal is to hold and buy more and double down if there ever is a significant dip (10%+)",
