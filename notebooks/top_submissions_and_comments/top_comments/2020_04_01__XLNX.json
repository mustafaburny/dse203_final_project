In the past decade we saw at least one run off Spark in the K computer.  Xilinx and Alterra have FPGA + CPU offerings (arm IP on the copy side I believe).  Nvidia and AMD with GPGPUs (and at least Nvidia with Jetson, etc CPU cores).  Motorola. Whoever made the propellor, and PIC if they're still around in any quantity.  Six years ago you could reprogram ~$1 'wi fi adaptors' from China and run whatever you wanted on them within their capability, and there are untold numbers of folks that have general propose CPUs somewhere in the silicon inside their widgets.  Tesla has their own computers for self driving logic. Some of the cloud companies offer compute time on in house designed machine learning options. (all from memory, maybe some small errors somewhere).\n\nTons of folks make CPUs, accelerators, general propose logic, etc.  They're mostly just not relevant to the systems your random neighbor has ever heard of, or they're embedded and un-advertised.  AMD/Intel and ARM-based are the headliners and the ones you actually hear about.",
