        "body": "*a forewarning I started typing, and went on a bit of a tangent, apologies*\n\nSo I only tested it briefly, but it had pretty good results. I ended up like going mad and just started adding a bunch of different features to the program (ie some balance sheet stripping, getting macro data from the fed, getting performance of various industries via ETFs, etc.). \n\nBut back to the question: it was a bit more of a trend analysis than a stock screener, I just didnt really know how to word it. So in theory, you could use any stock, and it would be able to detect up and down trends in momentum, before typical trend line analysis would (I'm not a huge fan of technical analysis, but admit there are some times where it can be helpful).\n\nSo when I back tested, I tried to use companies I have never traded (I only back tested 2015-2016 to try and get the most similar markets to today without me having too much forward looking bias, since didn't start paying attention to markets/trading until mid 2017). Further more, I was not exposed to price action even in the trading, as the charts I read were derived from a formula to calculate and chart momentum, so it was charts of the stocks relative momentum not stock price. After I completed the year of what dates were buys and what were sells, I went in and found the prices of those days (used closing price for both buying and selling prices).\n\nSo I used the SPX for broad market (even though, I clearly know that this has since gone higher), GDX (which, full disclosure I have briefly traded as a hedge before), and had a list of independent companies, but the only two I got through before going off on my tangent of coding were JNPR, and CERN.\n\nFor the SPX\nI was able to achieve a return of 15.73% through 6 trading \"trips\", while on the year it returned -0.73%.\n\nFor GDX\nI was able to achieve a whopping 121.52% over 6 trading \"trips\" compared to -20.10% year return\n\nFor JNPR\nI was able to achieve (another whopping) 115.32% over 8 trading trips, compared to 25.88% year return.\n\nFor CERN\nI was able to achieve a 76.34% return over 5 trading \"trips\", compared to a -27.16% return on the year.\n\nSo, things to take a way, it was pretty damn successful in the brief back tests I did. However, I noticed pretty quickly it benefits most from short term and intermediate swings in price, which the in the cases of GDX, JNPR, and CERN all were pretty volatile for that year, so the results I achieved from them, I'm expecting, are way above average. Actually the thing that sparked my tangent into other parts of the program was to try and weed out stocks that have high volatility, so i wouldnt have to go through them myself, issue is I didnt stop there. I'm pegging most results to be around that SPX result. Furthermore, this strictly tested against a yearly holding of those stocks, am planning to have someone go through with a regular trendline analysis or something with the same period to get a more accurate result as its performance against some basic analysis techniques.\n\nAs for the process I picked the companies, I used a random organizer to pick 25 S&amp;P companies (made sure they were included in the S&amp;P on the date my back test started) and ran with it. I threw in a few etfs (as shown GDX, but also have TLT, TLH, XLE, XLY, etc. Just havent gotten to them).\n\nEdit: Thanks for the interest in its progress!",

For the most part that's good.\n\nAnd as far as the push to edge computing is concerned, if we're still making terminals then it's probably marginal to just build the rest of the computer out and just do it how we have been. Then for any intensive applications use the compute resources on the private network like a render farm.\n\nAs far as who wins the VM play. VMware is expensive. 99% of IT departments don't have even half of what I just outlined above. And there's some really great alternatives that are better in many ways and much more affordable. Big switch networks(now Arista) for cloud fabrics / networking / public-hybrid cloud, Red Hat (now IBM) for open source virtualization, open stack, Fortinet for security, etc. etc \n\nI like VMware, but I just don't see them winning the cloud wars. In my opinion, it's going to be open source providers and enablers like Arista that will win, but even then there's a lot of traditional competitors that could run with it like Cisco, Nokia, Juniper, etc.\n\nBut they did have Velocloud which sold like gangbusters.

Companies that were in the shitter pre-Covid wont have the cash/liquidity to spend. \n\nOther Side-- As many companies realize they can still function pretty well without people in the office, many will move to reduce their physical footprint, consolidate offices to a more \"regional\" model where you only go to office for important / customer facing meetings, maybe a project kickoff. To sustain this sort of environment, infrastructure needs to be beefed up to handle increased bandwidth, security, utilization, etc. Companies will save money by spending a little to beef up infrastructure etc compared to their current real estate spend. However, these sort of major upgrades are not a flip the switch / overnight type of implementation, and take time to do right. So companies may take 3-6 months to ramp up capacity, and move to a more remote workforce end of year and into next fiscal year while they exit lease contracts.\n\nA note on WebEx, btw, it is a subscription based service, every user (or individual who can \"host\" a meeting) is a subscription. I do expect  they made beaucoup bucks on this in March).\n\nOverall, very bullish on this industry long term (WSB long term, 6-12 months lol). But it is very competitive and there are multiple players. Cisco has a large market share but Juniper, Huawei, Dell, etc all play in this space and are very aggressive price-wise. \n\nMy position is 6/19 47.5c, will see how much it ramps into earnings, may dump pre-announce if I hit my targeted gain (see the other DD noted, it notoriously dumps post earnings). Longer term, I may buy shares at a lower entry price point.",

Pretty much every country's military runs windows.\n\nJust listened to the q3 earnings call. Cloud demand is up like crazy right now. So, money is being shifted away from local resources into cloud computing resources. So many of AWS and Azure customers are shifting money into these tech companies. Smaller firms like NetApp, Atlassian, or Slack are seeing sales raise with this new demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, there are entirely new markets for tech that weren't viable pre covid. Consider the NFL, NBA....I can't remember the sport, but they now use MSTeams. Companies are seeing the cost benefits of remote work. Virtual Formula 1 is another example. Things are going to be interesting. To stay competitive, you will need to piviot into this new economic situation. Red Robin is an interesting case study. They cut costs like crazy and embraced off site orders. Or look at Trupanion's 10K. They cut costs and increased cash on hand to a point where they can operate for an entire year w/o income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to remember that there are millions of dollars worth of human intelligence driving the decisions behind each of these Tickers. Boards are made up of people with way way way way more industry knowledge than anyone on reddit. Yes, Tesla exists, and a tweet can swing billions of dollars around the moon, but for the most part, companies are ran by intelligent folks trying their best to make money. That's it. Even if the world is on fire, these people will find a way to sell you insurance on credit. The economy has existed since before the old testament. Exodus 30:11-16  is just ancient hebrew tax law. Even if it's not money, people will find something to trade to create value. The wheel keeps on turning.\n\nEDIT: Totally forgot, look at MSFT 10K. B2B OEM sales are the bread and butter. So you will need to see large retailers (including amazon) collapse before companies like intel and MSFT will feel the big hits.",

I was super-excited, had all of the right clothes to wear, and was definitely looking forward to flossing the new-and-improved me.  The first party was definitely cool, as I felt my way around, filled with nervousness and anticipation.  I laughed off the fact I didn't actually go home with a woman that first night, or even get a number, or even talk to a woman, but I had a nice buzz and was prepared for my next shot.   It was kind of like my bet on Dominoes this earning's season, in hindsight it didn't work out, but I had done the research and looked forward to the next round.\n\nThe next few parties in college, I began to resent how easy it seemed to be for everybody else to have a good time, and get apparently what I was looking for.  I was beginning to get less and less optimistic, and that initial sense of euphoria and confidence was slowly turning into self-loathing and the feeling of petulance of not belonging there.  As I bet AMZN and MSFT this earnings season, the same feeling became me.  Why didn't I just click on FB instead, why did I blow $1600 on an expiring weekend SPY Put.  None of it makes sense, to anybody.  \n\nEventually at the end of my freshman year, I realized that parties weren't for me, and maybe I'm just a weirdo.  Maybe earnings aren't for me either, but I could just be broke.  In either event, I have no business being there or here.",

In fact, I would say that NVDA and AMD are far more analogous to each other than even AMD -&gt; AAPL, and certainly to MSFT. The  way that I see it, NVDA/AMD are fundamentally companies that are concerned with producing a *physical good* \\- literal chipsets and dies. AAPL seems to waver on the hardware side of things (they have been known to go proprietary in that arena, but have also loaned out work to INTC on more than one occasion). I most certainly see MSFT as a true software/PaaS/SaaS company - suffice to say that they are producing very little in the way of physical goods.\n\nI think the *soft/hardware* direction is important to mention, because that fundamentally plays into the way that these companies deal in the market. Developing hardware is a mind-bendingly expensive process (relatively speaking). It takes years of R&amp;D and cash on hand to fund something that is truly great. An example of this would be the move AMD made to Zen (which is based on the concept of 'chiplets'; highly-scalable many-core designs that are fundamentally different from their monolithic predecessors).\n\nIn terms of growth, I would have to say that I see two viable options here: *NVDA and MSFT*. MSFT is pretty easy to explain; they create a product that fundamentally has lower upstart costs (software development's most expensive attribute is the cost of human labor) and lower maintenance costs (I would think). There is some movement towards a more data-center driven profit scheme (which would require boots on ground hardware en masse), and Azure is certainly an AWS competitor, but I think we've yet to see them really go full throttle on that (I think it could be big if they did).\n\nNVDA is a leader from a technological perspective. GPU compute-cores are very specialized devices that are good at doing only a few things, but very, *very well.* NVDA has been hammering away at this technology for years - they know the game, and they know where the money is. Autonomous cars, drones...the computer viz recogition software for postal, for literally anything, runs on a platform that is fundamentally a GPU (very high level view here). Machine learning applications in this field at the data-center level (think machine learning on AWS) are absolutely dominated by NVDA; In fact I would go as far as to say there aren't really a lot of competitors out there that are bringing to the table what NVDA does (Honestly AMD has severely gimped even their consumer dies at this point).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can elaborate more, but I'd go with MSFT and NVDA on this one.",

I do not understand why it is not showing up in the stock market more (yes I do know about the stimulus effects, and people fleeing bonds for stocks).  Boeing, Tyson Foods, GE, IBM, Oracle, all the commodities companies are going to be seeing double digit percentage decreases in their sales and revenues.  I feel like Boeing has to go bankrupt, and so many of their suppliers will too.\n\nThe market for many products, e.g. commercial real estate, airplanes, oil drilling equipment, has literally disappeared, and the stock market has not priced that in yet.\n\nThe Fed has propped up an enormous bubble with their actions, but the economy doesn't reflect what they have created.  \n\nAt some point the central banks will have to let SOME investors get wiped out, and that is going to be a very unhappy day on the stock markets.\n\nFord and GM are in staggeringly bad financial shape, nobody is saying anything about it.  Every major airline is going to be going through a bankruptcy cycle, Disney is likely to lose 75% of their revenue for the year.  How the hell can the indexes be at these levels?",

So why buy Berkshire instead of an index?  It has only 1 real tech exposure, Apple, so if you think tech is a bubble it's an incredibly safe investment relative to the market at large, which is being dragged upwards by tech.\n\nThat said, I don't invest in BRK personally. I just think you'd be dumb to downplay his incredible success for such a long period just because market fundamentals are incredibly hard to exercise on tech. \n\nThe only way to invest that much capital in that sector is to blow your load everywhere like Masayoshi Son, become the richest man in the world, then lose the largest amount of money in history when the bubble inevitably pops.",

        "body": "Google is search based on text and hoping websites adjust to that using SEO soft influence. Their banners are more and more lowering quality of search and overall search use is dropping due to apps and closed websites. They are big but a niche. Their model works for specific products only.\n\nFacebook is a developing world family and friendship automation. A lot of room to grow in places like Bangladesh. But technology which delivers value to customers is actually simple and they can easily be replaced. They are based on soft value not tech. \n\nAmazon us big in USA. It is a big country which used mail order catalogs way before internet. You can not have a store everywhere in America. Rest of the world isn't like that. They have been adding value to their offering because they want to offer the most for least like all retail but eventually someone will take this over. Just that their competitor can not be in USA or Europe. Europe is too small.\n\nData means nothing to customers. Customers want value for money. Data maybe can help speed up selection within millions of products but this doesn't really work as good as they promise. Ads and e-commerce recommendations are very much off once shoppers are not super easy predictable. Data and AI are a hype.\n\nMicrosoft also is a business software company with some diversification. In business it succeeds just like SAP and Oracle etc. It enters and it is hard to get it out. Not many players there as well as CIOs don't take much risk. But it's success is not because of them but simply because of digitalisation and globalisation. Microsoft itself hasn't created any relevant competitive value. They are just a big political entity in the right time and place. If something changes for them it will also change for SAP Oracle IBM etc. But they appear to be different because of hardware and games (more consumer) and Bill Gates always spent a lot on his PR.",

        "body": "&gt;That's why Buffett is hoarding cash.\n\nAlso, another thing. Why the fuck would you \"hoard\" something that's being handed out like candy? That's like those tards that bought up all the TP at walmart and then were caught trying to return it in two weeks because nobody was buying. Yea sure some people didn't have enough in the bathroom (savings) and maybe ran low until they implemented purchase limits (unemployment being raised by $600 a WEEK), but fucking again, what TP factories blew up? people aren't shitting more except traders figuratively, so you wait for the next shipment or two that was coming anyway and now you got your TP. Like seriously? They just dumped like 2-3 Tah-rilllllion dollars and most of it to companies to pay people, and to go directly to the one's no longer at companies. So most people have the cash they would normally expect because most people don't make shit. You know how much of that was to pay Buffett what he normally expects? Anybody over 100,000 didn't get what they usually make and if anything they probably sold part of their holdings in the crash. Instead, you have people wondering whether they should get their cash from unemployment or from their employer, worried that they'll get hired back too soon and lose some of it. Yes, hoard cash when the government is pumping out trillions and sell when the market is at a 40% discount. Oracle. Genius.",
