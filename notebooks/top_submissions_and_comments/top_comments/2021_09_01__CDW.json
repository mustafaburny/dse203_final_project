Valuation is reasonable considering revenue. It\u2019ll benefit from the growth in big tech companies.\n\nXYL - water technology provider in residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial settings. Provides an essential service. Valuation is high at the moment, but it looks like a good long-term hold.\n\nASO and DHR as mentioned by others here.\n\nI don\u2019t have a position in any of these, but I\u2019ve been following them so that I can buy them in the near future.",
