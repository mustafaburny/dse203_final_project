I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.  \nTesla is boasting about FSD(which is between a very good cruise and a poor self driver).

Their executives literally have explicitly stated that they can deploy Foundry fully remotely and don't require remote engineers to distribute their product to medium or small size clients in the last month they have outright stated this. Things like releasing announcements of Palantir foundry for builders or \"startups\" is excellent proof of this.\n\nTheir partnerships with Amazon and IBM are literally just ways of Foundry on apollo AI framework being sold by those companies packaged together with other products to sell to other companies. That's 100% scaleable and it's why their commercial clients are increasing quarter to quarter domestically and internationally. \n\nThey have distribution channels doing their work for them and are objectively not a consultancy company in Foundry. They have shown ample evidence that Foundry works out if the box just fine for enough medium and small size clients to be scalable and I think soon we will see proof of this even for large clients. \n\nThere's zero evidence that will have to slow down and as their TAM hears their brand and learns about their product. There's zero evidence that they are facing problems with scalability. However there has been consistent evidence all year that they have entirely solved it or they have continually gone far in the right direction. They increased expenses because of hiring and releasing Foundry for free during palantir unlock at the beginning of the year but their margins would've already improved if they weren't so focused on growth.",

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.

Selling the call spread is a little bit easier to predict what you'll make. If you buy a put spread, the vol collapse and the spread having to go fully ITM to realize a full gain has more variables at work. You can buy the put spread and still lose even with having the direction right.\n\nWorking myself out of a put that is ITM right now.\n\nI'm looking to get out next week and waiting until earnings to put new positions on.  \n\nI wouldn't be betting against MU just because spot prices are falling. That means supply chains are working their way out and that they will be producing at capacity vs charging a little bit more per diminished output. They can actually make more money overall at lower prices. This will be a quicker price recovery than the 2011 Fukushima earthquake. Demand is not going away.",
