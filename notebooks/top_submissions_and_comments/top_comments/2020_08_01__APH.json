Aph isn't remotely large enough to buy a well-known, national US cpg brand to begin with, but then more importantly, how does that brand then allow them to enter US cannabis state markets in a meaningful way? Any legalization framework will take years to develop, so it's not like state markets are about to open up their licensing programs right after the November election. Aph will need state cannabis licenses to operate like everyone else and buying a non-cannabis brand doesn't help in that regard. Seems like a very long-term development at best\n\nAph seems to have pretty popular brands in Canada. I don't see much a difference in trying to just push those brands in the US whenever possible",
