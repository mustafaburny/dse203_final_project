This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.\n\n\"Repeat after me: stocks only go up,\" Powell demands.\n\nI say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&amp;P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.\n\nPowell frowns and continues, \"I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nI feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, \"GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-\" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long.

It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.\n\nThe first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened.

        "body": "Credit goes to u/TheGreatPoopFarmer for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:\n\nStocks only go up\n\nThis economic data looks grim, I think to myself. This is the right move. I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.\n\nI come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&amp;P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.\n\nI hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. \"What am I-\"\n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he asks.\n\n\"Huh?\" I respond, confused.\n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he demands, louder this time.\n\n\"I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-\" WHAM! One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.\n\n\"It's priced in,\" he says coolly. \"So why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nDizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&amp;P has climbed back to 2850. Impossible, I think to myself. \"Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!\" I manage to answer. WHAM! Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.\n\n\"Repeat after me: stocks only go up,\" Powell demands.\n\nI say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&amp;P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary guh escapes my mouth as it falls agape.\n\nPowell frowns and continues, \"I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nI feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, \"GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-\" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&amp;P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.\n\nThe first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" I say.",

When you're retired with a 2M portfolio, you'd take out say 4% per year between 2% dividends and selling 2% of the shares. It would grow faster than that in most good cycles and you'd be able to sustain your pre-retirement income for many years.  \n\nIf you're investing for a medium term goal, you might start by buying stocks but gradually transition to bonds as you get closer to the goal so you have more certainty of its value in the near ter.  \n\nIf you're investing in individual stocks, you may want to check on them more often. You'd buy companies that you evaluate to be undervalued compared to their future discounted cashflows, or companies that you believe others will want to buy more of in the short term. Some of those stocks you'll be able to hold long term and buy more, but the circumstances might change for others and you'll want to reduce your holdings. Maybe they rapidly rise and become overvalued in your estimation, or maybe their fundamentals decline due to other competitors.",

TSMC has stated that prices will go up for new orders, but they are still working through the backlog that has been under contract for some time, and the new pricing won't take effect yet. This, plus the threat of China, is what's keeping the $TSM price depressed right now. Beyond that, they have nothing but tailwinds from a business perspective for the next several years. \n\nLook for the semicaps ($AMAT, $ASML, $TER, $LRCX, $KLAC, et al) if you want plays that will see action first from the TSMC, Intel and Samsung capex spending. The fabs will benefit from this capex second, while the fabless companies ($NVDA, $AMD, $AAPL, etc.) will see the benefit of this extra capacity last.",

I do think Brexit exasperated the covid downtrend and will hamper the UK's recovery. \n\nYou can already see that in the FTSE100 being still below the pre-pandemic highs when the S&amp;P, DAX, CAC, Shanghai, N225, SENSEX, and anyone else even halfway competent are all above their pre-pandemic highs. Brexit has closed the UK off from others which is bad for business.\n\nCANZUK should be a priority along with getting a strong trade agreement with the US (Biden winning was a win for the UK as Trump had publicly thrown the UK under the bus on multiple occasions).\n\nBack to the FTSE100. While it is indeed cheap. Low price is not always value. Low valuation is there for a reason. I'll wait until I see how the UK government executes their post-brexit geo-political economic master plan before putting my money in. I think it's a better idea to go into Brazil since their problems are mainly due to covid, easier for Brazilians to remove their poor leadership than it is for the UK to form international trade/travel/business agreements, and the current commodity boom will surely boost Brazil's economy which mostly works off nat good exports compared to the uncertainty of how the British economy will evolve in the future.",
