        "body": "\"So, JW made bank off a 12.5% loan to TER (some of which may still be outstanding?). Canopy paid off that debt to JW (seems unlikely this was paid in full, right?)\"\n\nCan you elaborate on this statement? It seems to contradict itself, as it's pretty clear that the entirety of the 12.5% legacy note has been paid off. Page 20 of their Q1 statements confirms this. \"Of the total proceeds received from Canopy Growth, $64,718 was used to fully pay off the outstanding principal and interest amounts under the Credit Facility with JW Asset Management and $8,494 is restricted for use in Canadian operations and is held in a segregated bank account\"\n\nLet's now address the terms of the Canopy loan itself. Obviously the annual interest rate of 6.1% is an extremely attractive rate, especially in this environment. The loan also matures in 2030, so there is flexibility baked in there in addition to the implicit inference that Canopy is eyeing the Terrascend as part of their future US expansion plan (not exactly a secret, mind you). Obviously the rosy terms come with the warrants attached to it, but 88% of the warrants come at an exercise price of C$5.14, a 68% premium above Friday's closing price of C$3.06, and the remaining batch of warrants at C$3.74. Not exactly what I'd call \"cheap\" paper here, and none of these are even exerciseable until US Federal law is changed so the eventual dilution could be years away. Seems like a pretty great trade off for cutting the annual interest expense in half for a large note, even if the funds can't be used for US expansion. (although I would assume the debt being retired also had that limitation)\n\nAs for the recent raise with JW, it's not quite as shareholder friendly with convertible shares at $2 US and warrants at $3 US but in the current environment there are certainly way worse raises out there. Couple this with the net Cash from the Canopy loan and these 2 transactions added $45.5M in cash to the books (albeit with $8.5M restricted to Canada, but per their Q1 conference call they are now fully funded for current CAPEX with extra to spare for M&amp;A). \n\nI think it is important to ask the questions you have brought up when we see the shuffling of the cards like this, but to me it's hard to argue this as a direct blow to shareholders. The $37M raise ($20M attributable to JWAM) definitely grows the interest Jason Wild has in Terrascend, but to me the exercise price on the raise is tolerable when you consider how hard it is to raise capital in the industry right now. \n\nThank you for your post! I would welcome further discussion on this. (Love the Bowie reference btw)",

My previous comment assumed that was what happened.  But I hadn't seen confirmation of it.  I don't hold Terrascend, so I didn't dig into their MD&amp;A.\n \n&gt; Let's now address the terms of the Canopy loan itself. Obviously the annual interest rate of 6.1% is an extremely attractive rate, especially in this environment. \n\nAgreed.  Win-win for both sides.  That's a nice roi for Canopy, and a great rate for an MSO.\n\n&gt; The loan also matures in 2030, so there is flexibility baked in there in addition to the implicit inference that Canopy is eyeing the Terrascend as part of their future US expansion plan (not exactly a secret, mind you). \n\nI'm not as confident about this as you are.  2030 is definitely very compelling.  As is the interest rate.  But we've seen plenty of loans re-negotiated to the benefit of the investor once the target company falls on hard times.  Iirc, this loan by Canopy is not secured (which surprised me, in a good way).  So, perhaps there isn't as much leverage their as there was for other lenders.  But I guess I'm just more skeptical that ever when it comes to large players issuing sizeable debt facilities to fledgling companies.\n\n&gt; Obviously the rosy terms come with the warrants attached to it, but 88% of the warrants come at an exercise price of C$5.14, a 68% premium above Friday's closing price of C$3.06, and the remaining batch of warrants at C$3.74. Not exactly what I'd call \"cheap\" paper here\n\nAgain, agreed.  The pricing was fairly decent.  As for cheap paper, though...if you feel that isn't cheap, then do you also feel there isn't much upside on the horizon for Terrascend?  Assuming they're worth what you believe they will be in a year (let alone once legalization happens), isn't this actually a sizeable amount of cheap overhang?\n\n&gt; none of these are even exerciseable until US Federal law is changed so the eventual dilution could be years away. \n\nIs that true for JW?  Or are you just talking about Canopy here?\n\n&gt; Seems like a pretty great trade off for cutting the annual interest expense in half for a large note, even if the funds can't be used for US expansion. \n\nThey definitely improved their debt liability substantially.  I just worry that the refi came with some substantial talon hooks from Canopy and JW.  We talked about the Canopy warrants, but don't forget about the 40M optional shares issued to JW alongside this refi.  \n\n&gt; although I would assume the debt being retired also had that limitation\n\nI would guess the opposite.  JW is private equity, right?  There's no limitations on where their funds can go.  Canopy had to structure it this way because of public listing regs.\n\n&gt; As for the recent raise with JW, it's not quite as shareholder friendly with convertible shares at $2 US and warrants at $3 US but in the current environment there are certainly way worse raises out there. \n\nGlad this was addressed.  There may be worse raises out there, but that doesn't change the fact that this was quite the sacrifice for access to capital.  That's a lot of cheap cheap shares coupled with warrants, the perfect PE hedged short strategy.  **[This article is well worth a read if you haven't seen it already.](https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/how-a-handful-of-hedge-funds-cornered-cannabis-financing-and-made-a-killing-in-the-process)**\n\n&gt; I think it is important to ask the questions you have brought up when we see the shuffling of the cards like this, but to me it's hard to argue this as a direct blow to shareholders. \n\nAgain, I'd strongly recommend reading the article I linked above if you aren't already familiar with it.  I'm less concerned with Canopy's interest than I am with JW's.  It reeks of hedge fund fuckery that preys on retail lemmings for profit.\n\n&gt; The $37M raise ($20M attributable to JWAM) definitely grows the interest Jason Wild has in Terrascend, but to me the exercise price on the raise is tolerable when you consider how hard it is to raise capital in the industry right now.\n\nAnd again, just because the environment's tough and others are falling into the same (or worse) traps...that doesn't mean this is good for Terrascend's existing (and future) retail shareholders.\n\nAlso, I'm not familiar with Jason Wild.  What's his story?\n\n&gt; Love the Bowie reference btw\n\nHa, thanks!  From the jump my flair has been a long run of Space Oddity lyrics, selected to fit the shifting mood of the cannabis market.  I jumped to Moonage Daydream once the bubble burst, though.  Felt more apropos.",

TER has indicated they are moving away from these segments which is good, but these have only drained on TER\u2019s financials performance from the beginning.\n\nI\u2019m hoping poor macroeconomic development due to Covid resurgence in the US will lead to another buying opportunity cause Q2 should be the best financials in history.",

Some of the old links to letters are fascinating and I have learned a ton just following along. \n\nAnyways, one of the company's I have been researching over the past almost year is Teradyne. While reading their latest 10Q, I come across the below paragraph under their revenue section which describes them selling their accounts receivables to third-parties. I am unfamiliar with the mechanics of this and how the below works, if someone could point me in the right direction for a resource or provide a quick explainer that would be great.\n\nFrom 10Q:\n\n *Accounts Receivable*\n\n*Teradyne sells certain trade accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. Teradyne accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as a cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring agreements were $46.8\u00a0million and $41.7\u00a0million for the three months ended March\u00a029, 2020 and March\u00a031, 2019, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in interest expense and were not material.*\n\nI am looking for a possible reason that they might sell their accounts receivables and if this is possibly any type of red flag? When I peruse Google, it seems that a typical reason that a company would sell accounts receivables is to raise cash, but TER typically has a good amount of cash on hand. \n\nI appreciate any help,",

For every GTII there are 10 MARIs and HVTs. Don't buy based on these posts. Do your own dd and make your own decisions. Fyi 2020 revenues will be 175-200ish milly assuming modest growth after q1 (guidance on q2 was 30% qoq growth for 45m).  And never invest based on news that may or may not happen. I personally love their PA operations and strategy even without NJ. And quarterly revenue 300-400 mil? Hahaha no no no I meant annual of course for 2021. It's a conservative estimation really. Could do better. \n\nThe cgc ties are largely useless to me as well as I noted. But the fact that acreage is a tire fire is a good thing for TER, not a bad thing. They become the obvious choice if those doors ever open up. I'd never hold that longterm so it's meaningless for me but it's not a negative.\n\n\nAnyway I ran trul and gtii up hard but recently opened a position in TER at 2.80. I agree with your point. Stick to the winners. Avoid the tire fire speculative trash. There are only three or four names worth playing in this space. TER is a bit more speculative but the risk-reward is advantageous at these levels.\n\nA lot of people complain about this sector and sometimes I feel I'm the only one who knows how to navigate this space, particularly in the low volume cse names. You have an edge; not everything is priced in on those names. Do your dd and they will eventually have their time in the sunlight. GTII and TRUL have been my horses the last couple years and rode them hard, sold and rebought lower several times over. It's not too complicated in the end.\n\n\n Sometimes it's not about picking the best names, it's about finding value. My dd leads me to believe that TER at their current valuation is as good as or a better deal than the big boys at their valuations.  Maybe I'm wrong but I think we need to relax on calling out dd or opinion posts. It's a good reason why this place is dead nowadays. You post something positive: pump and dump!!! Negative? YOU'RE SHORTING!!!! Anyone who blindly buys based on these posts needs to stop investing anyway. I don't expect anyone to. But back in this sub's glory days, dd was at a premium and welcome with open arms. Many names were brought to my attention that made me plenty of money. I was appreciative of the dd but of course I did my own reading independently before buying. I hope you guys do as well.",
