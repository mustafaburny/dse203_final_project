        "body": "Hi all,\n\nI have been following the subreddit for a while now and I have to say I am a big fan of reading some of the in-depth analysis provided here. Some of the old links to letters are fascinating and I have learned a ton just following along. \n\nAnyways, one of the company's I have been researching over the past almost year is Teradyne. While reading their latest 10Q, I come across the below paragraph under their revenue section which describes them selling their accounts receivables to third-parties. I am unfamiliar with the mechanics of this and how the below works, if someone could point me in the right direction for a resource or provide a quick explainer that would be great.\n\nFrom 10Q:\n\n *Accounts Receivable*\n\n*Teradyne sells certain trade accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. Teradyne accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as a cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring agreements were $46.8\u00a0million and $41.7\u00a0million for the three months ended March\u00a029, 2020 and March\u00a031, 2019, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in interest expense and were not material.*\n\nI am looking for a possible reason that they might sell their accounts receivables and if this is possibly any type of red flag? When I peruse Google, it seems that a typical reason that a company would sell accounts receivables is to raise cash, but TER typically has a good amount of cash on hand. \n\nI appreciate any help,",

Is there any article about mixed funds and how to understand bond performance?  \n I dont understand how the yield etc works in such a funds. but I would think paying 1.45% TER for this is rediculous?   \nHow do they justify this TER for bonds if bonds return less in general? Or would they be good at buying bonds at a low price and sell them high before maturity?  \nThanks!",
