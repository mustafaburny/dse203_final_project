        "body": "Possibly Very Bullish Sectors for the Next 3-12 Months Amid Troubled Times. The examples below are certainly not buy recommendations. Just examples.\n\nBelow is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\nAnyway enjoy the dips now because these are likely to get beefed up as the supply chain &amp; worker shortages unwind\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

Intel has been an iconic business for my entire adult lifetime and has survived many troubles. I'm not looking for a moon stock, just something that is likely to keep It's value for the next 20 years or so, grow modestly, and keep paying the dividend. Bleeding edge chips are not going to fuel growth forever. Soon we will reach the limits and needs of human perception, and performance/graphics improvements won't have as much value as in the past.\n\nThe covid and climate crises appear to predict a contraction in globalization  and a simplification of supply chains, which may benefit Intel in the near future. Its name recognition, market cap, low p/e, importance to American interests, and forward looking attitude all indicate a \"buy\" to me.

For a long time I have been trying to convince my friend to drop Intel stock (mostly based on their shrinking market share, your data nicely adds), but he still believes in the power of inertia. Nevertheless, I had gathered a list of stocks one IMO can use instead, not overperformative, but solid. \n\nI think that top pick is ASML - instead of betting on a sloppy big player in a growing market, you switch to the main supplier of players in this market. \nTexas Instruments and Analog Devices are good picks if you trust in the electronics segment as a whole, and they provide a wider product mix in terms of electronic components and integrated circuits.\nAnd my favorites also are companies, that produce good measurement instruments. I do solid state physics, and there is funny coincidence - producers of devices I like and use generally show good performance at a stock market. Those are Ametek, Agilent, Keysight, Danaher (Fortive).\n\nWhether you have the opinion on these companies, I would highly appreciate it.",

These are long term investments for my portfolio though\n\nMy actual dividend portfolio only consists of O, IRM, and IEP. In that order, they increase in yield percentage. IEP pays the most at 8 dollars a year for a nice yield of 14.61%. Dividend stocks are great but can quickly be unprofitable if the losses offset the payout so its good to buy dips and monitor performance as needed.",

I will just mention the main one along with some publicly traded companies.  The main buzz word or \"thrust\" right now is \"Digital Twins\" for \"remote viewing.\"  Matterport MTTR is mapping and storing the interiors of the world which will be used at some point in the future for the metaverse.  The reverse of this is Snapchat SNAP whose glasses will merge the digital world into your viewing and will be able to record the two together for content posting.  A larger aspect is that 5G is using mmWaves so that mmWave radar can also be part of the 5G towers.  This will allow unmanned drones to fly and film and allow remote viewing in real-time.  MmWave radar chips are now being added to phones (I think mostly from TXN) so that the drones can ping them to navigate indoors unmanned.  These chips also are supposed to work with augmented reality Snapchat or Magic Leap type apps.  Not investment advice.  This is a very boring post for a subject I'm actually excited about.

        "body": "My favorites are blue chip/large cap stocks and I've made some nice returns by doing so. They are not risk-free but way less risk compared to small caps/short squeezes. The strategy is literally buy low, sell high lol. Study the daily chart and find the lows and high of the stocks. Some stocks like to bounce within a range for weeks or even months.\n\nA super great example is TXN. It reached 197 in April and it usually bounces down to its lows (174-180) and bounces back up to 190s. It has repeated this pattern for MONTHS and just yesterday, it hit 186 and today it bounced right back up. AXP has also been fairly predictable, lows (155-161), and highs (171-179). When stocks break out of their range, then I usually stop trading it for awhile to see the new boundaries. At what price you sell is up to you, but my minimum goal is a 2% return but if the stock is looking strong I try to aim for 5% or above. During this choppy market recently, I've also been having major fun with SBUX, V, WM, UPS, AMD, VTI.",

I know the Army swears allegiance to the CCP instead of the nation. That the CCP rules as the please from Zhongnanhai without regard to laws.  They are content to practice hostage diplomacy like they did with the two Michael's to free Meng Wanzhou and they seem confused when western counties can't simply disregard the courts and do as they please like China. That the Belt and Road initiative is just neo colonialism to steal resources and strategic ports from poor nations. That the Uighurs face slave labor and genocide by controlling birth rates and harvesting organs like Falun Gong practitioners. \n\nChina is not a free, fair, or open market. Ask Jack Ma who got disappeared by them. Look at their national security laws, and how they annex neighborhoods and force their will on them. How they alter maps and globes to include the 9 dash line and pretend it is part of Chinese territory like the Scarborough shoal despite court rulings.\n\nSo tell me how elections matter when China can decide who is on the ballot to prevent a true opposition and use the national security law to disappear opposition?\n\nCall me a typical American, but my eyes are open to the actions of the CCP.",

The benefit they have in the long run in owning the hardware, software, and network, is that they can eliminate Visa and MasterCard from the equation.  If someone uses the Cash app to buy directly from a SQ terminal, the could reduce the charge from 2-3% (of which they get a small cut) to 0-5-1% (of which they get all).  SQ wins, merchant wins, but V and MC lose on such a transaction. PayPal is trying to build a similar network, but doesn\u2019t have as much traction with in person terminals.",

Are the expanding market share, is the sector growing, etc.  I need the company to justify why it can achieve or surpass their growth estimates.\n\nI listen to their most recent conference calls and look though any articles I can find, but I heavily discount opinion pieces.  I actively seek out reasons why this company will fail.\n\nAfter all of this, I try to put together a balanced view of where the company is valued now vs historically and also vs their competition.  It requires a lot of projection and assumptions and I only do it for companies that I can understand their business model.  You have to go into the process without bias, and to be honest the majority of companies that I do this for aren't buys at the time.",
