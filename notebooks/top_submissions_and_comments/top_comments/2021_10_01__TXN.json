        "body": "Possibly Very Bullish Sectors for the Next 3-12 Months Amid Troubled Times. The examples below are certainly not buy recommendations. Just examples.\n\nBelow is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\nAnyway enjoy the dips now because these are likely to get beefed up as the supply chain &amp; worker shortages unwind\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

Intel has been an iconic business for my entire adult lifetime and has survived many troubles. I'm not looking for a moon stock, just something that is likely to keep It's value for the next 20 years or so, grow modestly, and keep paying the dividend. Bleeding edge chips are not going to fuel growth forever. Soon we will reach the limits and needs of human perception, and performance/graphics improvements won't have as much value as in the past.\n\nThe covid and climate crises appear to predict a contraction in globalization  and a simplification of supply chains, which may benefit Intel in the near future. Its name recognition, market cap, low p/e, importance to American interests, and forward looking attitude all indicate a \"buy\" to me. I see Texas Instruments  taking advantage of the current situation as well.",

        "body": "Thank you so much for these two meaningful and insightful posts. For a long time I have been trying to convince my friend to drop Intel stock (mostly based on their shrinking market share, your data nicely adds), but he still believes in the power of inertia. Nevertheless, I had gathered a list of stocks one IMO can use instead, not overperformative, but solid. \n\nI think that top pick is ASML - instead of betting on a sloppy big player in a growing market, you switch to the main supplier of players in this market. \nTexas Instruments and Analog Devices are good picks if you trust in the electronics segment as a whole, and they provide a wider product mix in terms of electronic components and integrated circuits.\nAnd my favorites also are companies, that produce good measurement instruments. I do solid state physics, and there is funny coincidence - producers of devices I like and use generally show good performance at a stock market. Those are Ametek, Agilent, Keysight, Danaher (Fortive).\n\nWhether you have the opinion on these companies, I would highly appreciate it.",

I will just mention the main one along with some publicly traded companies.  The main buzz word or \"thrust\" right now is \"Digital Twins\" for \"remote viewing.\"  Matterport MTTR is mapping and storing the interiors of the world which will be used at some point in the future for the metaverse.  The reverse of this is Snapchat SNAP whose glasses will merge the digital world into your viewing and will be able to record the two together for content posting.  A larger aspect is that 5G is using mmWaves so that mmWave radar can also be part of the 5G towers.  This will allow unmanned drones to fly and film and allow remote viewing in real-time.  MmWave radar chips are now being added to phones (I think mostly from TXN) so that the drones can ping them to navigate indoors unmanned.  These chips also are supposed to work with augmented reality Snapchat or Magic Leap type apps.  Not investment advice.  This is a very boring post for a subject I'm actually excited about.

The strategy is literally buy low, sell high lol. Study the daily chart and find the lows and high of the stocks. Some stocks like to bounce within a range for weeks or even months.\n\nA super great example is TXN. It reached 197 in April and it usually bounces down to its lows (174-180) and bounces back up to 190s. It has repeated this pattern for MONTHS and just yesterday, it hit 186 and today it bounced right back up. AXP has also been fairly predictable, lows (155-161), and highs (171-179). When stocks break out of their range, then I usually stop trading it for awhile to see the new boundaries. At what price you sell is up to you, but my minimum goal is a 2% return but if the stock is looking strong I try to aim for 5% or above.

Migrant remittance used to flow almost entirely through Western Union, who was taking a significant chunk for the service. Now you can go to an ATM, drop some cash in, and get a BTC token that you can send digitally back home to your family. No banks, no middle men, no governments involved. Suddenly these people are seeing as much as a 25% increase in the amount they can send home because they're not paying WU to do it anymore.\n\nPersonally, legality aside, I like the idea of being able to move to another country and take all of my money with me in a device that's secure and portable, without having to worry about declarations or whether I qualify as a resident for their banks or whatever.",

There is some income inflation, and a few other things that are likely to be \"sticky\", but a lot of it will go away once a supply/demand equilibrium is reestablished.\n\nThe real inflation is still hiding in monetary policy.   The Wu-Xia shadow estimate of the Fed rate is -1.81%.  The Mankiw estimate of what Fed rate should be is ~8%.   So the current Fed rate is ~10% below where it should be.   That's massively inflationary, which is why investment assets like stocks and real estate are massively overvalued right now.  But there's no way the Fed can substantially narrow that gap without crashing the economy.   So once asset inflation starts leaking into the broader economy, I suspect inflation will take off in a sustained manner.",

Idk exactly what the catalyst was at that time, but I imagine the WSB hype added to the push (+good Q2). The stocks have been moving very similarly apart from that bull run. \n\nIts impossible to say how aware of the full picture the average retail investor is, but my guess is that they've barely heard of Xilinx whilst AMD is more of a household name. \n\nCheck out this link for ratio movement over time: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio",

As a share holder of AMD and TSM I have to say there are always down side in this sector. The two big thing are the numbers of players in the semiconductor manufacturer. There are a lot! AMD is a ant company compare to Intel, Samsung and TSMC. On top of that China SMIC is growing like a weed. This is why Lisa Su is trying to close the deal with Xilinx. She knows they need them to survive. It is though to be in semiconductor business. PLTR on the other has a huge moat it is national security business with next to zero competitor. However, the big issues with PLTR is that it is not a new company and yet its grow is extremely slow. They need to get more commercial clients if they plan to grow.",

I haven't checked since I bought a shitload at the start of August, but there's an arbitrage discount between the two for when xlnx will be converted into AMD. Should be happening any day/week now. \n\nLooking now, 1 xlnx becomes 1.7234 AMD post-merger. AMD is at ~$107 and xlnx is ~$160 today, and even though that's it's 52w high, it should be valued at $184 (107 x 1.7234) if the merger were to go through today. Obviously either stock could move as the one to close the gap and nothing is guaranteed, but worth looking into. \n\nJust make sure you buy a number of xlnx shares that gives a round number when you multiply it by 1.7234",

I think the market will be down pretty big in November and December.\n\nHalf of my portfolio is in cash. \n\nHalf of my portfolio is in play, and the reason it's still there is because I do believe there might be one more mini-bull rally before we get closer to November 2nd. My 2nd largest position is in AMD.\n\nMy plan is to try to milk whatever mini-bull rally happens prior to November 2nd. I see October 20th or 21st as the last chances to exit before everybody starts to get really nervous about November 2nd. Starting Monday, I only have about 8 or 9 more market days for half this portfolio.\n\nThen I might be jumping 100 percent to cash. This of course will be a temporary move, but I'm expecting November and December to just be months that most stock enthusiasts would like to forget. So, it's going to take a lot of discipline for me to hold out for the real lows that I'm expecting (at least 25 percent of all-time highs).\n\nBasically, I think when I buy back in either in November or December, I will load the boat with XLNX shares over AMD shares, but who knows if the spread will be as big then? Or maybe the merger will have been announced as final.",

Since they actually don't manufacture their chips and instead rely on TSMC for doing so, they are actually limited by the shortage. \n\nThey have the better product compared to Intel especially in the hugely important server market. They are gaining market share, but the lack of supply actually saves their rival at the moment. Similarly they'd have no problem selling more CPUs in the laptop/desktop market, chips for the PS5 or hugely in demand GPUs (even though nvidia still has an edge there). \n\nThey'll also buy Xilinx, which adds some nice synergies with the FPGAs. I feel like they most of all need to work on their software and GPUs, but they kind of already have the product range that nvidia would like to achieve by purchasing ARM (which so far doesn't seem to happen).",

I've traded the stock back and forth since February, and I can tell you that the stock was mostly not doing much of anything for long stretches, and then it finally had a big breakout, that pushed it above $100. This happened in this most recent 6 month period, so it seems like AMD is this outstanding performer in the most recent 6 months, but for 4 of those months, it didn't do much of anything.\n\nI still love AMD by the way. One of my favorite stocks going forward.\n\n(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",
