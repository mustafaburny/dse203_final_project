They may even give you advice on what to tell TDA in terms off how to structure/report it. They like these kinds of smart questions and also like folks who want to get their advice.

I know the market is in chaos at the moment but I figured either it will level out over time and everything will be OK or the world will end and I won't need to worry about mutual funds ever again anyway. I'm the kind of dummy who checks his funds every day (only started a Fidelity account last week, so I'm still just familiarizing myself with the whole process and learning about my options) and it can stress you out to no end watching everything fluctuate. But I know it's a long-term thing and I can't make decisions based on my emotional reactions to short-term fluctuations.
