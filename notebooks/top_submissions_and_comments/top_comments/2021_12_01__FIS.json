        "body": "So, I'm new to all this, just started last week by opening a Fidelity account. I previously had like 10k in checking, basically, and I'm slowly putting it into a few Fidelity mutual funds (FBALX and FXNAX). I bought a little PHO and SMH just to see how the whole process works and they looked kinda promising but they aren't really part of my plan, more like an experiment. Then later when I'm more familiar with the whole thing and they look like they're doing well, I can always focus more on them. But my main plan for investing/saving are these two Fidelity funds. I guess my question is: am I doing something stupid that just isn't apparent to me, being new? These two funds seem to cover a lot, so I'm pretty diversified between them. In fact there seems to be a little overlap, but that's probably OK? Also, is there any major reason to go with Fidelity vs Vanguard for funds like this? Aside from some apparently minor differences, they look to operate about the same, dare similar allocations, etc. I just hate being new, I need someone to tell me I'm not making horrible decisions. (Or that I am). Lol, thanks in advance!",

A SPAC (CFVI) can only combine with a single entity (that's why it's called an initial business combination vs. combinations) - in this case, they are combining with Rumble, so that's what you're going to get once the conversion is final (i.e. your CFVI shares will disappear and get replaced with Rumble ones). Unless the deal falls through (it is very rare, but it can happen - the Perishing Square SPAC is a good example), you will end up with Rumble shares in 2022.\n\nA word of advice (which you are free to ignore) from someone who has been investing for 20+ years: do a little bit of research on how SPACs work, even if it's a 10 min video. You're about to put hard earned money into something you don't understand the risks of.

        "body": "Welcome to r/investing. \n\nA couple of things - don't be gullible and fall victim to conspiracy theories. Most of the stuff about hedge funds have zero basis in reality. \n\nInvesting in the stock market isn't done through an app. It's a regulated financial transaction which is performed through a registered broker-dealer. That broker-dealer may offer an app to access their services. \n\nYou should choose your broker-dealer first based on their services and merits before ever deciding if you want to use their app. \n\nIf you already have a banking relationship - you can start there and see if your bank has a broker-dealer subsidiary. For example - Bank of America owns MerrillEdge. \n\nSince you have a 401k - is the 401k being administered by a broker-dealer like a Fidelity? That's another place to look to open your brokerage account.\n\nThe larger and more established retail broker-dealers are normally the ones to consider if you are new and unsure of the services that you need. For example - Fidelity, Vanguard, Merrill Edge, TD Admeritrade/Schwab, etc. \n\nLastly - make sure you understand the taxable benefits of considering IRA's and ROTH brokerage accounts first before opening a taxable brokerage account. See the Wiki on the top of this post for links to resources. Also - see the r/personalfinance wiki for things to consider before you invest other income.",

A broad ETF like SPY or QQQ is considered both sophisticated and suitable for a new person who is not investing his rent money.

Yes, go ahead and do partial shares if a full share is not convenient to buy.  \nBefore you invest in either SPY or QQQ, Google \u201cS&amp;P 500 Historical Annual Returns\u201d. See the lines going down? Make sure you\u2019re ok with that. Some years, Not only are there no profits for an entire year, there are also losses.

I usually do it twice a year. And as your risk tolerate changes - then consider reallocating to include fixed income funds as you get closer to retirement.",
