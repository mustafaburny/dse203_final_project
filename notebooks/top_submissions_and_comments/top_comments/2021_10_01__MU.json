It seems like everyone is chasing charts on high volume institutional phase 2 breakouts. \n\nWe\u2019re seeing huge trade volume numbers on stocks that are way overvalued, like in the tech sector. I\u2019m curious why there is not much trade volume in shipping, because the future earnings and revenue are massive, and they are waaaayyy undervalued.\n\nTake a look:\n\n\nSHIPPING\n- GSL (Global Ship Lease): 97% undervalued\n- GNK (Genco Shipping &amp; Trading): 89% undervalued\n- DAC (Danaos): 82% undervalued\n- EGLE (Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc.): 77% undervalued\n- ZIM (ZIM Integrated Shipping Services): 72% undervalued\n- DSX (Diana Shipping Inc.): 69% undervalued\n- SBLK (Star Bulk Carriers): 65% undervalued\n- EDRY (EuroDry): 56% undervalued\n- NMM (Navios Meritime): 48% undervalued\n- SB (Safe Bulkers): 47% undervalued\n\nBut then you also see huge undervaluation in the semiconductor industry.\n\nSEMICONDUCTORS \n- HIMX (Himax): 68% undervalued\n- MU (Micron Technology): 37% undervalued\n\nIn the energy/oil sector, we again see some huge under valuations, but at least there you also find high volume institutional investing and solid growth:\n\nENERGY/OIL\n- GPRE (Green Plains): 70% undervalued\n- CORR (CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust): 69% undervalued\n- BCEI (Bonanza Creek): 64% undervalued\n- MUR (Murphy Oil): 56% undervalued\n\nThere are plenty of other extreme examples like this, for instance in materials/mining.\n\nI\u2019m just curious why many of these stock prices don\u2019t see much volume trading, and they don\u2019t bubble up closer to their true intrinsic value\u2026",

Intel\u2019s forward looking guidance hasn\u2019t been the most reassuring either, so it\u2019s leading to current shareholders maintaining or trimming positions, not buying more. \n\nImo, only reason to have intel rn is if you already bought it at a cheaper price and like the dividend.",

I bought it when it was at $60 and the P/E ratio was 4. I thought it was a bargain, but it preceded to dumb to $30. Now its obviously up higher. Still would take a while compared to the S&amp;P 500.\n\nMicron is cyclical which changes things a little bit. But bottom line just because a company is doing well, any sort of shrinkage in revenues or market capture causes a stock to be discounted.\n\nIf Intel exited the CPU market AMD would explode. AMD is a smaller company still the compared to Intel to match appropriate TAM. AMD is not in the semiconductor game like Intel.\n\nIntel doesn't sell more CPUs then AMD. We don't have the metric for either company, but I think you would fine that AMD is selling more Desktop and Server CPUs then Intel for the past 2-3 years. Anyone that builds computers or is making a computer server would tell you that AMD's line of CPUs is a better value (generally). Production compacity has literally nothing to do with either.\n\nI think AMD is probably overvalued, but I would rather buy AMD then INTC, cause Intel's products are worse and its losing market share. Plus AMD's FCF is growing like crazy. They made $2 per share in free cash flow, up from 0.55 cents a year ago. Meanwhile Intel hasn't changed.\n\nThat's why there is disparity in price. Intel will have to take some time to fix itself and get its technology competitive. It will eventually, but in the mean time AMD still has a lot more room to run... imagine if they took 30% of server market... which is totally possible with only two competitors.",

        "body": "Possibly Very Bullish Sectors for the Next 3-12 Months Amid Troubled Times. The examples below are certainly not buy recommendations. Just examples.\n\nBelow is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\nAnyway enjoy the dips now because these are likely to get beefed up as the supply chain &amp; worker shortages unwind\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

MU's most recent guidance does suggest at least a near term stagnation in EPS, which the market will punish harshly.  \n\nThe DD that you need to do, is to figure out if you think this EPS stall is temporary or longer term.  I think look at their projections out towards 2025 and see if you think their capital investment plans can push EPS beyond the 2.50 mark.  If so, then the next 6 months could present a very good buying opportunity as the market punishes the short term stall.\n\nIf EPS is doomed to stagnate in the 2-2.20 range, then you'll see MU hold right around a 7 PE.",

Unless you have done extensive research and know the industry well statements like \"still has significant upside especially with ever increasing memory demand and strong financials\" are harbingers of poor returns. It is very very hard to time the cycle and many smart people been told to clear their desk because they timed it wrong so when I read something like that on Reddit of all places I always roll my eyes.\n\nIn any case if you truly want boring go with utilities or medical or consumer staples.",

RAM is theorized to have compounded growth as world industries embrace tech like AI big data computers mobile devices etc. Micron has oversupplied the market with its chips before, but now that\u2019s its more consciously aware of its oligopolistic standing in the world it will behave as such to benefit itself and shareholders.

This was completely understandable due to the supply constraints and disruption we have faced.\n\nHowever, now is appears to be spreading into most areas of the CPI - Housing, Food, Core goods and services, and perhaps most troublingly, it is now setting into the labour market. Once it gets settled into labour it really becomes a problem, because the only way out involves hurting people.\n\nThe situation in the 70s was actually very similar - it started with supply side shocks, monetary policy eased, the supply shocks eased, but by then the inflation had become endemic. What is really important about inflation is not so much the absolute rate of inflation, or how long it persists, but what people *expect* to happen. Once people believe it is happening, it will. People will unload money faster. Businesses will put prices up. Bosses will grant pay rises to their employees, landlords will put rents up, and it starts a cycle which cannot be stopped without very firm, even brutal, action.\n\nIt is still possible inflation falls back to target of it's own accord, and people continue to believe it is transient. But, we're on the edge of a precipice now, and the Fed should be watching the data extremely carefully and be ready to act if it continues to become broad-based, expected inflation.",

It was just really the last year or so where everyone bailed because no one wanted to hold the currency. The economy boomed while inflation soared because essentially it opened up a ton of business opportunities that are normally unsustainable. Basically, borrow now. Load up as mush debt as you can to buy assets. Real hard assets. Then turn around and sell and pay off your now inflated away debt. A lot of business whether they meant to or not settled in to this strategy.\n\nThis is really not political, this has been the build up of the fed policy since 2008. Both parties have accepted it since well what do you do otherwise?  Trump tried to pour gas on the economy during his term by pushing on the fed to be even more reckless. Then we had the pandemic and also a lot of money injected. Isn't likely hyperinflation but we will likely have some inflation from this. The economy is so weird right now, it feels like we have officially divorced from reality. However, who the fuck knows we are in new territory.",

        "body": "I tend to disagree with the hyperinflation narrative. If you look at currencies that fail throughout history, it ultimately is due to loss of confidence in the structural integrity of the economy that begins the cycle. Usually the political and socioeconomic backdrop is incredibly compromised (Venezuala, Zimbabwe, Weimar) or is recovering from extensive printing to finance war debts (also Weimar, greyback/greenback, continentals). The CERB, CEBA, CEWA payments were to prevent mass unemployment, homelessness, basically general economic collapse. It wasn't enriching people or business, it was helping them keep their heads above water. \n\nIn my humble opinion, people are also giving way to much attention to the relationship between QE and inflation, of which there isn't much evidence. Keep in mind, all the money is ending up in the banking system, not the consumers pocket. The general result of this is asset inflation (higher stock prices, lower short and long term bond yields, higher leverage leading to higher real estate prices). The average Canadian/American doesn't have much access to this liquidity unless they take out a loan, but that is usually used to finance a home or vehicle purchase (both areas that are absolutely inflated).\n\nI think there are major deflationary backdrops in the global economy that have given developed nations the luxury of being able to print the hell out of their currencies without consequence. This won't go on forever, and we will return to more normal interest and growth rates, and a general market crash or recession can pull liquidity out of the markets too. I'm honestly not all that concerned about hyperinflation. High inflation over the short term? Perhaps, but not collapse of the USD. \n\nIn regards to the BTC argument, I will say this: there is absolutely no correlation between BTC and inflation. Literally almost 0. The highest correlation BTC has with another financial asset? The S&amp;P 500. It is a high risk speculative asset, not a store of value or financial safehaven. Please don't treat it that way, as you are likely to lose a lot of money on paper if/when markets correct. The number one pumpers of BTC that are feeding these false narratives have no financial or economic education other than googling \"what is M2\" and now they are apprently experts, and they also have the vast majority of their net worth in BTC...so obviously they are going to say whatever they can to get the asset to go up in value. Major conflict of interest, and if they were publically pumping the price of a stock this way, the SEC would have them in prison instantly and banned from financial markets for life. My honest to God advice is block Michael Saylor (proven conman and fraud), Dan Held, Pomp, and anyone else who constantly pumps BTC's tires and refuses to listen to any counter arguments from experts in the field. It screams narcissism and cultish behavior, and people are all too eager to listen because they think BTC=\"freedom\" (it doesn't) or the whole world becoming wealthy (it won't). Tread very carefully in this space, it is far from a guarantee. Disclaimer: I also dislike Peter Schiff, so hopefully that appeases some of you \ud83d\ude02. \n\nGood luck investing my friends :)",

It\u2019s company hiring practices were created by some ancient archaic process that may have made sense 59 years ago, but with crappy technology of 10 years ago. \n\nApply to 500 jobs. 490 ghost you and never give you a status. 5 eventually send you a rejection 9-15 months later. 5 may call you. 3 will ghost you after that. 2 legit interviews. \n\nRecruiters will reach out to you and offer you less money than what your making now. I just had this happen last week. They reached out and offered me 35% less than I currently make to do a worse job. They seemed offended when I asked why I would even bother to consider that when it was the \u201cfinal offer\u201d. I was not looking and sure as hell not going to jump for that. \n\nWhen I was looking years ago - the resume upload only to renter the same information 50 times was soul crushing. I can see why people don\u2019t want to play the game. \n\nMy current job needs someone with a very specific very rare skill set. They have been headhunting for months. I found one. Sent them to the system had them apply and directly send the resume to the recruiter. \n\nThey \u201cdidn\u2019t think they are a fit\u201d without every reaching out.

        "body": "very startup has an origin story, a tale that illustrates its core principles. For Wealthsimple, that meant promoting low-fee, passive investing.\n\nAfter selling his first business about a decade ago, Wealthsimple co-founder Michael Katchen constructed a simple portfolio of exchange-traded funds using Microsoft Excel, then told the friends with whom he cashed out that this approach was the best way to invest their money.\n\nThe underlying premise: It\u2019s tough to outperform the market over the long run, so for most people it\u2019s better to invest in a mix of low-cost ETFs and ride the wave.\n\n\u201cThe feedback I got from my friends was, \u2018Mike, we\u2019re lazy. We love the system, but can you just please do it for us?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Katchen told The Globe and Mail in 2016. \u201cAnd they became the first 10 clients of Wealthsimple.\u201d\n\nThe concept proved popular with the millennial crowd, attracting billions of dollars in assets to Wealthsimple\u2019s so-called robo-adviser, and the company went so far as to buy Super Bowl ads preaching \u201csimple automated investing.\u201d In no time, Wealthsimple had so much buzz that people started to wonder if it would take down Bay Street\u2019s old guard.\n\nLately, so much of that seems like a past life. The company\u2019s automated platform still exists, but Wealthsimple is now advertising a day trading app for retail investors. And it\u2019s not just stocks \u2013 it is heavily promoting its new cryptocurrency business, which allows users to swap a slew of crypto assets.\n\nThe new strategy seems at odds with Wealthsimple\u2019s founding principles, particularly so with crypto, which is highly volatile and has some of the highest trading fees around. In a recent speech, Gary Gensler, the new head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, called the crypto market the Wild West, \u201crife with fraud, scams and abuse.\u201d China recently made all crypto transactions illegal.\n\nDespite the hard pivot, Wealthsimple has said little about its change of heart. When asked about the new strategy, no one was willing to be interviewed. Instead, the company sent e-mails explaining that it is diversifying to target different client segments.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to help everyone achieve financial freedom, no matter who they are or how much they have. That mission hasn\u2019t changed. We are a fast growing company building a full financial ecosystem for our clients across their savings, investing, spending, tax and crypto needs,\u201d Mr. Katchen wrote.\n\nAs for crypto\u2019s volatility, which prompted the SEC chair to call it a \u201chighly speculative asset class,\u201d Mr. Katchen does not believe that disqualifies it from inclusion in a well-rounded portfolio. Wealthsimple, he wrote, is \u201cvery comfortable recommending that our clients put their money in diversified, low-cost portfolios, while also supporting them if they wish to invest in particular companies or promising new technology.\u201d He also said that Wealthsimple is the first crypto platform to be regulated by a securities authority in Canada.\n\nWhat is happening at Wealthsimple is playing out in a similar fashion across the robo-adviser industry. Once-popular rivals in the United States, including Wealthfront and Betterment, are facing existential crises of their own. For all the billions of dollars that robo-advisers manage, it often isn\u2019t enough to turn a profit. Betterment\u2019s CEO stepped down last December, and its new leader acknowledged that an initial public offering likely was not possible until the company started making money.\n\n\u201cThese businesses operate on very tight margins. They just have extremely low fees, therefore they have to achieve pretty large scale before they\u2019re profitable,\u201d said David Goldstone, head of research and analytics at Backend Benchmarking, which tracks the robo-adviser market, in an interview.\n\nEven if a robo-adviser brings in tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue by charging around 0.5 per cent annually, the company has to spend heavily to attract new clients. \u201cThere was an industry-wide underestimation of how much it was going to cost to acquire customers,\u201d Mr. Goldstone added.\n\nCompounding the problem, the old guard woke up and launched robo-advisers of their own. In the U.S., Vanguard and Charles Schwab now dominate the market, with assets worth US$210-billion and US$60-billion, respectively, at the end of 2020. Betterment, the largest independent robo-adviser in the U.S., managed US$28-billion at the same date. In Canada, Bank of Montreal launched its SmartFolio robo-adviser in 2016, and Royal Bank of Canada followed suit in 2018.\n\nThe incumbents aren\u2019t simply more competition \u2013 they have a structural advantage, because they can cross-sell their robo-platforms to existing clients, lowering their customer-acquisition costs.\n\nTo adjust, Wealthsimple started diversifying in 2018 with a high-interest savings account, then added Wealthsimple Trade, which allows users to buy and sell stocks. In the fall of 2019, the company acquired software maker Simpletax. And a few months later it launched Wealthsimple Cash, a hybrid of a no-fee chequing account and a high-interest savings account.\n\nThe pivot to crypto started in August, 2020, when Wealthsimple\u2019s users were permitted to start trading Bitcoin and Ether. This past June, trading expanded to 14 additional crypto assets, including Litecoin and Dogecoin.\n\nWealthsimple does not break down its assets by division, but retail trading and crypto are what makes Silicon Valley salivate. Last fall, Wealthsimple raised $114-million in a funding round that valued the company at $1.4-billion. In May, it raised another $750-million, boosting its valuation to $5-billion only seven months later.\n\nRetail trading app Robinhood and crypto trading hub Coinbase recently went public in the United States, and their financial statements illustrate just how explosive retail trading revenue growth can be, particularly in crypto. At Robinhood, crypto brought in US$320-million in the first half of 2021, compared with just US$10-million in the first half of 2020.\n\nTo understand what that could mean for Wealthsimple, simply look at the fee schedule. The company\u2019s robo-clients often pay 0.5 per cent annually, while crypto traders pay 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per transaction (although Wealthsimple must split that fee with other parties).\n\nStock trading and crypto are also popular with younger users, which has always been Wealthsimple\u2019s target market but proved to be a tough nut to crack.\n\nEven though the company attracted billions in assets, it was a tiny fraction of the total wealth-management market. Switching rates, which measure the likelihood that someone is willing to leave their main financial institution, remain stubbornly low. In 2020, management consultancy Accenture pegged the switching rate for a primary financial account in Canada at only 4 per cent.\n\nYet as the company grows, it seems inevitable that it will move further from its roots \u2013 some of which are still exposed on Wealthsimple\u2019s website. In a section promoting its robo-adviser, the company writes: \u201cHistory shows that when you try to predict the future \u2013 by picking stocks, for example \u2013 rather than investing in a highly diversified way, you are more likely to underperform the market.\u201d",

Steel buildings are great and in a normal market the cost difference between a steel building and a wood building is negligible. What causes steel buildings to be more expensive in even a normal market is the cost of the foundation. You don\u2019t need near the concrete for a pole barn, but you can still get it about 95% as efficient for heating and cooling. Just make sure you have the contractor install a thermal break at the slab and install rigid insulation as well.",

        "body": "So let's get at this for real.  What uses steel, and in particular what uses steel mined and smelted in the US to the exclusion of imported?\n\nNot US residential housing stock.  Most of those units are wood frame construction, with maybe a few cables in the foundation.  \n\nNot US office buildings and malls.  Yes, they require steel to build them, but we have vacancy rates in excess of 50% as everyone has pivoted to work and shop from home.  No one needs a new steel building in this country for the next 5 years.\n\nCars (and other motor vehicles)?  Yes, cars require steel to build, although not the US' best selling vehicle the F-150, that's aluminum chassis and frame now, and many vehicles will follow suit.  Overall the trend will be less steel to make more cars.\n\nSo what the fuck exactly would induce someone to drop 2 bands a ton on steel in 2021 when they could just as easily defer their project to 2023 or not do it at all?\n\nSimple:  a Congressional mandate to spend tax dollars to build infrastructure.  Roadways?  Require steel.  Bridges?  They are made of steel.  Railways and railcars?  Those are pure steel, with a pinch of engineering added for flavor.  New factories?  Steel.  Solar installations?  Steel.  Power transmission lines?  Steel.  The CAT equipment (cranes, dozers, loaders, et c.) to build all this stuff?  Made of steel.\n\nIt pretty much boils down to whether Congress can get their act together.  If they pass Infrastructure Jr, (1.2T), a lot of steel will get bought and used.  If they also somehow put Manikin's balls in a vice and Kyrsten dies of COVID and they get the $3.5T bill passed, steel prices will rocket to the moon and holders will be blessed as the dividends rain down like flakes of slag from a hot-press.\n\nDon't hold your breath.\n\nEDIT:  I see most of your calls are dated Oct 15th.  The trust in Congress runs strong in you, little one.  I'd sooner dip my balls in an industrial grinder.",

        "body": "I think people adding up all of the issues right now and saying it's not a normal economic period are right that it's not a normal economic period, but by those measures, last year wasn't a normal economic period, as well.\n\nInflation: It's actually declining month over month, whereas last October it was increasing. People forget that the inflation metrics they cite are YoY and while inflation is in the zeitgeist now, it was also in place last year.\n\nThe debt ceiling: This is an actual problem, that could create a 2018-style long bleed. I've worried about this, but the government funding deal shows that there is likely a positive outcome. It represents some degree of blinking on the parts of those opposed to raising the debt ceiling, so I think we can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nCOVID: The economic data is much better than last year, and as much as it disappoints people who hoped for a full recovery by now, the soft re-opening from delta is still a relative increase in economic activity that is likely to get better as time goes on. We're in the upswing. Vaccines \\*do\\* work, and that's in the data. It just takes time for the end of a pandemic to happen.\n\nChina and supply issues: These concern me, and I think we're looking at supply issues for 6 months to a year, and this will cause some issues... but we have to remember that this is all due to an increase in overall demand and largely related to issues that specifically affect China. This isn't to say there won't be some problems from this, but we're not talking a 2008 larger systemic issue that is global. There are solutions to these problems that are in-play, and they're happening in an environment of very high demand for goods and services relative to last year... these are ultimately bullish, growth environment factors.\n\nTaxes/Taper/Rate increases: Will create a short term correction when they happen, but they're not unexpected and the impact of tax increases to corporations are not going to really effect growth the way that people think. Macroeconomically and historically, the reality is the opposite of what people think it will be with increased taxes creating more local capital velocity which means more revenue, more profits, and more growth opportunity. Companies are good at finding various ways to create efficiency in pricing, and Jeff Bezos getting some extra taxes won't impact the value of Amazon. The stock taxes proposed, like the estate tax on unrealized gains and the removal of the in-kind ETF tax break will largely have a null effect because the people concerned about them aren't taking into account how much they don't matter or aren't available to consumers. This is a bigger topic, but fears over these taxes are nothingburgers once you introduce human behavior into the mix.\n\nWorker shortage: Adjusted participation has close to returned to normal, with the exception of about a million workers based on the last data and it's probably tightened since then (most people getting higher numbers aren't accounting for historical reduction from baby boomers retiring since 2000 and pandemic mortality) and these forces are due to high demand, an expansion of higher pay work in the country post-pandemic due to supply chain issues, and come with higher overall wages which is an offset to inflation pressure, reducing the likelihood of a crash. This is actually a good signal even if it's a problem for insolvent businesses.\n\nAlmost all of the things people cite as problems are artifacts of positive economic growth.  \n\n\nIn the end, I expect October to be volatile, but I think there's little reason to automatically assume that it will be blood red... it depends on a number of factors. Me? I'm keeping a close eye on things and playing a bit conservative with my portfolio right now, but I'm looking for the broader entry point in the coming month, because I think this could look a lot like last year... but I also think human psychology dictates that we could have a short red period because the fundamentals matter less than people wrongly believing we're in a crash in the short term. In the long term, all of these forces will actually bring people to the market.",

        "body": "Kinda new myself, but my take so far. I think there's probably a lot of variation depending on many factors. For me as someone young it'll look very different to someone close to retirement.\n\nInvest in anything that improves your own education/income potential would likely yield the highest returns.\n\nFor \"normal \"investments i'd say chasing dividends over growth doesnt seem to make sense when planning to hold for a long time. Although i guess a small portion put into some REIT could be an option to diversify? Also don't really see the upside of bonds in my situation, maybe something to add close to retirement to take out volatility.\n\nI'd probably put like 80% in some diversified world etf like VTI in the US (for me it would be something equivalent from my country). Just buy and hold forever. Boring, but it requires low maintenance and the real gains are from the compounding effect that accumulates over time. Maybe check in twice a year and keep an eye out for crashes to be ready to buy a dip.\n\n20% in individual stocks or sector etfs. Partly to have a small chance of increasing returns, out of interest, and to learn a bit. But honestly i probably shouldn't go with more than 5, simply because it's necessary to keep a closer eye on the news. Mostly in larger caps that i assume will have long term growth higher than the average market. So something like the usual suspects of apple/microsoft/google, something from the semiconductor industry (since i know a bit about that) either an individual stock like nvidia/asml or a etf like SMH, and disney also looks interesting. Lastly a small portion as sort of a \"gamble\": So a smaller riskier company that has larger upsides. No concrete ideas there yet, i guess something from the bio/med sector or anything to do with space like rocket lab?\n\nPersonally not a fan of crypto, although it's hard to argue against the returns (in hinsight going all in 10 years ago would have made you filthy rich now). So i guess up to 5% or so could go in bitcoin/ethereum.",
