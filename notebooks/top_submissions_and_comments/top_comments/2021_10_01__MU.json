It seems like everyone is chasing charts on high volume institutional phase 2 breakouts. \n\nWe\u2019re seeing huge trade volume numbers on stocks that are way overvalued, like in the tech sector. I\u2019m curious why there is not much trade volume in shipping, because the future earnings and revenue are massive, and they are waaaayyy undervalued.\n\nTake a look:\n\n\nSHIPPING\n- GSL (Global Ship Lease): 97% undervalued\n- GNK (Genco Shipping &amp; Trading): 89% undervalued\n- DAC (Danaos): 82% undervalued\n- EGLE (Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc.): 77% undervalued\n- ZIM (ZIM Integrated Shipping Services): 72% undervalued\n- DSX (Diana Shipping Inc.): 69% undervalued\n- SBLK (Star Bulk Carriers): 65% undervalued\n- EDRY (EuroDry): 56% undervalued\n- NMM (Navios Meritime): 48% undervalued\n- SB (Safe Bulkers): 47% undervalued\n\nBut then you also see huge undervaluation in the semiconductor industry.\n\nSEMICONDUCTORS \n- HIMX (Himax): 68% undervalued\n- MU (Micron Technology): 37% undervalued\n\nIn the energy/oil sector, we again see some huge under valuations, but at least there you also find high volume institutional investing and solid growth:\n\nENERGY/OIL\n- GPRE (Green Plains): 70% undervalued\n- CORR (CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust): 69% undervalued\n- BCEI (Bonanza Creek): 64% undervalued\n- MUR (Murphy Oil): 56% undervalued\n\nThere are plenty of other extreme examples like this, for instance in materials/mining.\n\nI\u2019m just curious why many of these stock prices don\u2019t see much volume trading, and they don\u2019t bubble up closer to their true intrinsic value\u2026",

I bought it when it was at $60 and the P/E ratio was 4. I thought it was a bargain, but it preceded to dumb to $30. Now its obviously up higher. Still would take a while compared to the S&amp;P 500.\n\nMicron is cyclical which changes things a little bit. But bottom line just because a company is doing well, any sort of shrinkage in revenues or market capture causes a stock to be discounted.\n\nIf Intel exited the CPU market AMD would explode. AMD is a smaller company still the compared to Intel to match appropriate TAM. AMD is not in the semiconductor game like Intel.\n\nIntel doesn't sell more CPUs then AMD. We don't have the metric for either company, but I think you would fine that AMD is selling more Desktop and Server CPUs then Intel for the past 2-3 years. Anyone that builds computers or is making a computer server would tell you that AMD's line of CPUs is a better value (generally). Production compacity has literally nothing to do with either.\n\nI think AMD is probably overvalued, but I would rather buy AMD then INTC, cause Intel's products are worse and its losing market share. Plus AMD's FCF is growing like crazy. They made $2 per share in free cash flow, up from 0.55 cents a year ago. Meanwhile Intel hasn't changed.\n\nThat's why there is disparity in price. Intel will have to take some time to fix itself and get its technology competitive. It will eventually, but in the mean time AMD still has a lot more room to run... imagine if they took 30% of server market... which is totally possible with only two competitors.",

Just examples.\n\nBelow is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\nAnyway enjoy the dips now because these are likely to get beefed up as the supply chain &amp; worker shortages unwind\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

MU's most recent guidance does suggest at least a near term stagnation in EPS, which the market will punish harshly.  \n\nThe DD that you need to do, is to figure out if you think this EPS stall is temporary or longer term.  I think look at their projections out towards 2025 and see if you think their capital investment plans can push EPS beyond the 2.50 mark.  If so, then the next 6 months could present a very good buying opportunity as the market punishes the short term stall.\n\nIf EPS is doomed to stagnate in the 2-2.20 range, then you'll see MU hold right around a 7 PE.",

I bought it when it was at $60 and the P/E ratio was 4. I thought it was a bargain, but it preceded to dumb to $30. Now its obviously up higher. Still would take a while compared to the S&amp;P 500.\n\nMicron is cyclical which changes things a little bit. But bottom line just because a company is doing well, any sort of shrinkage in revenues or market capture causes a stock to be discounted.\n\nIf Intel exited the CPU market AMD would explode. AMD is a smaller company still the compared to Intel to match appropriate TAM. AMD is not in the semiconductor game like Intel.\n\nIntel doesn't sell more CPUs then AMD. We don't have the metric for either company, but I think you would fine that AMD is selling more Desktop and Server CPUs then Intel for the past 2-3 years. Anyone that builds computers or is making a computer server would tell you that AMD's line of CPUs is a better value (generally). Production compacity has literally nothing to do with either.\n\nI think AMD is probably overvalued, but I would rather buy AMD then INTC, cause Intel's products are worse and its losing market share. Plus AMD's FCF is growing like crazy. They made $2 per share in free cash flow, up from 0.55 cents a year ago. Meanwhile Intel hasn't changed.\n\nThat's why there is disparity in price. Intel will have to take some time to fix itself and get its technology competitive. It will eventually, but in the mean time AMD still has a lot more room to run... imagine if they took 30% of server market... which is totally possible with only two competitors.",

MU's most recent guidance does suggest at least a near term stagnation in EPS, which the market will punish harshly.  \n\nThe DD that you need to do, is to figure out if you think this EPS stall is temporary or longer term.  I think look at their projections out towards 2025 and see if you think their capital investment plans can push EPS beyond the 2.50 mark.  If so, then the next 6 months could present a very good buying opportunity as the market punishes the short term stall.\n\nIf EPS is doomed to stagnate in the 2-2.20 range, then you'll see MU hold right around a 7 PE.",

        "body": "You're missing a gigantic point. You are assuming that (1) you know what intrinsic value is and (2) that market price will tend to converge to intrinsic value. Neither is precisely true for equities. That's one reason you need to worry about volatility.\n\nI'll give you an example which should make things super clear. Consider a risk-free bond. Now this is an asset for which (1) and (2) hold precisely. Furthermore, if you are an investor who is holding the bond to maturity, you will not care about volatility. Why is that? Well, you know for sure that the bond will pay par at maturity. And as term to maturity gets shorter, the price will be pulled to par. The other way to look at this is if the bond price falls, you take a loss, but at the lower price, your expected return on the bond has gone up (exactly enough to offset).\n\nSo this is the type of situation that people seem to (implicitly) have in mind when they say \"volatility isn't risk\" or \"volatility doesn't matter for a long term investor\". But are these statements correct for stocks? No, since we are only estimating the intrinsic value with uncertainty. If the price of a stock falls, is it purely a discount rate shock or is it also a shock to future cash flows? It's often very hard to be sure (unlike in the case of bonds). The other point, of course, is that while a bond has a maturity date, a stock does not. So there is no mechanism that will force market price to converge with intrinsic value.\n\nSo volatility does matter as it typically reflects uncertainty in a company's future cash flow and shocks to the discount rate. I often hear people say that when a stock price falls sharply that they check whether the \"fundamentals are still sound\" and if so, it represent a buying opportunity. That's true, but in practice there is often a good reason for the stock to be falling (that perhaps other investors realize but you don't).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom a slightly different angle, perhaps the discussion you referenced is distinguishing between idiosyncratic and systematic risk. If company risks are idiosyncratic and hence diversifiable, you won't care since you could make that risk go away by holding a diversified portfolio. The remaining risk, at the portfolio level, most definitely is risk that you care about since people are risk averse (so they dislike a wide dispersion of possible outcomes in their portfolio wealth at retirement).\n\nThe last perspective is that for a given expected return for your portfolio (say per month or year), the long term expected growth of your wealth depends directly on the volatility. This is precisely the expected geometric mean growth rate and is well approximated by the expression:\n\nlog(1+mu) - sigma\\^2/\\[2(1+mu)\\^2\\] where mu is the per period expected return and sigma is the volatility. So for a given mu, the geometric mean falls as volatility (sigma) increases. This is the \"volatility drag\" that is often discussed on reddit in the context of leveraged ETFs, but which equally applies to any asset, levered or not.",
