Jamie Dimon could be caught red handed on the Epstein private jet with a 10 year old on his lap and JPM would still shrug off the news.\n\n*The world's largest investment banks made more money in fees during the        first nine months of the year than at any point since before the 2008        financial crisis, fueled by emergency fundraisings, initial public        offerings and a rash of mergers and acquisitions activity.*\n\n*Investment banking fees soared to around $64 billion in        the first three quarters of 2020, the most lucrative start to the year        for the sector since 2007, when banks were riding high at the top of the        last M&amp;A cycle and a year before Lehman Brothers collapsed.*\n\n*Five banks -- JPMorgan        (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), Morgan        Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) -- accounted for around a third of        that, collectively raking in fees of $19.8 billion in the        nine months to end of September, according to data from Dealogic.*\n\n*With just three months left until the end of 2020, banks are on course        for their best year in more than a decade. Global M&amp;A volumes surged to $1        trillion over the summer, according to data provider Refinitiv        -- the best third quarter since it started tracking numbers in 1998.*\n\n*However, some lawyers and bankers cautioned that a rise in coronavirus        infections could dampen deal making.*\n\n*\"Clearly there is great momentum to this deal activity, but another        winter COVID spike (*[*https://www.marketwatch.com/*](https://www.marketwatch.com/)*story/who-warns-of-serious-situation-unfolding-in-europe-as-covid-19-cases-climb-11600428004)        with further lockdowns could slow the pace and push deals into 2021,\"        said Frank Aquila, global head of M&amp;A at international        law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.*\n\n*Eamon Brabazon, co-head of EMEA M&amp;A at Bank of America,        said there was an \"underlying fragility and nervousness\" that something        akin to a significant second COVID wave could happen. \"If so, we would        expect the recent positive learnings around virtual processes would mean        that any impact on M&amp;A would be less acute than otherwise\"*\n\n*Equity capital markets bankers were kept busy, as a stampede of        companies took advantage of the rapid recovery in capital markets to        sell their shares, with fees soaring by 73% on last year to $18.8        billion. So far this year, IPOs have raised $135.5 billion        globally, 56% of which was unveiled in the third quarter, with health        care, technology and blank-check companies*\n\n*Martin Steinbach, EY EMEIA global leader, said the demand for        IPOs was being driven by investors looking for returns in a low interest        rate environment. \"If equity stories, management and balanced pricing        are met -- we predict this will bring a strong close to 2020,\" he said,        adding that the trend could accelerate as multinationals look to spin        off divisions to focus on core businesses.*\n\n*A series of emergency fundraisings by companies looking to shore up        their finances when the pandemic hit in March also provided a big payday        for debt capital markets bankers. DCM fees have surged by nearly 30% in        the same period in 2019, to $22.9 billion.*\n\n*Among those raising hundreds of billions of dollars were computer        technology company Oracle (ORCL) ($20 billion), U.S.        oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM) ($8.5 billion), and the        world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BT) ($5.0 billion).*\n\n*The resurgence of activity across all areas of investment banking will        come as a relief to bankers, as M&amp;A deal making and IPOs ground to a        halt  at the height of the pandemic in March and April.*\n\n*\"For the next 12 to 18 months the investment banking wallet opportunity        looks buoyant, but the product mix will adjust,\" said Philip        Drury, head of banking, capital markets and advisory for EMEA,        at Citigroup.*\n\n*However, despite the recent spike in M&amp;A, the total value of global deal        making for the first nine months of 2020 is $ 2.1 trillion        -- 21% lower than it was during the same period last year.*\n\n*Volumes were boosted by a wave of megadeals across sectors and        geographies, as companies sought to become bigger and more diversified        to help them weather the pandemic.*\n\n*These included Gilead Sciences's $20 billion takeover of        biopharmaceutical company Immunomedics and Nvidia's $40 billion    acquisition of U.K.-based        chip designer Arm from Japan's        SoftBank Group, whichhas helped spur a huge uptick in deal making over        the summer.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Americas        almost doubled activity in the third quarter compared with the same        period last year, while Europe        is still lagging, recording just $232 billion of deals in        the third quarter, a 3.5% fall on the same period in 2019.*\n\n*\"M&amp;A activity in Europe        will follow the U.S.,\"        said Javier Oficialdegui, co-head of global banking at UBS        (UBS). \" Every single sector and market needs to restructure in one way        or another because of COVID-19 and we expect a big uptick in activity        over the coming quarters.\"*\n\n*Activity in the region is also expected to pick up once the final Brexit        terms       are known and the consequences are understood. \"Then we can expect to        see a significant number of European deals as companies inside and        outside the EU seek to realign based on the new economic reality,\" said        Sullivan &amp; Cromwell's Aquila.*\n\n*Technology deals have surged this year, accounting for 16.9% of overall        activity -- or $377 billion -- compared with to 11% in        2019, as companies look to capitalize on their record valuations and use        their stock to become dominant players in emerging sectors.*\n\n*\"There is a lot of momentum going into year-end. Europe        is at the epicenter. When you look at the pipeline of deals into 2021,        we see a material year-on-year uplift,\" said Brabazon.*\n\n*-Lina Saigol; 415-439-6400;* [*AskNewswires@dowjones.com*](mailto:AskNewswires@dowjones.com)\n\n*(END) Dow Jones Newswires   10-01-20 1331ET*",

        "body": "I would just recommend you look at what Palantir actually does, and see why you think they are better than others at providing that service.\n\nI see them as offering two things:\n\n1) Consulting services: They'll come in and scope your current data environment, combine disparate traditional databases and unstructured data into one cohesive data mart. They'll do a lot of data cleaning since a lot of what they're bringing in is probably garbage, and they'll set up a repeatable process for loading, managing and monitoring what they've built.\n\n2) A data analysis GUI. Basically a combination of data visualization and predictive analysis that's been simplified for someone who doesn't code. So far this almost completely customized for specific use cases depending on customer.\n\nI see a couple problems:\n\n1) This is how they've worked their way into organizations so far, but it's also been completely duplicated by every major cloud service provider and legacy database provider. I see them having a hard time proving their value over the major players like AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle and SAP in this area.\n\n2) Once a company has chosen someone for step 1, they can now choose any analytics tool. I know Palantir has built a reputation as having some magic predictive power, but in reality, there are a limited number of algorithms that are useful for any given problem, and they're all going to be built in as options for any tool now that they pretty much just incorporate the best open source solution. I don't see them beating out Tableau, PowerBI, Adobe Sensei, Alteryx, Kibana, etc. in this space.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but they've had Foundry out for a few years now, and it has a few dozen customers. I would think if it were a clearly superior product, that would be much higher. It basically seems to only be useful for customers who are willing to pay for a completely customized interface, which I think will be a hard sell for most businesses.",

        "body": "I track the total index as well. I am also comfortable risking a minimal amount of captial on more speculative plays, like those surrounding disruptive innovation. This means any technology that has the potential but not the guarantee to shake up current industry. Especially if that technology is not yet polished or proven, because refinement can come in time and it likely will as long as the medium provides for greater access, better utilization, and/or further propagation of ideas. \n\nTake the internet as whole. It was initially discounted, it lacked polish or proof of validity over the long term and yet today it is indispensable to nearly everyone. Take the evolution of the blog, which at first was ridiculed and said to be unreliable and immature, but now provides a medium rich in information and validity. \n\nThese things take time. I am happy to allocate a small percentage of my equity to these ideas. All I need is one of 30 to hit big and my assumed risk will be rewarded. \n\nI would never advocate for putting an individuals entire networth into these types of funds, but I think it is irresponsible to discount the possibility of success based on a fear of failure or outmoded models of allocation that in all reasonable assessment have been behind the curve of innovation. \n\nI can see clear upside in technologies surround genomics and financial technology, for instance. Let's take traditional banking as an example. This system regularly cuts out access to large portions of the global population based in numerous factors, such as physical or geographical lack of access, or because they are deemed too risky to take on, or because of structural bias against subsets of the population. \n\nIf a disruptive technology comes along like SQ that offers greater access and mobility of capital accross populations and classes, it makes sense that they will attract and retain users on a more rapid scale than traditional firms. That creates a sustained competitive advantage, and if the firm is able to build consumer loyalty it will be difficult to wrench the consumer away unless another firm can provide adequate economic incentives for the customer to switch. \n\nSustaining this advantage can be done by creating a sticky business model, like IMB did in the past (we know how that turned out) or Oracle does currently (this has yet to play out, but I would argue without a fundamental shift in philosophy Oracle will continue to lose marketshare to their more innovative competitors), or by building an innovation stack that can rapid respond to a dynamic marketplace and continually create value for the consumer (Amazon, for instance). \n\nRarely do entrenched businesses have a culture or leadership team that can rapidly respond to these disruptions in a way that can effectively recapture lost market share. I am absolutely willing to take a small bet on the increased prevalence of Zillow or Open Door, for instance, because I can see that the current firms surrounding housing sales have not adapted to shifting market demands very effectively. They are entrenched, archaic, and tedious to deal with; in contrast, Zillow provides a much smoother and friendly experience in searching for and procuring a new home. So much so that these more traditional firms have largely begun to utilize the platform to serve their own ends. This makes it easier for Zillow to leverage the competition to their advantage and further disrupt the traditional business model. \n\nOf course, there are local, state, and federal regulatory hurdles to be managed, but over time the efficiency of captial markets will favor the most innovative and accessible firms over the more entrenched and laggard ones. \n\nIn summary, taking on a small amount of risk in emerging technologies often leads to greater returns on capital than the conservative and traditional methodology of 60, 40 \"safe\" equity and bonds. That isn't to say an individual should fully embrace that risk, but it is prudent invest in all potential outcomes with varying allocation based on individual preferences for risk. \n\nTime will tell.",

        "body": "Active management isn't necessarily a money losing proposition, it's just that you face an additional headwind.\n\nFrom 1993 to present, the market (represented by SPY, which we can invest in) has returned 9.67% annually. Therefore, we can say that 9.67% is the return generated by all active management strategies, before fees. Once you add in fees, say 1%, then active management in total should have provided a return of 8.67% annually.\n\nOf course, there have been underperformers and overperformers during that time period. The question is whether you can spot the over performers before they over perform, and if you can avoid the under-performers. It's not that easy - here's a [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/3-big-actively-managed-mutual-funds-that-are-beating-the-s-p-500-51573842353) article from last year pointing out that at that time, only 3 of 20 mutual funds they were following were beating the market.\n\nWe've all heard the stories about how the average investor in Peter Lynchs Magellan Fund (one of the best performing funds ever) had a [negative experience](https://www.alphawealthfunds.com/2019/08/the-average-investor-lost-money-in-the-best-performing-mutual-fund-in-history/) on average due to performance chasing - they would see it's end of year numbers and after good years, they would jump in hoping for a repeat of that experience, and after years that it did poorly, they would exit. Their search for the best active return did a number on their portfolio.\n\nAnd even now - we all know Warren Buffett as the Oracle of Omaha, and he also has an unparalleled track record. Except for the last 10 years, where Berkshire has also been trailing the market. There's plenty of other examples of this phenomenon.\n\nThat's the risk of active management. You can only see what their track record has been until now, and have no idea what the future will provide.\n\nFor myself, I own some ARKW (1.31% of my portfolio), and also own Sequoia Fund (SEQUX - 5.42%), but also have 7.5% in QQQ and 12% in SPYX.\n\nSequoia has a long track record, going through many economic cycles, but with that said, they have lagged the last 5 years. Fidelity's Contrafund is another example of a fund with a very long track record that has done well relative to the market.  But that said, history is full of actively managed funds that have failed to generate better return that the markets, but the mutual fund companies work overtime to make sure we don't see them - failing funds are merged with more successful funds or just closed altogether, making it much more difficult to find old data on them - it's called survivorship bias.\n\nWhat i do know is that the ARK funds have all done very well, the question is whether they will continue to shine in whatever the next phase of our economy actually is.",

SAP is lame. It can be a powerful tool but it's just god awful to look at.  \n\n\nI will note that there is a ceiling on all of this, and at some point your business needs will force you to go totally custom built on one of those platforms, and by then it depends more on 3rd party vendor pricing, whatever deal you can get from them, and extras where you can save, such as Saleforce's marketplace of apps that you can add. Things like that add a TON of value for Salesforce where you can save money on custom dev by adding prebuilt software and skinning it, as well as Salesforce Trailhead training program absolutely smashes the competition as far as getting teams up to speed on transition.",
