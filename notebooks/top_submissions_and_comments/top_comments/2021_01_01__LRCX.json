In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",

Enjoyed the ride up in 1999, and saw much of that money erode come 2000. However, since I still had a job, I was able to continue to buy in 2000 when things were going down. Made my first $1M after 2 drawdown periods (1999 and 2008); $150k invested over 12 years (I'd try to put in $1k/month most months, and a bit extra when I could) turned into $1M.\n\nThere's just so much more information and knowledge available now, and the folks of today don't seem to have a problem with holding through drawdowns. I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns. I've never seen such an iron conviction before. Folks of today are not afraid of drawdowns or volatility. Additionally, between all of our corporations, we're pumping in billions of new dollars every single week into the market now.\n\nTimes have changed, and you're kidding yourself if you haven't seen the change.",

This hasn\u2019t mooned yet and it\u2019s due for a run like BTBT. A lot of people don\u2019t know about EBON right now just like they didn\u2019t know about BTBT. It\u2019s going to be huge. A lot of people compare CAN to EBON but CAN has 150mil float (hard to move fast) and they don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline in terms of catalysts like EBON does for q1 2020. CEO is bullish and bitcoin at 28-29k is huge for them.\n\nBloomberg also released an article recently, calling them the next \u201cQualcomm of bitcoin mining hardware\u201d on December 26th. I made 4x my money on BTBT because I knew it was lagging behind mara/riot in terms of market cap to hash power.\n\nMy play now is EBON and I am extremely confident this unknown play is going to be the play for cryptocurrency. A bitcoin mining farm and crypto exchange in the pipeline is HUGE especially when they also are a market leader in terms of computing power for their bitcoin mining hardware (plus the patented exclusive rights to asicBOOST) \n\nBitmain planning to IPO at 50b and EBON has the chance to 4x or beyond just like BTBT. A lot of these plays are unknown and you just need to go in early. Don\u2019t go in the popular stocks that everyones talking about because most of the time, they just fail. We got a great stock here and we\u2019re early. Good luck to all. Bullish. BTC nearing 30k ATH hit 29600 and now around 29100-29200.",

Should I just cut them loose, or is -20% a normal loss and is still in the \"wait-it-out\" range?",

Qualcomm will be reaping massive returns in automotive by the time apple has something that's not as shit as the Intel ones they had been using. Qualcomm will still earn $9-18 an iPhone even if Apple is using 100% their own parts. They settled the 4.5bn lawsuit because they didn't want to admit stealing source code from qualcomm and giving it to Intel (and still failed), pretty red flag that they have to resort to that. \n\nBroadcom is definitely worthy of owning for a broad 5G portfolio. QCOM has my heart and is just making so much money. QCOM sets the global standards, owns the relevant patents and is so incredibly positioned for 5G take off it's insane. Most people think of 5G as faster cell service for smartphones when it's not for that at all. Once retail investors understand this, they'll be hoping on qualcomm. \n\nI think we will see significant investment in 5G infrastructure in the coming US infrastructure bill, telcoms and companies like Ericsson rely on that.",

Imagine the value of the IP from a company that has the cell tech which would replace all battery pack modules in most every product which uses lithium-ion. That's a pretty big reason, amongst other smaller factors, that justified them spiking. Reaching 130 a little while ago, I can't say that it's justified without a product and still a projected ways into the future for being able to have a product. However, at 100; yes? It's undervalued if it's trading at 70-80 or less. I could easily see this having a run-up similar to Qualcomm, once they've resolved the hurdles with their lithium solid-state. This was a big reason that I felt that RMO was more future-proof. They've stated they can transition their current battery packs from lithium-ion to solid-state in a short period of time. The number of people that haven't been able to differentiate between battery cells and module packaging is really overwhelming.\n\nQS product is solid-state battery cells, which is what stores potential energy from the configuration of a solid electrode and electrolyte, instead of liquid.\n\nRMO product is battery packaging, modules, and applications, which is what takes the battery cell tech, finds solutions for applying it to end-products, and manufactures them for those end-products.\n\nThese two companies are literally two different markets and aren't even competitors.",

I wasn't invested in the highly speculative dotcom stuff, but many other companies got caught up in the bubble. I was primarily invested in Qualcomm.\n\nI hit my target in the summer of 1999, but I didn't sell right away, things were increasing at an unreal rate. I remember one day QCOM went up by more than 100 points. I made more on QCOM that day than my annual salary. By the fall, I was looking at huge capital gains and I decided to just hold out until the new year to sell that way I could delay paying the capital gains tax by another year.\n\nSo, I sold out of my position the first week of January. I know people say the bubble popped in March, but I remember the decline starting in January. I've always thought it was because of people like me, trying to delay tax payments by a year.",

In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",

I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns.

Startups had to enter into deals with OEMs (often competitors) to manufacture their chips. \n\n1987 : enter TSMC, pioneered the contract manufacturing model. Startups now had a partner which was 1. Dedicated to their customers success (win-win) and 2. Not a competitor in the marketplace\n\nThose startups are the likes of : NVDA, QCOM.\n\nDecades later, where are NVDA, QCOM, TSM ? Tendie town.

This hasn\u2019t mooned yet and it\u2019s due for a run like BTBT. A lot of people don\u2019t know about EBON right now just like they didn\u2019t know about BTBT. It\u2019s going to be huge. A lot of people compare CAN to EBON but CAN has 150mil float (hard to move fast) and they don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline in terms of catalysts like EBON does for q1 2020. CEO is bullish and bitcoin at 28-29k is huge for them.\n\nBloomberg also released an article recently, calling them the next \u201cQualcomm of bitcoin mining hardware\u201d on December 26th. I made 4x my money on BTBT because I knew it was lagging behind mara/riot in terms of market cap to hash power.\n\nMy play now is EBON and I am extremely confident this unknown play is going to be the play for cryptocurrency. A bitcoin mining farm and crypto exchange in the pipeline is HUGE especially when they also are a market leader in terms of computing power for their bitcoin mining hardware (plus the patented exclusive rights to asicBOOST) \n\nBitmain planning to IPO at 50b and EBON has the chance to 4x or beyond just like BTBT. A lot of these plays are unknown and you just need to go in early. Don\u2019t go in the popular stocks that everyones talking about because most of the time, they just fail. We got a great stock here and we\u2019re early. Good luck to all. Bullish. BTC nearing 30k ATH hit 29600 and now around 29100-29200.",

        "body": "Ok, try my best:\n\nx86 and ARM are two different CPU architectures. AMD/Intel are based on x86 architecture.\n\nWithin the chips are CPU cores (hence u see 4-core/6-core/8-core CPUs etc). In (current) x86 architecture, all the cores are the same.\n\nIn ARM they are hybrid cores where some of these cores are power-hungry powerful cores for high-performance and some are lower power cores but more power-efficient. \n\nTraditionally more power = more performance (a simplified view) but there's a diminishing return and also in a battery-powered situation, this doesn't really scale.\n\nThe majority of pc/laptops/electronic devices don't always need to use powerful cores all the time. So when you have a hybrid architecture you can save power and only use the efficient cores when you are doing light tasks and then turn on the high-performance cores when you are doing demanding tasks.\n\nApple has been producing their own chips based on the ARM architecture and with the recent release of M1, they showed that CPUs can be both powerful and also energy-efficient in a mass-produced, everyday machine. This is especially true when you design the software (e.g. the OS) to distribute tasks accordingly to the right hybrid cores in order to improve performance per watt. i.e. optimising the software to take advantage of the chip design.\n\nTaking an assumption that AMD/Intel can not keep up with the pace of innovation that Apple is doing with producing their own chips, and that they will for the near-future stick with the x86 architecture, they will need to do something to mitigate this performance per watt difference between Apple and themselves. \n\nI'm thinking that AMD/Intel will also go down the route of Big.Little design employed by ARM while sticking with the x86 architecture. \n\nIntel I believe, is releasing a new CPU based on this architecture in the coming year. AMD I think is waiting on software to take advantage of this hence my comment on there is a dependant variable on Microsoft if they can optimise Windows for Big-Little Architecture and also ARM.\n\nIf MSFT spends more time on ARM optimisation you might see laptop manufacturers start using ARM chips from companies such as Qualcomm with their Snapdragon chips vs AMD/Intel chips (an example of this would be Microsoft Surface Pro X laptop).\n\nCircling it all back, this might have an effect on the future growth of AMD. How much, positive vs negative, that's for anyone to guess....\n\nHope that helps but also caveat disclaimer; there's a lot of \"if then therefore\" simplified logic in there.",

        "body": "Agree with most of that. Samsung does make their own 5G modems for and only for their lower end units, as modems are very complex and no one is close to qualcomm in ability. The new 480 chip might make samsung not even bother. Even apple's modems will likely be the otherside of snapdragon vs A13. Qualcomm will be reaping massive returns in automotive by the time apple has something that's not as shit as the Intel ones they had been using. Qualcomm will still earn $9-18 an iPhone even if Apple is using 100% their own parts. They settled the 4.5bn lawsuit because they didn't want to admit stealing source code from qualcomm and giving it to Intel (and still failed), pretty red flag that they have to resort to that. \n\nBroadcom is definitely worthy of owning for a broad 5G portfolio. QCOM has my heart and is just making so much money. QCOM sets the global standards, owns the relevant patents and is so incredibly positioned for 5G take off it's insane. Most people think of 5G as faster cell service for smartphones when it's not for that at all. Once retail investors understand this, they'll be hoping on qualcomm. \n\nI think we will see significant investment in 5G infrastructure in the coming US infrastructure bill, telcoms and companies like Ericsson rely on that.",

Big brain plays are all the above, plus BABA because China is about to overtake US. QCOM because M1 chip forced every other laptop manufacturer to use ARM based chips and QCOM is the only company with an actual competitor already in production, they partnered with msft to create SQ2.

Imagine the value of the IP from a company that has the cell tech which would replace all battery pack modules in most every product which uses lithium-ion. That's a pretty big reason, amongst other smaller factors, that justified them spiking. Reaching 130 a little while ago, I can't say that it's justified without a product and still a projected ways into the future for being able to have a product. However, at 100; yes? It's undervalued if it's trading at 70-80 or less. I could easily see this having a run-up similar to Qualcomm, once they've resolved the hurdles with their lithium solid-state. This was a big reason that I felt that RMO was more future-proof. They've stated they can transition their current battery packs from lithium-ion to solid-state in a short period of time. The number of people that haven't been able to differentiate between battery cells and module packaging is really overwhelming.\n\nQS product is solid-state battery cells, which is what stores potential energy from the configuration of a solid electrode and electrolyte, instead of liquid.\n\nRMO product is battery packaging, modules, and applications, which is what takes the battery cell tech, finds solutions for applying it to end-products, and manufactures them for those end-products.\n\nThese two companies are literally two different markets and aren't even competitors.",
