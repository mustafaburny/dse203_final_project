        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s government quietly appointed a director to the board of ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s key domestic subsidiary several months ago, an unusual arrangement that offers Beijing even more sway and insight into the world\u2019s largest private technology company.\n\nThe video and news giant in April sold a 1% stake in Beijing ByteDance to three entities including one controlled by the country\u2019s internet overseer and gave the government a board seat, according to a person familiar with the matter. The entity, which owns licenses to operate the company\u2019s TikTok-like Douyin and news service Toutiao within the world\u2019s No. 2 economy, remains separate from ByteDance Ltd., the company\u2019s main fundraising vehicle through which it operates TikTok globally.\n\nChinese state organs have for years invested billions of dollars into high-profile startups from Didi Global Inc. to Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group Co., but few if any manage to secure a seat at the highest decision-making table. The revelation about ByteDance, first reported by The Information, is likely to deepen investors\u2019 concerns about Beijing\u2019s attempts to wrest control of data from its giant technology industry, to both curb their influence and secure a valuable resource to power the economy and drive Xi Jinping\u2019s vision of common prosperity.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what motivated the government\u2019s involvement at ByteDance earlier this year, but it coincides with Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown on private enterprises, particularly in the tech sector. Regulators have expressed concerns about data security and the tools that companies like ByteDance use to present content to users.\n\nBut the fact that the industry regulator can designate someone to the board of a prominent sector player may unsettle investors worried about the broader ramifications of Beijing\u2019s clampdown. Even before Xi\u2019s administration tightened its grip on the tech sector, ByteDance had grappled with American lawmakers\u2019 accusations that TikTok in particular threatens national security and could aid Beijing in espionage efforts. In May, the month after the Chinese regulator took its stake, founder Zhang Yiming relinquished day-to-day control of his company to its closest lieutenant, a decision regarded as an attempt to distance himself from the growing turbulence at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cIt intensifies worries about the government\u2019s intentions for China\u2019s internet sector and the concessions private firms may have to make,\u201d said Michael Norris at consultancy AgencyChina. \u201cIt gives new context to Zhang Yiming\u2019s decision to step down from his position as ByteDance\u2019s CEO.\n\n\u201dXi\u2019s crackdown on businesses from ride-hailing firms to fintech and edtech upstarts to the largest players in commerce has traumatized markets throughout much of 2021, wiping more than $1 trillion off Chinese stocks and igniting intense debate about the Communist Party\u2019s longer-term objectives for private enterprise.\n\nBeijing ByteDance Technology \u2014 a Chinese entity established in 2012 when Zhang started his now thriving internet apps empire -- sold a 1% stake in an April 30 deal to WangTouZhongWen (Beijing) Technology, which is owned by three state entities. According to Tianyancha, a widely referenced database of corporate records, the trio included the China Internet Investment Fund, controlled by the Cyberspace Administration of China; China Media Group, the Party-controlled national broadcaster, and the Beijing municipal government\u2019s investment arm.\n\nThat deal allowed the investing entity to appoint one of only three board members, named Wu Shugang in the database. Instead of selling a stake in the holding company that includes its overseas businesses such as TikTok, the firm negotiated to have the government invest in the Beijing entity, according to the person.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese subsidiary referenced only relates to some of ByteDance\u2019s China-market video and information platforms, and holds some of the licenses they require to operate under local law,\u201d a ByteDance spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe investment itself wasn\u2019t unusual. The China Internet Investment Fund, run by the same powerful watchdog that initiated a probe into Didi in the wake of its $4.4 billion initial public offering in New York, has taken stakes in a plethora of startups including ByteDance\u2019s chief rival Kuaishou; podcast giant Ximalaya; truck-hailing app Full Truck Alliance and AI leader Sensetime.\n\nBut it\u2019s highly unusual for the government to directly appoint a board member at a private tech firm. Beijing, worried that entrepreneurs like Ma and their expanding dominions would eventually undermine the influence of the Party, has moved since late last year to rein in the industry\u2019s biggest enterprises. Various government agencies have launched investigations into monopolistic behavior at a slew of firms including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Wang Xing\u2019s Meituan, initiated deep data security reviews at Didi and Full Truck Alliance Co., pulled the plug on tech firms\u2019 IPOs abroad and even ordered vast swaths of the after-school tutoring industry to go non-profit.\n\n\u201cHaving a state-backed investor is still not sufficient to address regulatory challenges facing ByteDance\u2019s listing,\u201d said Feng Chucheng, a political analyst with consultancy Plenum in Beijing. \u201cWhat prevents the company from going public is not its corporate governance structure or source of funding, but the risk it could potentially impose on national security, due to the amount of data it accesses.\n\n\u201dThe unprecedented salvos have stoked concerns that Beijing is intent on exerting undue control over private enterprise, fomenting uncertainty that some say is making China Inc. un-investable.\u201cIt reignites debate in overseas markets as to whether TikTok could be a vehicle for state influence,\u201d Norris said.\n\nRIP BABA longs.",

        "body": "Its a hustle... how about you take a look at a post I put up about the culture of bitcoin its about 3 posts down on my page. Nuclear kitty is a nutjob. However the post  with the droolling character, diamond handz,  shills workin overtime, buy dip, 100k incoming. You wanna talk about reckless thoughtless speculation be my guest! Would you like to talk about bitcoin used for money laundering, helping fund and support terrorism, the mafia, cyber crime gangs, people getting killed for their bitcoin, the lack of transparency, how certain people want to use it to overthrow the Uited states, the list of cons go on and on, this is the category for investing, go take crypto over where it belongs in crypto. Some people only talk about the good side where you make DOLLARS but they dont do is take a little time time to do is be critical of it. Its a picture of a coin on a screen. At least the us mint used steel pennies in 1943 so that they could use the copper for bullets to kill nazis. You got a problem with the financial laws in this country go call you legislative representative, we all saw school house rock. Im all for financial regulation, but im not an anarchist. Dont even start with me, cryptocurrency is a gambling hall masquerading as a western union. Ive got the screenshots to proove it! Hypocracy is strong in crypto you guys act like you are all in the same boat but you are not! The smartest people will pull out, cash out into dollars leaving the bagholders looking at a computer screen with a picture of a coin and a empty wallet!!!",
