        "body": "I do this kind of thing for a living and it\u2019s not my first DDoS rodeo. I\u2019ve lived through several waves of these attacks and seen multiple generations of solutions.  At first we had to figure out how to do it ourselves with on-prem solutions like Radware and Arbor.  Next you had scrappy upstarts like Prolexic that used those techs to build scrubbing centers and offered services to those that couldn\u2019t protect themselves.  Then there was a wave of acquisitions and others trying scale the scrubbing center idea (e.g. Akamai buying Prolexic, carriers adding DDoS services). Now we have some entrenched players like Akamai, CloudFlare and some of the carriers, but I recently noticed that players like A-10, Radware and F5 are getting in the game with hybrid cloud/on-prem DDoS solutions.  From a technical perspective, these are an improvement over the 3 layers of defense I mentioned above because there is an on-perm component, but practically I think only a relatively small subset of customers will need this level of protection. \n\nGenerally some mix of A-10, Radware and Arbor will probably be the technologies the big players like Akamai, CloudFlare, Lumen and even Fastly use to deliver their services. So as these solutions providers build out there networks and scrubbing centers A-10 and the other hardware vendors could benefit in the same way a steel company will benefit when car sales trend up. \n\nThat said, A-10 is a pretty niche player. I run a team at a Fortune 50 multi-national and I\u2019ve only ever used a single pair of A-10 boxes on my network and those were eventually replaced by a feature on Palo Alto firewalls.  I suppose they could be an acquisition target if their tech is good, but I think they\u2019ll have a hard time competing against carriers and CDNs over time because the latter will have an easier time cross selling and up selling. I know I would rather expand services with a current vendor and push for volume discounts than go through the pain of cutting a contract with a new vendor for a niche tech.",

I follow a group and have learned more in 2 months than i ever would have by myself. I have all the scripts in tradingview if you want help. Let me know. From there its finding these trends and placing appropriate sized positions on them, in addition to watching the market, like spy, and hedging/buying insurance appropriately.",

Google has Bing, Firefox, Opera, etc. Apple has Samsung, Motorola, etc. Facebook has Snapchat and Twitter. Each have respective competitors.\n\nI think the fear is warranted that big tech is getting bigger, but to claim they are being 'anticompetitive' and pushing out competition is a stretch.\n\nI personally like big tech and all the innovation they are developing.",
