Basically most AAA games do not use it, although there are some outliers where graphical performance isn't important (ie. Hearthstone). High fidelity AAA games typically use their own engine, or they use an engine like Unreal. You probably see a lot more indy titles using Unity over anything else.\n\nThe benefits of Unity are that it is pretty easy to pick up. It's primary coding language is C# which is easier than C++ (which Unreal and most other game engines use). It also has a ton of tutorials and content and the asset store where you can license artwork, etc. for your games is bigger and has been around for longer (although it isn't an issue for AAA games and unreal store is decent enough). The primary drawbacks are around performance, I personally have dealt with startup performance which can be seriously bad when talking about games on mobile platforms (phones, oculus quest).\n\nUnity does have aspirations of being more like autodesk and going into that market, but I'm moderately skeptical that they can do that.",

That and it is a way to grassroots train people in their software.    \n\n\nIt is a bit of a niche example but in the 3d art sector Blender has shown that a freeware software can actually compete with a professional suite. Yeah Autodesk still is the industry standard but in the past year a dozen studios have decided to swap over to a very blender heavy pipeline. And Microsoft already is very aware what things such as Linux, googledocs, open office can do to their bottom lines with the no-cost competition. So I expect to see Microsoft doing more to reach the smallfry grassroots market in the future.",

But if you don't think you'll be able to add money to the account, I would make sure to buy stocks that pay a dividend, and set them up for DRIP, so that the dividend is reinvested getting you more shares of the stocks.\n\nA few ideas to research and consider that are under $20: LMRK, PBCT, ROIC, GLDD, VIAV, STWD, AQN, DRIV, TDS, MPW, THQ, TPH, FPE\n\nIf you want stocks you can't afford yet, and you can't buy fractional shares, you could get some less expensive stocks with good P/E ratios that pay dividends, let them sit for a while with DRIP, then sell them once you've gained enough to buy what you really want.

        "body": "Imagine basing this months price action on TA when everything is going to be driven by the news cycles around 2 events. I'm waiting for AMD moon this month because their 2 significant product launches are not sufficiently priced in.\n\nWhy do I say that? Look at any \"investing\" comments section on AMD and all they will talk about is how AMD is overpriced because their P/E is 160 lol or AMD is just another overvalued tech company like Tesla. Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like &gt;2X and &gt;3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that. Last weeks action was all about the 5800X AotS benchmark leaks - without knowing when future leaks are coming I don't see how we can predict any specific movements.\n\nMarch 21 95C, 100Cs",

I have studied in the hyperbolic time chamber and return with wisdom of ages. Behold.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD cash on hand for the quarter ending June 30, 2020: $1.775B (1)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nXLNX has a market cap of ~25B (2)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nClearly, AMD does not have anywhere near the amount of cash on hand for the acquisition and will have to resort to doing it with shares. Generally speaking, acquisitions like this seem to add a premium onto the shares to make it compelling for the company being bought out to take their offer. As XLNX has a market cap of 25B, seeing something like 29-30B in shares offered isn't unreasonable.\n&amp;nbsp;\nHere's what looks like will happen if the offering is 30B in shares when AMD is trading @ 90 to make math easy. AMD will issue something like 333,333,333 new shares, you read that right, and exchange them for all of XLNX's shares. As of right now, that's over a quarter of how many shares are currently outstanding. If the market seems certain the buyout will happen, XLNX will fucking moon and trade near 2x what AMD trades at theoretically until the buyout happens as shareholders of XLNX will receive multiples of AMD if i'm not mistaken. Do your own DD.\nSources:  \n\n\n(1) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/cash-on-hand  \n\n(2) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XLNX/xilinx/market-cap\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPS: I'm only posting it in this thread and not it's seperate post so I can be a greedy little fucking gremlin and keep the mad gains to myself whilst simultaneously being able to say \"Technically I told you so\".\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",

Both semiconductors have been doing extremely well in the rebound, not to mention TSM holding extremely strong during September amidst the major market selloff with mild volatility. TSM manufactures AMD's chips as well as AAPL and many other major chip companies, and they have a solid dividend for investors looking to hold. \n\nRKT: RKT has been pretty cheap and hasn't been rebounding as quickly since the selloff until today, but the future is extremely promising and they're disruptive in the housing loan market by decreasing friction in mortgages through simplified technology. Housing for the next couple years with low fed rates will be promising with millennials looking to make first time home purchases. Looking to see how it does tomorrow and may start a position next week.\n\nZ: Looking to add to the position if there is a pullback next week.

        "body": "No problem--happy to help. With regard to your questions:\n\n1. The vol skew isn't that big of a deal compared to the price spread in my opinion, but just the fact that puts tend to be a little more sensitive to IV than calls makes me shy away from them. IV usually increases when prices are going down, not up. So with call credit spreads even if IV does increase (bad for me) delta is decreasing (good for me). Don't forget: it's not even about the option prices themselves, it's about the difference in premium between them. The closer they get to ATM, the bigger difference in premium between the strikes because the chance that it could go either way increases. So, the fact that they're puts isn't terribly important, it's just one little thing among many that makes me lean toward call spreads.\n2. Yes, I prefer to trade call credit spreads with this strategy. Getting burned so hard with QQQ just soured me on doing this with bull put spreads. The probability of profit is similar, but just seeing QQQ blow through my strikes was demoralizing. With index funds like these, you're just more likely to see a large gap down than a large gap up, and even when there is a gap up overnight there's usually a pullback mid-morning where I can get out before it surges higher. *I can bank on mean reversion much more readily than I can bank on there NOT being a correction.*\n3. I don't tend to alternate indexes too much lately because after reading into it, day trades only count for \"*open-close*\" trades \"of the same or a substantially similar security\" in the same day. Until I dug into it, I wasn't sure if \"*close-open*\" trades counted as day trades. They don't, so that allows me to roll more easily. I don't use more than 2 or 3 day trades in a week, but it just makes me a little nervous to potentially be trapped in a strategy because I don't want to get flagged. I only tend to use them when scaling in/out of a position. For example, when the trade I have on reaches \\~50% profit, I'll usually buy back 2 or 3 spreads and roll them out to the next expiration. I've done that in the morning a couple of times and then there happens to be a big price decline later in the day and I've already gotten to my 50% target. If I want to manage my risk and really follow the strategy, I should close my positions, so I do it and take the day trade. I'd do the same thing if it went against me. It's more about having the option (pun intended) to use them if I need them.\n4. I haven't tried it on anything leveraged or inverse and probably won't--at least right now. The volatility scares me too much because when it goes against you, it goes *HARD* (e.g. SQQQ increased almost 10% on Friday if you include after hours). QQQ burned me too bad. If I were going to do it on with a leveraged underlying I'd probably do it on a leveraged DJIA product since the Dow tends to be the least volatile of the major indexes. Just be cognizant of the fact that options are leverage, so you're using leverage on a leveraged underlying during one of the most volatile times in recent market history.\n5. As far as risk/reward goes, just do what you're comfortable with while also remembering that--for the most part, the lower your max profit the higher probability that you're going to realize said profit. I usually shoot for \\~$15 max profit with 3-5 DTE and close them between $5 and $10 which allows me to roll them every day or two. But like I said I focus on resistance points so if the next area of significant resistance puts my max profit at $10, I'd rather be a little conservative and take that higher probability than be on the wrong side of a breakout. I'll probably be willing to risk more once I have a larger account, but right now a $500 loss would be a decent sized hit.\n6. You didn't ask about this, but from my experience it's also good try to use predictable-ish intraday price movements and mean reversion to your advantage. That usually means opening/closing positions in the morning or the afternoon when volatility is the highest. So again, if SPY gaps up overnight and opens like 2% higher, the tendency is that it will fall and \"fill in\" most of those skipped prices in the next couple of hours, even if it keeps going higher for the rest of the day. This also tends to happen when it gaps down, but is more predictable for a gap up. Those movements are your chances scale in/out to increase your max profit.\n\nSorry again for the novel, but I hope I answered your questions.",

        "body": "In my experience calls are particularly risky on low cost stocks whether they are close to earnings or not. For one, you need to buy a lot of calls to make a solid gain. Even average down on calls. Secondly if unforeseen issues arise like failed stimulus packages, an increase in COVID outbreak, an increase in unemployment, other bad news, perhaps the market shits itself like it did in March, or bad GDP numbers come out .... well .... options expire. Stocks live forever ... or until bankruptcy at least. I believe in PSFW, GPK, &amp; at least for now, ITI. I know that bagholdong these will eventually get me my money back if the unforeseen happens. Not so buying calls. \n\nNevertheless it may work out for you. But I buy calls two quarters out. Which is in part why these stocks don\u2019t look particularly attractive to me from an options stand point. They\u2019ll need to pump hard to break even. IV can be massive near earnings. If I were to buy calls I would do it after a post earnings sell off. The IV crush will make them cheaper and the value added by IV will grow until next ER. Your question isn\u2019t an easy one for me to answer because I am very risk adverse when it comes to options. Just sold my 5 CTXS call options for a profit today and could have made a lot more of I had just held on to them.\n\nLong answer but I wanted you to see it at a different point of view.",

At that job I started my 4 year degree in compsci and started pursuing certifications. In 2 years years I finished my A+ and network+, which allowed me to get a new job as a server administrator for a credit union. A year into that job I got microsoft certified, and a year after that I got my security+ certification with a promotion to systems engineer. I learned everything I could at that credit union; I made their consultants obsolete by learning cisco networking and VMware administration. The following year I finished my bachelor's in computer science, and then asked the same consultants I made obsolete at the credit union for a job. That was 6 months ago, right as all this covid stuff hit.\n\nThe only reason they lost my credit union as a client was because they took the time to show me around VMware and cisco administration. They taught me just enough for me to put together a vsphere cluster in my home lab with cisco switching and routing. That was all I needed to gain the confidence necessary to stop calling them. I decided that I wanted to work with them around the time I no longer needed their help! \n\nI knew it was risky going from a secure job as a Systems engineer at a credit union to an IT consultant for a small firm, but it was totally worth it. I wake up when I want to and work when I want to. I need to bill 15 hours a week to pay for myself and make the firm some extra money. Anything extra just makes me look good! Now I'm VMware certified and working on Citrix and Cisco certifications. I love all of my colleagues and the constant learning opportunities. I wouldn't trade my current job for anything.\n\nTldr: Never stop learning. Aim for a new certification every year, and make sure to network!",

Amazon actually has better synergy between its a) streaming biz b) Amazon online biz by the way of cross-marketing between the streaming customers and buyers, on top of that the home automation market, and much more capital to play in the streaming biz vs. Netflix, and lastly  c) Netflix's production capabilities is very much replicable with enough capital.\n\n2) I believe Amazon is well positioned to dominate the streaming market with Twitch, yet it will have synergies between the Streaming biz, Gaming biz, and Online Retail biz. Amazon can potentially fight steam for the platform biz, and it is already incorporating advanced gamification into Twitch that I believe will ultimately integrate with its Online retail and Gaming Biz\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) AWS and thin clients,. desktop virtualization space. This is a market that has explosive underlying growth behind it, and Amazon alongside Citrix is well positioned to capture more MS down the road.",
