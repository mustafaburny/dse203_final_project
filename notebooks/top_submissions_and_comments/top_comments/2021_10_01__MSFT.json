But because Amazon has their fingerprints on everything, one bad segment could really hurt their projected outlook.\n\nFrom a company perspective, Amazon is stronger than ever. Don't mistake stock price with the company's outlook. Amazon will continue dominating and growing. Earnings report don't determine the direction of a company. It's just if you have been investing into Amazon the past year, your money has basically earned you a negative return considering that index funds would have pushed your portfolio much higher. \n\nThe way I see it, long-term investors have nothing to worry about. Amazon/Apple aren't going away. Short-term, there are much better opportunities elsewhere for your money to grow. \n\nPersonally, best blue chipper IMO is MSFT. Focused on what they know, continuously growing at high rates with their cloud services being a strong focus. Profit margins are absolute bananas. Last year, $60 billion profit on $155 billion revenue. With many companies using their services more than ever at an alarming rate, I like MSFT's lack of dependency in supply chain issues that Apple and Amazon has to deal with and rely on heavily.",

        "body": "very startup has an origin story, a tale that illustrates its core principles. For Wealthsimple, that meant promoting low-fee, passive investing.\n\nAfter selling his first business about a decade ago, Wealthsimple co-founder Michael Katchen constructed a simple portfolio of exchange-traded funds using Microsoft Excel, then told the friends with whom he cashed out that this approach was the best way to invest their money.\n\nThe underlying premise: It\u2019s tough to outperform the market over the long run, so for most people it\u2019s better to invest in a mix of low-cost ETFs and ride the wave.\n\n\u201cThe feedback I got from my friends was, \u2018Mike, we\u2019re lazy. We love the system, but can you just please do it for us?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Katchen told The Globe and Mail in 2016. \u201cAnd they became the first 10 clients of Wealthsimple.\u201d\n\nThe concept proved popular with the millennial crowd, attracting billions of dollars in assets to Wealthsimple\u2019s so-called robo-adviser, and the company went so far as to buy Super Bowl ads preaching \u201csimple automated investing.\u201d In no time, Wealthsimple had so much buzz that people started to wonder if it would take down Bay Street\u2019s old guard.\n\nLately, so much of that seems like a past life. The company\u2019s automated platform still exists, but Wealthsimple is now advertising a day trading app for retail investors. And it\u2019s not just stocks \u2013 it is heavily promoting its new cryptocurrency business, which allows users to swap a slew of crypto assets.\n\nThe new strategy seems at odds with Wealthsimple\u2019s founding principles, particularly so with crypto, which is highly volatile and has some of the highest trading fees around. In a recent speech, Gary Gensler, the new head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, called the crypto market the Wild West, \u201crife with fraud, scams and abuse.\u201d China recently made all crypto transactions illegal.\n\nDespite the hard pivot, Wealthsimple has said little about its change of heart. When asked about the new strategy, no one was willing to be interviewed. Instead, the company sent e-mails explaining that it is diversifying to target different client segments.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to help everyone achieve financial freedom, no matter who they are or how much they have. That mission hasn\u2019t changed. We are a fast growing company building a full financial ecosystem for our clients across their savings, investing, spending, tax and crypto needs,\u201d Mr. Katchen wrote.\n\nAs for crypto\u2019s volatility, which prompted the SEC chair to call it a \u201chighly speculative asset class,\u201d Mr. Katchen does not believe that disqualifies it from inclusion in a well-rounded portfolio. Wealthsimple, he wrote, is \u201cvery comfortable recommending that our clients put their money in diversified, low-cost portfolios, while also supporting them if they wish to invest in particular companies or promising new technology.\u201d He also said that Wealthsimple is the first crypto platform to be regulated by a securities authority in Canada.\n\nWhat is happening at Wealthsimple is playing out in a similar fashion across the robo-adviser industry. Once-popular rivals in the United States, including Wealthfront and Betterment, are facing existential crises of their own. For all the billions of dollars that robo-advisers manage, it often isn\u2019t enough to turn a profit. Betterment\u2019s CEO stepped down last December, and its new leader acknowledged that an initial public offering likely was not possible until the company started making money.\n\n\u201cThese businesses operate on very tight margins. They just have extremely low fees, therefore they have to achieve pretty large scale before they\u2019re profitable,\u201d said David Goldstone, head of research and analytics at Backend Benchmarking, which tracks the robo-adviser market, in an interview.\n\nEven if a robo-adviser brings in tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue by charging around 0.5 per cent annually, the company has to spend heavily to attract new clients. \u201cThere was an industry-wide underestimation of how much it was going to cost to acquire customers,\u201d Mr. Goldstone added.\n\nCompounding the problem, the old guard woke up and launched robo-advisers of their own. In the U.S., Vanguard and Charles Schwab now dominate the market, with assets worth US$210-billion and US$60-billion, respectively, at the end of 2020. Betterment, the largest independent robo-adviser in the U.S., managed US$28-billion at the same date. In Canada, Bank of Montreal launched its SmartFolio robo-adviser in 2016, and Royal Bank of Canada followed suit in 2018.\n\nThe incumbents aren\u2019t simply more competition \u2013 they have a structural advantage, because they can cross-sell their robo-platforms to existing clients, lowering their customer-acquisition costs.\n\nTo adjust, Wealthsimple started diversifying in 2018 with a high-interest savings account, then added Wealthsimple Trade, which allows users to buy and sell stocks. In the fall of 2019, the company acquired software maker Simpletax. And a few months later it launched Wealthsimple Cash, a hybrid of a no-fee chequing account and a high-interest savings account.\n\nThe pivot to crypto started in August, 2020, when Wealthsimple\u2019s users were permitted to start trading Bitcoin and Ether. This past June, trading expanded to 14 additional crypto assets, including Litecoin and Dogecoin.\n\nWealthsimple does not break down its assets by division, but retail trading and crypto are what makes Silicon Valley salivate. Last fall, Wealthsimple raised $114-million in a funding round that valued the company at $1.4-billion. In May, it raised another $750-million, boosting its valuation to $5-billion only seven months later.\n\nRetail trading app Robinhood and crypto trading hub Coinbase recently went public in the United States, and their financial statements illustrate just how explosive retail trading revenue growth can be, particularly in crypto. At Robinhood, crypto brought in US$320-million in the first half of 2021, compared with just US$10-million in the first half of 2020.\n\nTo understand what that could mean for Wealthsimple, simply look at the fee schedule. The company\u2019s robo-clients often pay 0.5 per cent annually, while crypto traders pay 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per transaction (although Wealthsimple must split that fee with other parties).\n\nStock trading and crypto are also popular with younger users, which has always been Wealthsimple\u2019s target market but proved to be a tough nut to crack.\n\nEven though the company attracted billions in assets, it was a tiny fraction of the total wealth-management market. Switching rates, which measure the likelihood that someone is willing to leave their main financial institution, remain stubbornly low. In 2020, management consultancy Accenture pegged the switching rate for a primary financial account in Canada at only 4 per cent.\n\nYet as the company grows, it seems inevitable that it will move further from its roots \u2013 some of which are still exposed on Wealthsimple\u2019s website. In a section promoting its robo-adviser, the company writes: \u201cHistory shows that when you try to predict the future \u2013 by picking stocks, for example \u2013 rather than investing in a highly diversified way, you are more likely to underperform the market.\u201d",

        "body": "You might be 15 years old, and you're new to investing, but I think this is a wonderful opportunity for you take charge of your future and set yourself up nicely for financial health throughout the rest of your life. You can start now at age 15, and in 20 years, when you're 35 years old, you might be completely financially independent. Which of course would be super awesome. There's many 35 year olds walking around right now, that would wish they could go back in time to 15 years old and start doing the right things.\n\nThe right things, is learning all about the stock market and how this whole thing works. I think throwing that $200 into a ETF won't really help you too much along this path. My advice is for you to take out a nice sheet of paper and right down all the various products that you use all the time, and the products you love the most. For example, maybe you really like Disney+ streaming service. Or you really love Apple phones. Or you really like XBOX's, or you love Supreme clothing. Whatever it is, write it down. Then the next step is to find out who the parent company is that owns whatever it is that you're into. For example, if XBOX is one of your all time favorite products, the parent company is Microsoft.\n\nSo, you go through this list, finding the parent companies, and then you look for their ticker symbols. See if the companies are publicly traded. For example, if you like Supreme clothing, I think that's a privately held company, so you can't buy any shares in it.\n\nBut, once you have a nice long list of Ticker symbols that actually have real meaning for you, now you need to figure out how to compare and contrast these companies underlying financial fundamentals. \n\nBut how do you do this? Well, this is where YouTube can be your friend. There's plenty of YouTube videos that are specifically designed to help you look at a companies financials and understand what their financial statements mean. \n\nOf course, you're only 15 years old, so this might seem too difficult, but I'm telling you, just take you time, relax, you can learn this stuff. If you can learn which original Pokemon cards are the most valuable, then you can learn this crap. \n\nSo, once you do all this, then you'll have a much better idea of how things work, and then you can put your $200 into an investment account that allows you to buy fractional shares. This way, even though you have a small amount to start out with, you could buy tiny fractions of companies like Google (YouTube) or Microsoft (Xbox). This way, you can have a portfolio of maybe 6 or 7 companies that are using that $200, and even though you'll just have tiny slivers of shares, you can follow these companies over the coming months and learn more about how things work. \n\nYou can keep up with when they report their earnings, and how the stocks react to that news, etc, etc.\n\nI'm excited for you, and I wish I could time travel into the future about 20 years to ask you how you like being a multi-millionaire! Good luck!",

Apple is on a league of its own, and someone like nvdia or Qualcomm will create the M1 equivalent for PC.\n\n\nAnd the other problem as someone who works in Silicon Valley, in this industry and has a lot of friends in Intel is: \n\nIntel has been bleeding talent left and right for the last 5 years. \n\nIntel pays very low compared to Silicon Valley standards, that\u2019s partly because there is so much competition for talent from nvidia, apple, Qualcomm who are all killing it.  And as a big chunk of compensation is tied in RSUs, Intel cannot compete with salaries as these companies stocks have done extremely well. Apple\u2019s stock has gone up 300% in 5 years and if 30% of your compensation is RSUs, then you are basically getting 30-40% yoy raises for 5 years straight. No way Intel can keep up with that.\n\nIntel pays like 30-50% lower for a comparable position at apple. You just cannot retain top talent with that kind of a pay disparity. Anyone I know, who is talented enough and can leave Intel, has left Intel. \n\n\nIntel is seriously at the danger of becoming IBM of chip makers. Especially now, with amazon working on its own server chips, google working on its own, Microsoft is rumoured to be working on their own silicon for azure. Apparently Qualcomm is going to compete in PC processors. Intel is increasingly looking its in a death spiral. Google, Amazon, Microsoft can pay intel\u2019s top people 2x and poach them left and right. Because these companies are swimming in money form their other businesses.\n\n\nOne thing they have going for them is their fabs. With the increased attention to on shoring chip manufacturing, they should leverage that and start manufacturing chips from competitors for domestic consumption, especially like the defence industry. They have a healthy head start with chip manufacturing infrastructure and know how. They should lean into that. The days of them competing to make the best processors in the world is over.",

        "body": "So I really like GitLab as a company and work with them pretty frequently. If I had to bet, I would say that they are going to continue crushing the market. However, I think the stock is wayyyy overvalued.\n\nThey've got a market cap of roughly $14 billion and they'll probably do $210M - $220M in sales this year. If we say that sales = revenue (it isn't), their P/E ratio is 63. That's actually higher than one of their competitors Atlassian, who sits around 50. Atlassian's Git product BitBucket is nowhere near as good at GitLab, but Jira is literally everywhere. GitLab's closest competitor is GitHub, owned by Microsoft. Microsoft's PE ratio is in the high 30s but not a great comparison. At least 63 isn't anywhere near as bad as TSLA which sits at &gt; 400.\n\nGitLab is losing a ton of money (last year they lost about $200M). Luckily they raised about $800M from the IPO which gives them a few years of runway. My expectation is they will scale engineering and sales to keep up with GitHub.\n\nGitHub is extremely strong competition, but not for reasons people typically mention. GitHub is the defacto git repo for almost all open source software. However, they initially neglected the enterprise customers so GitLab has taken a lot of those accounts. In addition, GitLab's CI capabilities are a solid 1.5-2 years ahead of GitHub's.\n\nHowever... GitHub, owned by Microsoft, has more money than you can imagine. Microsoft's strategy is to give their customers that pay for TFS/Visual Studio free GitHub licenses. In addition, Microsoft will give customers hundreds of thousands of dollars in free consulting to help migrate over. \n\nGitHub also has a $5/user/month tier. GitLab did away with that tier a year ago because it is unprofitable. Microsoft has so much money, they are currently using those very cheap licenses for more user acquisition. Plus, pretty much every company is a Microsoft customer already so the sales reps have tons of inroads. In addition, Microsoft owns LinkedIn. That means Microsoft knows who works at what company, how to reach them, the skills of the company's employees, and what platforms they use (e.g., if a company has 30 enterprise software engineers for SAP, well, MSFT knows they do a lot of SAP work). That information is extremely valuable to sellers.",
