And time and again, these same Chinese stocks are outperformed by American counterparts with tons less risk and no threat of CCP sword of damocles over their heads.  Had you invested in Microsoft, Google, FB, or any FANG, you would have outperformed these Chinese stocks dramatically.\n\nJust because China is economically powerful doesn't mean you, especially an international investor, get to benefit.  The CCP's goal is for China to become more powerful at your expense, not your gain.",

Small periods of sideways movement or short term dips are fine, but sustained downward movements, or big moves down with a new resistance level that is made out of titanium steel is a disaster for a wheel.\n\nAs already noted in another reply, SPY isn't ideal for Wheels for pretty much the reason you already said: since SPY is well diversified, on average SPY is less risky and less risk means less reward. The risk premium on SPY is therefore relatively low.\n\nUsually the best Wheel stocks are dividend paying blue chips, like AAPL, MSFT, JNJ, BLK, XOP, etc. Most people can't afford to wheel those stocks, though, so you need to find lower cost stocks that still have solid growth potential in the short term. Not meme stocks, that's a volatility play. You want steady and predictable, not boom or bust.",

It\u2019s partly true, small, medium and (some) large sized tech companies have a really unhealthy debt ratios. \n\nHowever, debt is and have been so damn cheap and why Google or MSFT should be punished for holding debt is beyond me as they could quite simply change their capital structure over a year or two, I\u2019m even gonna bet they already started working on it. \n\nSo, I\u2019d be worried about smaller companies with high debt and bad cash flows. The mega cap ones, not so much.",

Also, Microsoft nor other PC vendors (except for Samsung maybe) are not building their own ARM processors at the moment. Qualcomm is the only player right now and they didn't have great offerings lately, particularly for WoA.

I don't currently own any shares, but I'm rooting for this company longterm because he seems like such a genuinely good natured fellow.\n\nI've daytraded and swing traded the stock a few times. Buying the stock at it's price right now, (around 8 bucks), seems like a screaming steal. You can be conservative with it, and just ride it from $8 to $12. The only real problem is that I do think we're headed for a major correction which is going to see huge megacaps like AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA all down 20 to 25 percent off their all time highs, and what does that mean for a tiny company like HYLN? Could HYLN drop all the way to say 6 bucks a share if the entire market tanks?\n\nThat's really my only hesitation in loading the boat on HYLN. I will say this though, if the market does indeed tank, and HYLN drops to $6, it will be time to buy as many shares as I possibly can stomach.

SBUX could be interesting too.\n\nFor FB, I own a 250 strike FB call June 2023 (already lost 20% on that one), so just selling a call against it (PMCC).\n\nAlso have 1 call in PATH and FUBO (more speculative plays), and I'm already almost 50% down in PATH, 40 strike Jan 2023 call. Collecting peanuts premium against it as well in the mean time. Oh well, at least my calls were all deep ITM plays.\n\nI think I'm learning to stick with NVDA, MSFT, SPY, and QQQ.",
