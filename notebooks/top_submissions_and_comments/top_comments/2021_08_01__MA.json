        "body": "Interesting piece in the WSJ by George Soros last week.  Investing in Chinese companies looks like an excellent way to hand money over to Xi Jinping and the CCP \n\n&gt; That process has been unfolding in the past year and reached a crescendo in recent weeks. It started with the sudden cancellation of a new issue by Alibaba\u2019s Ant Group in November 2020 and the temporary disappearance of its former executive chairman, Jack Ma. Then came the disciplinary measures taken against Didi Chuxing after it floated an issue in New York in June 2021. It culminated with the banishment of three U.S.-financed tutoring companies, which had a much greater effect on international markets than Mr. Xi expected. Chinese financial authorities have tried to reassure markets but with little success.\n\n&gt; Mr. Xi is engaged in a systematic campaign to remove or neutralize people who have amassed a fortune. His latest victim is Sun Dawu, a billionaire pig farmer. Mr. Sun has been sentenced to 18 years in prison and persuaded to \u201cdonate\u201d the bulk of his wealth to charity.\n\n&gt;  This campaign threatens to destroy the geese that lay the golden eggs. Mr. Xi is determined to bring the creators of wealth under the control of the one-party state. He has reintroduced a dual-management structure into large privately owned companies that had largely lapsed during the reform era of Deng. Now private and state-owned companies are being run not only by their management but also a party representative who ranks higher than the company president. This creates a perverse incentive not to innovate but to await instructions from higher authorities.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-jinping-deng-xiaoping-dictatorship-ant-didi-economy-communist-party-beijing-authoritarian-11628885076",

It's like if you do whatever the government wants to keep the government happy, they'll let you continue doing whatever it is you do. If you step out of line, get too big, or aren't useful anymore then you get the Jack Ma treatment. The government there makes and breaks businesses and people as opposed to the West where companies advance or decline based on how they perform in the market.\n\nOn top of that, China... how to say... doesn't have \"personal property\" or \"property rights\" in the sense that we in the US and West know and are familiar with and invest with confidence based on. The whole way contracts and courts work there is very different. Their government has no qualms about simply declaring that a particular person or people no longer owns certain things. That is utterly unimaginable for us in the West. Your property being inseparable from you without either you voluntarily selling it or the government attempting to take it by running it through a fair and open legal process is one of the foundational ideas of the West.\n\nAlso, they don't have accounting standards and bookkeeping and banking like we do. So, good luck with whatever numbers they present.\n\nAll of this is to say investing in China is a bad idea. You're giving someone else money that hopefully maybe connects to a company in China that is a black box that will randomly prosper or fail for unknowable reasons.",

The government basically stepped in before the company became to big to fail. The CCP saw Ma as becoming too big and powerful so they needed to cut him and his company down. Now the head government official in Hangzhou where BABA is headquartered is under a corruption investigation in connection with ANT. The CCP will go after all the politicians who are connected to Ma. They will discard them so Ma loses his political influence too. China can and will replace BABA with another company quickly and efficiently. \n\nNot only this...they will probably get delisted in the US when they're required to be audited. China has a red line for auditing. It won't let anyone look at the financial details that could be a \"national security\" problem. Probably all government officials use BABA for finances so there is no way they will allow auditing of the company.",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s government quietly appointed a director to the board of ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s key domestic subsidiary several months ago, an unusual arrangement that offers Beijing even more sway and insight into the world\u2019s largest private technology company.\n\nThe video and news giant in April sold a 1% stake in Beijing ByteDance to three entities including one controlled by the country\u2019s internet overseer and gave the government a board seat, according to a person familiar with the matter. The entity, which owns licenses to operate the company\u2019s TikTok-like Douyin and news service Toutiao within the world\u2019s No. 2 economy, remains separate from ByteDance Ltd., the company\u2019s main fundraising vehicle through which it operates TikTok globally.\n\nChinese state organs have for years invested billions of dollars into high-profile startups from Didi Global Inc. to Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group Co., but few if any manage to secure a seat at the highest decision-making table. The revelation about ByteDance, first reported by The Information, is likely to deepen investors\u2019 concerns about Beijing\u2019s attempts to wrest control of data from its giant technology industry, to both curb their influence and secure a valuable resource to power the economy and drive Xi Jinping\u2019s vision of common prosperity.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what motivated the government\u2019s involvement at ByteDance earlier this year, but it coincides with Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown on private enterprises, particularly in the tech sector. Regulators have expressed concerns about data security and the tools that companies like ByteDance use to present content to users.\n\nBut the fact that the industry regulator can designate someone to the board of a prominent sector player may unsettle investors worried about the broader ramifications of Beijing\u2019s clampdown. Even before Xi\u2019s administration tightened its grip on the tech sector, ByteDance had grappled with American lawmakers\u2019 accusations that TikTok in particular threatens national security and could aid Beijing in espionage efforts. In May, the month after the Chinese regulator took its stake, founder Zhang Yiming relinquished day-to-day control of his company to its closest lieutenant, a decision regarded as an attempt to distance himself from the growing turbulence at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cIt intensifies worries about the government\u2019s intentions for China\u2019s internet sector and the concessions private firms may have to make,\u201d said Michael Norris at consultancy AgencyChina. \u201cIt gives new context to Zhang Yiming\u2019s decision to step down from his position as ByteDance\u2019s CEO.\n\n\u201dXi\u2019s crackdown on businesses from ride-hailing firms to fintech and edtech upstarts to the largest players in commerce has traumatized markets throughout much of 2021, wiping more than $1 trillion off Chinese stocks and igniting intense debate about the Communist Party\u2019s longer-term objectives for private enterprise.\n\nBeijing ByteDance Technology \u2014 a Chinese entity established in 2012 when Zhang started his now thriving internet apps empire -- sold a 1% stake in an April 30 deal to WangTouZhongWen (Beijing) Technology, which is owned by three state entities. According to Tianyancha, a widely referenced database of corporate records, the trio included the China Internet Investment Fund, controlled by the Cyberspace Administration of China; China Media Group, the Party-controlled national broadcaster, and the Beijing municipal government\u2019s investment arm.\n\nThat deal allowed the investing entity to appoint one of only three board members, named Wu Shugang in the database. Instead of selling a stake in the holding company that includes its overseas businesses such as TikTok, the firm negotiated to have the government invest in the Beijing entity, according to the person.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese subsidiary referenced only relates to some of ByteDance\u2019s China-market video and information platforms, and holds some of the licenses they require to operate under local law,\u201d a ByteDance spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe investment itself wasn\u2019t unusual. The China Internet Investment Fund, run by the same powerful watchdog that initiated a probe into Didi in the wake of its $4.4 billion initial public offering in New York, has taken stakes in a plethora of startups including ByteDance\u2019s chief rival Kuaishou; podcast giant Ximalaya; truck-hailing app Full Truck Alliance and AI leader Sensetime.\n\nBut it\u2019s highly unusual for the government to directly appoint a board member at a private tech firm. Beijing, worried that entrepreneurs like Ma and their expanding dominions would eventually undermine the influence of the Party, has moved since late last year to rein in the industry\u2019s biggest enterprises. Various government agencies have launched investigations into monopolistic behavior at a slew of firms including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Wang Xing\u2019s Meituan, initiated deep data security reviews at Didi and Full Truck Alliance Co., pulled the plug on tech firms\u2019 IPOs abroad and even ordered vast swaths of the after-school tutoring industry to go non-profit.\n\n\u201cHaving a state-backed investor is still not sufficient to address regulatory challenges facing ByteDance\u2019s listing,\u201d said Feng Chucheng, a political analyst with consultancy Plenum in Beijing. \u201cWhat prevents the company from going public is not its corporate governance structure or source of funding, but the risk it could potentially impose on national security, due to the amount of data it accesses.\n\n\u201dThe unprecedented salvos have stoked concerns that Beijing is intent on exerting undue control over private enterprise, fomenting uncertainty that some say is making China Inc. un-investable.\u201cIt reignites debate in overseas markets as to whether TikTok could be a vehicle for state influence,\u201d Norris said.\n\nRIP BABA longs.",

As at now, Baba is #1 trending hashtag in Chinese social media. People are saying various negative things. Some say it will be nationalized. I am actually giving you a live update. Xi hates Jack Ma for many reason. But mostly because Jack Ma stands for the capital influence over the state and he is the outstanding speaker of pro-western ccp circle. Jack and Baba represent challenge to hardcore Maoist like Xi. Likely he will ended jail if he is lucky( not execution) You can gamble all other Chinese firms , but not baba. The downfall of jack ma is a sure thing. Any average Chinese knows that. The baba as a company may still be exist, but what it\u2019s ending means to the capital market and as public traded company is unknown.

Why do you think Jack Ma literally disappeared? Can you imagine if the U.S. government targeted Amazon and Apple in the same way? You have to be really naive to not see that China has a strong gridlock on their companies. They are, at the end of the day, socially communistic. Meaning, they allow companies to operate privately but ultimately under the benefit of the Chinese government which is again, why American companies wishing to operate in China have to partner with a Chinese company.

It felt like I was losing money to hit the sell button, but in reality I made a great profit and locked it in. I still have a ton to learn. It shouldn't have been that hard. If it was in the 90s right now I probably wouldn't even be having these thoughts, which is scary in itself.\n\nI guess this is why it's important to have an exit strategy and execute it?

Folks, I know you don't want to plow through the SEC filings and nit pick them. But you really have to. Zy had already been borrowing massively from the dubious Perspective Credit Holdings II, **second line** in their s-1. When a company tells you it is in trouble, believe them. They RUSHED to IPO, with no revenue in Covid, because they were going to have to fork over everything to their creditors unless they had a big cash raise. They had a 100 million credit facility on December 31, 2020. They had liens on substantially all their assets when they IPO'd. Perceptive Credit Holdings will own every patent of ZY within days, now. Read your SEC docs, folks. Rely on teams with great lawyers and auditors that provide us with well crafted SEC filings in a timely manner. Edit: I mean it could still be salvageable because they raised about 548Mil in the IPO to service their debt, but the evidence was in the s-1s. And the analysts have only downgraded to hold, left them with a $12 instead of a $54. lol. who knows. My point is related to the SPAC vehicle and the SEC filings. Follow your teams and follow the quality, and please don't compare ZY to $DNA, they really do not match.",

I know very little about them.\n\nCHPT - Chargepoint - Their business model relies on the sales of cloud services to partners that provide colorful reports on charger utilization. The partner provides the power and in many cases the maintenance as well. Each charger nets them at least $300/year in revenue, with more if the customer buys a maintenance plan.\n\nEVGo - EVGo builds the infrastructure and pays for the power, and profits based upon how they bill customers. Their primary revenue source is customers using the network. Their prices are a bit high, but they are working on getting really valuable locations.  \n\n\nBLINK - They revenue share with the site hosting the charger and are mostly installing low-reliability chargers at usage prices that make gas look dirt cheap. Without a major change in their business model, I don't see this going far, but the upside is that low information site hosts (often in the hospitality industry) find them appealing.\n\nVOLTA - Advertising based free charging. The way I see it, these guys have figured out a way to buy billboard space in high traffic areas for &lt;$100/month in operational costs. Its a really clever business model. Not sure how sustainable it is, but maybe?\n\nElectrify America &amp; Tesla Superchargers - Automaker subsidiaries, so not independently traded. Probably closest business model-wise to EVGo, though with slightly different pricing strategies.\n\nI've probably left out some other charge equipment manufacturers, but I can't think of them right now.",

It's all about opportunity cost, and the benchmark they largely compare investments to (and discount future cash flows with) is the risk-free rate of return, which is the 10-year note.\n\n**EDIT:** The kicker of this highly unusual market is that many investors, like Buffett, seek 10% returns. If you see above, the TTM earnings of the S&amp;P is far from 10%, even with expected growth priced into the equation. BUT by pure investing standards, when the S&amp;P TTM earnings yield is over double the return of the 10-year yield... equities are without question the smarter investment. BUT (x2) is a 3.3% yield today (probably 4.5% by January 2022) a return you want to lock yourself in for the long term?.. BUT! (x3) Sitting in cash, or even government bonds, you're guaranteed to lose money with inflation..\n\nTLDR: The market is both objectively cheap and historically expensive. Some people call it a \"logical bubble\". Only time will tell what will happen, but remember the job of the investor is to not get sidetracked by macro factors and instead continue to assess the earning power of companies for the long term.",

Sorry for the wall of text, but there are sources everywhere and all of the information is verifiable.\n\npart 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 part 5\n\nNow, for the part 6 with consolidated DD:\n\nDD part 6:\n\nBefore I talk about Microvast, I have to talk about how Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) came about. It is the only way anyone will truly understand any of the following DD. CATL was founded in 2011, IPO'd in 2018 for $2.1 Billion, and ended that same day at a valuation of $12.3 Billion. Today, it's worth $120 Billion. How did this explosive growth happen with a company where 99% of its revenue was only coming from China? Well, you have to go back before 2011.\n\nCATL was spun off of Amperex Technology in 2011, with Amperex and CATL both being founded by Billionaire Zeng Yuqun. Founded in 1998, Amperex's growth was driven by its ability to manufacture batteries for consumer products (e.g phones, laptops, etc.) based on licenses they acquired from American institutions and companies like Valence Technology. It was such a success and they started producing batteries for top-tier companies like Apple. Eventually, Amperex was bought out by the TDK Corporation in 2005, becoming a subsidy ran by Yuqun.\n\nThen in 2011 CATL was spun off by Yuqun, based on the same exact strategy of purchasing advanced R&amp;D licensing to manufacture superior EV batteries. However, it wasn't without help. They rode the coattails of the CCP's investment of over $60 Billion USD in electrifying China. To be eligible for any of the money on the table, everything had to be domestic, including the battery supply. On the supply side, there was little competition, with large Chinese automotive OEMs deciding to only produce batteries for themselves. CATL filled in the gap, their first big break being with BMW in 2013, eventually, CATL became the largest battery manufacturer in the world, in the world's largest EV market.\n\nMicrovast, spinning off a chemical and material science company sold to DOW Chemical, sustained itself in a competitive industry. Unfortunately, it did not have as much success as CATL. Why that is, is for another post but major factors include high internal R&amp;D costs, being too ahead of their time in regards to fast charging, and generally how subsidies were constructed for heavy vehicles in China despite making the most economical sense.\n\nWith all of this out of the way, now we can actually talk about Microvast and its latest technology.\n\nBut one more thing, it's best that I clear up relevant concepts relating to battery technology. While I expect most here to have a general understanding of how a battery works, I don't expect most to understand the underlying intricacies and nuances relevant but important to understanding battery technology. Below comment on a small fraction of concepts, I have noticed that is poorly understood among retail traders.\n\n1. Battery technology is a multi-criteria optimization problem\n\nNo one battery chemistry is perfect for all applications. Typically you are looking at several different characteristics of a battery such as energy density, power density, cost, safety, cycle life, efficiency, internal impedance, etc. Hopefully, you get the point. The end all be all is not energy density. More often than not an improvement in one metric causes a worsening in others. knowing the application at hand is very important. Even across EVs, there's a vast difference in needs when it comes to battery performance requirements.\n\n2. Energy density (or any metric per mass) differs between levels of manufacturing\n\nIf you're not specifying energy density by the level of subcomponents, cell, pack, module, or system, in my eyes it is meaningless. Below, courtesy of L\u00f6bberding et al. shows the vast difference you can get at the cell level (Blue) and system-level (orange).",

It's a person calling out a dam burst and there's no way you can time it or convince enough people in time to prevent it from happening. I myself believe in the things you say and have been expecting a crash for a long time now. None of these highs make sense or look sustainable in the long run. I am greatly concerned that the people do not understand that each subsequent crisis or string of bubbles is adding more dimensions to the unpredictable nature of the problem. Further, us folk not being accurate seers is enough to discredit our views.",

Folks, I know you don't want to plow through the SEC filings and nit pick them. But you really have to. Zy had already been borrowing massively from the dubious Perspective Credit Holdings II, **second line** in their s-1. When a company tells you it is in trouble, believe them. They RUSHED to IPO, with no revenue in Covid, because they were going to have to fork over everything to their creditors unless they had a big cash raise. They had a 100 million credit facility on December 31, 2020. They had liens on substantially all their assets when they IPO'd. Perceptive Credit Holdings will own every patent of ZY within days, now. Read your SEC docs, folks. Rely on teams with great lawyers and auditors that provide us with well crafted SEC filings in a timely manner. Edit: I mean it could still be salvageable because they raised about 548Mil in the IPO to service their debt, but the evidence was in the s-1s. And the analysts have only downgraded to hold, left them with a $12 instead of a $54. lol. who knows. My point is related to the SPAC vehicle and the SEC filings. Follow your teams and follow the quality, and please don't compare ZY to $DNA, they really do not match.",

I know very little about them.\n\nCHPT - Chargepoint - Their business model relies on the sales of cloud services to partners that provide colorful reports on charger utilization. The partner provides the power and in many cases the maintenance as well. Each charger nets them at least $300/year in revenue, with more if the customer buys a maintenance plan.\n\nEVGo - EVGo builds the infrastructure and pays for the power, and profits based upon how they bill customers. Their primary revenue source is customers using the network. Their prices are a bit high, but they are working on getting really valuable locations.  \n\n\nBLINK - They revenue share with the site hosting the charger and are mostly installing low-reliability chargers at usage prices that make gas look dirt cheap. Without a major change in their business model, I don't see this going far, but the upside is that low information site hosts (often in the hospitality industry) find them appealing.\n\nVOLTA - Advertising based free charging. The way I see it, these guys have figured out a way to buy billboard space in high traffic areas for &lt;$100/month in operational costs. Its a really clever business model. Not sure how sustainable it is, but maybe?\n\nElectrify America &amp; Tesla Superchargers - Automaker subsidiaries, so not independently traded. Probably closest business model-wise to EVGo, though with slightly different pricing strategies.\n\nI've probably left out some other charge equipment manufacturers, but I can't think of them right now.",

It's all about opportunity cost, and the benchmark they largely compare investments to (and discount future cash flows with) is the risk-free rate of return, which is the 10-year note.\n\n**EDIT:** The kicker of this highly unusual market is that many investors, like Buffett, seek 10% returns. If you see above, the TTM earnings of the S&amp;P is far from 10%, even with expected growth priced into the equation. BUT by pure investing standards, when the S&amp;P TTM earnings yield is over double the return of the 10-year yield... equities are without question the smarter investment. BUT (x2) is a 3.3% yield today (probably 4.5% by January 2022) a return you want to lock yourself in for the long term?.. BUT! (x3) Sitting in cash, or even government bonds, you're guaranteed to lose money with inflation..\n\nTLDR: The market is both objectively cheap and historically expensive. Some people call it a \"logical bubble\". Only time will tell what will happen, but remember the job of the investor is to not get sidetracked by macro factors and instead continue to assess the earning power of companies for the long term.",
