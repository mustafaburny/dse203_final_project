Most dont realize that there are hundreds of merchants who offer the same thing SQ does and did offer the same service long before SQ came around. SQ just made it slightly easier and had marketing power the smaller processors didnt. This is why many non-tech savvy people dont know about the alternatives.\n\nThough for the record I had absolutely no problem using a normal merchant when I ran my businesses and practically all of them offered a strip you can use with your computers (pre smartphone) as well as traditional machinery and a online API. This was as far back as 2000... When Blackberries became a thing you could also get a swipe thing for them.\n\nA normal merchant services offers far lower fees than SQ does. This is why I just dont get why anyone uses it. Its purely lack of knowledge. The only possible reason one might prefer SQ for merchant services is if you have stupidly low volume... to the tune of maybe a couple hundred a day. In this case, sure... SQ makes sense. Otherwise, you would be a fool not to get a normal merchant. Just call Costco for theirs. This is why I just dont get how SQ is growing... are businesses really that dumb? I just dont get it...",

Gonna take a while to double your investment (assuming you bought today) but strong financially and bright future. \n\n$NIO is insanely overvalued. There\u2019s no argument here. All EV and renewable stocks, wouldn\u2019t suggest hopping in. P/Es are inflated so high it\u2019s a guarantee we\u2019ll see lower prices (a lot lower!) soon. History has shown.\n\nI like undervalued gems. \n\n$SMCI, $ASO, $VIRT, $ERIC, and $MTZ are my small cap stocks for long term hold. Each have their reasons as to why I\u2019m holding but more importantly, their financials are strong. P/S approximately 1 (tough to find this ratio in today\u2019s market. Gotta dig.) P/E ratios are low relative to competitors. Some have little long term debt. Good ROEs. Increasing revenue. Just safe to hold and DCA down during times like this for me. \n\nLarge cap stocks I\u2019m holding long are $TMUS, $VZ, $AAPL, $V, $MA, and waiting for $PYPL to hit $130 to hop in. But guess what? If it doesn\u2019t hit, I\u2019m not jumping in. Simple as that. Plenty of stocks out there, no reason why you should jump in a stock that hasn\u2019t convinced you yet.\n\nOr if you don\u2019t wanna bother and have a strong stomach to handle red days, buy $TQQQ. \n\nLast thing. Rule of thumb: if it\u2019s being newly mentioned highly on Wall Street bets, and media outlets, most likely it\u2019s too late.",

Say what you will about US monetary policy, but we're still a long ways from burning cash for heat. There's a bigger need for it if you're in a third-world country with bigger fears than 10% inflation, or maybe you want to hold Bitcoin if you're in an authoritarian country and have genuine fears the government may come to seize your other assets.\n\n&gt;You will likely not be able to go to a shop and buy a bag of rice using BTC in a country that actively doesn't want to support BTC usage.\n\nCouldn't agree more, and I've said elsewhere that Western countries are probably still a long ways off from adopting it, if ever. Shop owners don't just say \"ok I'll take it,\" especially with it as volatile as it is--your day's profits would be ruined by a 5% drop in the bitcoin market. The only way I see adoption happening in the West is through technology and not just more people owning bitcoin. There's a technological need for a debit card that would do instant conversions to USD along with being a much cheaper middle-man than Visa or Mastercard. \n\nGranted, crypto does other stuff beyond being a hopeful currency. Gaming/NFTs I think will be the first real-world use case for it.\n\nBut when Buffet calls Bitcoin \"rat-poison\" because it has no utility, he's not totally wrong, either. It's $60k of basically theoretical value. I'm big into the space, but it's also the antithesis of value investing, which I also do and the dichotomy hurts my head sometimes.",

It's entirely possible a US correction happens and a rotation into China happens for a few months, just based on cyclicality - China started drawing down months ago on regulatory fears, so valuations are attractive. \n\n2. MA and V have been pulling back for about a year, due to a variety of factors, and are sitting at trend support on the log-scale, 10-year+, monthly charts. Financials and payments are often a good leading indicator of cycles - so we could be looking at a rotation out of tech and speculative investments but the beginnings of a rebound in MA/V (and maybe PYPL but that's a mixed tech/finance stock). Anticipated rising interest rates will benefit traditional mortgage banks at the expense of investment banks.\n\n3. For broader-market permabears scared of China - Utilities have been relatively flat for about a year now as well. They are also a safer, more income-focused sector for downturns, and have relatively inelastic demand, which protects them from downturns to a moderate extent.",

You essentially retracted your generalization about \u201cblue state governors\u201d plural to now refer to only the governor of WA. Sure?\n\nThe thing I really want to focus on is your weakest argument which is the edit you put on this comment. You said you would \u201cshow me how I was wrong\u201d in the edit. Apparently showing me how I am wrong is just you typing that \u201cthere were all sorts of restrictions\u201d without any specifics or sources. You listed a bunch of shit, most of which is irrelevant to any political decisions by state governors. \n\nMissed sporting events? This season in the bluest state in the US everything is full capacity indoors and out. This goes for almost all blue states. During the time period sporting events were missed - it was happening in BOTH red and blue states prior to high vaccine levels.\n\nCancelled fairs? Apparently this is a big political issue? Biggest fair in MA was packed this year and not cancelled. Also do you think the governor decides on fair cancellations to virtue signal? That one is honestly kind of funny.\n\nMandatory masks? Ironically this one you are the most off on. 6 states currently have mandatory mask laws. 3 are blue. 2 are red. One is purple. But yes - clearly \u201cblue state governors\u201d virtue signaling.\n\nHomeowner laws? I legit don\u2019t even get this point. Not aware of any \u201chomeowner laws\u201d related to covid restrictions coming from any blue state governors, at least the ones I\u2019ve listed.",

Now that companies are doing better, getting strong revenues... it doesn't really matter if the market does a hard correction. It isn't needed for there to have been a \"mistake.\" They communicate what is necessary to try to keep people calm, until the time comes for a change, and then the change is made. There is nothing in \"promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\" about stonks always going up. If they had tapered a year ago, as you seem to be suggesting, before employment had recovered then companies might not have done the same amount of hiring. That was the goal all along, and they've been saying that all along. If you've been listening to them. A lot of people have been responding with continuous cynicism, instead of listening, and those people are less prepared to rotate their investments on time.\n\nIt is up to each of us, as traders and investors, to be prepared for things like this, and to make sane choices.",

I personally contribute only to Roth because company matches to Roth 401k are considered traditional so if you have a Roth 401k you're already diversified.

That's actually what Comcast is legally feuding with them now about, they're saying that Disney is sandbagging with slow expansion of Hulu in foreign markets so they won't have to pay Comcast as much.

I would like to sell my units in this to buy  individual stocks and ETFs. My time horizon is 29 years.\n\nMy investing strategy is to buy and DRIP stocks/ETFs/etc that pay consistently growing dividends and also provide good long-term total returns (10% per year or better). I am also trying to diversify by having equal weighting in every sector.\n\nThe diversifying part is where I am having trouble. Right now, the sectors I don't have exposure to are: Energy, Consumer Discretionary, Basic Materials, and Healthcare. I have yet to find an individual company in these sectors that I like enough to buy stock in. I have found energy to be a particularly tricky sector.\n\nIs there an ETF that has equal-sector weighting, and has performed well over the long-term? Or would I be better served by buying an S&amp;P 500 or TSX60 ETF?\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "I think a similar scheme lead to the collapse of Greensill Capital recently.  They provided loans for various things to do with supply chain management.\n\nSteel Magnate Sanjeev Gupta was taking the loans from Greensill then aggressively acquiring companies and assets into his \u201cempire\u201d then immediately using those assets to acquire further loans from Greensill at values inflated wayyy above actual book value.\n\nIn effect he was buying companies, getting control of their assets, immediately securing loans against the assets and then using those loans to buy further companies / assets. etc. \n\nIt\u2019s funny because Gupta is still going but Greensill collapsed because the bigger banks it was using for its own finance decided it was being too risky and froze its accounts leading to its collapse.  \n\nGupta kinda did what you\u2019re asking about but it\u2019s all pretty dodgy and it appears as though he has gotten away with it, at least for now.",
