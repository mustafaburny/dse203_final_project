        "body": "Some historians say it was, some say it wasn't. OP says:  \n\n\n&gt;Belgium had the world's first stock market(without actual stocks) back in 1400's.\n\nWhich already sounds confusing. How can you have stock exchange without stocks? Since OP didn't add sources, what he means by this is speculation. In the early 14th century, Bruges was a center of trade in Europe. People would trade in the city square and stuff. In 1285 the *Ter Beurse Inn* was established. An inn run by the prominent Van der Beurse family and housed forgeign merchants. The square where the inn was located was where a lot of trading was done. This is where the word beurs (bourse) comes from. The inn, square, trading together make an argument for being the first exchange, with the inn later becoming a place where solely trading was done. [More on all this here.](https://thetchblog.com/2020/09/07/the-original-bourse-at-bruges/) \n\n[Trade then shifted to Antwerp, where in 1531 the first purpose-built commodities exchange building was established.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourse_of_Antwerp) So that's a Belgian contender, I suppose. \n\nThe first place where *stocks* were exchanged is [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronext_Amsterdam). In 1602. By [the Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company). You know, the company that was established in 1602 and is mentioned by OP in his second point:  \n\n\n&gt;The East India Company is widely recognized as the world\u2019s first publicly traded company  \n\nAnd then there's many more interesting contenders for world first exchanges. Ultimately it doesn't really matter which first. It's all fascinating history worth a read. Oh, also:\n\nThe top 10 list from OP also doesn't make sense to me. I was surprised the LSE had a bigger market cap than the Euronext, but even more so bigger than the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges. Looking around I can't find any data supporting the list. I also notice OP listed a whole bunch of exchanges, and uses the [Stock Exchange Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange_Group) for the London one, which is more than just the LSE. [Most top 10's I can find look like this](https://www.tradinghours.com/markets) or similar. Different order than OP's for sure.\n\nI appreciate the idea of this post. And I realise it's fluff and saturday entertainment. But for a sub that should value research like no other, it's a bit disappointing. Hopefully it lacks a bit of depth because OP put all their effort into doing DD for their portfolio ;)",

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

        "body": "I work in the semi industry and I've been in and out of AMAT positions the past couple of months. TSM, Samsung and INTC have near-term headwinds in terms of earnings based on semiconductor demand simply because it takes so long to expand capacity. The front-end winners in current semi production efforts are going to be those who supply the tools, products and services that go into these fabs that are planned for construction: AMAT, ASML, TER, LRCX, to name a few. Secondary effects on earnings from this will come 1-2-3 years down the line for the semi manufacturers themselves, depending on whether or not they are expanding/upgrading an existing facility, or building one from the ground up.\n\nThe end-users of these semiconductor products (GM, F, NVDA, AMD, etc.) will be the last ones to benefit from expanded chipmaking capacity, as easing the demand crunch allows them to resume normal sales levels. Note that for auto mfrs, this has a ripple effect on rental car companies, who sold all of their fleets in fire sales last year and now can't replace them because the auto mfrs can't make cars.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is booked up for the foreseeable future; these bookings have prices agreed well in advance, and are almost certainly not subject to TSMC's recent statements that they plan to increase prices; that will happen with new bookings down the line.",

I adore all the degenerates here. I like the positions or ban requirement. Wsb was my intro to options. It told me about the jpow brrrr and the v-shaped recovery last year. I learned that TA is the best way to sound smart but be actually retarded. Wsb showed me that dividends and boomer stocks was for nerds. And it taught me how to lose money really fast and that I should always inverse myself. But in The last 3 months I\u2019ve literally learned 5x what I knew from the past 3 years. Gme is the most interesting story of the year. This megathread was going to eventually and naturally be replaced as apes learn new plays and the gme story unfolds. It doesn\u2019t make sense to make an executive unilateral decision to kill the thread and it just makes mods look sus af. Killing the thread only feeds the conspiracy/cultish mindset. Just like all the CNBC/motley fool/S3/etc... FUD proved to me that gme was a real threat. MODS: get a grip and use this growth as an opportunity to integrate a lot of beautiful minds so that we can collectively share the best ideas and the best gains and losses. Why shoot yourselves in the foot?",
