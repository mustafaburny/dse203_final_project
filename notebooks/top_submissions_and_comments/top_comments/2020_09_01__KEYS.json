Well, it basically means that if you buy the one for 100 bucks cheaper, you're locked into ONE storefront for all your games, and that storefront is controlled and owned entirely by Sony. So that means their margins on that storefront are higher - no disc production or distribution costs or cut to any other retailers. \n\nBasically...they're trying to be Steam/Origin/Epic. But since they don't sell keys to their games, no gray market shenanigans like occurs with those. No greenmangaming sales to compete directly with. No discounts at all, if they decide they don't want to (but more likely their discounts will just be fewer and farther between as is the case right now). It's a smart play.",

Ive been in and out of it on shorts twice. I won't hold it overnight. I said it 2 nights ago 15 was my reentry, it will go lower. Look at the volume 1.42 million. This fades to 400k in a week. They have to declare the dividend soon and also report earnings. Absent those 2 keys utz is in a downward trend. As far as a Marijuana spac, kblm hands down and its happening soon. They filed preliminary registration of securities and they should file either def or prem 14 soon. Kblm has the weakest 10.9 of any stock I've ever seen. Warrants trade at .30. Low volume. It will pop to 12 maybe 13 when the filings hit but if the warrants don't pop past 2, down she goes. My pt post merger is 4.",

The stock didn't really budge.\n\n&gt;not all of us are day traders\n\nOk, but if the stock price shoots to 5 bucks on Monday, wouldn't you want to sell and then re-invest once the price settles down? The major tenet of the stock market is buy low, sell high... not buy low and just ignore profit when available. You have potential to turn your 1000 shares into 2000.\n\n&gt;let me know what plays are going to blast off don\u2019t get confident with these two Green Day\u2019s\n\nAll you really have to do is watch the morning news tickers (PR Newswire, Globe, and Businesswire) Every single day, green or red, there'll be a smattering of about 50 or so press releases right at 7am. A few of them have positive news about a drug getting approved, or a merger, or a small company taking a large profitable order etc.... From there you see if there's any movement on the stock and jump in accordingly.\n\n&gt;Netflix they already said they will invest a billions into black banks\n\nYes, this bumped the stock price up a bit on June 30... and it went back down, of course.\n\n&gt;Alicia Keys setting up a trillion dollar fund for black businesses\n\nA billion to be exact\n\n&gt;the fact ppl only invest in black stocks just to make some money for a couple of days is disgusting\n\nI'm not gonna argue with you there. Wall Street itself is disgusting. Everyone is out to make money and can still sleep at night, regardless of their morally questionable actions. As long as it's legal (and sometimes not), people will keep doing what they do. I mean, isn't short selling the definition of morally questionable? Yet people do it every day and businesses thrive on.",

        "body": "Each morning, wake up about 30 minutes before the market opens. Keep an eye on \u201cmovers\u201d that have already gained a lot AND have a large increase in volume in that 30 minute window. Usually the stocks with the greatest premarket gains are the ones with the most volume. Go all in just before the market opens. Immediately place a limit sell order for a 3%, 5%, 7% gain (whatever you are comfortable with). 9/10 times you\u2019ll hit that target. Even if you start with a very small amount, you will start to make real money very soon.\n\nEven if it\u2019s a pump and dump, you can still ride the FOMO on the way up, but you NEED to sell at your target.\n\nNever hold anything in your \u201ctrading\u201d account overnight.\n\nThe key is to be OK with seeing a small gain for the day even if that stock continues to shoot up after you sell. Don\u2019t try to \u201cread\u201d the chart to maximize gain. Just set a percentage goal and immediately place the sell order. If you can stick to the plan and not give in the FOMO you are very likely to succeed. You cannot be greedy. You need to understand that eventually 3% or 5% will be a lot of money for one day. \n\nThis is not a \u201cLambo\u201d strategy, it is a sustainable long term strategy for additional income.\n\nAlso, be ready to sell at a loss if the stock goes down. You\u2019ll never win every trade every time, you just have to win more trades than you lose. As long as you stick to a 10% threshold (up or down), you\u2019ll never completely lose your shirt.\n\nAlso, be sure to set aside what you will owe for short term capital gains, which are taxed at the regular income rate.\n\nETA: This strategy is completely separate from an \u201cinvestment\u201d strategy. In an investment strategy, never buy penny stocks as a long term hold. Buy the Large Cap boring stuff and watch your portfolio slowly gain instead of slowly bleed out while you hope and wait for a moon launch. You might get lucky, but you probably won\u2019t. \n\n-Trade penny stocks for extra income.\n-Invest in proven companies for long term growth. \n\nI just handed you the keys to success.",

I know for most of you the tanker topic has sailed in June, but when I followed the discussion back then I got inspired to pursue an idea that is not really of relevance to my employer, but has been whirling in my head for years.\n\nBefore working in finance (hence the disclaimer), I was an oil guy and among other things in charge of monitoring crude tankers sourcing feedstock to refineries. I was scraping data from MarineTraffic for ships transporting our crude. Aside from the obvious stuff such as lat/long and speed, I also got data on draft (how deep a ship sits in the water) which gave me a way to calculate the fill.\n\nI have long speculated that this data could be used somehow and when you guys were all-in on the tanker stocks it hit me. You could use draft data for entire fleets and get an estimate for fleet utilization.\n\nSo I spent most of my scarce free time the last two months setting up a scraper and a web-dashboard on AWS. I don't know if fleet utilization is really a good KPI, but in the end I just wanted to build an 80ies themed dashboard in RShiny and try some new programming tricks that I could then transfer over to my day job.\n\nSo anyway, here's the keys. Let me know, what you think. Please go gentle, as the AWS server probably craps out under heavy traffic. Also, if you are using Chrome, consider turning on the sound (controls below the map). It's part of the experience ;)\n\nPS: If you are an equity research drone sitting behind a corporate firewall, you will probably need to use Firefox or Edge as many firewalls deny sockjs websockets in Chrome.\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ELTqYND.png?1\" alt=\"Tanker Tracker Preview\"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

        "body": "&gt; I see this all the time and it's very misleading. Of course options can be traded peer to peer.\n\n--\n\n&gt; Sure the majority of trades probably involve market makers but it's not particularly unusual not to.\n\nMy post had a clear intention and given the context the intention was clear: the OP conceived of option trading as peer-2-peer driven and did not incorporate the hedging dynamics with MMs; so my post needed to steer him away from their initial conception and towards understanding MM dynamics. Judging by the number of upvotes they received, OP was not alone -- which reinforces the need for clarification.\n\nIt was clear because OP phrased the question in a particular way and I responded in a topical way.\n\nFrom your phrasing, I don't understand your intention. Is it\n\n* to dispute the general trend?\n\n* to share personal experience?\n\n* to pick hair? (&lt;--- this seems most likely to me)\n\n&gt; When that happens, it's **almost certainly not** a MM, it's another trader or institution.\n\nRather, when that happens, it is still likely an MM. You can see this meet-you-at-the-middle type of trades frequently 10min before 4pm ET. What's the odds that you get a peer to match the opposite of your *combo* trade? (ie. if you don't sell combo, just take my words that combo trades get met in the middle as well.) MM has hedging needs that can be partially fulfilled by buying a net sell order.\n\nAnother way to see it is by noting the response time. BID/ASK starts off with its usual spread and the center moves with underlying in the usual way. Often, the moment you submit an order in between the spread -- ie. either moving BID up or moving ASK down -- your order is filled. That means, in the former case, ASK moved down, and in the latter, BID moved up. In other words, someone responded to the change in order book. When that response is near instantaneous, what's the odds of it being peer trader in a low volume environment? And indeed option trading on most assets are low volume.\n\nAll that is of course balanced against the much more frequent situations when you post orders in between BID/ASK and there is no taker.\n\n&gt; This sub acts like market makers have some secret keys to the kingdom.\n\nNeither of the explanations as of the time of your posting said that. Although as analogy, it is quite true.",

        "body": "When I first started trading, I started with a attainable goal in my mind. I target 15% compounded annually and in 20 years, if I maintain this, my account will be over 400k. I think 400k over 20 years is to slow of growth in my opion but it would be consistency to meet that. My true goal would to be at 1 million in 10 years which would need to be 45% annually. I like the idea of having two goals one to reach and then another to strive for! I would also like to branch off trading income into other revenue sources like real estate and so on. I am only 21 so I have alot of time ahead of me. I also still work a job since I think multiple sources of income is one of the keys to success. Also, it is nice having guaranteed income as well. I have passed 15% already this year so some years may be better than others.",

I have V in my Roth account, and won't sell it, basically forever, or at least 5-10 years.

Yes I'm happy they've had a huge run up for the past couple years. Yes I'm sad that I sold half of my position when I had 100% return. No, I do not plan on selling more. Yes SQ is fantastic, and yes I hold a similar amount in PYPL as well. \n\nNo, I do not think SQ or PYPL will surpass visa as the king of payment processing. Visa is a giant, and could simply reveal their own p2p lending platform if any of the minor banks manages to cross their moat....it still hasn't been crossed yet.",

When a stock is trending down, people see the average as a decent price to sell at before the next down turn.\n\nIf it crosses the moving average, the price tends to move to other side of the bollinger band which is 1 standard deviation away from the moving average.

I think you could possibly see this happen with Amazon and Facebook, but I think it\u2019s unlikely to happen to the others. Anyway, this action was not catastrophic for the telecom sector. If anything, the breakup of the monopoly enabled innovation and increased the TAM of telecom companies. If it was just Ma Bell in town, think how long they would\u2019ve resisted DSL or cable internet and tried to keep us all on dialup.\n\n\nWith IE, the problem was that they used their platform (Windows) to monopolize the browser space. I think there\u2019s an extremely compelling case to argue that Google and Apple will be in trouble with this and be forced to spin off their app stores, but this will not cripple them \u2014 the vast majority of revenue does not come from App Store monopolies. Microsoft stock has been on a rampage since then, as well.\n\nTLDR: long term investors should not fear antitrust action under current regulations.",

They might even recover considering how bullish they are but regardless many of the names in energy and financials are undervalued right now and that presents opportunity. \n\nThe recent crash happened because everything was overextended but right now it\u2019s only certain sectors so that makes things different. We might end up playing a seesaw effect with financials and energy as some move away from tech.
