Well, it basically means that if you buy the one for 100 bucks cheaper, you're locked into ONE storefront for all your games, and that storefront is controlled and owned entirely by Sony. So that means their margins on that storefront are higher - no disc production or distribution costs or cut to any other retailers. \n\nBasically...they're trying to be Steam/Origin/Epic. But since they don't sell keys to their games, no gray market shenanigans like occurs with those. No greenmangaming sales to compete directly with. No discounts at all, if they decide they don't want to (but more likely their discounts will just be fewer and farther between as is the case right now). It's a smart play.",

Keep an eye on \u201cmovers\u201d that have already gained a lot AND have a large increase in volume in that 30 minute window. Usually the stocks with the greatest premarket gains are the ones with the most volume. Go all in just before the market opens. Immediately place a limit sell order for a 3%, 5%, 7% gain (whatever you are comfortable with). 9/10 times you\u2019ll hit that target. Even if you start with a very small amount, you will start to make real money very soon.\n\nEven if it\u2019s a pump and dump, you can still ride the FOMO on the way up, but you NEED to sell at your target.\n\nNever hold anything in your \u201ctrading\u201d account overnight.\n\nThe key is to be OK with seeing a small gain for the day even if that stock continues to shoot up after you sell. Don\u2019t try to \u201cread\u201d the chart to maximize gain. Just set a percentage goal and immediately place the sell order. If you can stick to the plan and not give in the FOMO you are very likely to succeed. You cannot be greedy. You need to understand that eventually 3% or 5% will be a lot of money for one day. \n\nThis is not a \u201cLambo\u201d strategy, it is a sustainable long term strategy for additional income.\n\nAlso, be ready to sell at a loss if the stock goes down. You\u2019ll never win every trade every time, you just have to win more trades than you lose. As long as you stick to a 10% threshold (up or down), you\u2019ll never completely lose your shirt.\n\nAlso, be sure to set aside what you will owe for short term capital gains, which are taxed at the regular income rate.\n\nETA: This strategy is completely separate from an \u201cinvestment\u201d strategy. In an investment strategy, never buy penny stocks as a long term hold. Buy the Large Cap boring stuff and watch your portfolio slowly gain instead of slowly bleed out while you hope and wait for a moon launch. You might get lucky, but you probably won\u2019t. \n\n-Trade penny stocks for extra income.\n-Invest in proven companies for long term growth. \n\nI just handed you the keys to success.",

        "body": "Pretty much everyone will list off some of the household names in big tech, like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, ADBE, GOOGL, etc. All of these are industry leaders with solid financials, so they\u2019re probably a safe bet for long-term growth. Though they may be overvalued right now (pretty much everything is). \n\nOther than those, within tech I tend to like semiconductors. I figure that cloud computing, AI, AR/VR, self-driving cars, fintech, bitcoin mining, smart phones and computers, etc. are just going to become a bigger and bigger part of the economy. And computer chips (CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, those chips in your credit card, etc.) are at the heart of all of these technologies. It\u2019s pretty clear that technological progress here isn\u2019t slowing, and demand for chips is just going to continue to grow. If you want to go with individual companies, NVDA, AMD, TSM, AMAT, MU, LRCX are all at the forefront right now, and have solid balance sheets. If you don\u2019t want to put all your money on one horse, a non-diversified, semiconductor-focused ETF like SMH or SOXX will give you exposure here while mitigating some of the risk. \n\nGreen/clean energy is a promising market, but it\u2019s a really young industry so there\u2019s a lot of risk in trying to pick a winner. TSLA is ahead of the pack for now, but it\u2019ll have competitors nipping at it\u2019s heals soon enough, and the stock is currently way overvalued. There are also other sectors of this market that TSLA hasn\u2019t tapped into, and could see massive growth in the next 5-15 years as we begin to wean off of fossil fuels. Again, a focused ETF like PBW or QCLN is a good way to mitigate risk and broaden exposure without having to pick a single winner. That said, this sector may be overvalued right now because oil/gas have taken a big hit during COVID and green energy isn\u2019t quite ready for prime time. In other words, oil/gas are currently cheap and will probably rebound a bit Post-COVID, so you could make money with fossil fuels, but I\u2019d stay out of them long-term and bet on clean energy/vehicles instead. \n\nI also like biotech and genomic medicine. TMO is a blue chip that basically has a monopoly and is a go-to for all biological research. Pretty safe bet on a well run company that\u2019ll be around for years. LZAGY, RHHBY, and TECH are similar, but tend to have their hands in more clinical trials and drug development, mainly with small molecules and other \u2018classic\u2019 treatment methods. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good ETF in this sector, but I haven\u2019t really looked as it\u2019s my field. CRISPR, gene therapy, etc. are all starting to show promise in the clinic, but is a really nascent industry. MRNA and BNTX are probably overvalued right now due to COVID speculation, but if they can get their delivery mechanisms to work (and they\u2019re showing promise), they\u2019ll basically revolutionize medicine. Again, if you don\u2019t want to bet on a single horse, ARKG is a good ETF for genomic medicine. TNX is a very young company that\u2019s showing a lot of promise for sequencing technology, so high risk but potentially very high reward. \n\nOther than that, it\u2019s always a good idea to put money into \u2018boring\u2019 non-risky, non-tech stocks. COST, WMT will probably be good picks during the coming economic crisis, and may actually be able to compete with AMZN if they shore up their online interface. V and MC are solid standbys (can\u2019t go wrong with credit cards). Also probably a safe bet to go with health insurance companies. SPY is also a broadly diversified ETF (basically the tracks the S&amp;P) that will be a safe bet long-term.\n\nMy suggestion would be to pick industries you think will grow long-term, and select a few stocks or an ETF within them. Set up a rather diversified portfolio so you aren\u2019t overexposed on any one front (I\u2019ve lost more than the market with this last slump, for instance, since I\u2019m overexposed in tech; I could probably use more \u2018boring\u2019 stocks like WMT). One or two shares apiece from 50 promising companies is a much safer bet than 500 shares in one or two very promising companies. Keep each at a smallish percentage of your total (I get really uncomfortable if a single stock goes above 10% of my total, even if it began as 1%, so I sell to bring it back down and use the profit to diversify). Generally speaking, the riskier the industry/company is, the lower percentage of your total it should be. \n\nHope this helps!",

Guess what... \u201ctech\u201d is literally a part of our daily lives now. \n\nIn the dotcom times it was all about lofty valuation on the possibility that tech would be the next big sector. Turns out many years later to actually be true and everyone is pissed off that they were wrong about doubting it. \n\nNow Apple, and Microsoft are literally at the top of the S&amp;P500 yet some people still cannot accept them because of P/E valuations and it\u2019s logical but I think its hilarious how contradictory some of the statements can be. \n\nThese people talk about how its impossible to time the market or that past performance doesn\u2019t indicate future performance yet there is one thing they are certain of. A tech bubble because of the tech bubble that happened 20 years ago. How can everyone be so certain these companies are overvalued when the sector has lead the market for the last 10 years. Maybe tech will fall back or maybe it will continue to outperform for another 10 years. We just don\u2019t know. What\u2019s certain is tech is not what it was 20 years ago and it will be interesting to see how it grows going forward. Those who say techs outperformance isn\u2019t relevant just want to rationalize their bearish stance on tech IMO.  \n\nAll this said the tech sector is  broad and there are fairly valued solid companies out there with good balance sheets. TSM(P/E 27.4) and LRCX(P/E 20.9) are some I am interested in.",

(NYSE American: ZOM) announced today that it has agreed with its development partner Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Qorvo US, Inc., to develop three new assays -- Cobalamin, cPL (canine Pancreatic Lipase), and Folate -- to target diagnosis of canine gastrointestinal issues. The new assays are in addition to the initial five assays currently under development, including panels for adrenal and thyroid testing, for TRUFORMA\u2122, Zomedica's point-of-care veterinary diagnostic platform. The agreement to pursue development of the new assays has triggered the final $2 million milestone payment under Zomedica\u2019s Development and Supply Agreement with Qorvo.\n\n\u201cOur intent for TRUFORMA\u2122 always has been to have it serve as a broad diagnostic point-of-care tool for dogs and cats and to continue to expand the diagnostic offerings available on the platform,\" said Robert Cohen, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Zomedica. \"We believe that the combination of the Cobalamin, cPL and Folate assays will enable veterinarians to use TRUFORMA to conduct a thorough testing panel to diagnose dogs in gastrointestinal distress.\"\n\nIf successfully developed, the Cobalamin, cPL, and Folate assays will represent what the Company believes is the first non-infectious gastrointestinal panel optimized for use in canines fully available at the point-of-care to facilitate rapid diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders. Evaluation of the health of different components of the gastrointestinal system is necessary to identify the cause of clinical symptoms. This panel is intended to assay the function of the pancreas, proximal small intestine, and distal small intestine. The Company believes that the ability to conduct testing at the point-of-care will facilitate real-time clinical decision-making, reduce in-patient clinic stay, promote earlier detection and treatment, and increase pet owner satisfaction.\n\nAccording to a DVM360 study*, ASPCA Pet Insurance, Embrace, Nationwide, Pets Best and Trupanion agree that \u201cGI condition\u201d is the most common insurance claim for dogs. Signs of digestive system disease can include excessive drooling, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting or regurgitation, loss of appetite, bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating, straining to defecate, shock, and dehydration. The TRUFORMA diagnostic device, which is smaller than a desktop printer, is anticipated to provide highly sensitive, species-specific assays using Qorvo\u2019s proprietary, non-optical Bulk Acoustic Wave (\"BAW\") sensor technology. The BAW sensor is a proven semiconductor technology used in telecommunications and aerospace markets. The Company believes that BAW technology has the potential to improve veterinary diagnostics by delivering reference laboratory accuracy and test performance to the veterinary clinic at the point-of-care.\"\n\nI bolded the important parts. This is a long hold regardless if r/s happens or does not. IMO the r/s ain't happening.",
