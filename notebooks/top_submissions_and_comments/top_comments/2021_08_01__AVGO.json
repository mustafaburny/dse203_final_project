I use [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&amp;symbols=TQQQ+SPXL+TMF+LLY+KO+VZ+PG+NVDA+UNH+ISRG+GOOG+APPS+AMD+AAPL+FB+AVGO+AMZN+GE&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;tradingDays=60&amp;months=36) to check correlations. I added the suggestions from the other comments for tickers more than 2 years old. You can run this tool on any companies you like to see which ones are the best fit. Since you are already using leveraged ETFs, I would recommend adding TMF (at least until bond yields start rising again). For individual stocks, I recommend LLY, PG, VZ, or any mega cap company that has less than .5 correlation to both of your ETFs.",
