Workers is a different paradigm for building applications at scale. They are working on a database according to their CEO or CTO (Can't remember it was a comment on HackerNews). R2 is a direct replacement for S3. Their core CDN offering is better than CloudFront. You can compare some features straight up, you compare others more predicting the future of the market. Cloudflare has executed well technically and they are catering towards the infrastructure designers of tomorrow. If they succeed, they will creating a new market and eating some of AWS/Azure/etc's market as well which is very large. Which is why valuations like 60b don't scare me and I can imagine 10x valuation.\n\nYou are free to disagree with me, I made my largest bet ever on them and it's returned many X (I have effectively quadrupled down on NET at this point starting from ~$27 and buying in 4 times). I don't really care what you think or how it reads, I think there is huge potential and I'm personally willing to make that bet and explain why. It's not financial advice, it's just the opinion of someone who spends their entire life in tech, web hosting and software development. I'm also holding shares in most of the major cloud hosting providers+CDNs that are publicly listed (AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, DOCN, FSLY, LLNW).

I remain extremely bullish in ENPH, although short/mid term price action is pretty much impossible to predict.\n\nIQ8 is peerless in the semiconductor space, and signals ENPH's first foray into commercial solar. Growth in new continents (S. America and Europe) is barely starting, with India representing massive growth in the long term, and US residential adoption of solar is somewhere around 5%. I expect ENPH to continue to be an alpha generator for at least 5 more years, and hit &gt;$1000 / share, and IMO that is conservative. \n\nSPWR is very well position especially as they still own 2.5m shares of $ENPH.

For the longest time they didn't even have a customer support phone number, they're difficult to get ahold of if a problem arises.\n\n3.) Unstable and unreliable app, RH became completely unusable, multiple times during the Covid March 2020 crash. When other brokers stayed operational\n\n4.) Payment for order flow. RH makes money buy selling your buy orders to high frequency trade hedge funds, who are then able to \"frontrun\" the stock, meaning they can buy the stock a milisecond before you do, thus raising the price your market orders get filled. So you're actually paying more for stocks on RH than if you used another broker.\n\n5.) Conflict of interest, RH primary customer, Citadel was caught illegally naked shorting meme stock. During the meme stock frenzy, RH users weren't allowed to buy shares of certain companies, whereas with other brokers you could.\n\n6.) RH has history of being fined by the SEC, and countless lawsuits regarding not having the best user's interest in mind.\n\n7.) Glitchy Options display. RH falsely displayed losses for a young options trader who was actually in the green. He ended up committing suicide because of it.\n\n8.) If you care about margin %, Interactive Brokers and M1 Finance both have cheaper margin %\n\n9.) Not good for buying Crypto. You don't have access to your wallet keys, and you're not allowed to transfer your crypto to anew wallet, so you're forced to liquidate it if you want to move it elsewhere, which creates a taxable event. Also questions have raised if RH really holds the crypto that you \"own\" on their app.\n\nAlso it's not 2019 anymore, it's 2021. Countless apps have clean simple UI. SoFi &amp; Fidelity Beta both have clean UI",

Meanwhile, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have great back end infrastructure, but terrible, outdated UIs. I used to think what those companies did was the hard part, and Robinhood just put some paint on a pig. I joked it was a race to see who could fix themselves up faster. But it's been almost a year, and those old school websites are as bad as ever.\n\nVanguard's bad UI is somewhat on purpose, and Schwab bought TDA and Thinkorswim. But Fidelity is an embarrassment. Active Trader Pro is the single oldest and worst performing piece of software I've had the misfortune of interacting with in the past decade. Their mobile app is terrible as well, though I commend them for trying to introduce a nicer looking, but still barely functional Robinhood knockoff beta.\n\nBasically, good design is priceless. But since an investor's job is to put a price on things, I'll just say it's very valuable. Haters always said that Steve Jobs was just the pretty boy frontman, but there are a lot of computer companies and only one is the largest corporation on the planet by simply coasting on Jobs's designs. It's hard to write good code or build a brokerage, but it's almost impossible to create good design.\n\nBasically, leaps on $MLKN",

        "body": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

Because if you just buy a stock and you let it stay there, unless the company gives dividends you will receive nothing in return. So you agree that a company that gives dividends does have value? Let's say a company that gives 10% of dividends each year, will make you back that money in 10 years and from there everything else is a bonus.\n\nNow. What is the reason why every company doesn't give dividends? The reason is growth. They and their shareholders both think it's better to invest the potential dividends back into growing the company. \n\nBut the company always will have \"potential\" to give out dividends, once they decide they don't need to grow anymore - they could start giving out dividends, but meanwhile you can think of dividends as constantly being automatically invested back into the company, however due to company growing the potential also increases an you can still cash out the \"dividends\" by selling the stock at higher price due to potential of dividends having been grown.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

        "body": "1)Lots of people are saying it doesn't matter and to an extent that is correct. As 10% is 10%.\n\nThat being said if you are starting out lower shares could cause a few problems, mostly if you don't have access to a platform that allows fractional shares.\n\n1)Let's say you get a dividend of 10% a year as a simplified example. 1 share at $1000 you get $100 dividend. Great but now you need $900 more to get another 1 share.\n\nIf the price was $100 a share and you bought 10 (same $1000) you would be able to reinvest it and have 11 shares at the end of the year.\n\nWith the $1000 share you would have 1 share and $100 waiting for you to get enough to invest. This slows you down, this becomes less of a problem as you go but can be tough at the start. In this example it limits the ability for the compounding interest to be fully efficient.\n\n2) Smaller amounts of shares can be a problem if you wanted to rebalance or decide to change investments in the future.\n\nKeeping with the previous example of prices per share, if I had 3 shares at $1000 and it went up 10% I may want to take that 10% and invest it somewhere else. Sadly, I only have 3 shares so the best I could do is sell 1 share. So instead of just rebalancing with the 10% I would be limited to rebalancing with 33%.\n\nIf each share was $100, I would have been able to sell 3 shares. Keep my $3000 still invested but move the $300 to something else, vs selling 1 of the 3 shares for $1100.\n\n3) As others have said, it would also involves options, but as you are starting out, this could be something that isn't important to you.\n\nAll of this kinda revolves around you having a basic ideas and understanding of what you are doing, the risks and goals and plans for the investment.\n\nHopefully you understand the risks and basics of investing vs just trying to cash in on a way to get rich, because others have had luck. It is always a bit worrying when the only socks people reference are the \"popular\" picks at the time. \n\nIf you are starting out, please take some time to look at the basics and save yourself the costs of multiple small mistakes costing you your hard earned money. Also please take a look at ETF's as they can be particularly good for starting out while you figure out your long term strategy.",

Some of those people are stupid. You introduce safeguards and security checks to make sure they don't fuck up. But now everyone has more work to do, because they have to also deal with safeguards. This is unpleasant, and people who have more options start to leave for places with more creative freedom. You are left with people who have less options. Then you need to introduce more safeguards, because a lot of them are stupid. This increases complexity of your system even more, so even more people are needed. And now you have labor shortage.\n\nIs it a concern - I don't think so. It's an early stage of the new industry. It's different from other industries in a sense that it requires creative work, unlike for example car factories, where your concern is mostly providing the right instructions to your many workers. It's similar to academia, where there's also a problem of old farts stifling creativity. But academia deals with it somehow, so IT will also find a way.",

Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term. I think that\u2019s a pretty massive difference.",

Indeed, much of the money was stolen by the government causing the famine in the first place\n\nWorld hunger can't be fixed by money.. not convinced it can be fixed by anything short of toppling governments and rebuilding countries which.. is never going to happen",

This isn't the forum for breaking down the US tax code but the last major overhaul was in the 1980s. It is well past time to clean up our tax code and put in a more efficient and fair system of taxation from the have-nots to the have-alots.\n\nI want to see a fairer system in place so that more of the wealth created under our system is put to use for the benefit of everyone in our system. \n\nEurope has issues as well but has a much stronger social safety net and is still a reasonably successful economy, etc.\n\nThe govt. does a lot of good things with the money that is collected through taxes and could do more good if everyone paid a similar % of their earnings, whether capital or earned.\n\nThe govt. also spends on items that different groups of us are opposed to but that is the give and take that we all must work with.\n\nFor every \"good\" ultra-wealthy there are multiple examples of \"bad\" ultra-wealthy.
