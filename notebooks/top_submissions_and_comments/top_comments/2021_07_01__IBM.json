This specially hurts manufacturing and R&amp;D heavy companies. \nFor example from 1995\u00a0through 2019 IBM spent $201 billion buying back\u00a0its own stock. \nAt one point, management of IBM was bragging, how R&amp;D expenditure of IBM has been reduced, so he could have more profits and returns to shareholders (dividends and repurchases). This worked great in short run, but results are clearly visible now, IBM is shadow of itself, company that was leading Innovation for decades is now a service company. \nManagement got its bonuses, shareholders enjoyed short-term gains, but in the end where left with shell of company.\nThis was not only reason for IBM issues, but contributed significantly.\nFor more recent example, check Boing and Intel, both wasted fortunes on buybacks. Both were cheered by Wall Street for it, but in reality, both companies underinvested in their future.\nI am not against buybacks, only it needs to clear, there is no free lunch, especially not in R&amp;D heavy Industries.",

You can't solve every problem by throwing money at it. If you're coming in to a field 10 or 20 years behind in research, just being big doesn't mean you're going to catch up in tech just like that. Look at what happened to IBM in the face of upstarts like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.\n\nEven if big companies can fund their own research later, that will put them a decade or more behind. Meanwhile, another big energy competitor could buy up several successful startups and quickly become the dominant player.

Speaking of which consider Ford going public in '56, look at all those decades of building up before going public. Or IBM over 100 years ago. \n\nSo profitability, being so young its all about scaling up and expanding their facilities. Any money is being used to make them more competitive. They believe they can do that by building a larger rocket which will broaden their capabilities. They will be receiving a 750million dollar cash injection. 200 of which will be going to designing and building the next rocket [Neutron ](https://youtu.be/agqxJw5ISdk). Give them room to screw up and lets put it at 250. The rest of the money could go to a number of things. Building a launch pad in New Zealand for Neutron, they have a deal to use the existing launch pad in Wallops, Virginia. They could build three more Neutron rockets, you could have a fleet. Cycling one out and brining in a new improved model throughout the years. They also have their own unique satellite bus built in-house, [Photon](https://youtu.be/LAUj-TQpn-A). First it delivers the payload of other satellites, but it's also open to configuration. I hope they have plans on scaling that up for the Neutron.  They are currently generating revenue, but no they are not cash flow positive, they hope to reach  that in a couple years.\n\nSustainable, as a private company they made it through the global recession of 08(I know that's a weak point). Their still acquiring more partners as they continue to develop their product. For instance BlackSky started by launching their prototype with another launch provider, but now they have multiple launches contracted with Rocketlab. \nThis is still a young industry, if the speculation about mining in space comes true, I believe they will be well positioned for that market. In the mean time it's all about satellites. I think we're at a crossroads, the infrastructure on a large scale could be changed. Do we continue laying and maintaining ground lines to connect everyone on the network? Or do we launch a bunch of satellites and change so everyone goes back to putting a dish on their roof? Or Winnebago, and have internet in the middle of nowhere?\n\nScaleable, I've already hinted towards scalability with a fleet of larger rockets. Possibly larger satellite busses. But it's space, so I want you to use your imagination and think if it's scalable.",

Meanwhile they have AMD which is firing on all cylinders, ARM threat in everything especially database, and NVIDIA which is a runaway jn graphics. This is the equivalent of purchasing IBM for the cloud wars because they\u2019re cheap. Great CEO though, I\u2019ll give it to them they decided not to put anyone from sales, finance, or marketing into that position; Gelsinger is a boss.\n\nTSM is an earnings and growth juggernaut and it is reflected in the valuation. Again though, you\u2019re comparing two different business models. Intel is tough to do a 1:1 comparison with any company because in this day and age they\u2019re pretty unique (it used to be most of the semis owner their own favs).",

At this point I'm considering either staying at academia or working on companies more focused on the software integration part. Not necessarily in that order.\n\nAt the moment I see a handful of companies ahead of them in terms of both software and hardware e.g. one can actually access IonQ's hardware using IBM's (open) software Qiskit on top of accessing IBM's harware. Also IBM is at least a couple of years ahead in its hardware scaling. Moreover I consider not a controversial statement to say that IBM's (and others') hardware platform  (superconducting qubits)  is inherently less difficult to scale than ion traps, making the playing field tilted away from ion traps (and photonics tbh).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope they prove me wrong because that would mean extraordinary success to everybody involved in the field, but the odds are stacked against them.",

But I'd strongly suggest looking at the holdings; oil companies, AT&amp;T, IBM, lots of riffraff has high dividends but they could easily have low/negative real return over the next 10+ years.\n\nSkimming the top 10 holdings of each - I'd go with VDADX over VHYAX. Dividend appreciation, dividend aristocrats, usually good choices. Even taking a stock like AAPL for example - if you bought it in 2013, you'd have a 5% dividend yield on your original investment ($13/share back then, $0.60 dividend now). If you bought XOM in 2013 in the $80s, you'd only be making about 4% on your original investment. In terms of total return, again you'd be better off with AAPL by a long shot. So going for quality matters.",

        "body": "&gt; Those shit companies were not in any index and pets.com was 300-400 million market cap at its peak (which it held for a very short time). You can equate pets.com to companies like NKLA which make gravity powered trucks. NKLA was ~ 30B market cap at its peak -- and it's still worth 5B+\n\nThat kinda helps my point though. NKLA tanked but it has no correlation to the overall stock market, and the whole stock market went up in fact. Same with the entire SPAC bubble. Yes it was a bubble, but it popped and the market moved on its way without missing a beat. \n\n&gt; The \"real\" megacap tech companies of 2000 were hewlett packard, microsoft, ibm, csco, intel, sun, compaq, etc. Their P/E ratios are much closer to the FAANGs of today. And most of the peak P/E ratios happened after a series of bad earnings.\n\nEven then the PE ratios are not the same. MSFT in it's peak in 1999 had a PE ratio of ~82, it now has a PE ratio of ~35. \n\nI'm not gonna say that *every* company today is fine. Many are not (including NKLA). But the 2000 was endemic throughout the market (i.e. say \"internet\" and stock 10x'd at ipo). Today the market is much more varied and plenty of companies trading at high multiples do so because they're growth is very real.\n\nSorta unrelated but I personally believe tech got an insane boost from covid which is/will be driving huge digitalization efforts and  accelerate growth for many saas/cloud centric companies.",
