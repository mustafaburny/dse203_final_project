This specially hurts manufacturing and R&amp;D heavy companies. \nFor example from 1995\u00a0through 2019 IBM spent $201 billion buying back\u00a0its own stock. \nAt one point, management of IBM was bragging, how R&amp;D expenditure of IBM has been reduced, so he could have more profits and returns to shareholders (dividends and repurchases). This worked great in short run, but results are clearly visible now, IBM is shadow of itself, company that was leading Innovation for decades is now a service company. \nManagement got its bonuses, shareholders enjoyed short-term gains, but in the end where left with shell of company.\nThis was not only reason for IBM issues, but contributed significantly.\nFor more recent example, check Boing and Intel, both wasted fortunes on buybacks. Both were cheered by Wall Street for it, but in reality, both companies underinvested in their future.\nI am not against buybacks, only it needs to clear, there is no free lunch, especially not in R&amp;D heavy Industries.",

You can't solve every problem by throwing money at it. If you're coming in to a field 10 or 20 years behind in research, just being big doesn't mean you're going to catch up in tech just like that. Look at what happened to IBM in the face of upstarts like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.\n\nEven if big companies can fund their own research later, that will put them a decade or more behind. Meanwhile, another big energy competitor could buy up several successful startups and quickly become the dominant player. So like with tech startups, the big players won't be looking for discounts, they'll just wait to see who makes the best proven breakthroughs and then compete with each other to acquire the best tech first.",

Speaking of which consider Ford going public in '56, look at all those decades of building up before going public. Or IBM over 100 years ago. \n\nSo profitability, being so young its all about scaling up and expanding their facilities. Any money is being used to make them more competitive. They believe they can do that by building a larger rocket which will broaden their capabilities. They will be receiving a 750million dollar cash injection. 200 of which will be going to designing and building the next rocket [Neutron ](https://youtu.be/agqxJw5ISdk). Give them room to screw up and lets put it at 250. The rest of the money could go to a number of things. Building a launch pad in New Zealand for Neutron, they have a deal to use the existing launch pad in Wallops, Virginia. They could build three more Neutron rockets, you could have a fleet. Cycling one out and brining in a new improved model throughout the years. They also have their own unique satellite bus built in-house, [Photon](https://youtu.be/LAUj-TQpn-A). First it delivers the payload of other satellites, but it's also open to configuration. I hope they have plans on scaling that up for the Neutron.  They are currently generating revenue, but no they are not cash flow positive, they hope to reach  that in a couple years.\n\nSustainable, as a private company they made it through the global recession of 08(I know that's a weak point). Their still acquiring more partners as they continue to develop their product. For instance BlackSky started by launching their prototype with another launch provider, but now they have multiple launches contracted with Rocketlab. \nThis is still a young industry, if the speculation about mining in space comes true, I believe they will be well positioned for that market. In the mean time it's all about satellites. I think we're at a crossroads, the infrastructure on a large scale could be changed. Do we continue laying and maintaining ground lines to connect everyone on the network? Or do we launch a bunch of satellites and change so everyone goes back to putting a dish on their roof? Or Winnebago, and have internet in the middle of nowhere?\n\nScaleable, I've already hinted towards scalability with a fleet of larger rockets. Possibly larger satellite busses. But it's space, so I want you to use your imagination and think if it's scalable.",

Pets.com actually had a business / revenue, tons of SPACs are little more than post series A companies, all of them worth well over a billion.\n\nThe \"real\" megacap tech companies of 2000 were hewlett packard, microsoft, ibm, csco, intel, sun, compaq, etc. Their P/E ratios are much closer to the FAANGs of today.

I cannot dismiss the ingenuity they have used to make a golf cart a true luxury car. Their weakness is business model, repairability is a nightmare, selling cars without key features then making by them subscription items? They are not cars, they are hardware with software licenses that are only profitable if you count the pollution credits sold.  Established carmakers won\u2019t play these games, will have local service departments and build them to be a hat they are: cars. They have been doing it for a century. The chip shortages have made them focus on high end models, I kinda doubt they will start the base model production given the profitable high end models will bring. I see the brands that you know selling higher end, and coach built super high end cars. Once the patents begins to expire, we will see Chinese cars flood the low end with of the shelf tech. I am in on Nio and researching the Chinese makes that are actually producing and selling cars today. I liken it to the IBM computer \u201cclones\u201d of the \u201880\u2019s. We will see compatible plug and play parts. Anyone research the scooter market? China has super factories that you can order any number of scooters, at any price point based on the quality of the parts specified, then slap your model name in them. ( check out AliBaba.com, buy a shipment, print your labels and poof, you are a scooter manufacturer). Trademarks? Pfft.

But I'd strongly suggest looking at the holdings; oil companies, AT&amp;T, IBM, lots of riffraff has high dividends but they could easily have low/negative real return over the next 10+ years.\n\nSkimming the top 10 holdings of each - I'd go with VDADX over VHYAX. Dividend appreciation, dividend aristocrats, usually good choices. Even taking a stock like AAPL for example - if you bought it in 2013, you'd have a 5% dividend yield on your original investment ($13/share back then, $0.60 dividend now). If you bought XOM in 2013 in the $80s, you'd only be making about 4% on your original investment. In terms of total return, again you'd be better off with AAPL by a long shot.

You can equate pets.com to companies like NKLA which make gravity powered trucks. NKLA was ~ 30B market cap at its peak -- and it's still worth 5B+\n\nThat kinda helps my point though. NKLA tanked but it has no correlation to the overall stock market, and the whole stock market went up in fact. Same with the entire SPAC bubble. Yes it was a bubble, but it popped and the market moved on its way without missing a beat. \n\n&gt; The \"real\" megacap tech companies of 2000 were hewlett packard, microsoft, ibm, csco, intel, sun, compaq, etc. Their P/E ratios are much closer to the FAANGs of today. And most of the peak P/E ratios happened after a series of bad earnings.\n\nEven then the PE ratios are not the same. MSFT in it's peak in 1999 had a PE ratio of ~82, it now has a PE ratio of ~35. \n\nI'm not gonna say that *every* company today is fine. Many are not (including NKLA). But the 2000 was endemic throughout the market (i.e. say \"internet\" and stock 10x'd at ipo). Today the market is much more varied and plenty of companies trading at high multiples do so because they're growth is very real.\n\nSorta unrelated but I personally believe tech got an insane boost from covid which is/will be driving huge digitalization efforts and  accelerate growth for many saas/cloud centric companies.",

        "body": "Sort of. Anyone can make an android device. Only apple can make iOS devices. We saw how this played out in the PC space already - anyone could make a windows computer. 75% of the market now is Android. Apple is regaining small market share but it's just a cyclical oscillation that occurs due to all the other platforms dropping to zero in the last couple years. E.g. if 5% of Android users decide to give iPhone a try and 10% of iPhone users decide to switch to Android, iPhone still gains market share when it's far enough behind (so you get the feedback effect we see now).\n\nThe problem with closed platforms is they will eventually find themselves behind. There are just too many competitors - it's Apple vs. the world. Wearables, automotive, VR, AI capabilities... there are tons of ways the landscape is going to change in the next 10 years and it's highly likely Apple finds itself behind. Camera upgrades and poo emojis can only get you so far - eventually people don't need your new product.\n\nApple also charges a fee to develop apps. It's free on Android. On Android you can bypass the app store easily and download any app, even from a web address, on iOS it is a massive pain (we see this with fortnite).\n\nAlso we are at peak phones now - I only see downward pressure on margins due to the competition. Apple cannot get away with such high margins anymore - the only reason we don't see that (their margin is only slightly falling) is because they've added all these other high margin business to offset it (i.e. their services they've expanded in the last couple years). The reality is they're losing margin on their phones and they won't be able to hide that in their numbers forever (they certainly tried when they changed their reporting two years ago).\n\nSo those are my concerns with Apple. I always felt their original PE ratio was correct. Once Buffet got in on them they experienced PE expansion which is irrational IMO and I predict will correct itself at some point.\n\nThat's my opinion anyway. I think the market is really messed up right now based on bad speculation.\n\nFor reference, I'd say IBM, INTC, AAPL, and MSFT should be way closer in terms of PE than they actually are. Something more in line with reality would be IBM -&gt; 10, INTC -&gt; 14, AAPL -&gt; 18, MSFT -&gt; 22. MSFT and especially AAPL sitting at 30+ is just ridiculous, as is IBM hovering around 25. I don't think INTC is priced that unreasonably but it is compared to everything else right now.\n\n&gt; I have used both android and other OS's and I have found Apple to be the most easy for my work and personal life\n\nThis was true years ago.

Q1 2021 operating income is up 266% and eps is up 232% from Q1 2020 and it isn't *just* higher margins; Total revenue in 2020 was up 45% from 2019 and Q1 2021 total rev Is up 92% compared to Q1 2020. Oh and the XLNX acquisition or whatever pending china approval.\n\n  \nAND there are some tasty insider whispers IF TRUE insinuating next gen GPU performance above and beyond what they expect from Nvidia. FULL STOP. Not at bargain price points, or for certain niche applications just straight up expecting to have the best GPUs on the market next gen. Nvidia having something spicy up their sleeve non-withstanding; you never know with Nvidia.   \n\n  Add in plans to buy back 4 billion worth of shares over the next 4(?) Years with cash on hand and plans for 3nm production by 2024 and everything I hear about AMD makes me think up up up. They have new deals with Samsung for their phones and google/amazon for servers, to add to the pile of deals like making chips for Sony and Microsoft consoles. The future looks bright.\n\nI put 90% of my account in AMD last month when they were hovering around 80$ without a single worry and I haven't unwound my position yet. Hoping for 2021 guidance to be adjusted from 50% to 75% growth to set this thing off again. Or merger approval, whatever comes first.",

Only if all necessary regulatory bodies approve the acquisition. Currently China is the last approval required until the merger can occur. Technically China can say no and AMD will most likely decide to not go on with the merger.\n\nBecause the acquisition is a fixed rate of shares. OP is staring at current market prices the value of one share of XLNX currently is cheaper than 1.72 shares of AMD creating a small discount.

All the DDs written on here continue to ignore how important the Xilinx merger is. It was hated on by many, but Su Bae is no moron, she is strongly positioning AMD to dominate the CPU and Semi-Custom solutions. AMD will continue to make progress in the GPU and gaming market but the growth and tendies will come from expanding further into and dominating the server industry and building strong relationships that will establish profits for years, as well as expansion into 5g, aerospace and defense, and AI.",

The xlnx acquisition may increase AMD\u2019s TAM but Nvidia is still king in many segments.. I would be surprised if any of that rapid amd growth happens before 3-4 years ..",

The regulator decides at the end of each phase if it's ready to make a decision or if it will move on to the next phase.\"\n\nSo rather than thumbs up, we've got up to 60 days before China gives the go ahead (or delays another 3 fucking months if they so choose).\n\nI don't see it starting to heat back up until a few weeks after earnings.
