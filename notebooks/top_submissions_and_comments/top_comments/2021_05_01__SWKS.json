        "body": "All tech is selling off today providing an excellent short-term buying opportunity as there is no rational reason for it other than just following the herd.  What I look for are dominant companies with secure moats and amazing earnings which are not overvalued, do not have a sky-high PE and which pay a dividend.   There are only a few stocks like this and at the top of that list is AAPL.  True many stocks, mostly young companies on the move, will outperform AAPL.  Some will double, triple, quadruple, and AAPL's days of quadrupling are likely over but capital preservation and security is just as important as capital appreciation, and especially if you have already made all or most of the money you need, I recommend AAPL as a safe longterm investment or temporary parking place. Eventually and maybe very soon it will resume its upward track but for now even a sell-off day like today is quite modest and unlikely to continue for more than another day or two, which means today and tomorrow might be the best times to buy AAPl and any of its suppliers like Skyworks which has been getting hammered for several weeks now.  In fact I bought more SKWS today at 167 and will buy again and again perhaps even on margin if it keeps selling off.  For if there is one secure product line in the world now it is the iPhone and everything it is made up and offers.  And unlike most stocks, AAPl has already proven with spectacular earnings that is is undervalued. And yes all stocks and investments entail risk, but with AAPl is it minimal and short-lived, and the trajectory is still up with no competition in its lane. And as for the Epic lawsuit, I have read a detailed legal analysis and would not fear them much.  I believe they will lose (because Netflix left the Ap Store and thrived) and even if they do win one round, Apple will keep on appealing and fighting this for years. Also, if congress  ever forced Apple to break up (will never happen but who knows?) that will actually unlock even more value.",

        "body": "IMHO it is the stupid crypto craze and the reckless Robin Hood day trading casino which is freaking out the markets now, that plus the uncertainty of Biden's big bills getting passed.  The Trump newly-dominated GOP (are they nuts or what going back to him?) is doing everything it can to queer the economy (as well as our whole democracy and national mood), not wanting Biden to succeed and partnering with Putin once again to try and bring him down. Putin was likely behind the gas pipeline hack and most of the covid denialism anti vaccine BS.  Putin is also big into crypto which is a way for him to avoid detection and launder money.  But I would avoid both oil stocks and cryptos like the plague. They will fall hard soon.   So yes, we have some problems.  But who wants to bet against AAPl for more than a few days?  Sanity will resume soon.  What we really need it for the cryptos to crash 50% and that will wake up people to resume normal responsible adult investing again.  So I bought more Skyworks today and if this continues I will buy more tomorrow as a proxy for AAPL which I already own 60,000 shares of, and I like round numbers.  Instead of cash I have parked all extra money in T and VZ and am up around 10% so I am selling some of those and buying Skyworks which once tech rallies back will be one of the fastest movers, and also pays a dividend.  At today's prices, I estimate one could make 50% off Skyworks and 25% off AAPL and not even need any miracles. Attitudes just need to change, and they will, any hour or day now,. Also, amongst the FAANMG stock, the one with the least amount of value and good news priced in is AAPL.  So I assume that has the most upside.",
