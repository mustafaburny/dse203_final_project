As forward thinking as the market might pretend to be, Q2 earnings will (mostly) be trash and Q3 - 4 won't have the \"revenge\" spending we hoped for due to Covid resurgence. Tickers like AMC, AAL, ect face real threats of bankruptcy.\n\n3. Death totals ARE increasing, particularly in states that are surging. So Covid will continue to beat down \"recovery\" stocks that recently surged.\n\nThis week has showed why its tough to time when things will correct back down.

If they go bust between now and august that 3.5 put may lose $2 or $3  Look at HTZ.  They were trading around 3 until they declared bankruptcy and now they are down around 1.5-1.8 and they gapped down to like .50 the day after they declared.  I prefer something thats trending up to something thats at the risk of dropping.  If I can sell a CSP for $1 on a $15 stock thats been trending up for a month, its more likely to gap up to $20 than down to $10.",

Those things have had a spectacular year - Shopify call \"Over the past few months, we've seen the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally shift the way businesses and consumers interact. It has catalyzed e-commerce, introducing major changes in buyer behavior and pulling forward what retail would look like in 2030 into 2020.\" There's been many conference calls where companies are discussing growth being pulled forward - look at Paypal yesterday night. Much of the rest of the market is either down or down significantly. If you look underneath the market, there are very defined winners and losers.\n\n Additionally, the market looks forward to some degree. Earnings so far this quarter imo haven't really been that bad at all considering. This sub acted like Q1 earnings were going to cause the market to crash again and they didn't. Q2 earnings are coming out and they're not terrible, either - and once again, many are stepping over a low bar because expectations are low. It's still an incredibly difficult, uncertain time, but there's definitely companies that have benefited from this and I think people should really consider how behaviors are going to change long-term even after this is over and who will continue to benefit - and who will not. On the flip side of those who benefit from this, you've also seen slow declines that were already happening (look at a lot of B &amp; M retail - look at movie going, see the Universal/AMC decision the other day that will make the theatrical window far shorter etc)) be pulled forward by this.",
