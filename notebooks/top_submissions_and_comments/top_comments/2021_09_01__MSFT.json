It's probably worth holding on to apple and Microsoft (and the others if you have a risk tolerance and really believe in the companies), but directing new capital elsewhere.\n\nYou probably don't want to do this, but low cost ETFs can be your friend. They give broad exposure for not much money. Something to consider adding to your portfolio.\n\nI know this is an unpopular opinion here, but I think Tesla is a bad bet. I understand its rev is growing, but its valuation is very high for its corresponding fundamentals. It's also just building cars right now.

PMCC underlying should be the same criteria as if you wanted to just be long on the stock itself but the long call is cheaper than the stock so you can play on shit you couldn't afford to just buy 100 shares like AMZN, TSLA, etc.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want a better strategy than the wheel, what I do is size my position in 200-share minimum size and then buy-write 100 shares with a CC and then a CSP for the other 100 shares, so basically a covered strangle.  Profits from both sides of the wheel, is as directional as you want it to be (but generally directional with positive delta), and captures profits from gains in the underlying instead of fucking right off with those like if you're just selling a CSP with the wheel.  If you get assigned on your CSP, then switch to just CCs.  If you get assigned on your CCs then either go back in or switch to another underlying.  I might get assigned on MARA if it keeps going up, but if so then I'll get assigned at 43 where my entry was 30 and my adjusted basis is probably closer to 25 so that's not bad for 6 weeks or so on a single position in a $10k account (actual account is closer to $35k but I'm pretending it's only $10k so I can practice this shit without blowing up my account).  This strategy ONLY works because we're in the longest bull market in history, but because of that I want to be more directional.  If we get into a crash, then chase your underlying down with CCs and roll to 50 delta every time your CCs hit like 80 delta to lock in the intrinsic in the contract for a small additional profit.  Also sell call credit spreads as it falls and buy back in at the bottom with all the premium you made during the fall.  On the way up, put credit spreads and CSPs will make you more money.  If it stays at the bottom, then condor the fuck out of it and set a limit buy like $1 below your short call so you can turn that shit into a covered call and a long call; if it drops then just take assignment on the short put if you like the stock.  \n\n\nFor PMCC, the good part is you can use it on stocks you can't afford so NVDA, AMD, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT (premium is shit though), FB, etc.  It's also a much more efficient use of capital than an actual CC with the stock in terms of your ROC since you can hold more positions (so trade more positions but trade smaller; read up on the Kelly Criterion for gamblers to figure out position sizing).  With 10k I'd recommend 3 positions with a maximum of maybe 4 or 5 positions at most.  With any options selling strategy, your goal is to get rich very slowly but consistently.  Aim for like 1% per week and you'll do fine.",

I\u2019m 22 myself and Microsoft, apple, Tesla, and AMD are all in my top 5 holdings as well, but with a decent amount less weight. Biggest I have is Microsoft at 18% and the next is a 9% hold.\n\nThe biggest factor here is your age. At just under 20 you have well over 40 years on your investing horizon, and the companies in your top holdings aren\u2019t going anywhere any time soon. Those companies will grow over that time guaranteed.\n\nWhat I would recommend though is reducing your top 3 to a 20% hold and using that money to invest in some S&amp;P 500 index funds or moving the money to a Roth IRA account which essentially will do the same thing but with management. Since you have extra income that you\u2019re using to invest right now I\u2019d also say to put the money you\u2019re adding to your portfolio in one of the two places above as well, just so that all your eggs aren\u2019t in the tech basket but have guaranteed growth from funds that follow the market as a whole.

In the US these are tax deferred until age 55 or 62 depending on the plan. \n\nIf you want the payments now I\u2019d look into dividend stocks. They are stocks that pay you money (I think quarterly) based on how many shares you have and how much money the company made that quarter. Think CocaCola, Microsoft, IBM, Apple, etc. Companies that earn consistently and aren\u2019t going anywhere. This is less risky than investing in a startup company for a true royalty that only lasts if the company does. \n\nEither way talk to a stock broker for more info.",
