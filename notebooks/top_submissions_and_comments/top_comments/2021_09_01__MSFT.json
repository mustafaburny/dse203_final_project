That extra 3-4 hours saved every week and reinvested wisely can compound into something life changing for a lot of people.\n* Spends 1 billion every year to help advance space travel via Blue Origin.\n* Has employed over 2 million people with a company-wide minimum wage of $18/hr and good health benefits. Amazon\u2019s net profits in 2020 was around 21 billion dollars. They pay their employees 90 billion dollars in wages and other benefits.\n* Yeah Amazon\u2019s founder has 180bn net worth.

        "body": "Once Elon makes a 4 door sedan with 500 mile per charge range and a million mile battery lifetime, and for under $25,000. \n\nIf the Model T from Ford were superior to horses in cost and performance, the first the electric engine to replace the internal combustion engine, it is going to  need to be better in cost and performance. \n\nThat said, there is SpaceX and StarLink. And the Boring company. And also Neuralink. All these have potential to improve the quality of life on earth and generate more total resources for society at a faster rate. \n\nBut the key is technology and an environment that can accept that innovation. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit surprising that there are around 3000 billionaires in the world and yet Elon Musk is spearheading over half of the most promising and innovative solutions to increase the average quality of the human condition. \n\nThere are only so many resources in society. TSLA getting bigger just means it has ownership of more resources or is seen as such. \n\nI think that because TSLA touched 880 but couldn\u2019t touch 900, then 1,000 is far away, as is 1,500. A price rejection of that significance without changes in many of the fundamental underlying factors of the company suggest that, well, many things will need to severely change for TSLA to rise up that high. \n\nFinance is the way resources flow in society to incentive activities towards their most profitable outcomes. \n\nWith the amount of shares TSLA has printed, is it worth 1500? Especially if humanity does have a technological leap - is there enough room for society? If TSLA has technological leaps, that will transfer to other industries. \n\nSpaceX could acquire hundreds of trillions every month in space extraction resources for humanity \nStarLink can replace Comcast \nWhat Microsoft did with offering an easy user interface system and computer operating system, Neuralink will do even more. An ultra-high bandwidth computer interface system. If sandals applied to feet improve walking performance, And a computer improves thinking performance much like a sandal improves walking performance, then Neuralink is a Tesla. \n\nDo you realize that of technological leaps happen, it might not push the price of TSLA too high? It\u2019s already priced in to be successful. \n\nBasically. $1500 Maybe under 5 years? \n\nThat\u2019s the issue with TSLA. They outperformance many times and they are expected to outperform technologically. TSLA having success is more likely to push other sectors to outperform, but not necessarily TSLA. Basically, what if it is likely for a potential initial public offering of Neuralink and SpaceX to triple within two years? Would TSLA still be a decent option? It\u2019s about relative growth. And TSLA is already assumed to be capable at fulfilling the scenario of the electric engine replacing most internal combustion engines within 20 years. And their current price reflects that. \n\nA share price evaluation of 1500 needs\u2026 society to make changes. And even then, if a share price of 1500 happens without monumental shifts in society due to technological leaps, there will be other options with higher relative growth as a result.",

Today, the big techs are all solid companies with profits and a shit ton of assets. They are good companies that are just trading very high, unlike bad companies that are trading at insane prices like back then. Don't get me wrong, there are still overpriced shit companies, but the big companies that form the bigger part of tech funds, and even the SP 500 as a whole, are mostly good companies.\n\nSo is a correction coming? Maybe. Personally I would say probably, but who knows.\n\nA crash like 2008? Maybe.\n\nBut is Google/Apple/Microsoft/FB and all the other big tech companies going bankrupt? Almost certainly not. Their price might fall, but I highly doubt they'll go bankrupt.\n\nIf there is a crisis, I would be much worried about other companies, not the big tech. Like, do you know how much cash they have? I'm not even kidding, like they have billions and billions of cash on hand.  Paying down their \"low\" level of debt (relative to their size and profts) will not be an issue even if there's a crisis. I would be much more worried about companies with lots of debt and not enough liquidity to pay their bills if you're wary of a crisis.\n\nLet's say worse case scenario, there's a huge crash. I'm ready to bet that in 20 years the price of the market will be much higher than it is now.\n\nTLDR: Buy an index fund -&gt; Forget about it -&gt; Profit (and sleep soundly at night)",

The drive is 5 miles, I wonder why the HDs, COSTs, WMTs, TGTs parking are always packed like that, even tho it\u2019s only Wednesday, \nHmmm guess I\u2019ll skip groceries today. I feel lazy. Sitting at the restaurant\u2019s outdoor patio, I enjoy my brunch with a glass of wine, my eyes start wandering around. What a beautiful day, the birds, the air, the people. Maybe it\u2019s enough wine for the day, I go in to grab a soft drink. 8 out of 10 drinks on the fountain machine are KO products. Lots people around me are working on their AAPL and MSFT laptops. They are so thin yet very powerful. As a tech geek I know they are powered by INTC and AMD CPUs, and the heavy stuffs are done with NVIDIA GPUs. Gosh people are so productive nowadays! It\u2019s time to leave, I lay my JPM V card to the tray, 5x points for dining baby! 5 mins later I\u2019m on my way. Shit, I\u2019m almost out of gas, pulling into a CVX gas station, tap my BAC MA card because I\u2019ll get 3% cash back on Gas. Damn there\u2019s a line wrapping around that MCD and SBUX drive thru, the food is unhealthy but well business is still booming I guess. \nGetting back into my home, I suddenly remember tomorrow is Oct 1st. I have T, VZ, NFLX bills to pay. \nDamn, I observed a lot from my lazy day today. I wonder what my life would be without all of the conveniences I saw today. \nI log into my Fidelity account and buy 4 more VOO shares. \nFeeling good.",

Selling the call spread is a little bit easier to predict what you'll make. If you buy a put spread, the vol collapse and the spread having to go fully ITM to realize a full gain has more variables at work. You can buy the put spread and still lose even with having the direction right.\n\nWorking myself out of a put that is ITM right now.\n\nI'm looking to get out next week and waiting until earnings to put new positions on.  \n\nI wouldn't be betting against MU just because spot prices are falling. That means supply chains are working their way out and that they will be producing at capacity vs charging a little bit more per diminished output.
