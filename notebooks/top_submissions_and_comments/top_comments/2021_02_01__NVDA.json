Between the limit on buying stocks and hedge funds trading between themselves to drive the price down, and creating a distraction (SLV) to draw attention and fill pockets, this should be throwing off a significantly larger red flag than \"ERMERGERD WSB SAYS GME WORTH $69,420 LOOL\". Who gives a shit, you're completely missing the point here. Short sellers expose themselves to basically unlimited risk. But that risk never actually materializes for them because they can just cheat the system. Meanwhile someone can go buy a stock and lose value because of *their* game OR someone can go short a stock and become insolvent while the *big boys on WallStreet* walk away.\n\nGME isn't an isolated incident. BB, NOK, AMC and a number of others are getting hammered- and have been getting hammered since last Wednesday because the people on the losing side don't want to lose at the game they created for themselves. BB basically experienced a rug pull- it didn't taper off or settle in the 20's... it looks like someone pulled a plug. Look at what happened a month ago (or more) with PLTR and Shitron. Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia... AMD have all been recent targets of this institutional wide short selling.",

GME could theoretically score 8-15 points of margin on customized hardware, and still be selling at a discount.\n\nIf they score some partnerships with say, NVIDIA or AMD, that just helps the profit even further, if they are selling at a high enough rate. Companies tend to give 5-10 extra points discounting to their sellers if their order stream is consistent and high enough.\n\nI like the stock at $50, I think it's a steal, but I don't think there is any one silver bullet here.",

Main reason why is that recently the stock saw a dip from the 100 down to the mid 80s level mostly due to hedge funds deleveraging because of the whole GME fiasco so you are buying it at a discount in my opinion. \n\nAnother reason why is that AMD is a classic turnaround story. It wasn't too long ago that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy due to failing product lines, but now it has CPUs that can rival and even outperform Intel and the specs for their GPUs shows they can actually go foot to foot with Nvidia. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the market for CPUs and GPUs are still growing so I don't really expect a deceleration of the company's revenue growth. \n\nLastly, keep in mind that the Gov is still doing QE infinity, that and the trillions of stimulus they are gonna give out this year means it is a perfect environment for risk assets, so don't overthink it.",

Why? Cause I know these securities have value that any investor can see and I don't need to convince them to buy in with some get rich quick schemes.\n\nWhat happens when most of your investors are in for a quick buck and don't actually believe in the business too, is that they're quick to bail out for a profit because they were never in it for the long term. And that's exactly what happened to GME, people saw a company's stock jump to ridiculous valuation thanks to a short squeeze and took profits. \n\nNo short ladder attacks or whatever other stupid conspiracy you want to bring up. If I bought GME at 20 wtf would I not sell at 300? Even if I thought it could keep running I'd still sell a decent portion of my position to secure profits.",

        "body": "I think you underestimated the importance of TSMC. Just think about how many things today's use chips, TVs, cars, computer, data center, phones, cameras. About half of them are from TSMC (based on market share). Now apply the current auto ICs shortage to every sector. That's what will happen if China invades Taiwan. We are not going to see a collapse of TSM, we are going to see a Great Depression. I dont think the western powers will allow that to happen.\n\nAlso the fact that TSMC is the largest fab and has the most capacity but is still at full capacity tells you the world needs IC. Apple, AMD along takes away so much of their 5nm and 7nm slot already. The fact that Nvidia didn't produce their rtx3000s in TSMC is actually bullish because TSMC couldn't care less about it to lower its price to compete with Samsung. \n\nOn the topic of Samsung, their fab is the only threat to TSMC. However, it has been shown from time to time that TSMC process is better, in terms of performance and power. Apple once used both TSMC and Samsung to produce one of their iPhone processor. You can Google the result, but basically TSMC wins in every metrics.\n\nIntel on the other hand, is a closed fab meaning they do not produce chips for other companies. They only make their own stuff. So even they figure out their 7nm, it is not a threat to TSMC. On top of that there is no capacity in TSMC for Intel (said TSMC). \n\nThere are many other fabs in Taiwan outside of TSMC. And they are all getting the benefit from TSMC being at full capacity. It will be interesting to see if they can take all those orders in and grow or TSMC will increase its capacity faster.\n\nOther ealier concern is China. It is spending a lot of resources in chip manufacturing. However, this is no long a issue because of US sanctions. ASML and other key equipment manufacturers are not allowed or limited to sell to China. This basically put a chock hold on Chinese fans. Unless they can develop their own equipment, there is no chance for them to catch up to Samsung or TSMC.\n\n\nThis is my two cents. I'm increasing my holdings whenever I can on a 2~3% dip day. I don't see any competition in the next 5~10 years minimum.\n\n\nTLDR: This world need ICs. TSMC has 55% share in it. So you want in then buy TSMC. This is not going to fall into the hand of China, or there will be greater concern than TSMC share price.",

Not only that but NIO/Ford/GM just cannot compete with TSLA in terms of robotaxi/automated driving, they'd have to partner up with NVDA to even come CLOSE to TSLA (NVDA's AI is 3 years behind TSLA's) so even then they'd be three years behind TSLA and will have to pay extra money for NVDA's partnership which will decrease their margins or make the cars far more expensive while also not being on par with TSLA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCar companies are playing catch up to TSLA's FIRST ITERATION....And I'm not even including batteries and solar......TSLA is undervalued at these prices someone fight me.",

Also, if they get split up by anti-trust, then that'll end up being bullish as all 4 major components of Facebook are individually better companies separated than together.\n\nBUY: Nvidia &gt; Crypto, Data Analysis, Gaming, etc require dedicated processing machines or boards. Figure Nvidia is a leader in design here and charges quite a premium, so big room for growth as decentralised finance kicks on, people do more bigdata or \"AI\" stuff and gaming (outside retail shops) gets bigger.\n\nBUY: JPM &gt; Figure that with all the idiot silver activity, good time to buy a company that has exposure to it, but otherwise has strong fundamentals and dividends.\n\nBUY: TLRY / APHA &gt; Going further into Weed stocks after they drop down from the 20% run up.\n\nHOLD: Meme stocks &gt; BB/Nok fundamentals haven't changed just valuation, GME is my Capital Gains Tax write-off for this FY and holding until just before FY finishes. :)",

        "body": "So from what I understand, which is marginal at best...  AMD, Nvidia, etc need TSMC, Samsung, or ON to fabricate their chips.  Because AMD and Nvidia design the chips, and TSMC makes (fabricates) them.\n\nNow Intel owns all their own fabrication facilities, but their latest technology (fabrication process) is trailing behind the likes of TSMC and Samsung.  So Intel is competing with TSMC in fabrication, but has approached them to perhaps make some Intel chips while Intel sorts their shit out.  To this TSMC said \"sorry, but we got too many orders from AMD and Nvidia\" so you're on your own.\n\nI don't know that this helps anyone make a decision, but TSMC looks to have a market advantage for the next year or so.  Especially since they're making all the AMD chips in the PS5s and Xbox Series XYZ.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, I lost 17K on GME.  I clearly eat crayons.",

People have been researching and developing this technology recently. The biggest issue is that purifiers are extremely costly and can cause more harm than good if they arent installed properly. They want to spend a lot of money on marketing to properly educate people how and where to install it, so I doubt its going to cost 45k$, probably more towards 50-60k$, but that is still a massive difference.\n\nAs for how it will end up performing on the stock market, I doubt the stock will keep rising, but I am fairly certain that it will at the very least spike once it is proven to have any positive results on covid, let alone that a lot of aging purifiers can be replaced with higher end hardware for the same cost.  \n\n\nAs for which ticker belongs to the company providing the new technology, I have no clue exactly, but according to other comments, there is vyst(for cheap play), LLC, trox, carr, jci(carr and jci might already be too late to invest), xiaomi, haier and midea(last three for china market).

The United States will beat Huawei to establish the global standards and commercial market for security reasons - ergo the most prominent U.S. company is in Globalstar given that it already has trusted partners in both Qualcomm (and Ericsson by association) - both of which bring integrated services to 190+ countries.",

        "body": "With all due respect, I do not agree with your statement about there being direct competitors for most companies between the NASDAQ and NYSE. Strong, long lasting companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Qualcomm, etc. hardly have any competition whatsoever in reference to the companies listed in the NYSE (unless you count stagnant/dying firms like Oracle or Nokia, but that\u2019s really stretching it). Only thing I can really think of is Facebook v Twitter and some e-commerce stuff like Alibaba v Amazon. Either way, the examples are seldom. \n\nThat said, I appreciate your advice immensely. Thank you :)",
