        "body": "I agree.\n\nPeople here keep brining up the \"value\" of the company while completely overlooking what is actually happening in the marketplace. Between the limit on buying stocks and hedge funds trading between themselves to drive the price down, and creating a distraction (SLV) to draw attention and fill pockets, this should be throwing off a significantly larger red flag than \"ERMERGERD WSB SAYS GME WORTH $69,420 LOOL\". Who gives a shit, you're completely missing the point here. Short sellers expose themselves to basically unlimited risk. But that risk never actually materializes for them because they can just cheat the system. Meanwhile someone can go buy a stock and lose value because of *their* game OR someone can go short a stock and become insolvent while the *big boys on WallStreet* walk away.\n\nGME isn't an isolated incident. BB, NOK, AMC and a number of others are getting hammered- and have been getting hammered since last Wednesday because the people on the losing side don't want to lose at the game they created for themselves. BB basically experienced a rug pull- it didn't taper off or settle in the 20's... it looks like someone pulled a plug. Look at what happened a month ago (or more) with PLTR and Shitron. Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia... AMD have all been recent targets of this institutional wide short selling.",

GME could theoretically score 8-15 points of margin on customized hardware, and still be selling at a discount.\n\nIf they score some partnerships with say, NVIDIA or AMD, that just helps the profit even further, if they are selling at a high enough rate.

Main reason why is that recently the stock saw a dip from the 100 down to the mid 80s level mostly due to hedge funds deleveraging because of the whole GME fiasco so you are buying it at a discount in my opinion. \n\nAnother reason why is that AMD is a classic turnaround story. It wasn't too long ago that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy due to failing product lines, but now it has CPUs that can rival and even outperform Intel and the specs for their GPUs shows they can actually go foot to foot with Nvidia. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the market for CPUs and GPUs are still growing so I don't really expect a deceleration of the company's revenue growth. \n\nLastly, keep in mind that the Gov is still doing QE infinity, that and the trillions of stimulus they are gonna give out this year means it is a perfect environment for risk assets, so don't overthink it.",

And that's exactly what happened to GME, people saw a company's stock jump to ridiculous valuation thanks to a short squeeze and took profits. \n\nNo short ladder attacks or whatever other stupid conspiracy you want to bring up.

        "body": "I think you underestimated the importance of TSMC. Just think about how many things today's use chips, TVs, cars, computer, data center, phones, cameras. About half of them are from TSMC (based on market share). Now apply the current auto ICs shortage to every sector. That's what will happen if China invades Taiwan. We are not going to see a collapse of TSM, we are going to see a Great Depression. I dont think the western powers will allow that to happen.\n\nAlso the fact that TSMC is the largest fab and has the most capacity but is still at full capacity tells you the world needs IC. Apple, AMD along takes away so much of their 5nm and 7nm slot already. The fact that Nvidia didn't produce their rtx3000s in TSMC is actually bullish because TSMC couldn't care less about it to lower its price to compete with Samsung. \n\nOn the topic of Samsung, their fab is the only threat to TSMC. However, it has been shown from time to time that TSMC process is better, in terms of performance and power. Apple once used both TSMC and Samsung to produce one of their iPhone processor. You can Google the result, but basically TSMC wins in every metrics.\n\nIntel on the other hand, is a closed fab meaning they do not produce chips for other companies. They only make their own stuff. So even they figure out their 7nm, it is not a threat to TSMC. On top of that there is no capacity in TSMC for Intel (said TSMC). \n\nThere are many other fabs in Taiwan outside of TSMC. And they are all getting the benefit from TSMC being at full capacity. It will be interesting to see if they can take all those orders in and grow or TSMC will increase its capacity faster.\n\nOther ealier concern is China. It is spending a lot of resources in chip manufacturing. However, this is no long a issue because of US sanctions. ASML and other key equipment manufacturers are not allowed or limited to sell to China. This basically put a chock hold on Chinese fans. Unless they can develop their own equipment, there is no chance for them to catch up to Samsung or TSMC.\n\n\nThis is my two cents. I'm increasing my holdings whenever I can on a 2~3% dip day. I don't see any competition in the next 5~10 years minimum.\n\n\nTLDR: This world need ICs. TSMC has 55% share in it. So you want in then buy TSMC. This is not going to fall into the hand of China, or there will be greater concern than TSMC share price.",
