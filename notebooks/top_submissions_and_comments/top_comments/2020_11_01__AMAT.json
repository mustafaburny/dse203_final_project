        "body": "I see a bunch of meme stocks lol. Here\u2019s some stocks with a PEG below or right around 1 with decent growth potential and wide profit margins. \n\nVRTX- unfairly gapped down about a month ago, has a 0.82 PEG, 0.07 LT D/E, 25% expected eps growth and fat profit margins. \n\nAMAT- been on a big run lately but still at a decent value. 16% expected EPS growth and a high ROE. You could have grabbed it in the $50s a couple weeks ago and now it\u2019s nearly $80 so the boat might have sailed for short term gains but it\u2019s still trading at a good value. \n\nATVI- pretty low debt, 1.09 PEG and fat profit margins. Been on a year this year but has been on a downtrend for a while now. Maybe a little TA can help you find a good entry point, or just buy it because fuck it. Could be risky because the video game sector isn\u2019t exactly the golden child when it comes to investments. EA is also a good value, they recently announced a buyback and started a dividend.",

        "body": "For those of you who invest in SPAC warrants pre-announcement, I would take a look at Ace Convergence ($ACEVW) for a few reasons:\n\n(1) They are focused in the right industry ([IT infrastructure/software systems-on-a-chip markets](http://acev.io/home/default.aspx)) that has lots of target companies, many of which are doing very well ($AMAT, for example). Any announcement would send these warrants to the moon because people get very excited about any companies that can offer any tech that supports cloud and/or 5G markets. \n\n(2) The management team is terrific. Behrooz Abdi is a very successful entrepreneur and is deeply connected in the chip equipment space. The other folks on the board also have deep investment/deal-making experience. \n\n(3) The warrants are going for under $1. SPAC warrants with a tech focus typically pop into the $1.50 - $3 range upon announcement.\n\n(4) There is barely ever any volume on these. I don't think anyone has been paying any attention to this SPAC. Get in early and sell on announcement.\n\nDisclosure: I have been buying these over the past few months and I look forward to making some $$$$. Not going to sell until they announce a deal.",
