        "body": "I don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\nA resumption of their buyback program could pop the stock, the market realizing they are cheap, or some paper launch.\n\nThe actual business is definitely in decline now (which it kind of was not as much until now. They were definitely not being killed by competitors. They have a very strong moat in laptops, enterprise and cloud. These OEMs switch very very slowly. But they are now).\n\nI\u2019m too lazy to type it up, but Intel\u2019s quietness about new products, their 10nm laptop products suggests that alder lake and other 10nm products are not great. Plus they do not have many 10nm fabs. 2-3. There is a good chance that they won\u2019t have anything exciting (and in high volume) until mid 2022 when 7nm hits. Unless they use TSMC for CPUs which there are no rumors about so far.\n\nThe odds of the stock staying in range are high imo.\nIf anything I\u2019d buy the stock (or wait for light at the end of the tunnel) and hold for the third intel comeback.\n\nBut this time is also different. Apple will introduce ARM powered macbooks, whose release should depress Intel. This push will also further improve the software ecosystem around ARM giving tailwind to startups like Ampere and whoever else is making ARM CPUs now. Broadcom. Amazon Graviton.\nMy point is just that his is not like K6-2 and Ahlon64 times, because there is a real threat from ARM.",
