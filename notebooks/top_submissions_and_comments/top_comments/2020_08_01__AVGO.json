        "body": "I'm not that familiar with CEO comp packages, but the new OSS CEO (David Raun) has some intriguing incentives and a much different skillset than the previous CEO (Steven \"Old News\" Cooper). I'll leave the skillset analysis to others, but I thought it might be worth sharing some intriguing bits from the comp package. \n\nThe CEOs compensation agreement specifies that \"a discretionary bonus provided that the Company\u2019s common stock price reaches $5.50 per share and remains at or above such price for six (6)\u00a0consecutive months\". It doesn't specify the discretionary bonus amount, but I would assume it would be fairly lucrative considering that would represent \\~150% of increased market cap over the time he started in June. \n\nOn the other hand, he's got vesting incentives that lock in at the end of Q2 and Q4 which incentivize him to increase the price $0.25 over the previous six months at the end of the period using a weighted average price.\n\nHis compensation agreement went into effect on June 24, 2020, so it's early but it's meaningful that this is the goal. The earning report on Thursday represents the end of Q2 so the price run up here matches the incentive to increase the price over the previous six month period. End of the price around Q4 last fiscal year was $1.80ish so they've easily hit the $0.25 price increase milestone with the current \\~$3 price, but the end of Q2 (relevant period for the price escalator) was actually approximately June 20-30. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKey Takeaways: \n\n* The board of directors has incentivized the CEO with a price target of $5.50 (average price over 6 month period during the next three years of the agreement period) and stock option vesting escalators if the price increases $0.25 at the end of Q2 and Q4. \n* CEO has previous exit experience PLX Technologies acquired by the company now known as Broadcom (an OSS partner) and the CEO change would seem to be an indication that they are looking to move toward growth/profitability. \n* Strong partnership list including NVIDIA, AMD, and others. \n* [COVID-19 statement](https://www.onestopsystems.com/coronavirus-covid-19-statement) includes this language: \"Due to the medical, military and other critical applications serviced by our products, the US Undersecretary of State has requested that OSS remain in operation and continue to provide the essential critical infrastructure products we manufacture.\" \n* A diverse product set that ruggedizes computation in a wide set of markets (e.g. military, medical, autonomous vehicles, media and entertainment, etc) where quick decisions need to be made faster than is possible in cloud computing applications. \n\nKey Resources: \n\n* [8K - SEC filing announcing hiring of David Raun as CEO.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391d8k.htm)\n* [CEO Employment Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391dex101.htm)\n* [CEO Interview on OSS product offerings including \"AI on the Fly\" and Edge Computing](https://www.channelchek.com/channelcast-detail/157) \n* [July 21 Corporate Presentation including Customer List, Q1 and Q2 progress, and some fluff.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_e9cdb971205220b8a434fada5addbc0a/onestopsystems/db/354/2817/pdf/OSS+Corporate+Profile+July+2020.pdf) Key customers in industries ranging from aerospace, military/government, medical instrumentation, 5G communications, and autonomous vehicles. \n\nI don't know where this is going, but I like the company's outlook. Long term price outlook is $5.50 at some point over the next three years. I have no idea what's going to happen in the short term.",

They were definitely not being killed by competitors. They have a very strong moat in laptops, enterprise and cloud. These OEMs switch very very slowly. But they are now).\n\nI\u2019m too lazy to type it up, but Intel\u2019s quietness about new products, their 10nm laptop products suggests that alder lake and other 10nm products are not great. Plus they do not have many 10nm fabs. 2-3. There is a good chance that they won\u2019t have anything exciting (and in high volume) until mid 2022 when 7nm hits. Unless they use TSMC for CPUs which there are no rumors about so far.\n\nThe odds of the stock staying in range are high imo.\nIf anything I\u2019d buy the stock (or wait for light at the end of the tunnel) and hold for the third intel comeback.\n\nBut this time is also different. Apple will introduce ARM powered macbooks, whose release should depress Intel. This push will also further improve the software ecosystem around ARM giving tailwind to startups like Ampere and whoever else is making ARM CPUs now. Broadcom. Amazon Graviton.\nMy point is just that his is not like K6-2 and Ahlon64 times, because there is a real threat from ARM.",

        "body": "SoftBank Nears $40 Billion Deal to Sell Arm Holdings to Nvidia\n\nUnion of Arm, Nvidia would create a powerhouse in the chip industry\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank recently has been involved in a series of big asset sales after being under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. 9984 1.03% is nearing a deal to sell British chip designer Arm Holdings to Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said \u2014 assuming it isn\u2019t derailed at the last minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world\u2019s smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics\u2014and play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year\u2019s biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm\u2019s customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals. Most or all of that is already under way or completed and its shares are up more than 20% this year. Among the sales: big chunks of its holdings in China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and T-Mobile US Inc. following the wireless provider\u2019s merger with Sprint Corp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank has also purchased options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks this year. The sheer size of the bet has had an outsize effect on the overall stock market, driving prices higher, the Journal has reported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt SoftBank, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been working with a small team to negotiate the Arm deal including the chief executive of the chip company, Simon Segars, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, as well as Rajeev Misra, CEO of the firm\u2019s giant Vision Fund, and Akshay Naheta, another executive at the fund.",

Not that they will... but its an option nvidia doesn't have.\n\nI see AMD continuing to eat Intels lunch which alone is enough to push them past 200/300 in the next 2-3 years.  The biggest risk is Intel capitulating on the fab side of things and teaming up with Samsung.  I can see Intel besting AMD on the 8nm Samsung process.\n\nIntel will eventually go fabless.  If they do it in the next 2-3 years amd could be it trouble.  If they insist on being stubborn they are going the way of Nortel long term and AMD will rule x86 with an iron fist.",

Some of these could be my personal experience, but I've seen this posted too many times now.\n\nThey do have an edge on some things, but that's not going to stay long. Their current strategy is to buy back their stock and market against AMD instead of investing in their own technology and talent.\n\nThis stock will be a buy the day they put a CEO with an engineering background that'll fire a lot of the dead weight and hire talented people to focus mainly on technology and ease off of the advertisement and stock buy backs.\n\nIf you've read thus far, great. If you're still not convinced, which most Intel people aren't, here is a question: What would convince you? An actual live video of Lisa Su wiping the floor with Intel CPUs?

Some undervalued tech wont be as affected and will continue upward movement(see INTC) and some relative strength will remain in the sector. But expect more bleeding from the ones that had yuge run ups (ZM)\n\nNext leg up will be fueled by recovery plays to build on top of the already strong tech sector.  The vaccine is coming whether you like it or not. Put your political b.s. aside.  This is going to be a green light for getting covid impacted businesses going again at almost 100%. Again, just because you dont like Trump isnt a good counter argument.  Get over it.  Position yourselves accordingly; things like (good)airlines, cruise lines, retail, restaurants, DIS...  might even add in financials\n\nPersonally, I'll be leaving a little bit of reserves to savagely go balls deep into Palantir when they do their ipo later this month.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk",
