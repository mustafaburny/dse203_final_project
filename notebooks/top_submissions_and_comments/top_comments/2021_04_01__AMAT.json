        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

From the time that any company went public until today each chart shows that the bulk of growth happened in the last year alone, evidence apparent before every crash or recession. Furthermore companies like AMAT saw a huge jump in the price just in the last month because of catalysts, not because of sales.

If you check their earnings transcripts you can see that they talk about their deliveries as well as their inventory.\n\n&gt;For that reason, I believe that we're going to start seeing this revenue certainly inside 2021. At least, the execs at companies like AMAT seem to agree, and the market seems to be anticipating the PEG.\n\nYou're probably right about the latter part and perhaps wrong about the former part. AMAT isn't going to book profits in 2021 for the new capex outlay that was announced in the past couple of weeks from TSMC and Intel and the others. It would be accounting fraud. Even a nontrivial expansion of an existing fab will take 2-3y minimum. But the market is certainly anticipating the forward earnings. I am long-term bullish AMAT and the others, have been for a while, but AMAT is trading at a 33 P/E and INTC is trading at a 12.5 P/E. Assuming their earnings are correlated (which they ought to be if you normalize for lead/lag), I'd rather play the cheaper valuation with far cheaper IV.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I so desperately want to be involved in the capex names but the entry point right now is mediocre. My thinking is that if they rip, they will carry the rest of the fab side of the sector with them. So I prefer the insanely cheap upside skew of INTC because it will rip if it can break through the psychological barrier that 65 represents for the spot price. My play is to wait for everything to get crushed in a correlation event later this summer and then scoop them up. The stars will have to align but I think they just might.",

Any major changes to the current healthcare system would take years to execute and UNH would probably play a role in that transformation.\n\nV - Continued digitization of financial system, pandemic recovery should be favorable to them, they also appear to be experimenting with crypto transactions for customers\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nTSCO - Not quite as established as something like HD/LOW in terms of retail but higher upside potential, should be pretty resilient to e-commerce given the products they sell + their targeted market",
