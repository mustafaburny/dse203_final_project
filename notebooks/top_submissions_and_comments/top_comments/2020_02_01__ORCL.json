That means right now I am currently $79 down. There are three cases that can happen next Monday:\n\n1) CGC stays around the same price - The sold put is not exercised. I will sell another $19 put a week out (2/21 expiry) for about $100 again, which will put me in the green. \n\n2) CGC goes up - worst case scenario - The 3/6 put is now not a good risk management device, as selling $19 puts is no longer generating much premium. I can mitigate the impact of this scenario by setting a limit to sell the 3/6 put (not guaranteed that the order would be filled though)\n\n3) CGC goes down - I get assigned on the $19 2/14 put, but I have a corresponding 3/6 put that will guarantee that I break even on the shares (not including premium). I will sell calls against the newly acquired CGC shares until 3/6 approaches, when I will exercise the put if CGC is still worth less than $19.",

        "body": "142mm shares float. 25mm of that is short, meaning they borrowed from people who are long out of that 142mm and then sold it to other people who are now long. Effectively 25mm shares EXTRA have been traded that don't actually exist. When the stock goes up, most longs don't sell. The person who is short is paying a large interest rate to borrow those shares on top of the losses they're taking in the market. Tesla is the most shorted stock in the market which means the interest charge will be amongst the highest in the market. When they get margin called, they are forced to buy shares back. The 25mm shares that they borrowed from are unlikely to sell. They're making phat interest on top of the price appreciation for the shares they lended out. Most of the big institutional owners have only been adding positions in Tesla not selling. Names like Baillie Gifford who owns 13.8mm. Vanguard and BlackRock that owns almost 8mm and 6.4mm for their various mutual funds. Many other institutions own it too, most adding not selling shares. Then you have large individual investors, like Oracle CEO Larry Ellison who owns 3mm shares just by himself. Do you see how the supply of shares people are willing to trade rapidly evaporates? Keep in mind Elon himself owns 34mm shares and only ever sells small amounts to pay taxes, then usually buys them right back later. These big shorts have to find someone willing to sell them shares, and LOTS of them. The longer they wait to find a seller the worse it gets for them and they're still paying brutal interest. \n\nShorts have unlimited loss potential and limited gain potential. It's amazing how few people understand this bias. You have to be way more informed about a short position than you do a long position. A lot of people on Reddit think shorting is a game like trading in and out of stocks on a whim. Then something like this happens and people get a reality check on how this shit really works. There were 10 years leading up to today where people were predicting the iminent death of Tesla. Very powerful, loud, respected people like Bob Lutz, many hedge fund managers, news talking heads, and analysts. People need to understand these talking heads all have a financial interest in lying about Tesla as much as possible. They lie about Tesla's safety, battery tech, financials, or software (sometimes all of these at the same time). In December Morgan Stanley's bear case for Tesla was a valuation of $10 / sh. \"Legendary billionaire investor\" Jim Chanos went on CNBC to layout why he thought Tesla was worthless. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/12/14/jim-chanos-we-think-tesla-is-worth-zero.html\n\nWatching that interview now if you actually research anything about Tesla's product  or business you realize all of that was just blatant lies. He was using his media platform to bet short against the company and profit off the stock selloff as a result of his media spot. \n\nPeople talk about Bulls getting overhyped. Maybe that's true today. To suggest Bears haven't had their own hypetrain is just denying reality. This is the formula for the short squeeze of the century.",

Gen. Brad Schwedo, the Joint Staff\u2019s chief information officer wrote in a declaration to the court. \u201cThe United States cannot expect military success fighting tomorrow\u2019s conflicts with yesterday\u2019s technology. Providing DoD with rapid access to an enterprise cloud, one which provides elastic computing power and storage, is vital to U.S. national security.\u201d\n\n&gt;To win the injunction, among other factors, Amazon needs to show that it\u2019s likely to win the underlying lawsuit and that it its interests would suffer more without a work stoppage than the government\u2019s would if the JEDI buildout was paused.\n\n&gt;And the arguments DoD and the Justice Department are presenting to the court appeared to be meant to show the government would be harmed in multiple ways.\n\n&gt;\u201cJEDI\u2019s (cross-domain solutions) solve the modern software development conundrum \u2013 non-traditional contractors will develop software at the unclassified level, and DoD can then move that software up to Secret (and/or Top Secret),\u201d Sharon Woods, the director of the department\u2019s Cloud Computing Program Office wrote in another declaration. \u201cEarly adopters will need the interim period to produce software that is ready to use CDS when the Secret level is launched. Delaying development of JEDI\u2019s unclassified services will delay software development work that must first occur in the unclassified JEDI environment.\u201d\n\n&gt;In another filing unsealed on Wednesday, government attorneys objected to another request Amazon has made of the court as part of its lawsuit: to authorize sworn depositions of President Donald Trump and several other officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and former secretary James Mattis.\n\n&gt;AWS asserts that testimony would shed further light on one of the central arguments of its protest: the company\u2019s allegation that DoD\u2019s decision to award the contract to Microsoft can only be explained by alleged political interference by the president. So far, the allegations are based mainly on public statements President Trump has made that are critical of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, but also on an account in a recent book in which the president was reported to say he wanted to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d out of the contract.\n\n&gt;In its response, DoD and DOJ called the discovery requests an \u201cextraordinary step\u201d that has no bearing on the questions at issue in the case.\n\n&gt;\u201cAWS spends pages and pages detailing the president\u2019s alleged bias exhibited against Amazon.  Yet the relevant question in this protest is not whether the president dislikes Amazon, but rather whether the source selection officials \u2014 the government personnel who actually evaluated AWS\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s proposals and decided which offeror would receive the JEDI contract \u2014 exhibited bias against AWS in this procurement,\u201d attorneys wrote. \u201cParadoxically, program officials were falsely accused of harboring a pro-Amazon bias in the Oracle litigation, which is currently pending appeal.  AWS omits almost all mention of this litigation from its account of alleged bias, perhaps in part because AWS\u2019s position with respect to supplementation of the record in that protest is inconsistent with the arguments it presents here.\u201d",

        "body": "If we're talking about random companies, sure, I agree with the principle. But just like we saw last time, there are certain companies that are too big to fail. And some that if they were to fail, would be indicative of a MUCH bigger problem.\n\nI mean, could you imagine what would happen if Google goes tits up? If Chase or Target went bust, it would be a massive blow, for sure, but we could and would eventually recover from that; at the end of the day, a bank is a bank and a big box retail chain is a big box retail chain.\n\nBut if Microsoft goes kaput, what the hell would happen to all of the companies that rely on Microsoft-exclusive products? Apple takes over? Please. \n\nIf Amazon or Google dies, what happens to, like, half the internet? And almost every major conpany uses Oracle in some way, shape, or form. This isn't even considering the governmental impact of losing these products and services, either.",
