Gen. Brad Schwedo, the Joint Staff\u2019s chief information officer wrote in a declaration to the court. \u201cThe United States cannot expect military success fighting tomorrow\u2019s conflicts with yesterday\u2019s technology. Providing DoD with rapid access to an enterprise cloud, one which provides elastic computing power and storage, is vital to U.S. national security.\u201d\n\n&gt;To win the injunction, among other factors, Amazon needs to show that it\u2019s likely to win the underlying lawsuit and that it its interests would suffer more without a work stoppage than the government\u2019s would if the JEDI buildout was paused.\n\n&gt;And the arguments DoD and the Justice Department are presenting to the court appeared to be meant to show the government would be harmed in multiple ways.\n\n&gt;\u201cJEDI\u2019s (cross-domain solutions) solve the modern software development conundrum \u2013 non-traditional contractors will develop software at the unclassified level, and DoD can then move that software up to Secret (and/or Top Secret),\u201d Sharon Woods, the director of the department\u2019s Cloud Computing Program Office wrote in another declaration. \u201cEarly adopters will need the interim period to produce software that is ready to use CDS when the Secret level is launched. Delaying development of JEDI\u2019s unclassified services will delay software development work that must first occur in the unclassified JEDI environment.\u201d\n\n&gt;In another filing unsealed on Wednesday, government attorneys objected to another request Amazon has made of the court as part of its lawsuit: to authorize sworn depositions of President Donald Trump and several other officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and former secretary James Mattis.\n\n&gt;AWS asserts that testimony would shed further light on one of the central arguments of its protest: the company\u2019s allegation that DoD\u2019s decision to award the contract to Microsoft can only be explained by alleged political interference by the president. So far, the allegations are based mainly on public statements President Trump has made that are critical of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, but also on an account in a recent book in which the president was reported to say he wanted to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d out of the contract.\n\n&gt;In its response, DoD and DOJ called the discovery requests an \u201cextraordinary step\u201d that has no bearing on the questions at issue in the case.\n\n&gt;\u201cAWS spends pages and pages detailing the president\u2019s alleged bias exhibited against Amazon.  Yet the relevant question in this protest is not whether the president dislikes Amazon, but rather whether the source selection officials \u2014 the government personnel who actually evaluated AWS\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s proposals and decided which offeror would receive the JEDI contract \u2014 exhibited bias against AWS in this procurement,\u201d attorneys wrote. \u201cParadoxically, program officials were falsely accused of harboring a pro-Amazon bias in the Oracle litigation, which is currently pending appeal.  AWS omits almost all mention of this litigation from its account of alleged bias, perhaps in part because AWS\u2019s position with respect to supplementation of the record in that protest is inconsistent with the arguments it presents here.\u201d",

No 0days or weeklies, strictly over a month or more options with long C leaps.\n\nCurrently I'm sitting on:\n10 MSFT $145 C exp in 2021. Bought at beginning of 2019. Planning to sell them soon, but I've been saying that since I bought them. MSFT just keeps hitting highs.\n\n 8 AMD $35 C exp in 2021. Bought in back when AMD was trading just under $40.\n\nI have 3 cash secured puts on AMD at $45 exp end of Febuary.\n\n10 QCOM $85 C exp 2021. Bought when QCOM was at $90 a while ago, just letting it ride I'm at a decent loss on them right now, but it'll come back.\n\nI've gotten bitten writing puts on QCOM, but selling calls has worked wonderfully for me. I got exercised a few weeks ago on 200 shares at $90. I'm waiting for a dip to $85 to buy shares back, I'm not bothering to write puts since I make it a point not to play earnings.\n\n20 SPCE $20 C Exp 2021, bought in at $13. I had 30, sold 10 at $18. Planning on selling off another 10 when it bumps to $22 and then ride my remaining out to exp or roll into further leaps.\n\nThat's all I'm doing in options at the moment, I have most of my portfolio in stocks.",
