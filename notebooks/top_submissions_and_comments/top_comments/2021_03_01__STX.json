Basically the most fabs have been out of game for advanced technology nodes. For example, TXN has some fabs, but they are old technology (still a descent market especially for analog chips). MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC. Samsung is still in the game and SMIC is trying to catch up. But basically TSM takes the majority of the market. \n\nDisclosure: I have been holding TSM for a couple of years. I personally prefer fab+fabless and I am a little bearish on US-based fab. But I am not an expert in the field.",

CRSR is not one of those companies (aside from rebadging hardware manufactured by others for the consumer market).\n\nGo-to plays would probably depend on your opinion on whether flash will outperform mechanical storage for the next X number of years or not (I'm ignoring tape media for now, even though it is important). The likes of SK Hynix, Micron, Samsung Electronics, Toshiba, WD, STX, Marvell all spring to mind. Then you have the other companies who deal with the tools that allow us to store such vast amounts of data. That's where the likes of NVDA/INTC/AMD come in from a hardware perspective. But also the vendors who supply those servers to data centre customers, such as Dell, HPE, Atos, IBM etc.. Oh and then there's the actual cloud giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc.. \n\nBasically put, a play on data can involve many, many companies. I personally (in my opinion - not financial advice, of course) think it's a great play, but I don't think CRSR would be anywhere near the list of my preferences.",

It'll take US shell months to ramp up production so short term (I'm guessing next 6 months) and demand fundamental points to more upside.\n\nThen you have the wildcard of rising Middle East tension.  Israel said last week if they are updating their plan to strike Iran's nuclear program if US is not willing.  Iran responded today saying it will level Tel Aviv if Israel tries.  Probably just ego talking right now but who knows.  Major Saudi oil port Ras Tanura got attacked by drones and missiles yesterday.  They blame Iran backed rebel Yemen but the port is northern SA, far away from Yemen so doesn't make any sense.  Iran is much closer.  Or it could just be a false flag to use to start bombing Yemen again (that war has been taking a ease fire last year because of the pandemic but can start again now pandemic is on its way out).  If any of those escalates, oil is going up huge.",

If the CEO is going to lie to its employees I don't like the stock. It is foolish to assume it is to big to fail, As an investor you should be concerned about the lawsuit by the SEC. You should be concerned about its failure to preform during the biggest bull season the country has ever seen. You should be concerned about the lack of innovations this tech stock has came out with. You could be concerned about paying 67 BILLION for Direct TV and they CAN NOT SELL THE PRODUCT BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO BUY IT. You should be concerned that they keep rising cost of products without building any real value. You should be concerned that its competitors are providing the same services for WAY LESS. You should be concerned that they are unwilling to renew UNION contracts. And the list goes on .... As an investor there arnt any positive things about this stock besides the fact they they are \"BIG\" and can not fail and you have nothing to worry about are the exact same words the CEO used while speaking to 100s of thousands of employees two weeks prior to laying them off.\n\n5g investment 1.8 B I think is the number for 2020... I'm not betting against 5G. Im betting against the fact AT&amp;T failed to see the true value in 5G as its competitors are using it to bring home internet to rural areas as AT&amp;T is using it as an excuse to stream videos on your phone. 5G is the future in tel com but AT&amp;T 5G is no different than Tmobile 5G and they have it for x2 less the cost. \n\nBrick and mortar make up a huge % of sales and new customers.

        "body": "All valid points, I'd break my response in topics starting with ..\n\n1. The loss of brick and mortar stores isn't the downside here as they are not losing those stores, however switching them to auth retail. This alone is going to hurt the perspective in new customers. Being in the tel communication industry, finding customers who are the bread and butter for the company (5+ lines) will want to come into a store. AT&amp;T can no longer deliver on that aspect as the auth retailers are dishonest and get paid 1/3 of what a corp sales rep would make. And as an insider and speaking to fellow colleagues in the industry who have lost their jobs and forced to work call center .. 70% of their customer concerns are from people who signed up at these auth retail locations. That being said, it will alone eat away into their profits to be made on the cellular side of things. Also, as I stated earlier with the expansion of 5G they are dumping billions into upgrading and adding towers all over. Without expected growth from sales to cover the cost of the new debt they are taking on it could potentially be drastic for the company's number source of rev. \n2. AT&amp;T staff was a hit and miss depending on the location and owner. 99% of corp stores will have amazing staff and they were all properly educated and paid. With the decrease in corp ownership you will see customer sat go down the drain by the end of this year. On top of that, the current employees are all union and these are split up into regions the purple contract was renewed however orange and black still are up in limbo which implies further layoffs. The concept that a boomer wont switch for the money was fine was everyone was making money. But with covid a lot of people are looking for ways to cut money and the number 1 thing right is TV and cellphones. Their new plans are expensive and they have put increasing pressure on currently plan holders to switch to new plans or be throttled. Keeping a plan is one thing but when a company tells you that your current plan is changing and you are going to get less for more unless you pay more for the same  features you've always had will single handedly cause the majority of people to switch. On top of everything AT&amp;T lies to its investors as well as its employees. You know how hard it is to be on a nation wide phone call with the CEO of a company that is telling every single retail rep in the country during the middle of a pandemic that their jobs are safe only to know that two weeks later that 70% wont have a job next year (some as soon as 2 weeks from that call)?\n3. they can't even find buyers for Direct TV and many other products they are trying to get rid of which will cause them to sell their bad investments off for pennies on the dollar. Anyway you look at this AT&amp;T is going to lose A LOT of money and they will not be able to make up the losses nearly as quick as they would have been able to in the past. competition is getting harder and harder and sales/ad rev are both down and have not made a recovery since covid. In no scenario will AT&amp;T be able to make money in the coming years. They have been building this coffin for some time by changing business model to reflect unrealistic results and being late to show with almost every new product they have came out with. TECH COMPANIES NEED TO INNOVATE. AT&amp;T spends billions of dollars trying to come up with products that are outdated and when they do release the products (AT&amp;T TV, HBO MAX) they are over priced. If a tech company can not deliver on new products it will not be able to deliver overall.\n4. There are 100 better div stocks that AT&amp;T. when speaking of AT&amp;T div.. This was the first time in many years AT&amp;T did not raise their DIV. The DIV itself was in question after COVID. I doubt they will be able to keep their DIV where its at for very long if they keep doing what they are doing.",
