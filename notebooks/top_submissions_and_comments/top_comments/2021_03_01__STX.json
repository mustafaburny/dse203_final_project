        "body": "You might want to remove STX, AVGO, AAPL and etc. from the list, and add ASML, LRCX, MU and etc. to the list. \n\n\nI am working in semiconductor industry but not in fabrication. Basically the most fabs have been out of game for advanced technology nodes. For example, TXN has some fabs, but they are old technology (still a descent market especially for analog chips). MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC. Samsung is still in the game and SMIC is trying to catch up. But basically TSM takes the majority of the market. \n\nDisclosure: I have been holding TSM for a couple of years. I personally prefer fab+fabless and I am a little bearish on US-based fab. But I am not an expert in the field.",

In next 2 years we will create more data then in last 2000 years. So this was kind of enlightening for me. Question is now where we will save all this data? Who is memory producer? I own Micron and this is super bullish sign for me.\n\nI would like to add that now I\u2019m looking into other memory producers, which has reasonable PE, like Seagate for example. I think any company in that sector will have huge potential, based on shortage and estimates how much more chips we will need.",
