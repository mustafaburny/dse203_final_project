Wrote them down to remind myself during the next crash. \n\n1. **Don\u2019t sell.**\u00a0Unless you are able to predict the top and bottom, selling would mean you make a loss and miss out when the market rebounds. I made the mistake of selling PayPal at a loss, thinking I would switch my funds to buying Microsoft, which was doing well with their video conferencing app. At the time, PayPal was slow moving compared to the other tech companies. I sold PayPal and did not manage to get into Microsoft early enough to ride the gains. As a result, I not only missed out on the opportunity on Microsoft, I missed out my gains for PayPal had I held. PayPal has since gained 20% from my average price.\u00a0\n\n2. **Don\u2019t panic, average down.**\u00a0During a crisis, don\u2019t panic! (I know, easier said than done) Determine value of the stock and its fundamentals. If the fundamentals are still intact, ignore the noise and just average down. Divide your spare cash in 3 pockets. Every time the stock drops 10%, buy in. The economy will eventually recover and this is how you make use of the opportunity to make high returns.\u00a0\n\n3. **Follow the trend.**\u00a0The market may not always make sense. During this crisis, despite rounds of weak economic data (unemployment, GDP decline etc.), the market has rallied 25%. Follow the trend, ride the wave, don\u2019t try to go against it. Shorting this market will only hurt you. Don\u2019t fight against the Fed.",

Trade Desk up another 11% today and is now more than 2x since early April. Car sales were considerably better than expected in May (https://www.autoblog.com/2020/06/02/may-2020-us-auto-sales/), which sent Carvana up big yesterday. Security? Okta had a very good quarter the other day, Crowdstrike yesterday. Visa said two days ago that trends continue to improve, Paypal said April was the best month since its IPO.\n\nSome emerging markets tech names doing well. Look at SE +117% YTD. MELI +40%\n\n Google and Facebook suffered from ad spending on things like travel being down (Booking and Expedia spend a fortune on Google ads - Expedia's chairman noted \"\u201cAt Expedia, for instance, we spend $5 billion a year on advertising. We won\u2019t spend $1 billion on advertising probably this year.\" A couple of years ago, Booking spent a billion on Google ads in the quarter (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/05/travel-giant-booking-spent-1-billion-on-google-ads-in-the-quarter.html.) So those companies are uniquely effected, but things have improved as Facebook noted on their conference call. Google may have suspended some spending recently, but they announced the other day that employees who choose to work from home can expense a grand worth of office furniture. https://nypost.com/2020/05/26/google-will-let-workers-expense-1000-worth-of-office-furniture/\n\nWork from home has certainly done well too, but if that becomes a bigger part of culture going forward to some degree, that becomes a long-term theme. Remote work - look at RNG, ZM, FIVN.  Look at telehealth - Teladoc has done well this year but Livongo +145% YTD. Look at CDN names like FSLY, which is +150% YTD/NET +71%",

They were grounded and not filled with hyperbole, and he appeared to be thinking deeply on the questions (even the 'simple' ones) and answering them in a concise but sufficient manner -- what you would expect from a good engineer rather than a salesman.\n\nI also remember looking him up and following his path from Tesla to SpaceX to PayPal/X.com. So here you had someone who was extremely ambitious, highly intelligent, but also knew how to deliver. He thinks bigger picture and ahead of the curve. That's what I value most in founders, and I think engineers make the best founder/CEOs because engineers are logical and no bullshit.\n\nIt's extremely rare to find that mix of ambition, intelligence, and engineering mindfulness. Is he a good human being? I don't know. His impact on humanity has probably been net positive so far. He has his views and opinions that don't necessarily align with mine, but some of his big ideas do.\n\nIn contrast when watching the Trevor Milton interview last week, the things that struck me were:\n\n1. \"be in the current/things are easy\" ... This is the exact opposite of what it's like to be visionary imo. The toughest problems are extremely difficult, and if people just took the easy path, we'd have very little real progress in the world. This is mostly a copycat mentality. There's a 'current' because someone else has already busted open the dam.\n2. comparing his previous company with Amazon ... Anyone who describes their business as \"it's like Amazon but\" gets a thumbs down from me. It's a total namedrop cop-out, and then he says something like \"we didn't know what we had at the time\" as the reason they failed I'm guessing? Pretty lame answer, and it completely misses the distinguishing factor for Amazon's success vs. everybody else from the early years. They didn't just sell books; they mastered supply chain. Again, just shows really short-sighted thinking and misguided analysis imo.\n3. he doesn't come off as brilliant to me ... Seems like a nice enough guy and isn't stupid, but that's not really enough for me to be wowed. A lot of his advice is typical and cliche. I almost groaned aloud when he said something to the effect of starting Nikola Motor because he wanted to turn something ugly into something sexy.\n4. generic hyperbole and what? ... He talks about easily getting world-class people because of how sexy his company is, and I feel it's just sales-pitchy associating with something that's supposed to be impressive (CEOs and presidents, billion-dollar companies, etc.). He also says the Nikola Motor logo is a hexagon with six angles because he teaches that there are six ways to look at everything. But then he doesn't explain what those six angles are. Why six? Why not eight? Sixteen? Thirty-two? Maybe there's actually a reason for six, but it comes across to me as a half-baked retrofitted narrative. That logo is generic as shit, and I doubt he was adamant it had to be a hexagon. It wouldn't surprise me if it was done somewhere like 99 designs.\n\nAnyway, that was a lot more than I intended to write. I might just be grumpy because I missed out on the huge upswing, but that was my thought process for cutting out early last week. Maybe they can still be successful as a copycat, but they're being valued as an innovator. Best of luck if you're in it!",

Were it my money I would most probably pick a tech stock - something near the top of the list of the Nasdaq 100.  But I would so that partially because its more bulletproof to the harder times ahead than other sectors and will likely grow.  How much is a matter of evaluation.\n\nRemember the rule don\u2019t try to predict try to get the probability on your side.\n\nI would look at cyber security or electronic payments companies like PayPal and such - they are only growing as we digitally transform society.\n\nI was looking at Schroedinger SDGR, based on the whole theme of digital transformation but didn\u2019t get in and it\u2019s tripled in the last four months approximately.\n\nOn the smaller side I like Limelight networks when you look at what they do for the money you pay.  \n\nBut like Schroedinger, they\u2019ve kinda had their rebound run already and might not grow that much short term now that this run is well in but have perhaps a long term hold type of play in them.\n\nI\u2019m a trader not an investor so I don\u2019t look super far out and like to make my money in intermediate to short terms.\n\nLet me know what you figure out and congratulations take that profit off the table when it\u2019s available cause nobody can predict the future though the Dow futures are predicting a up day tomorrow right now.",

If you compare them with Marketsmith you will see the glaring difference. The paypal buy recommendation in their newsletter and sell recommendation on Marketsmith was a classic pump and dump scheme skewed towrds marketsmith users. As for the lists I believe there are etfs with all the holdings so kind of defeats the purpose of paying monthly.\n\nThat being said marketsmith is pretty good no doubt. Just very expensive. At around 50 a month it would be great for individual investors.\n\nThe cup and handle pattern is great pattern for the bull market no doubt about it.\n\nI havent looked at gorilla trades. Thanks for letting me know. Will check them out. \n\nIf there are any others do let me know.",
