I bought the following CALLS on Friday, and plan to hold:\n\n5 LYB Jan 15th 2021 45 at $6.37\n\n20 GM Jan 15 2021 30 at $1.51\n\n20 XOM July 17 2020 40 at $3.64 - plan to close this one in the week ahead if we get a pop. (I bought it after I heard the president talk about buying some of the cheap oil in the market and filling up our coffers)\n\n12 Big Lots Jan 15 2021 20 at $1.45 \n\n5 XOM Oct 16th 2020 45 at $4.67. (May hold on to this one longer term as I believe we will see a bounce in oil in the coming months)\n\nHeavily considering buying July Puts on the SPY at the $200 range and Apple at the $225 range as well. \n\nMy positions are fluid and are aimed, generally speaking and specifically on the PUT side, to give me downside protection on the nearly $600,000 I have in long positions. \n\nNervous times, generally speaking, but, with a longer term horizon, likely 12 months, in mind, I believe we have MANY moats that will pull us out of this thing quicker and more robustly than we have seen in the previous bear markets--- lower oil prices, VERY low interest rates, a pro business FED and US GOVT AND, potentially most importantly, PENT up demand that will be fully unleased with a ripe garden of money, loans and oil that are there for the taking!\n\nWhile I lose about $30,000, give or take, per 2,000 point down day, I also add to positions for the long term, specifically, in Google, Amazon, Facebook, CVS, Cisco, QCOM, Pfizer and SWKS. \n\nI wish everyone the best of luck and will say, generally speaking, be greedy when others are fearful. \n\nI believe we are DAMN close to having a recession AND a corona virus effect fully priced into the market, outside of Apple, which I believe has significantly more downside.",

Cisco and EMC may have been dominant for their time but they were eventually eaten by software.\n\nI think this time it's fundamentally different. Amazon and Microsoft both have strong cloud platforms and enterprise businesses, and the former isn't going anywhere. On the whole, anything that can be replaced with software and algorithms will eventually be so, and there is a lot of space to innovate in this area: AR, VR, AI, SDNs, etc. I think MSFT and AMZN are safe bets because everyone uses them right now and it's very difficult to launch a cloud platform from scratch. You need the economics of scale to make a dent in that.\n\nV because electronic payments keeps growing and V and MA both have giant moats around them through their processor network. DIS because of its IP. It's been a century and the company keeps going strong.\n\nBAM because they simply own the major structures that makes modern business and commerce possible.",

Think of it as a sort of PTSD.\n\nAs we can see from history, people tend to get comfortable in how life plays out for them until there is a drastic change. An example could be WW2 when the free land bombed Japan. The bat soup cancer is our modern day global problem(I guess the upside is that it's not a war).\n\nAnother good point you mentioned is the transitioning from working in offices to successfully working at home. More so with the advances of tech, and companies like Cisco and all of those video calling/meeting focused programs. Look at Bloomberg News, a lot of the anchors are now working from home with no disruptions in the quality of news reported(besides audio glitches, but I'm sure that will be fixed relatively soon). \n\nAs for that shitty bat soup cancer, there's a young child that got it (12 years old) with no underlying sickness and a few other people below 30s.\n\nPeople would take things serious only when shit hits the fan and then some more.",

Made 20 grand long on Tesla shares and then Tesla puts end of day today on some quick whatever trades. \n\n And then one of my covid patients died. It was expected, but sad. Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day. It has for 5 years and still does now. Love you guys. Stay safe.",

Get it done in federal - disability money garnished at 25% for 10 years, then debt forgiven and IRS taxes the forgiven amount. Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle. Gonna need a super lawyer to keep it in state as I stayed in CA the entire time, opened the account in CA, and TDA has state presence by having physical retail buildings so are bound to state creditor laws. \n\n# TL;DR\nMay be paying a lawyer 100k-1m to not owe 1m to keep it in state court, lol.

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",

That's only because if you start (and continue) to invest because you somehow believe \"I should start investing\" or \"I should be consistently investing\" (what brokers would have you believe, to ensure their survival) rather than \"I have found a good investment\" then you will always invest an inopportune moments. Buffett invests on very long timelines, using historical trends and ratios as a guide, whereas many investors look at more recent information, and only start investing at the point where recent history shows good returns. I'd say when recent history shows poor returns but long term history shows good, and the particular company you're looking to invest in has some kind of difficult to emulate competitive advantage (be it financial, operational, market, or some combination thereof) then go and invest. Otherwise, keep your money on the sidelines (and let it pile up) whilst you observe the market/industries/companies and wait for a great opportunity to buy. This is what the Oracle does, I think.",

        "body": "Great question. \n\nCompanies have been developing a new model for delivery of their services. Traditional IT is considered on-prem or on premise technologies. That can range from servers to applications. Technology vendors have been developing \u201ccloud\u201d technology for years and have been pushing this to market. However, because true cloud or \u201cpublic cloud\u201d is hosted in a vendors data center people are skeptical of using vendors because they don\u2019t control everything. This means all the responsibility is on the vendors to secure everything. \n\nSince cloud is the new way of deploying IT solutions and people are starting to accept the model more governments want in on the benefits of cloud. \n\nBut since the government won\u2019t be in full control of the cloud (see Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Oracle gov data centers) they need a way to ensure security, deployment, and capabilities are met. This is called fedramp. There are multiple levels in getting certified for usage from the government.",
