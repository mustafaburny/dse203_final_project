Aside from the usual bug schedule (which cisco is no better/worse than anyone else) their hardware is rocksolid, it really comes down to the software for the API on the devices, or the software of tools to manage it.\n\nCisco is only a leader in the market when you look at the entire breadth of their portfolio because: No one else is spread as thin.

Correct? \"\n\nNo. If you expect a red Monday and you already own 100 shares of Cisco you plan to sell, you are already dealing with a loss. Furthermore, if you expect the price to go down further you would be good to buy a put contract on Cisco. \n\nIf you want to hang on to your shares of Cisco because you expect them to go up, but want \"insurance\" against that, you could also buy a put contract in case the price goes down.",

Cisco has slowly gone up.\n\n\nLets say your required holding period is 1 year. That means if you hold the stock for 1 year and the stock doesn\u2019t budge in price. If you sell you gain the 15% in the discount plus 4% from the dividend you gained as well. Historically, the stock has gone up as well, which also increase your gains.\n\nSo, continue to buy your company stock.\n\n\nNow there is some people I bet at your work, just like mine, that have bought their company stock for 20+ years and never sold. Doing this increasing your exposure to that one company. If the company tanks, your stock will be worth a lot less and you could be out of a job.\n\n\nHowever, if you go with selling right after your lock out period it\u2019s a great way to use that discount to generate more money for you. \n\n\nRelax investing is a marathon not a sprint.",

If, for example, you attempt an elementary level of stock analysis and summarize your thought process, while asking for feedback, that would be more appropriate. Simply stating \"should I buy X, I have Y money\" is somewhat lazy. Also, presenting questions in this fashion does not foster discussion in any meaningful way. \n\nTo answer your question:\n\n1. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon (Established Tech)\n2. Ecolab, Honeywell, 3M, Corning, Cisco (Blue chip)\n3. ETFs (i.e., VOO or VTI) \n\nStart here. See if you agree after researching.
