The market maker makes a profit from the bid-ask spread and rebates a portion of this profit to the routing broker as PFOF. Another fraction of a penny per share may be routed back to the consumer as price improvement.\\[3\\]\\[4\\] Brokers in the United States that accept payment for order flow include **Robinhood, E-Trade, Ally Financial, Webull, Tradestation, The Vanguard Group, Charles Schwab Corporation, and TD Ameritrade**, while brokers that do not receive payment for order flow include **Interactive Brokers (pro accounts that are charged commissions), Merrill Edge, and Fidelity Investments.**\\[5\\]\r  \n\r  \nIn the United States, accepting PFOF is only allowed if no other exchange is quoting a better price on the National Market System. The broker must disclose to the client that it accepts PFOF. Transactions must be executed at the best execution, which could mean the best price available or the speediest execution available.\\[1\\]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment\\_for\\_order\\_flow",

You can goggle which is best brokerage firm for beginners.  I'm bias been with TDA for over 20 years love their educational videos.  Please make sure you read news article Anatomy of a Short published in 2008 or 2009.\n\nRemember investing should be for life and if you can commit to sending some money every 2 weeks it will grow quite abit.  Always, always do your own research;  never go blindly into a stock recommended on social media, always verify the info.  REITs may have some additional tax implications, so you may want a stock that pays dividends that you don't have to do a lot of tax calculations.  \n\nIn college you may want to check out financing courses, if it is too expense check Udemy  prices are quite reasonable on really good investment complete courses.

The only advantage was easy deposits, but has a casino like interface. If you're into crypto, you don't own anything if you go through them. I use Ameritrade, they have great educational courses and charting with sinkorswim add on. But they only offer full stock purchases, so I'll sign up with fidelity to purchase partial shares.",

Before you plunk any money into the market, first establish how much you can afford to invest (income - expenses) and how frequent (biweekly, monthly). A sure fire way to derail your investment is to have to pull money because you need it. Invest what you can afford to do without. Once you have that, then sign up for a brokerage account. I suggest Fidelity. Next, avail yourself to all the education and tools that will help you understand your risk tolerance, timeline, and provide direction towards sound investment choices (one I suggest is SCHD). Be patient! Time in the market beats timing the market, so invest, don\u2019t touch it, and let it grow. You will have ups and downs but it\u2019s a marathon not a sprint. Good luck!",
