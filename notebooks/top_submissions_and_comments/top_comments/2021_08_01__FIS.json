The market maker makes a profit from the bid-ask spread and rebates a portion of this profit to the routing broker as PFOF. Another fraction of a penny per share may be routed back to the consumer as price improvement.\\[3\\]\\[4\\] Brokers in the United States that accept payment for order flow include **Robinhood, E-Trade, Ally Financial, Webull, Tradestation, The Vanguard Group, Charles Schwab Corporation, and TD Ameritrade**, while brokers that do not receive payment for order flow include **Interactive Brokers (pro accounts that are charged commissions), Merrill Edge, and Fidelity Investments.**\\[5\\]\r  \n\r  \nIn the United States, accepting PFOF is only allowed if no other exchange is quoting a better price on the National Market System. The broker must disclose to the client that it accepts PFOF. Transactions must be executed at the best execution, which could mean the best price available or the speediest execution available.\\[1\\]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment\\_for\\_order\\_flow",

If you're thinking of GME go read all the older DD's from January on GME, watch the movies Big Shorts, Margin call, if your interested in dividends check out r/dividends ; r/investing &amp; goggle dividends; likewise strongly recommend either TD Ameritrade or Fidelity. You can goggle which is best brokerage firm for beginners.  I'm bias been with TDA for over 20 years love their educational videos.  Please make sure you read news article Anatomy of a Short published in 2008 or 2009.\n\nRemember investing should be for life and if you can commit to sending some money every 2 weeks it will grow quite abit.  Always, always do your own research;  never go blindly into a stock recommended on social media, always verify the info.  REITs may have some additional tax implications, so you may want a stock that pays dividends that you don't have to do a lot of tax calculations.  \n\nIn college you may want to check out financing courses, if it is too expense check Udemy  prices are quite reasonable on really good investment complete courses.   There is a ton of information for free on the internet.  It is a worth while life journey.  Good luck",

        "body": "Does Robinhood have a moat? What are they doing that's so special? Yeah the fractional shares thing and their approach to trading on margin was novel at the time, but it seems most of the big players offer similar products now. And this is the banking industry, experience and connections matter. RH clearly demonstrated their weakness in this area when they got owned by short sellers earlier this year. Ignoring the mechanics of what happened there, the end result was RH getting a bit of a black eye after the dust settled. And, their CEO's attempt at PR certainly didn't instill confidence that he knows how to handle similar scenarios in the future.\n\nHere's the other thing I don't think most people think about. 15 years ago, you start a new job and set up a 401k, what happens? Go go to the special 401k portal that's tailored to your employer's needs and everything kind of exists in this special, walled off, sort of ecosystem. But, that's not what it's like today. Now, for certain institutions like Fidelity, setting up your 401k eventually leads you into the larger portfolio of product offerings from Fidelity including howtos and guides on ETFs, fractional shares, margin accounts, etc. It's all there.\n\nIs Robinhood's marketing and start-up image enough to differentiate them from the rest of the pack? I'm an educated investor and not really their demo, but certainly the approach Fidelity is taking will pay off over time, no? Having an already established investment account would seem to create inertia that would be hard to overcome. Maybe RH focuses on the small fries -- the folks who are only putting in a few thousand dollars? That would lend itself better to a more mobile app centric sort of approach AKA an almost paypal or Zelle like experience, but then I don't see the justification in the market cap.\n\nKind of all over the place with this comment, but yeah, what's the angle here for RH? How do they not just become another small player in the somewhat already saturated retail investor space?",

Or they don't tell you \"you can't sell your shares\" when a potential squeeze is on. \n\nDrop RH for everything possible (Fidelity won't give me options because I am newb and didn't deposit enough to be risky)",

        "body": "Does Robinhood have a moat? What are they doing that's so special? Yeah the fractional shares thing and their approach to trading on margin was novel at the time, but it seems most of the big players offer similar products now. And this is the banking industry, experience and connections matter. RH clearly demonstrated their weakness in this area when they got owned by short sellers earlier this year. Ignoring the mechanics of what happened there, the end result was RH getting a bit of a black eye after the dust settled. And, their CEO's attempt at PR certainly didn't instill confidence that he knows how to handle similar scenarios in the future.\n\nHere's the other thing I don't think most people think about. 15 years ago, you start a new job and set up a 401k, what happens? Go go to the special 401k portal that's tailored to your employer's needs and everything kind of exists in this special, walled off, sort of ecosystem. But, that's not what it's like today. Now, for certain institutions like Fidelity, setting up your 401k eventually leads you into the larger portfolio of product offerings from Fidelity including howtos and guides on ETFs, fractional shares, margin accounts, etc. It's all there.\n\nIs Robinhood's marketing and start-up image enough to differentiate them from the rest of the pack? I'm an educated investor and not really their demo, but certainly the approach Fidelity is taking will pay off over time, no? Having an already established investment account would seem to create inertia that would be hard to overcome. Maybe RH focuses on the small fries -- the folks who are only putting in a few thousand dollars? That would lend itself better to a more mobile app centric sort of approach AKA an almost paypal or Zelle like experience, but then I don't see the justification in the market cap.\n\nKind of all over the place with this comment, but yeah, what's the angle here for RH? How do they not just become another small player in the somewhat already saturated retail investor space?",

That is one who tracks the S&amp;P500, Russel or some world wide index. I believe fidelity have their own, use Google or search this subreddit to find one. The reason they are so hard to beat, is diversification. A single company might fail or perform badly even under a economic boom. The market as a whole does not.\n\nAmazon &amp; Apple are too big too fail? So were Lehman or General Motors. Besides both of these stocks are their own counterexample. Apple was big in the 70s in personal computing. Yet, From 80 till the first iphone the company just burned money. Amazon only started to perform really well when cloud-services became huge. It did not perform poorly, but nobody really saw it for the monolith it is now. \n\nLastly, if you need the money in 6 months, don't invest in the stock market. The 40k might become 50k or 30k. In my country (west Europe) this can mean around a -50k/+50k difference in your mortgage (down payment requirement) are you sure you want that risk?",

        "body": "Robinhood has disabled trading during bull runs, so you can't take profit, ask them anything critical on reddit, they block you. Owned by hedge funds, I speculate they extrapolate info from limit orders for their benefit. Zero customer service. I'm in the process of ditching them and moving everything out. The only advantage was easy deposits, but has a casino like interface. If you're into crypto, you don't own anything if you go through them. I use Ameritrade, they have great educational courses and charting with sinkorswim add on. But they only offer full stock purchases, so I'll sign up with fidelity to purchase partial shares.",

I was getting used to Fidelity on my phone and it was my first penny stock. It was at $.13. Saved me from losing my ass bc I\u2019m down 70%. I\u2019m still holding all 100 shares and no matter how high it goes, I will never buy more.",
