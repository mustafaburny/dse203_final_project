        "body": "Peer to peer lending. The lending club was used as an example. I never use P2P as I made my money off oil and big tech. OP wanted some safe, minimal risk ventures and I supplied them with an avenue that has worked for hundreds of thousands. Sure he can put it in a savings account, a Roth IRA, hell go for that 401k.  \n\nPoint is, if that\u2019s your plan, unless you win the lottery you will always be the 99%. \n\nSure I did get a little emotional at that previous poster who obviously is apart of the 99%. Nothing wrong with that; we\u2019re human. Just like he can be a misinformed jackass, I can also share my opinion on some alternate relatively safe savings accounts and/or platforms.\n\nAnd lastly to answer your final question, I retired very young. I\u2019m married, got kids, live in a wonderful home with a few close great friends. I don\u2019t have to worry about money any more which is fantastic;  but only because I earned it. I\u2019ll tel you why I was so motivated to have an intellectual discussion with this guy; unfortunately he was hostile first so I went fuck it. I was homeless and a drug addict for many years. Homeless, I\u2019ve technically died twice, both resuscitated. Been to rehab, inpatient detox - you name it. Grew up poor, abused by my father- typical boo hoo story. Wasn\u2019t until I found Jim Rohn that I turned my life around. Never had it easy, just like most of the people on the planet. But I was determined and focused and wanted to give back to those who stood by me at my worst. My family and friends. I won\u2019t go into details what I\u2019ve done for them, but let\u2019s just say they also won\u2019t need to worry about money anymore. Unless they take up a meth addiction of course. Jokes aside, my motivation is my family. They looked out for me so I did all I could to get off sleeping on a park bench after losing my high profile city job; to actually go and do what I\u2019d do. And I did if. \n\nFor anyone reading this, you got this. Do tonnes of research on financial trends but more importantly whatever makes you happy. Fortunately I found an industry/s where I got the best of both worlds. I pray every night, I sit down with homeless people and listen to their stories. Even just chatting helps. Sure I\u2019d get them some clothes or warmers and food and what not; but that\u2019s not the point. I\u2019ve always been selfless and it\u2019s paid off; albeit the rough patches In between. I digress; my secret to \u201csuccess\u201d is 3 simple notions. To be determined, consistent and persistent. So long as you have a general direction and have a relatively sound moral/ethical compass. You should be fine. Good luck! You\u2019ve got this.",

You shouldn\u2019t be opening a position based off a \u201cgood feeling.\u201d I use technical analysis\n\n2. When you enter a position, you must tel yourself at what point are you going to start getting ready to take profits. Obviously if the trade is going well your way you shouldn\u2019t close it, but for me once I get past the 20% threshold and I see that the trade is gonna go against me, I close the position. I make that decision based off technical analysis. I\u2019m not right every time but I am the majority and that\u2019s what matters.\n\n3. Same thing as #2. Last week I had bought SPY 323P\u2019s and secured profits at 44% gain. If I had held, two things could\u2019ve happened. Either 323 was the bottom and I wouldve lost all profits and more or the reality (SPY all the way to its levels now). I\u2019m not taking a 50/50 chance on that and losing profits. Hindsight is 20/20. Hardest part is keeping your emotions out of trading",
