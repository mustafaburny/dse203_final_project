Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

If this is an alt account, that's your fault, not mine.\n\n---\n\n&gt;For example, I checked, and from 40 days ago,on the Wu Flu sub:\n\nFirst, if this is your best example of how you were \"just trying to help people\", you should just stop talking now.  More importantly, it looks like despite your 267 step score that you missed some math back in grade school because 40 days ago is still February. You keep saying you started calling this in January as some proof of your enlightenment. \n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fhvyh0/the_us_stock_market_has_now_wiped_out_the_entire/fkeri5h/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fhvyh0/the_us_stock_market_has_now_wiped_out_the_entire/fkekw5w/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fgwqxf/the_outbreak_is_a_marathon_not_a_sprint/fk8ki4a/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fejhpx/anyone_remember_from_a_few_weeks_ago/fjssk08/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fcv4qm/todays_stock_market_news_tuesday_march_3rd_2020/fje2hms/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fbgnoq/department_of_health_confirms_first_coronavirus/fj5spe4/).\n\nApologies that the people of /r/stocks didn't keep tabs on what you were posting on /r/Coronavirus back in January.\n\n---\n\n&gt;As i\u2019ve said here, if you actually bothered to read my posts, i came here to r/stocks for the first time to try and tell people that this was fucking serious when everyone was still in full-bull mode. That was after the first 10% down. I was well out of the market by that stage, but i was hoping to help others and learn a bit myself.\n\n&gt;I was told i was a \u201cweak investor\u201d, that i was trying to manipulate the market etc etc\n\n&gt;What i\u2019ve posted on r/stocks when i first came here has turned out to be exactly right, and the brutal truth is that if you\u2019d listened to me instead of circlejerking y\u2019all would have got out with only a 10% loss rather than a 30% one (and counting).\n\nI would believe you if you were going around right now still trying to help people rather then telling everyone how right you were and crying about how no one took you seriously. Also, there were plenty of [other people](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ey7ejt/experts_say_wuhan_coronavirus_will_likely_become/fggnkhk/) warning others on multiple subs including [investing subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ex781a/spy_calls_bought_the_dip_wish_me_luck/fg7yei2/), so get off your high horse. \n\n---\n\n&gt;I\u2019m not here to post \u201ci told you so\u201d\n\nIronic, given the preceding paragraph:\n\n&gt;What i\u2019ve posted on r/stocks when i first came here has turned out to be exactly right, and the brutal truth is that if you\u2019d listened to me instead of circlejerking y\u2019all would have got out with only a 10% loss rather than a 30% one (and counting).\n\n---\n\n&gt;Hope you\u2019re having a good investing week.\n\nI'm doing [just fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fae0ph/1510_profits_this_morning_on_spy_puts_time_to_eat/fiy127d/), thanks for the concern.\n\n---",

Called them during a layover and gave them details of where I was staying. Got in late and paid cash to my AirBnB and by 8 am the next morning they had a wire transfered to a nearby WU for enough cash to get me until I could meet up with a new card. They didn\u2019t even charge me a fee (which would have been totally reasonable).\n\nI have no idea if that was standard or some kind of special exemption, but that was probably the most impressive customer service I\u2019ve ever experienced.",

The virulent version transported them to the rear, piled them into hospital ships to cough on everyone. The sailors in the navy spread it everywhere else in the world cause they were trapped on ships where everyone got it. The total reverse of normal.\n\nThat second wave with Spanish Flu being extra deadly was an artifact of the logistics of WW1. No reason to expect it will happen with Wu-flu.",
