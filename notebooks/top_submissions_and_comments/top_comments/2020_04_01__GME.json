        "body": "I'd encourage you to do some research on the USD with respect to major market events. In the 2000s there was around 2.3$ trillion in dollar denominated debts held by foreign nations/institutions/investors. \n\nIn 2019 q3 there was $12.1 trillion in dollar denominated debts held by foreign nations/instutions/investors.\n\nIt should be no surprise to you that the USD is the global reserve currency, but there is literally not enough dollars in the system to support the demand at the moment. I believe this is one reason the FED and Jpow are acting so aggressively, as you correctly noted, the monetary intervention by the feds did save the market from complete destruction, however, it cannot be ignored that their is a massive liquidity crisis within the institutions of the US and from abroad. \n\nIf you look at the repo actions the feds are taking, they are literally taking up anything under the sun as collateral, including making special purpose vehicles to use collateral that they previously were not legally allowed to, for example corporate debt bonds. \n\nHistorically the fed has not had to serve as a repo facility, in fact, before the covid19 crash the fed was trying to completely remove its role in the repo facility. Now its stuck there. Why?\n\n Because no one wants to loan out USD in a time of so much economic fragility, everyone needs USD, traditionally foreign institutions get USD via mercantilism (trade) and the covid19 pandemic just put the kibosh on that, bad news. \n\nSo the fed steps up, realizes their is a massive liquidity crisis and starts pumping out the bullshit memes (BRRRR) that reflect that 99% of this sub actually has no idea how the fed reserve works and what it does. \n\nIf you want to look at some correlated graphs check out the USD dollar strength with respect to corporation profits. You MIGHT notice the trend that when the dollar is STRONG corporate profits are FLAT . The USD has been strong since 14' and corporate profits have also been flat, regardless of the stonks only go up memes, which as im sure you know is because of corporations becoming incredibly leveraged and buying back their own stocks, creating stock evaluations that aren't based in reality but rather on chasing a sugar high. \n\nAnyways,\n\nTLDR; US dollar is in high demand world wide, their ain't enough dollars to meet that demand in the global system so Jpow is trying to print his way out of a hairy situation. Its obviously more nuanced than that but were to stupid to understand it\n\nGME 4/24 2P",

Their last annual earnings report indicated that their total inventory is about 2/3rds of what it usually is.  \n\nWhat does this mean?  They're not carrying as much product (pre-COVID19).  In 2018, they ended their fiscal year with $854M cash+inv.  2019, $1.6B.  2020 - they only have $500M.  It's like they're not even trying.\n\nTotal assets is down 50% from previous year.  In 2018, GME booked $1.3B as goodwill (brand name + buyout of thinkgeek.com) value.  In 2020, they booked $0.  They bought [thinkgeek.com](https://thinkgeek.com) and killed them.  Well, actually Amazon probably killed them.  They thought they were going to sell thinkgeek product in their brick-n-mortar stores.  They appear to have a spike in property and equipment.  Buildings and land remains the same.  Perhaps they are trying to switch their business model to something more cloud-based?  Otherwise, I don't know why they're piling up new property/equipment.\n\nThey haven't managed to reduce their liabilities despite reducing their assets by 50%.  This resulted in a 50% reduction in equity.  Return on equity is -47%.\n\nStock price is half of their book value.  If you bought a controlling interest at current stock price, you would double your money by simply liquidating the company.\n\nThey only thing they have going for them is that they are not in a great deal of debt (yet).",

It would be like buying Tower Records in their last days because Yamaha / Sony / Pioneer / etc... announced that they will be bringing compact discs back in their appliances. As I mentioned in my previous comment - the stock price is selling for less than their book value.  \\*If\\* physical media comes back, right now is fantastic time to buy Gamestop.\n\nHowever, as internet speeds continue to get faster and faster - it becomes so much more convenient for people to just download their games.  It's inevitable - people are going to move away from physical media. \n\nMy guess: Burry is trying to get GME to clean up their financial data and position them for an explosion when they start to pick up business from Sony and Microsofts next gen consoles.  When everybody jumps on that bandwagon - he's going to be the first one to exit.  It's either that - or he's positioning himself to profit from a dissolution.  Sounds like he's pushing them to get #2 (below) in order so #3 can happen.\n\n [https://info.legalzoom.com/article/what-happens-shareholder-dissolved-corporation](https://info.legalzoom.com/article/what-happens-shareholder-dissolved-corporation) \n\n## Voluntary Dissolution\n\nWhen the decision is made to dissolve a corporation voluntarily, all necessary steps must be taken to make the dissolution legally effective. Generally, the corporation needs to take the following steps:\n\n1. File all required dissolution documents required by state law.\n2. Wind down and discontinue all business operations, including payment of all outstanding debts and taxes.\n3. Liquidate any remaining assets, which can then be distributed to shareholders.",
