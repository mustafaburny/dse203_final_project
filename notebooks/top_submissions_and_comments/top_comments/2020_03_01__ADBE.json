Look up Norbert's gambit on how to do  currency conversion for cheap.

VGT is good. If you want to go indexes only, you can put this at 10% of your US allocation\n\n3) My ETF position is small and will increase it as I age and have only room in regular accounts. The biggest advantage of ETFs is you never need to sell them and so don't need to worry about capital tax gains.\n\n4) Stock positions and here are some of my favourites: V, MA, MSFT, APPL, EL, ADBE.\n\nWatch the fees when are buying.

        "body": "Some netural thoughts:\n\nWhile I don't think their stock will go down considerably from here, I think it will under perform the broader market going forward.  You don't have to look far to see this in the oil sector back in 2015.  Many people poured into quality oil names that seemed like great value hoping to generate a quick turnaround.  Most of those names recovered from the bottom to about 75% of their peak before heading south again due to the recent oil price wars in 2020 mixed in with lower demand due to COVID-19.\n\nA good amount of Boeing's stock growth was attributed to the success of the 737 Max orderbook.  When the scandal first broke, the stock traded around $275ish factoring in the fix and discounting the order book.  Now we have the COVID-19 crisis which has crippled the airline and tourism industry as a whole.  This is going to take a while to sort itself out.. and I don't believe Airlines are going to be lining up to fill up order books of airline manufacturers.\n\nWhile I don't think Boeing is going anywhere (it's a critical service and a duopoly), it's a badly managed company in a badly hit industry right now.\n\nI would much rather buy hard-hit tech names than put money into BA right now.\n\nDisclosure:Sold BA, bought EQUIX, ADBE, V and MA.",

I believe there was only one quarter in the past 2 years where they merely met their revenue guidance.\n\nThe bigger concern with Adobe is when will their growth start to slow. Their software is expensive and they can only hike the price so much before businesses start looking for cheaper alternatives. They are trying to branch into other markets, like e-commerce but they have a lot more competition there.\n\nI personally think Adobe needs to create pricing tiers rather than their one program for x dollars or every program for x dollars. They would have a lot more customers if their plans were more flexible and affordable.",

Apple is transitioning to a service based model and I\u2019m not convinced that it goes as well as planned. They have a lot of room to run with AirPods and iPhone sales internationally but will they triple the stock? I\u2019m not sure... maybe a good short term play but idk what to expect beyond the next 3-5 years and think there are better options available.\n\nDisney has too much riding on theme parks and box office numbers for long term growth so I\u2019m not bullish on it. If it was streaming only, I would love the stock but I would be concerned about where the stock would be versus other stocks long term.\n\nI would add Adobe and Shopify as ones to consider and also AMD as a long term play. Each of these in a portfolio with Microsoft could realistically double or triple your money in 5 years or less. The Trade Desk is also performing very well and a great one to buy.",

Right now there are a few Q1 reports coming out today tomorrow, Adobe, Broadcom, not what date range Q1 2020 encompasses (some are showing as q4 2019).\n\nYeah keep things posted here but likely it all depends how the corporations choose to \"word\" their target misses, or use it to cover up or shift on the books somewhere else for a sunny day in the future.",

Like /u/not_unique123, I got in on WYNN puts earlier this week and my position has doubled. \n\nRemember, WYNN, LVS and MGM have properties in Asia and gaming in Macau is down 87%. There have been a number of conventions that have cancelled this week, including Adobe (~20k), Atlassian (~5k), Aruba (14k), NXT (unknow), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (unknown). \n\nThere is an Agriculture convention (https://www.conexpoconagg.com/visit/covid-19-update/) starting in 5 days with 130k attendees. It's still on but who knows, it could cancel at the last minute. They have stated that many of their asian attendees have dropped out and based on the numbers they provided that amounts to about 2500 people. \n\nThese companies will be hit hard especially as the virus spreads through NV. I'm a regular Vegas attendee, going 3-4 times a year, and I cancelled my trip last week. Their earnings for this quarter will be bad. The big question is how quick will they rebound? I've received 5 emails today from MGM properties offering comped nights. This isn't particularly out of the ordinary but price cuts during next quarter and an increase in comps to get more people in the door will certainly affect profits.",
