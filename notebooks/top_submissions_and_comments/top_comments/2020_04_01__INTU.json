I'd be wary of negative surprises like that in this environment.",

For one, every year sees more and more free options for tax software, and the ones that already exist get better. In addition, there is public policy pressure to make tax filing software essentially free for more and more people, which could be doubly the case for 2021 since we are likely to continue to see huge, impactful legislation coming out of Washington. I'd be wary of negative surprises like that in this environment.",
