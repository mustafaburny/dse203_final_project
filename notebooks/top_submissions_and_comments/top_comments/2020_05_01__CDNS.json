        "body": "Cloudflare is like the Shopify of content delivery networks (CDNs) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, offering both solutions at a cheap rate and making them easy to use. These services improve the speed at which your website is served globally by saving versions of the website (caching) across many global checkpoints. Say I have a website that resides on a server in the US. Someone visiting this website from Europe would have to download the contents of the website from the server in the US. With a CDN, there would be a copy of this website at multiple checkpoints in Europe and every other continent , improving the speed at which users can load the website. This distributed network of servers is also used to distribute the load from targeted attacks in traffic to the website that would otherwise overload the server and take it offline. The average user can setup Cloudfront for their personal website.  \nAmazon (AWS) is also competing in this space, with AWS Cloudfront and Shield for CDN and DDoS protection respectively. Amazon is 5-10x the price and quite convoluted to use. You would need a professional to manage your AWS subscription. Same with Google and MSFT Azure",

Interesting article on this, including mentions of execs at LPs buying illegal because of convenience LOL. [https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/04/08/news/ontario-allows-cannabis-stores-offer-delivery-and-pick-black-market-looms](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/04/08/news/ontario-allows-cannabis-stores-offer-delivery-and-pick-black-market-looms)\n\nInterestingly, LPs could in theory apply and set up private distribution as well (I believe this was just wholesale direct to retail...no direct to consumer rec sales). I can't find the exact link right now to the story, but the OCS claims that no LP was able to meet service requirements for private distribution. To my knowledge they haven't disclosed what those standards/requirements are, but lets be honest, we are talking about the distribution of cannabis here, this isn't exactly rocket science.\n\nI've seen comments claiming that the cost for each LP to distribute to individual stores would not be cost effective....True for very small LPs, but for the Big 5 that are moving substantial volumes...I can't imagine how this wouldn't be cost effective. Here's one theoretical example:\n\n\\- Canopy product ships from Smith Falls (1hr drive away from Ottawa). Sells wholesale to OCS and I'm assuming the terms are freight in. Product ships to OCS warehouse in Oakville....Retail in Ottawa purchase wholesale from OCS to ship to store (\\~5 hours drive back to Ottawa)....&gt;6hrs in transit time to deliver to a retail store 1hr away (Obviously, the decrease transit time is not always favourable....e.g Smith Falls to London)\n\n\\- In this example, if Canopy were to sell direct:\n\n* They could cut outbound freight costs (depends on product mix and distribution across the province, but I'm pretty certain any additional cost in outbound freight would be offset by the incremental margin gained....\n* Incremental margin per gram: By shipping direct to retail I'm assuming this would in part circumvent OCSs cut (Anyone know what margin they take per gram?)\n* Easier to optimize inventory mix: Avg. volume per shipment would decline (direct shipments, smaller batches). I'd anticipate that these direct shipments would allow LPs to be more lean.....Decreases time that product idles at OCS warehouses and less reliant on OCS purchasing cadence (It'd be interesting to know how long a gram takes to flow through the OCS supply chain, from PO to LP to delivery to retail).",

        "body": "&gt;Can you explain this? The US industry has been outsourced a lot, how is it industrially powerful?\n\nYes the US produces and licenses several of the most critical technologies around the world. Take semiconductors, the EDA semiconductor design market is controlled by primarily by two American companies Cadence and Synopsys. Without it chips couldn't even be designed. In semiconductor equipment manufacturing USA has KLA Tencor, AM and Lam which are essential to producing chips. This is just one example in the semiconductor industry and the US has several other companies producing high value content and products for the world.\n\nThe US only outsource the low value and admin stuff to developing countries to do as these products are of low Gross Margin or low cost contribution. This makes sense commercially since given future industry is driven by high value industries like high technology manufacturing and digital computing so naturally firms will focus more on . This is also one of the core reason why Trump and China hawks want to fight China as they seek to deny or slow China's ability to domestically produce high value goods such as semiconductors and supercomputers. \n\nIn fact US components are so important that you can even see their impact on companies like Huawei who has stated that it is hard to live without US components. This is why US is industrially powerful. Their products are critical to building modern day technologies and without it it is very hard to live without them.\n\n&gt;It's mostly services, but I don't see how one can say the US doesn't rely on imports with a straight face.\n\nYes but imports to the US are mainly low value products . Low value products have low cost contribution and the main Gross Profit is retained by the firm who outsources the production of the product. US doesn't really rely on imports in the sense that the US does not need to import any high tech products from anywhere as the US has the domestic capability to mass produce high tech goods efficiently.\n\nLook at China they rely on imports to survive. Without semiconductors the Chinese technology space will literally come to a grinding halt. This has been mentioned by Jack Ma before when he was in Japan where he referenced the US control over core technologies like semiconductor. This is why the US does not rely on imports since they are technologically self sufficient.",

It's a big thing in online casinos. You can figure out the seeds and predict every outcome. For that reason, physical  multifactor products that rely on radioactive decay have been around for years.\n\nSo having physical keys is really important to any sort of robust security strategy. But okta is more than that. Identity access management and authentication is huge. There's many stories of people logging into aws accounts and bankrupting former employers. This happens to all kinds of companies in many ways. Especially financial fraud. CFOs have been thrown in prison for identity / financial frauds that have been perpetrated against their companies to the tune of millions.\n\nIdentity management can identify users based on minute details. For example, just how you operate your device. Like the specific cadence that you type your passwords, etc., can help to properly identify you.\n\nSo, I feel like 33x is pretty reasonable compared to much of the tech industry and especially given the opportunity for growth. Mid markets and smbs are lagging but will be adopting security practices that were previously only being adopted by enterprises. However, it will mostly be through MSPs and/or MSSPs.",

CRM\nHowever, not always you buy stocks for their current earnings, you invest in their future earnings, which depends on your confidence in that business to deliver. For this reason the closest to blue chips the stabler p/e tend to be.\nIndustries tend to have comparable p/e, but rarely industries can compare. Tech is notoriously expensive, biotech too, with high p/e.... But this doesn't mean they are bad investments",

So many SaaS models today rely on the $x per user per month model and Microsoft or Google or Facebook or Salesforce come in and offer something almost of the same quality for 20% of the price.\n\n Why should I pay $10 per month per user for Slack or Zoom when Microsoft throws in Teams and Google throws in Meet to their bundle for practically free and pours in tons of cash to continue to improve them? Oh and I get the SSO using Microsoft/Google security included so don't have to spend another $10 per user per month on an Okta login? And so on and so forth.\n\nThere are some awesome software businesses out there but not as many as I would like to see. A hardware + software component or just insurmountable data advantage (like Bloomberg has) would be great but seems like so many of these public companies are very replaceable.",
