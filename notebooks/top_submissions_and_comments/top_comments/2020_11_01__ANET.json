        "body": "Take this with a grain of salt because I\u2019ve only been trading options for a little over a year, but generally speaking if IV, and IV rank more importantly, are up it can be pretty profitable to sell in the direction of movement. You can give yourself a little room by selling OTM for a little less premium if you\u2019re bullish, or you can sell ATM if you\u2019re bearish and looking for a correction. \n\nI\u2019m working with a smaller account so I stick to safer trades and trade OTM spreads with the short strike between .20-.30 delta. I didn\u2019t check the quote, but this kind of move on ANET is the sort of thing I would normally consider as a potential trade, if the volume is there.",

Gates's mom served on a charitable board with the CEO of IBM; they were more associates than friends, and that wouldn't have helped Gates at all if he hadn't already, you know, founded MS. \n\nElon's family didn't own an emerald mine, and he was $100k in debt when he graduated college. \n\nMeritocracy just means that merit - mostly in the sense of skills - is rewarded. It doesn't mean that everyone necessarily has an equal chance. \n\nIf a company needs and engineer and I have an engineering degree, and you don't - maybe because you had an abusive family growing up wit a father in prison and so never graduated from HS, the company is hiring me *on merit*. I'm an engineer; you're not; you can't do the job. \n\nThis doesn't mean that if our lives were switched at age 3 I would have done any better; that's just a separate question from meritocracy. \n\nI mean, if a company needs someone who speaks French, and my wealthy family summered in France every year and sent me there one a gap year and then on a junior year abroad...while you took French in HS...merit means I get the job *even though* I was only able to obtain my qualifications because my family was rich enough to keep sending me to France. \n\nBut the company isn't hiring me because of who I am, but because of what I can do, and that I can do it better than you can.",

First, comparison to the Leidos, CACI, BAH, IBM, HPE etc. of the government consulting world. They too employ a lot of talent. What is the difference with PLTR? Second, government consulting is often a \"customer intimate\" model, not quality leadership. Govt says it wants high tech, but they often buy those companies who understand them most. Which model is PLTR using? Why will PLTR succeed in Govt? Is it primarily IC?\n\nThird, if PLTR has silicon valley magic in it, then why is the commercial business not taking off? If you have a superior value proposition, that will be reflected in high margins and a kind of inevitability of customers who are drawn to your products. A weakness there would make me pause.",

Standard Oil in the early 1900s, IBM when mainframes were everything. Capital is so cheap right now that it's easy for startups to get funds. It may not seem like it but consumers will switch for better products or ways of doing things. Brands don't last forever and companies become more and more difficult to manage as their size increases.\n\nAlso don't forget the world is much bigger than just the US. China and other large developed countries are full of brilliant people, lots of access to capital. How long until Alibaba has boots on the ground in USA and starts aggressively pressuring Amazon?\n\nMy guess is that eventually the government will put a stop to big tech simply buying out their competitors.

        "body": "So the other response summed it up pretty well, but left one other important factor out. The importance of Intel's architecture is fading. It will always be around of course, but anyone that doesn't think ARM is going to keep getting a larger and larger bite of the pie isn't paying attention. Apple will give everyone permission to target software for ARM architecture and we'll soon see a second attempt from Microsoft. Again, we'll always have applications for Intel, but it won't be nearly as dominant. Intel's production woes over the past half decade are well documented, and it's clear that they are about as well run as Boeing these days. The problem for Intel is that they face much more fierce competition than Boeing. Intel will survive of course, but they'll be a shell of their former self, and they'll have fumbled their flagship products and missed the boat on the areas of the industry that are sure to see rapid growth. I understand that people want to target value, but Intel is priced the way they are for good reason. If you're looking for value in Intel then I have some IBM stock to sell you as well.",

Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money. Seagate was dismissed in 1997, sue again and paid [$45 M to R+ as late as 2000](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/seagate-to-pay-rodime-45m-to-settle-suit-2000-01/).   R+ only exists as a shell company and its share price soared on news of the patent settlement.

Gates's mom served on a charitable board with the CEO of IBM; they were more associates than friends, and that wouldn't have helped Gates at all if he hadn't already, you know, founded MS. \n\nElon's family didn't own an emerald mine, and he was $100k in debt when he graduated college. \n\nMeritocracy just means that merit - mostly in the sense of skills - is rewarded. It doesn't mean that everyone necessarily has an equal chance. \n\nIf a company needs and engineer and I have an engineering degree, and you don't - maybe because you had an abusive family growing up wit a father in prison and so never graduated from HS, the company is hiring me *on merit*. I'm an engineer; you're not; you can't do the job. \n\nThis doesn't mean that if our lives were switched at age 3 I would have done any better; that's just a separate question from meritocracy. \n\nI mean, if a company needs someone who speaks French, and my wealthy family summered in France every year and sent me there one a gap year and then on a junior year abroad...while you took French in HS...merit means I get the job *even though* I was only able to obtain my qualifications because my family was rich enough to keep sending me to France. \n\nBut the company isn't hiring me because of who I am, but because of what I can do, and that I can do it better than you can.",

First, comparison to the Leidos, CACI, BAH, IBM, HPE etc. of the government consulting world. They too employ a lot of talent. What is the difference with PLTR? Second, government consulting is often a \"customer intimate\" model, not quality leadership. Govt says it wants high tech, but they often buy those companies who understand them most. Which model is PLTR using? Why will PLTR succeed in Govt? Is it primarily IC?\n\nThird, if PLTR has silicon valley magic in it, then why is the commercial business not taking off? If you have a superior value proposition, that will be reflected in high margins and a kind of inevitability of customers who are drawn to your products. A weakness there would make me pause.",

Standard Oil in the early 1900s, IBM when mainframes were everything. Capital is so cheap right now that it's easy for startups to get funds. It may not seem like it but consumers will switch for better products or ways of doing things. Brands don't last forever and companies become more and more difficult to manage as their size increases.\n\nAlso don't forget the world is much bigger than just the US. China and other large developed countries are full of brilliant people, lots of access to capital. How long until Alibaba has boots on the ground in USA and starts aggressively pressuring Amazon?\n\nMy guess is that eventually the government will put a stop to big tech simply buying out their competitors.

        "body": "So the other response summed it up pretty well, but left one other important factor out. The importance of Intel's architecture is fading. It will always be around of course, but anyone that doesn't think ARM is going to keep getting a larger and larger bite of the pie isn't paying attention. Apple will give everyone permission to target software for ARM architecture and we'll soon see a second attempt from Microsoft. Again, we'll always have applications for Intel, but it won't be nearly as dominant. Intel's production woes over the past half decade are well documented, and it's clear that they are about as well run as Boeing these days. The problem for Intel is that they face much more fierce competition than Boeing. Intel will survive of course, but they'll be a shell of their former self, and they'll have fumbled their flagship products and missed the boat on the areas of the industry that are sure to see rapid growth. I understand that people want to target value, but Intel is priced the way they are for good reason. If you're looking for value in Intel then I have some IBM stock to sell you as well.",

So I will be around so long there are investors willing to keep the company running.\n\nAs for the eV controversial giant, this is not quite finished. Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money. Seagate was dismissed in 1997, sue again and paid [$45 M to R+ as late as 2000](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/seagate-to-pay-rodime-45m-to-settle-suit-2000-01/).   R+ only exists as a shell company and its share price soared on news of the patent settlement.  I think **NKLA** can remain as a shell company with its patent portfolio covering designs that covers most vehicles built electric or not. [It sue Tsla earlier](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/04/20/teslas-effort-to-short-circuit-nikola-lawsuit-fizzles-as-patent-office-denies-door-argument/?sh=44dc21a45d78).

More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",

These include borderless transfer without needing to convert to to local currency (cant do this with Western Union), black markets, safe haven from oppressive governments, sending aid to citizens of oppressive governments, ways to bypass import sanctions (see Iran), and more.

I agree cryptocurrency and blockchains are useful but I don't see Bitcoin as a long term store of value. It's far more volatile than precious metals and also intangible.\n\nIBM is making huge strides towards quantum computing, and once they pull it off, Bitcoin will become worthless once the public/private key cryptography is cracked and anyone with access to a quantum computer can simply sign transactions to send coins to themselves. We're easily within 10 years at this point, possibly less.\n\n&gt;This is like saying anyone can create a better social network than Facebook and therefore Facebook has no value\n\nWhat about Myspace?
