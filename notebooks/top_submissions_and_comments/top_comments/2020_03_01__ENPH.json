However, I do believe that CSOD will see better in growth in this arena than others (not necessarily Citrix, whatabeast, long after earnings again). \n\nI do agree this is a short term play, I am intending on jumping out when my risk tolerance hits. Hopefully this play is smart and makes a fair percentage, and I believe it will. It's nice to catch a stock before it's bull-run and I really think this has potential to do that. I am likely going to split my investment into stocks (2.5k) and slowly ease into more calls (5k total, 1.5k now) if the trend is correct. For what it is worth, this following research has given me more belief that a solid recovery is about to occur.\n\n&gt; Saba acquisition has provided additional insights on improving operational efficiency, which is driving further operating margin improvement. \n\n&gt; Saba acqusition will not be a full tax-payer until 2023\n\n&gt; They believe that the Saba acquisition will cause their standalone unlevered free cash flow to be meaningfully higher than current estimations ($150M)\n\n&gt; AWS credits that were modeled as expenses\n\n&gt; Certain 2019 Capital expenditures will not be present in 2020\n\n&gt; \"And we did see some signs of good momentum going into 2020 for Japan. But I'd say APJ was mixed because of Japan's performance.\"\n\n&gt; \"we do have a plan to hit the rule of 40 in 2020 on a standalone basis and we expect to significantly exceed our original cash flow target, which was $150 million. If you recall a couple of years ago, we laid that out we expect to be meaningfully above that\"\n\n&gt; Literally they hired, AlixPartners, a world-class consulting firm with particular expertise in performance improvement and cost optimization.\n\n&gt; its Q1 subscription revenue guidance calls for 10.5% y/y growth, which means that Cornerstone is planning for roughly 30% margins in 2020 (was 10% or something)\n\n&gt; most of Cornerstone's annual revenue is already locked in\n\n&gt; consolidated 2019 results suggest Saba will net roughly $250 million in annual subscription revenue for the company. Saba is also expected to \"substantially increase unlevered free cash flow\".\n\n&gt; Saba will at least increase market share in their respective markets.\n\nWell I at least should be critical, and these are some concerns:\n\n&gt; They are taking on a huge $985 million term loan to finance the deal.\n\n&gt;layoffs that are happening across the U.S. will lower Cornerstone's billings, which could lead to a lower subscription rate given their pricing schema\n\nHowever, I really believe that investors will take note when they see the free-cash flow they are generating, their improved operational margins combined with an un-modeled acquisition that represents 33% of their current revenue.\n\nMy prediction until earnings is this: $CSOD will retest $32.50 sometime by May 1. I think it lingers around $31.50-$32.50 until just before earnings where it breaks to the upside at $33.50. If earnings are a hit, maybe we see upward of $35-$37.",

Currently work for a security startup, so take my advice with a grain of salt.\n\nI would stay away from the ETFs right now. I don\u2019t think they provide a lot of value over something more generic, and I believe there will be a contraction in cyber security. Winners will win but overall it\u2019ll drop.\n\nA few reasons why: \n\nPre covid19- big vendors like Microsoft and AWS were already doing great adding security tooling to their enterprise IT offerings.\n\nTraditional AV... what consumer would buy that in a world of smartphones, tablets, and PCs that come with Defender?\n\nNetwork security gear is threatened by cloud vendors.\n\nMany security tools aren\u2019t made for modern development and IT management practices. A lot of old crap was made in the days where security teams could and would just say \u201cno you can\u2019t do that\u201d.\n\nA lot of old companies in cyber ETF fit that bill.\n\n**During** covid-19, I think a lot of companies will spend on remote work (Citrix, VPNs, Zoom, cloud services) - some of which actually benefits traditional security vendors.\n\n**Post** covid-19, I think many will try to have a GOOD remote work environment, and favor cloud based solutions, zero-trust setups with reverse proxies instead of VPNs, etc. Cisco did a good job buying Duo there, it bridges their gap between old and new. ZScaler has a huge valuation because it fit the description for that kind of modern tool to investors.\n\nThe next year will be interesting. I expect more consolidations l, acquisitions, and tamer VC funding and hopefully valuations that are more logical.\n\nTL;DR I wouldn\u2019t touch ETFs because I don\u2019t much of a lot of companies in them but there\u2019s going to be some change that\u2019ll open up the market to those innovating for real (few of which are publicly traded - but there\u2019s some).",

Had like 5-6 stock's, gaining some one digit greens. \n\nAnd then I went full retard mode. I watched some daytrading YouTubers, I almost felt the thousand of dollars waiting for me to pick them up. I thought I know some tech analysis strategies, I thought I can time the market and I thought speculating is the way to go. \n\nIt wasn't. I lost 30%. Sort of depressing. I withdrew my money and waited until the feeling I need to get this back quickly is gone. \n\nWithout being emotional I went back to the market and started my initial process. And stayed there. And making money again. Not much, but making it. \n\nThe thing is once you have a strategy and even if it does work out in some cases- you can make a root cause analysis. And see what was wrong. When you gamble - there is no process behind this. Noting to review. You can't review bad luck... \n\nMy portoflio now looks as follows:\n\nLow risk: MSFT /JNJ / PHG\nMid risk: Netflix / Roku / Citrix / SAP / 3M / Biogen\nHigh risk: Tesla / Inseego\n\nI'm not very active, but also I cut loses quickly not wishing for a recovery. Sometimes good choice , sometimes bad.

I might be very wrong like I've been many times. \n\nI think the market now has established the winners, companies doing ok and those who are majorly affected. That's sort of a stabilization in this time. We know who is who. Who's naked and who's well dressed up. \n\nWhile im sure Airlines, Cruises, Entertainment will keep getting smashed, on the other side companies like MSFT, NFLX or Citrix should do very well. \n\nSome of them will be corrected. Like Netflix - this stock will be corrected. Rather later then sooner, but will get a hit. \n\nMSFT? Not so much I think. Theyr AzureClouding and work from home systems are market leaders. \n\nI would not buy BA, MGM or Bank stocks. \n\nI agree 200% on:\n\n[...] we haven\u2019t seen the downstream effect on real demand yet. Even amazon is reporting an earnings miss\n\n\nAmazon is a very interesting case. While the demand on many products should make the company sales go down, on the other hand - if you think online shopping, Amazon pops up immediately. And this situation will speed up the online...ization of the world. \n\nI dont see a major S&amp;P correction due to the leaders pushing this train, but some stocks will be slaughtered. For sure\n\n\nI think mate we are actually on a similar page, just a different point of view and expression.",

I think we will some corrections soon there. \n\nNetflix is one of the stocks I think its gonna be corrected, but not before ER. I'm actually holding Netflix stock and ready to sell as soon as its starts getting corrected. \n\nOracle- yeah pretty safe. If you plan to buy this week for short term - go with Citrix. They are having ER this week. Should rise even if it doesn't beat expectations as the outlook looks good. \n\nIdk about IBM. Haven't analysed them recently as since 2016 they were on a decline. They might be back on corona, but didn't hear anything great from them recently. Deeper analysis recommended.",

This could be a run-up play, or it could continue going up past earnings. $CSOD is barely above its lows from the crash and is in a pretty good position to start its bull run. I think one of the biggest things investors are looking for in $CSOD is free cash flow, and according to the CEO:\n\n&gt; we now believe our standalone unlevered free cash flow will be meaningfully higher than that.\n\nI even think this \"meaningfully higher\" comment, is even higher. This quote comes from before March where we learned that their activity stats are through the roof. Their subscriptions have likely gone up, which means their free cash flow has probably grown significantly. This signals to investors a place to safely park investments.",
