Other than that, couple partners of theirs and a few other various ones, anything that's not ENPH I just want to diversify across the renewable energy sector.\n\nIf JKS somehow drops again (doubt it), buying more of them to wait for China to get around to realizing clean air is nice.\n\nAlso your username is kinda freaking me out lol",
