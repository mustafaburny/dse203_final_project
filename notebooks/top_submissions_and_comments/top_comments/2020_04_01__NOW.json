        "body": "I'm just gonna jump in here because it isn't the first time I've seen \"short squeeze\" seemingly used incorrectly and I feel like maybe some of you don't really understand what it is. The chart we are seeing now cannot be a short squeeze nor can it be a \"short squeeze in reverse\".\n\nShorting a stock means you're borrowing shares from your broker and selling them to someone at the current price. The idea being that you think the price will go down and then you can buy them back at a lower price. So if you short XYZ today at $100/share and buy them back tomorrow at $90/share, you've made $10/share. If, on the other hand, the stock goes up to $110, you've lost $10/share.\n\nNow the tricky thing about shorting a stock is that there is no limit to the upside (of the stock price). When you buy a stock, the maximum you can lose is 100%. You buy it at $100 and it goes to zero, you've lost $100/share and can't lose more. That's it. But if you short a stock, your losses are theoretically unlimited. If you shorted TSLA at $300 you'd be in a world of pain when it hit $950 because that means your losses are $650/share at that point. Your downside (on the trade) is unlimited but your upside is limited to 100% (and that's if the shares go to zero).\n\nFor these reasons, you don't want to short a stock and hold on to it forever like you might if you were long. The pain of holding onto it as the losses mount become too much to bear, but also because you don't have an unlimited amount of money in your account. At some point, you will be FORCED to buy back the stock before the losses outstrip your funds.\n\nSo a short squeeze occurs after a stock has run up considerably and reaches a point where everyone who has shorted the stock is essentially forced to buy it back before it goes too high. At this point, you'll see a huge spike on top of a run up.\n\nThere is no real opposite to a short squeeze because when you hold stocks long, your max loss is 100% and no one is ever forced to sell. You can just hold on until zero. In real life, however, you will often reach a point where people just don't want to lose more money and get out anyway. When everyone is running for the exits and sells their stock at the same time, you'll see a huge downward spike after a run down. This is usually called capitulation and often signals a reversal to an uptrend.",

Hence the massive pop in reserves.\n\n- Key difference between old GAAP and new GAAP is that you must now estimate the lifetime expected credit loss for your loans adjusted for forecasted conditions\n\n- They're likely using a multi scenario weighted model and would have shifted the weightings to reflect the COVID environment; think something like 80-10-10 of most stressed economic environment:moderate stressed economic environment:baseline\n\n- Subsequent Q's won't see as big an income statement impact as the delta between prior Q provision (officially Allowance for Credit Losses) and current Q provision shouldn't be as vast.\n\n- You effectively had a black swan event for this adoption where 1/1/20 (it's effective date), you wouldn't have weighted a stressed economic environment as heavily (if at all, we nearly had the tip in 30,000 DJI almost as recently as Feb), versus 3/31/20 the remeasurement date where you have to account for, well virtually total cessation of normal economic activity.\n\nSo when they speak to building reserves (FASB will have a conniption at that language btw), they've assessed their entire portfolio for lifetime expected credit loss. You see the numbers pop particularly in cards, which are unsecured and your loss given default would to all intents and purposes be 100% vs mortgage loans where you've collateral.\n\nAlso important to bear in mind that since ~2018 the bigger lenders have been keeping higher quality mortgage loans on the books (basically they aren't selling top quality 800 FICO stuff to FNMA FMCC much if at all).\n\nJPM are very well placed to weather this, as they were in 2008. It's a well run shop under Daddy Dimon.\n\n**TL;DR: Watch out for the banks who elect to defer CECL implementation because it likely meant their models adjusted for COVID gave them numbers they didn't want to push through Q1 earnings**\n\n**TL;DR of the TL;DR = Accounting rules fucked EPS in the ass but it shouldn't be as volatile going forward**",

And I thought, \"fuck, I have a few extra hundred bucks. Let me buy some stonk and in a few years, I'll have a few extra hundies to spend.\" Not playing big, just a little fun investment. They were trading at 50-54 bucks. At the height of the wii it was twice that, and in early days there were stories about Switches outselling the wii, so I thought, \"fuck yeah let's do this.\" \n\nAnd I watched that stock price go from 50-54 to 30 over the course of several months. And I thought, \"Well fuck. I guess I'll just hold and wait this out. \n\nThen I found r/wallstreetbets. And all you gay bears. And autists were making truckloads on puts. Puts puts puts. Huge payback. *Ridiculous* puts. Spy 180 puts that they bought OTM and sold *slightly less OTM* for like 100% gainz. And I thought, \"I'd like me some tendies\" and people said \"This market will go down more.\" And my NTDOY stonk was trading at like 35 bucks or so so I thought \"fuk it, let's sell that shit, cause all its done is hover down there for years now, and let me buy some putz for a quick lil turnaround.\" \n\nAnd so I did. SPY220p 4/17. And the day after SPY went from like 250 to 270 and I thought 'fuk it diamond hands.' And then it kept on going up and it kept on going up, and I kept waiting, I kept seeing, \"No, no, this can't hold, there's too much bad news!\" Brrrrr brrrrr motha fucka kept on going up. \n\nAnd now it's worthless and Nintendo is trading back at $54.",

I went into the trade with an 80 percent probability of success, and got out for a nice ~13 percent gain overnight.\n\nI usually don't open new trades in the first 30 or so minutes of the trading day, but market internals ($ADD, $TICK, and $VOLD) looked very strong so I decided to get long SPY JUN 281 calls. I let those ride until we hit the /ES 2835 loaf pivot and $ADD began to decline, then sold next week's 275 calls against my 281 calls so I could have some downside delta on and make money if the market declined. That trade also protected my profits on the long calls and allowed me to sell some premium to the suckers here and on /r/wallstreetbets who love overpaying for single leg options.\n\nThis morning TSLA also hit a 61% fib retracement from the FEB high to the MAR low, and I thought I'd try getting short with a put diagonal. I bought the JUN 735 contract and sold next week's 710.\n\nI also got short DKS on the pop this morning with JUN 26 calls, and am going to let that run for now. I'll probably hedge it off with another diagonal before the end of the day.\n\nI also have a long call diagonal with AUY, long the JAN 4.5 call and short the MAY 5 call. If for some reason I could only do passive investing, I'd be looking closely at miners over the next year.\n\nFinally, I have a couple of puts short AOBC for fun / speculation. \n\nThose trades have left me with SPY portfolio beta-weighted deltas at -270, which means I can expect to make $270 if SPY falls by $1. It also means I can expect to lose about $270 if SPY goes up $1. By the end of the day I'll look to trim that back to something closer to -100 so that I'm not leaning too short. \n\nCurrently, my theta is around 500, meaning I can expect to collect about $500 per day on my short options.\n\nEDIT: And, downvoted. That's okay hive mind, keep it coming. My trading accounts are denoted in USD and not fake internet points. And they're up handsomely YTD.",
