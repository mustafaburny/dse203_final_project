So it's like a dividend in a way or a shares buyback. https://www.trustnodes.com/2021/11/15/nearly-one-million-eth-burned \n\nOwning eth entitles you to the revenue generated by the network that you get through this burning mechanism, or if you stake then you get interest. So owning eth means you're basically owning part of the ethereum network which isn't much different from an investment perspective than having equity ownership in a company.",

I recently opened a position into WU, due to its very cheap valuation trading below historic PEs and has an amazing dividend.
