You probably don\u2019t need it nor care much but just thought I\u2019d share.    JKHY is a stock we are all currently holding.   Earnings are on 2/2 I believe.",

For example, I bought 5 JKHY 125C that expire 02/19 for $22 each today. This costs me 22x5x100=11,000. If the stock goes below 125 on expiration date my calls will be worthless, if the stock goes above 147 I will make money. I kinda like short dated ITM calls as the premium cost is often little to none.\n\nI think people should use options, just never put your entire portfolio towards them. If you're always gambling 100% of your portfolio it only takes one slip up to lose a good chunk.",
