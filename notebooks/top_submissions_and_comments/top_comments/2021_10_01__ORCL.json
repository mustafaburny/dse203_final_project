They are pre-spinoff and you won't receive share in their spin off company. \n\nI'd like to sarcastic ally respond - Yeah, all old bluechips from the 90s are going to 0. Just look at Microsoft. VISA. Cisco. Oracle. \n\nWhat operating systems do majority of servers run? It's not windows, or iOS, or android. It's Linux. And the best one is redhat. It can run on and interface with any of the cloud providers securely. It's a platform to switch between any cloud provider easier than conforming to each cloud setup separately. \n\nWhat company makes the best server to process transactions for credit cards, banks, large retailers and service companies? Ibm, their processors are purpose built. Some like banks, hospitals, insurers are require by law to run their own data transaction systems. Their 7nm power 10 / telum processors can handle more work load any one else. Amd and Intel chip followers take note of ibm's CPU architecture. Specifically their cash system that result in much lower latency and cash pools in the size of gigabytes, also shared memory pools in terabytes. \n\nThey came up with the 2nm and lower transistor process for chips. They led in creating a programming language for quantum computing. They set a world record in data storage solution with their 580 terabyte tape units. Not worth listing all the little things they do. \n\nTheir new CEO is outspoken about collaboration and getting ibm out from being a siloed company. I am sure they will find the right partners for their tech. He switched the company over to Salesforce and slack and such. Deepens partnerships with companies like SAP and others. Increasing consulting business. IBM was also early in jumping in and providing lots of online open courses with100s of thousands taking part across the world. \n\nIBMs role might be niche and you might not understand them. But, it doesn't mean they are not relevant globally. $75B in revenues.",

        "body": "IBM made some huge errors. Initially IBM did not believe in the PC revolution nor did they want to cannibalize their high revenue mainframe business, so they did not bother developing PCs. Once Apple took off they realized their mistake and wanted to quickly rush a PC to market. They quickly made the hardware but needed an operating system. Instead of developing their own they looked to hire an outsider to do it since that would be faster. They entered into an agreement with Microsoft that allowed Microsoft to retain the rights of the operating system.  This initially seemed fine since IBM dominated hardware, so they did not anticipate what would come next: dozens of competitors rip apart IBM personal computers, reverse engineer them, and then build their own IBM PC clones. The competitors sell the clones for a fraction of the cost of the IBM computer and take away huge market share. Meanwhile Microsoft is laughing their way to the bank as they own the rights to the operating system and make money regardless of who the hardware provider is. \n\nIBM realizes that they need to lower the cost of their products to compete in the marketplace so they look to cut costs. They cut back significantly on hiring. So where do all the top engineers go to? Not IBM but other tech companies like Microsoft and Oracle (and eventually Google, Facebook, etc).\n\n\nSo essentially they had no moat, and stopped hiring talent. Today\u2019s tech giants are constantly hiring and spending insane amounts on R&amp;D. The second they stop is when you should get worried.",

Earnings growth will be a bit harder as companies will have some really hard comps and market multiples come in a little.\n\nThis. And I've made the argument before, the only reason we were able to successfully raise interest rates in the 80s is because an entirely new industry (tech) came online and fueled the growth of the US (and world) economy for the next 35 years. Seriously think about this:\n\n- Volcker jacks rates up to 16-20% from March 1980 to May 1981. This stops inflation, but causes a recession that is one of the contributing factors to Carter losing his reelection bid.\n\n- Apple IPO is December of 1980. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\n- Microsoft IPO is March of 1986. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nAnd those are just the biggest. We also had companies like Intel, Oracle, Cisco, Dell, and others coming online in the 70s and 80s. And then that led right into the 90s and 00s with Google and Amazon, followed by Facebook, etc.\n\nAll of this to say, if the fed raises interest rates drastically, it's going to lead to a recession. And unless we have some industry that is going to lead the way forward for the next 30 years of economic expansion, I don't see how the fed will be able to stand their ground before dropping rates again. Maybe clean energy or biotech could do it, but I don't think we have enough momentum in either of those sectors right now to sustain us through a recession like tech did.",

Long term contracts being acquired due to the ability for $TRTN to leverage the situation against their customers. They also recycle their storage containers by melting it into steel and selling it, so with record high steel prices as well, whew\u2026 So we got good guidance &amp; record profits which might lead to this outcome. At the very least, I suspect it will hit $60 again which is more than enough tendies for me to walk away with happy.\n\nPositions:\n75x 11/19 $60c\n125x 12/19 $60c",

What's up with logistics only having 3 players, and UPS being the outright monopoly? Seems like a huge opportunity for Uber and Doordash to make a name for themselves in on-demand delivery.\n3. It's funny how the first US bank appears at #62. Just shows that people aren't loyal to their banks, they only use them because they're locked in or it's convention. Makes me even more bullish on Square and Paypal. \n4. Why did they classify Google as a media/entertainment company? Either way, the Facebook brand is super strong, despite all the hate it receives on Reddit. \n5. I'm impressed that Zoom and AMD made the list. I expect in the future they will overtake Oracle, Salesforce, Cisco etc in terms of brand recognition and loyalty.",

Similar revenues to say an Asana. asanas mkt cap is 20B where Zuo is barely 2.5B. The two things that\u2019s been holdin Zuo back is they were heavy on services revenue after the ipo and their % of growth q/q has slowed since then as well. \n\nLiking everything I\u2019m seeing though. They\u2019ve improved their product offering, reduced churn, and are transitioning services work to partners as they focus on subscription revenue. \n\nThis stock will either take off in the next couple of quarters or it\u2019ll get gobbled up by a private equity firm.

IBM is 36% institutional and 19% mutual fund owned, with the biggest institutional investors being Vanguard, Blackrock, State Street, Geode, Schwab, Morgan Stanley, NY Mellon, BofA, JP Morgan.\n\nThey have significant positives too, for example they have much higher quality engineering staff than most tech companies could hire if they tried. Some of the most difficult to hire skilled workers are happy to have a chance to work there. They have a lot of experience working with industry, and they treat their customers a lot better than Oracle or Alphabet. They're an industry giant that did decline, so of course they have the challenges you mention, but that experience isn't entirely a negative thing.\n\n&gt; There is reason to buy IBM\n\nNow you're just trolling.",
