        "body": "IBM made some huge errors. Initially IBM did not believe in the PC revolution nor did they want to cannibalize their high revenue mainframe business, so they did not bother developing PCs. Once Apple took off they realized their mistake and wanted to quickly rush a PC to market. They quickly made the hardware but needed an operating system. Instead of developing their own they looked to hire an outsider to do it since that would be faster. They entered into an agreement with Microsoft that allowed Microsoft to retain the rights of the operating system.  This initially seemed fine since IBM dominated hardware, so they did not anticipate what would come next: dozens of competitors rip apart IBM personal computers, reverse engineer them, and then build their own IBM PC clones. The competitors sell the clones for a fraction of the cost of the IBM computer and take away huge market share. Meanwhile Microsoft is laughing their way to the bank as they own the rights to the operating system and make money regardless of who the hardware provider is. \n\nIBM realizes that they need to lower the cost of their products to compete in the marketplace so they look to cut costs. They cut back significantly on hiring. So where do all the top engineers go to? Not IBM but other tech companies like Microsoft and Oracle (and eventually Google, Facebook, etc).\n\n\nSo essentially they had no moat, and stopped hiring talent. Today\u2019s tech giants are constantly hiring and spending insane amounts on R&amp;D. The second they stop is when you should get worried.",

        "body": "&gt; The most likely scenario is we see 3 to 4% inflation next year as the fed tapers and then we are back to dealing with low growth after all the demand pull forward we have seen and people accumulate debt over the next year and feel poorer. Earnings growth will be a bit harder as companies will have some really hard comps and market multiples come in a little.\n\nThis. And I've made the argument before, the only reason we were able to successfully raise interest rates in the 80s is because an entirely new industry (tech) came online and fueled the growth of the US (and world) economy for the next 35 years. Seriously think about this:\n\n- Volcker jacks rates up to 16-20% from March 1980 to May 1981. This stops inflation, but causes a recession that is one of the contributing factors to Carter losing his reelection bid.\n\n- Apple IPO is December of 1980. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\n- Microsoft IPO is March of 1986. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nAnd those are just the biggest. We also had companies like Intel, Oracle, Cisco, Dell, and others coming online in the 70s and 80s. And then that led right into the 90s and 00s with Google and Amazon, followed by Facebook, etc.\n\nAll of this to say, if the fed raises interest rates drastically, it's going to lead to a recession. And unless we have some industry that is going to lead the way forward for the next 30 years of economic expansion, I don't see how the fed will be able to stand their ground before dropping rates again. Maybe clean energy or biotech could do it, but I don't think we have enough momentum in either of those sectors right now to sustain us through a recession like tech did.",

The two things that\u2019s been holdin Zuo back is they were heavy on services revenue after the ipo and their % of growth q/q has slowed since then as well. \n\nLiking everything I\u2019m seeing though. They\u2019ve improved their product offering, reduced churn, and are transitioning services work to partners as they focus on subscription revenue. \n\nThis stock will either take off in the next couple of quarters or it\u2019ll get gobbled up by a private equity firm.

        "body": "PLTR has the better long term growth case. They're addressing the biggest issues of machine learning, which is security and data wrangling. Most consultants will say they need months to look through data and sanitize it before they can do meaningful data science work; PLTR can do it in a week with their internal tools. They also offer data-driven digital twin simulations of entire supply chains. Doesn't that sound handy during a global supply chain crisis?! Businesses can ask questions like \"what if China's output goes down 80% in September from black outs\", \"what if shipping through LA is delayed by 4 weeks\" and get impacts on delivery time and dollar amounts. Once companies start using these tools, they will never leave, until there's a competitor, which doesn't really exist in the space. \n\nThey are successfully growing their corporate client base and the percent of revenues from the government is going down, while they're getting more money from governments. The draw back is that the stock is expensive, but don't be surprised if this company grows to be worth hundreds of billions. Very bullish investors are predicting this will be as big as IBM, Oracle, Microsoft or Salesforce. They sell very valuable business tools that scale incredibly well and capture long term contracts. Retail investors think AMD is better because they see the CPU in their computer and think it's an in-demand product. \n\nAMD is fab-less and they're already experiencing scaling problems. They're competing with NVidia, Amazon, Apple, Msft and now Intel for manufacturing resources. So they might have a better chip, but if they have production bottlenecks, how do they keep growing fast? Amazon makes so much money on AWS because their customers pay more for on-demand resources. AMD has to bid against 5 companies are that are many times larger than them to get their chips made, which should be scary to investors. People think Intel is going down because Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are making their own chips, but nobody is thinking this will affect AMD for some reason... Where exactly do people think these chips are coming from?\n\nAMD is far better priced than PLTR (AMD is fairly priced now), but they have strong global competitors and a fickle market that will flock back to Intel in 2 years if they offer a performance advantage. The good news for them is a couple more years of supply shortages and intense future demand for processors",

You can decide every move Burry makes is genius and based on solid data, but reality is, he never once posted any real thesis beyond this  for why it should go down.\n\nIn fact in the beginning of March, he tweeted:\n\n\"$TSLA below $100/share by later this year will not crash the system. There is no reflexivity in such a fall. But it would trigger the end of an era for a certain type of investing.\"\n\nSeems to me that is an opinion as was stated here that TSLA's value is as a \"meme\" stock and he is not considering that investors really believe in the future growth of TSLA.\n\nSeems you are desperately looking for confirmation for your bias that TSLA is not a good investment and you have chosen the autist oracle to hang your hat on. Hey, Michael Burry is a great investor, but with TSLA, he has never once articulated anything more substantial than what I have said over here. I disagree with what he has said. If he has more depth to his short position, then let him share it. Or, perhaps, as recently suggested, his short position was actually quite small and was just some gambling by him and not something he did with real confidence, which would perhaps show that he himself was not that convinced with his own analysis.",

        "body": "I did ok doing something like this, this summer during earnings. There are a few helpful pointers. \n\n1. 0 DTE is a bad idea. I will usually buy a month or two out. It\u2019s more expensive, but if the stock has had a big run up to earnings, there\u2019s a great chance it\u2019ll dump after earnings. If the run up was justified, it\u2019ll keep going. Generally,  a 5% underlying change is all that\u2019s needed if you purchased the right options.\n\n2. ALWAYS buy ATM the afternoon prior to earnings (if earnings will be during PM) or around 3 PM the day of (if it\u2019s an AH report). You really want to be as close as possible to ATM on both trades. If you have a $150 strike and a $155 strike, and the underlying is at $152.50, it\u2019s not a smart play. If the underlying moves in either direction by the last trade, it will create an imbalance on your straddle, and the IV gets lopsided. This is where I\u2019ve screwed up the most. If an ATM opportunity presents itself, take it. \n\n3. If your order on the call goes through, but the put doesn\u2019t, and the underlying moves from $152.50 to $155 in the interim. Buy the ATM put at $155 if you want to maintain the same balance. The idea is that you pay as close to possible to the exact same amount on the call as you do the put. This works the other way around too if the price drops.\n\n4. Buying a month or two out gives the underlying the opportunity to swing back in the direction of the sacrificial option. I straddled Nike at precisely $155 with December options during its last earnings. It dropped to $147 at one point and I made 30-40% on the put. Then I held onto the call which had lost a lot of money. The stock as now recovered, and I\u2019m even up on the call now. The entire play, I\u2019m up around 60%.\n\n5. Look for the companies with a dividend a month after earnings. I like Oracle for this. I bought the $90 straddle after last earnings. I believe they were November expiration. The price dropped after earnings and I collected on the puts about 30%. Then I hung on to the decimated calls for a month because the dividend was coming. As predicted, people piled into the stock for the dividend and it subsequently ran up to $97. I made somewhere close to 100% profit on the call option, that I\u2019d previously been down on.",

Initially IBM did not believe in the PC revolution nor did they want to cannibalize their high revenue mainframe business, so they did not bother developing PCs. Once Apple took off they realized their mistake and wanted to quickly rush a PC to market. They quickly made the hardware but needed an operating system. Instead of developing their own they looked to hire an outsider to do it since that would be faster. They entered into an agreement with Microsoft that allowed Microsoft to retain the rights of the operating system.  This initially seemed fine since IBM dominated hardware, so they did not anticipate what would come next: dozens of competitors rip apart IBM personal computers, reverse engineer them, and then build their own IBM PC clones. The competitors sell the clones for a fraction of the cost of the IBM computer and take away huge market share. Meanwhile Microsoft is laughing their way to the bank as they own the rights to the operating system and make money regardless of who the hardware provider is. \n\nIBM realizes that they need to lower the cost of their products to compete in the marketplace so they look to cut costs. They cut back significantly on hiring. So where do all the top engineers go to? Not IBM but other tech companies like Microsoft and Oracle (and eventually Google, Facebook, etc).\n\n\nSo essentially they had no moat, and stopped hiring talent. Today\u2019s tech giants are constantly hiring and spending insane amounts on R&amp;D. The second they stop is when you should get worried.",

Earnings growth will be a bit harder as companies will have some really hard comps and market multiples come in a little.\n\nThis. And I've made the argument before, the only reason we were able to successfully raise interest rates in the 80s is because an entirely new industry (tech) came online and fueled the growth of the US (and world) economy for the next 35 years. Seriously think about this:\n\n- Volcker jacks rates up to 16-20% from March 1980 to May 1981. This stops inflation, but causes a recession that is one of the contributing factors to Carter losing his reelection bid.\n\n- Apple IPO is December of 1980. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\n- Microsoft IPO is March of 1986. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nAnd those are just the biggest. We also had companies like Intel, Oracle, Cisco, Dell, and others coming online in the 70s and 80s. And then that led right into the 90s and 00s with Google and Amazon, followed by Facebook, etc.\n\nAll of this to say, if the fed raises interest rates drastically, it's going to lead to a recession. And unless we have some industry that is going to lead the way forward for the next 30 years of economic expansion, I don't see how the fed will be able to stand their ground before dropping rates again. Maybe clean energy or biotech could do it, but I don't think we have enough momentum in either of those sectors right now to sustain us through a recession like tech did.",

        "body": "PLTR has the better long term growth case. They're addressing the biggest issues of machine learning, which is security and data wrangling. Most consultants will say they need months to look through data and sanitize it before they can do meaningful data science work; PLTR can do it in a week with their internal tools. They also offer data-driven digital twin simulations of entire supply chains. Doesn't that sound handy during a global supply chain crisis?! Businesses can ask questions like \"what if China's output goes down 80% in September from black outs\", \"what if shipping through LA is delayed by 4 weeks\" and get impacts on delivery time and dollar amounts. Once companies start using these tools, they will never leave, until there's a competitor, which doesn't really exist in the space. \n\nThey are successfully growing their corporate client base and the percent of revenues from the government is going down, while they're getting more money from governments. The draw back is that the stock is expensive, but don't be surprised if this company grows to be worth hundreds of billions. Very bullish investors are predicting this will be as big as IBM, Oracle, Microsoft or Salesforce. They sell very valuable business tools that scale incredibly well and capture long term contracts. Retail investors think AMD is better because they see the CPU in their computer and think it's an in-demand product. \n\nAMD is fab-less and they're already experiencing scaling problems. They're competing with NVidia, Amazon, Apple, Msft and now Intel for manufacturing resources. So they might have a better chip, but if they have production bottlenecks, how do they keep growing fast? Amazon makes so much money on AWS because their customers pay more for on-demand resources. AMD has to bid against 5 companies are that are many times larger than them to get their chips made, which should be scary to investors. People think Intel is going down because Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are making their own chips, but nobody is thinking this will affect AMD for some reason... Where exactly do people think these chips are coming from?\n\nAMD is far better priced than PLTR (AMD is fairly priced now), but they have strong global competitors and a fickle market that will flock back to Intel in 2 years if they offer a performance advantage. The good news for them is a couple more years of supply shortages and intense future demand for processors",

You can decide every move Burry makes is genius and based on solid data, but reality is, he never once posted any real thesis beyond this  for why it should go down.\n\nIn fact in the beginning of March, he tweeted:\n\n\"$TSLA below $100/share by later this year will not crash the system. There is no reflexivity in such a fall. But it would trigger the end of an era for a certain type of investing.\"\n\nSeems to me that is an opinion as was stated here that TSLA's value is as a \"meme\" stock and he is not considering that investors really believe in the future growth of TSLA.\n\nSeems you are desperately looking for confirmation for your bias that TSLA is not a good investment and you have chosen the autist oracle to hang your hat on. Hey, Michael Burry is a great investor, but with TSLA, he has never once articulated anything more substantial than what I have said over here. I disagree with what he has said. If he has more depth to his short position, then let him share it. Or, perhaps, as recently suggested, his short position was actually quite small and was just some gambling by him and not something he did with real confidence, which would perhaps show that he himself was not that convinced with his own analysis.",
