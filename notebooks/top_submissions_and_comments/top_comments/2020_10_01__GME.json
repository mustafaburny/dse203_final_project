But I remember value investors saying since like 2018 that GME was undervalued if you look at its asset to debt ratio or something.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think anyone knew *what* was gonna happen, but there were people who definitely knew that there was good opportunity for *something* to happen, especially with how insane the % of shares being shorted on this company is.\n\nOnce Cohen came aboard it was a perfect storm for a pop like this eventually, a dude like him doesn\u2019t just throw his money around unless he intends to make a ROI.",

I held SSSS calls yesterday, thinking \"alright don't panic sell...\" only for the underlying stock to tank 10% more today. \n\nAt this point I'm just chasing losses.
