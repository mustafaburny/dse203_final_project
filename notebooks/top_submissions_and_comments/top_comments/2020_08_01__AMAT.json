        "body": "I like ONTO more on a comparative basis. They have a technological edge with their equipment and are way under valued. They are taking at about 21 P/E right now, but as they build out their portfolio, they expect to earn over $5/sh with increased margins. So, a FPE of closer to 7. AMAT is a great company, but they are already built out. ONTO has that TAM SAM gap to fill in addition to eating market share and the growing industry. I wouldn't be shocked if AMAT or LRCX buys ONTO, frankly. It would make sense.",

As we saw with the pandemic, Costco, Home Depot, etc. They weren't as vulnerable as other stocks like Airlines, banking, food production, some Tech, insurance companies, niche markets, Looking at you Starbucks, etc. \n\n\nNow if I'm looking for a long position I'm looking for a stock that doesn't give a shit about the election. AMAT is a great example of that. I had UBER for a while and then heard the stirrings of the employee/contractor debate and got the fuck out immediately. \n\nI want something that will hold up well during almost anything and could almost be considered a necessity to most. UPS,  FedEx, Amazon, Cloud companies, Software. People need their shit. \n\nThe whole EV market right now is propped up by Tesla, most would be half their price without it. And one bad earnings report and it tanks.  \n\nShort positions I just ride the trend. Hop on and get out. Buy the rumor, sell the news. Sell if your loss exceeds 10%. This will give you a bit more capital to expand your long term positions. Because you can't exactly sell and then buy more. \n\nTrevena for instance is finally coming out of it's little shit hole of a rollercoaster and I came out $380 up for the day.\n\nBefore you buy a stock act like you have to leave the room and ask your boss for permission to buy. This will cut out impulsive buying and jumping in on a shit EP. \n\nAlso now that I'm thinking about it TelaDoc is right around the perfect entry point. I'd buy 1, see what happens next week or two and then average out if you like it. Or just dump it. But once the merger is complete that thing will fly. I've got 16 shares and it's treated me well. Stalled this week though. But honestly look into AMAT and semiconductor companies as well. Consistently good earnings reports are great but look what happens if they have one bad quarter and see how fast they bounce back. That's what you want. Plus good dividends. My neighbor makes stupid money and he's got 2000 shares of AMAT and swears by it.\n\nEdit: \nhttps://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/data-tables/dividend-leaders-aug-27-2020/\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/data-tables/etf-leaders-aug-27-2020/",

However, the call sounded super bullish, because they had a record backlog of orders to fill and had a record number of orders to fill for the next quarter.  They also said that the supply chain issues had passed, and that they expected to recoup the slightly missed earnings over the rest of the year.  \n\nI mean I'd expect a healthy ER based on last quarter's call.  The bigger picture is that 5g, AI, cloud computing, the internet of things, etc. etc. all mean that there will be a big demand for AMAT products and services for the foreseeable future.",
