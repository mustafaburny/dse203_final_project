But because of short pressure and the unemployment data I believe it was slowed. It should be at or near a technical bottom. \n\nI bought today after the 9am run up failed. I figured it would fail, but I had anticipated a larger recovery than what I've seen so far. I bought after the run up dropped and retraced. \n\nThe company is great i think the shorts are a little too ambitious on this stock as it doesn't have a dividend to worry about and momentum had been in their favor. Amat dropped 3% I expect mostly due to the record date for its dividend, many other tech stocks struggled as well today so also contributed to downward pressure.  \n\nI believe they have strong partnerships. I also believe in the technicals. Starting to have huge divergence from the means that I've seen. Technical indicators showing oversold. \n\nYada Yada.",

Apologize if thats not the case.\n\nOne thing I might caution against is that the portfolio is heavily invested in companies that don't currently make much money relative to stock price.  KSU is one of the closest value stocks you have but even they trade very expensive compared to peers like UNP and NSC.  At end of the day, stocks have value because of their ability to make money.\n\nIm all for picking some stocks that have growth potential but I would consider balancing out with stocks that already are mature.  Companies like aapl, wmt, V, DUK, AMAT, SUI, PFE, etc.  These companies you dont have to get nervous before every earnings call because you know the expectations are reasonable.",

They are taking at about 21 P/E right now, but as they build out their portfolio, they expect to earn over $5/sh with increased margins. So, a FPE of closer to 7. AMAT is a great company, but they are already built out. ONTO has that TAM SAM gap to fill in addition to eating market share and the growing industry. I wouldn't be shocked if AMAT or LRCX buys ONTO, frankly. It would make sense.",
