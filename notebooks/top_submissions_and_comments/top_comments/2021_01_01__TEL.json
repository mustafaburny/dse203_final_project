        "body": "Normally I don\u2019t do this kind of thing, but I\u2019ve had far too much wine, just enough marijuana, and I\u2019m feeling kinda jolly this evening, so let me spit some knowledge about everyone\u2019s favorite eye in the sky these days. The employee lockout will be a buying opportunity, because Palantir\u2019s is going to the fackin\u2019 moon, boys. Get your helmets on, and strap in. This rocket\u2019s about to blast off. \n\nPalantir\u2019s pretty well-established in the Data Analytics community with big Government contracts pouring money into R&amp;D projects. You don\u2019t need to turn a profit when the Government uses you for their skunkworks dept. on the explosion of industry that is Surveillance. \n\nSpeaking of surveillance... let\u2019s take a little walk down memory lane, shall we. Y\u2019all remember Barack Obama, right? The guy who [wrote Presidential Executive Orders declaring a continued State of National Emergency every year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_the_United_States) that brought us the NSA cell phone bullshit, along with all the other erosions of our privacy we are now totally accustomed to, and largely gave us the rise of Mass Surveillance? He had some pretty colorful characters working for him. One of those characters was this total badass named [Avril Haines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Haines). \n\nIf you don\u2019t know about her, you should. Again, because she\u2019s a badass. Studied Judo in Japan, apparently became bored with that at some point and casually studied theoretical physics at University of Chicago. Somehow that wasn\u2019t exciting enough for her, so in her down time, she ended up buying a used-up, junk-ass Cessna airplane,  and **rebuilt the avionics herself**. Once that little weekend project was completed, she tried to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and crash-landed near the Newfoundland coast. No shit. I mean, who does that?! A badass judo hobbyist who dabbles in theoretical physics, that\u2019s who. Now, she did crash, yes, but: her co-pilot ended up falling in love and wife\u2019in the shit out of her. I mean, can you blame the guy? They cuddled for awhile and opened up a little bookstore in the ghetto of Baltimore, hoping the danger of a drug riddled city could hold her lust for excitement. Shocker: it couldn\u2019t. \n\nBy the early 2000\u2019s, she was bouncing around government jobs doing lawyer stuff, and that\u2019s when she met Joe Biden. Several high-profile positions followed, but the one I want to focus on happens in 2010, when she gets a seat at the table to be Deputy National Security advisor. Three years later? She replaced Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy and former acting director. \n\nThat\u2019s right, you heard me. The CIA. \n\nSpeaking of Joe Biden... guess who he just [nominated to be the Director of National Security?](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/30/939722113/the-winding-journey-of-avril-haines-bidens-pick-to-lead-u-s-intelligence). If you said Avril Haines, you get a good star. \n\n\u201cDaegoba; what the fuuu does this have to do with Palantir?\u201d Well... do any of you degenerates know who was the first investor in Palantir? A little company called In-Q-Tel; the venture capital firm of the **CIA**. They kicked Thiel a cool $2 million waaaaaay back in 2003, just as he got the company off the ground. \n\nNow, wouldn\u2019t it stand to reason that maybe, *just maybe*, it would be a safe bet to assume that moving forward in the foreseeable future, with all these old friends getting together to run the US Government over the next few years, that we could see a little bit of good news around Palantir? You think!?\n\nIf this isn\u2019t your next big play over the long term, I don\u2019t know if you should even be in the stocks game. The writings on the wall. It\u2019s plain to see. Palantir will be a giant in the next two years at the very least, and a Juggernaut in Data Analytics for the foreseeable future. \n\n Now, go. Invest in Palantir, and retire early. You\u2019re welcome.",

        "body": ". Singapore steps up bid to become Asia Spacs hub SGX looks to \u2018blank cheque\u2019 companies to capitalise on surging investment in region\u2019s tech start-ups Singapore\u2019s stock exchange hopes to become the first in Asia to take advantage of investor demand for blank cheque companies.  Singapore\u2019s stock exchange is accelerating plans to become the first major bourse in Asia to list special purpose acquisition companies, aiming to capitalise on a surge of foreign investment in fast-growing technology start-ups. SGX said it would begin a formal consultation within two months into allowing blank cheque companies to list in the city-state. The exchange has already held talks with global banks and issuers, according to multiple people involved in the discussions. Singapore would be the first exchange in Asia to join the rush of tech-focused Spacs, one of the hottest asset classes in the US, where blank cheque vehicles raised a record $80bn in 2020.\u00a0 Sponsors raise capital by listing Spacs and then hunting for a company to acquire or merge with. The\u00a0structure provides companies an alternative route to going public to expensive and time-consuming initial public offerings. Tan Boon Gin, chief executive of SGX\u2019s regulatory unit, said this month that the exchange had received a number of expressions of interest. By giving issuers a faster path to market and more certainty on pricing, Spacs \u201cwould benefit capital markets both locally and regionally\u201d, according to the exchange. Bankers said SGX would be well positioned to attract Asia-based and regionally focused acquisition vehicles that have listed in the US, such as Bridgetown Holdings, a Spac backed by Hong Kong businessman Richard Li and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. Bridgetown raised $595m in a US IPO in October, making it the biggest Spac focused on south-east Asia. Bridgetown 2, which launched this month, is seeking to raise $200m to target additional Asian companies. Udhay Furtado, co-head of Citigroup\u2019s Asia equity capital markets business, said there was a \u201cbacklog building\u201d of financial sponsors aiming to list Spacs targeting Asian companies, especially in south-east Asia. More than five Spacs by Asia-based sponsors in the US have announced plans to list or have gone public in the first two weeks of 2021, including one by Hong Kong-based Primavera Capital and Princeville Capital. SGX\u2019s pursuit of Spacs comes as some of south-east Asia\u2019s highest-profile unicorns, or private companies worth at least $1bn, are expected to seek public listings this year. Those include ride-hailing apps Grab and Gojek, valued at $16bn and $10bn, respectively, and Indonesian ecommerce start-up Tokopedia, recently valued at $7.5bn. SGX, which has suffered a string of delistings, could be an early mover because it has greater incentive to allow in Spacs, Mr Furtado said. The exchange\u2019s push follows earlier, less fruitful attempts to attract tech names, such as partnerships with the Nasdaq and Tel Aviv exchanges. Recommended Special purpose acquisition companies Goldman chief executive says Spac boom is unsustainable The Singapore exchange is also facing competition from regional rival Hong Kong, which has drawn a steady stream of \u201chomecoming\u201d listings by Chinese tech groups seeking to reduce their dependence on Wall Street amid tensions between Washington and Beijing. \u201c[SGX] may not be able to compete with the Hong Kong exchange in terms of tech IPOs so it\u2019s trying to find another edge,\u201d said Margaret Yang, a strategist at DailyFX. The Hong Kong stock exchange has not been an option for Spacs in Asia because of its tight rules around \u201cbackdoor\u201d listings, imposed over concerns about listed cash shells that can access funding without full IPO scrutiny. However, Spacs have been criticised for lacking transparency and providing greater returns for sponsors than for shareholders. One investment banker in Singapore said SGX had proposed changes to the US Spacs model to make blank cheque vehicles more \u201cinvestor-friendly\u201d, including requirements to ensure only qualified sponsors could raise a Spac and changes to incentives so that sponsors could not walk away with an outsized financial gain.",

Silver is a 1 trillion market and gme wasnt even a billion when this started so you cant expect it to move as fast. However 7% in 2 days is massive for Silver and its up 6% already today in tel aviv. the movement isnt to buy paper so idk where your thesis of JPM is coming from? If everyone buys physical which is what most are doing the system goes up in flames. Will it be easy? Absolutley not but it is possible. In regards to your GME i dont think it changes a thing.  The job is done. Hedge funds have been warned but Hedge funds are just a very small criminal in this huge crime. If GME is where it stops they will just reload and get bailed out like in 2008 and after enough time passes will be back to the same crap as before. Its not enough. Thats why your seeing so many people join this movement",

Deflation or stagflation will prohibit an economy from growing e.g.) Japan over the last 30 years. \n\nBtc may not be the true answer but I can guarantee you that central banks are not.

But there needs to be somewhat stable prices and medium of exchange. Do V/MC/AMEX really need to take up to 4% of small business transactions to transfer money from one person to another, No crypto eliminates those companies. Do we even need WU or MGI for remittances, no, crypto solves for that. Can we get rid of BAC/WF/C et cetera? I\u2019d like to think we can.",
