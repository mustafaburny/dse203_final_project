(\\~$40k in total profit). If your father's son is looking to wank himself off for the coming few months, I am presenting a new opportunity!\n\n(*caution: This post will contain ideas that are for not suited for the faint in heart, but rather targeting autists who wish to earn a FUCKING PROFIT!)*\n\nAs many of you know, $WORK is, in essence, a replacement for email. It is a remote collaboration tool that allows people to effectively work together, access hundreds of thousands of critical applications and services, and find important information to do their best work. Last week they reported solid earnings, with Revenue jumped 50% from year-ago levels, and the company reported adding 12,000 new paying customers. More than 90,000 organizations signed on with Slack on either a paid or free plan during the three months ending April 30. The number of organizations paying $100,000 or more to Slack in annual recurring revenue rose by nearly half to 963. It also sees the good times continuing. The company projects full-year revenue growth of 36% to 38%.\n\nDespite these solid reports, the company dropped 16%.\n\nInvestors in Slack should be proud of the company\u2019s performance. According to management, the firm did extremely well in what was the first quarter of its 2021 fiscal year. Based on the data provided, revenue at the firm came in at $201.65 million. This represents a gain of 49.6% over the $134.82 million the firm generated the same quarter a year earlier. Such a high growth rate, particularly for a firm with a market capitalization of $22.4 billion before reporting the news, is difficult to come by. Currently the stock is severely undervalued and will probably rebound very quickly before hedge funds and smart money rebalance and pump this to the fucking moon. This morning Motley just posted two articles on $WORK, Investors Observer released improved price targets for $WORK, and the legendary David Hynes is asking you to get into a threesome and start Fucking $WORK in its ass!\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-time-canaccord-buy-rating-231519661.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-time-canaccord-buy-rating-231519661.html)\n\nBesides the fact that $WORK has plenty of room to consolidate growth with its SaaS potential, it's also beginning to form some monstrous partnerships with other tech giants like IBM and AMZN.\n\nPositions:\n\n8/21c $44. Cheap as tits and can only go up after being down 70% from last week.",

Faith that dividend payouts will generate acceptable passive income  \n3.  A gamble that someone believing any of these three points will come by later and pay more money than you did for the shares you want to sell  \n(For small time investors who aren't buying respectable amounts of shares of companies and getting their names high on the \"pay me out first\" list which will add other ways to make money and more control of the company's direction)\n\nIf you only consider option 3 regarding stocks, there is no difference between buying BitCoin and buying Stocks; it's just a matter of which faith in the gamble being in your favor is stronger.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you are gambling purely on someone else being willing to gamble.  Yeah you can point to acceptance rates for payment services, but that hasn't penetrated enough to really be a factor outside of the true believers.\n\nWith stocks, you have the company to base actions on.

After Jeopardy the public demonstration doesn't change anything about the shares I own, but it caused people to want to buy shares of IBM; whatever reason they had didn't matter because it meant I could sell for an increased value.

Your point is spot on - CTS goes after small and medium size enterprises while IBM will go after the Fortune 500. It is purely a reseller model...but the company's main focus is converting these clients into more software. \n\nA lot of the targets they acquire are usually product specific - they end up selling a ton of Cisco or a ton of Dell without much overlap. But if they are selling Cisco, it's not as if their clients aren't buying Dell products also. That's the value prop that they pitch when they acquire targets - we are going to give you the tools to sell everything your clients want and need and your clients will love that they will not have multiple vendors. So effectively cross-selling is a huge selling point for the targets. \n\nWith respect to Red Hat, IBM is actually giving Converge market development funds to pursue these markets effectively throwing their full weight behind them. \n\nAnd yes, 700m and still on the Venture...not something you see every day. I am pretty confident they will uplist to the TSX within the year and will aim to go after NASDAQ later this year if not early next year.",

And then few years ago, he invested in AAPL.

That will ease over time, but it may take half a decade (like we saw after the Recession) for group contribution to get back to normal percentages. \n\nAs it relates to hotels, the issue isn't as much the individual traveler as much as companies cutting travel requirements out of budgets and putting mandates to hold meetings virtually. Or consolidating quarterly events into an annual event. Or let's say companies send less ppl to trade shows/conventions from their contingencies. Or even a company like IBM mandating a 25% travel reduction would have a major ripple effect throughout the industry. \n\nLeisure travel alone won't cut it for most markets. Even a low to moderate negative shift in corporate travel behavior will be beaten up badly.

Lots of people betting both red and green, hence the kangaroo memes. If you don't want to, there's a few options. With high IV spikes you can try iron condors to make money off the volatility. Otherwise buying stock and selling calls is more safe and you make money if the market goes up or stays the same, and cover a large part of losses if it goes down. If you are bullish hit the NASDAQ (qqq) if you are bearish hit spy. Stocks I would look into include ttd for large options premium, ba/ko/ibm/wm/wmt/oil(apa,fang,mro,mpc,xom) for dividend and long term growth, lulu for legging juice, wtrh for the delivery memes, and adbe/rh/docu/mdb/ayx for strong individuals. You might also consider the classic cows of msft appl amzm and fb. If you're going to put in decent money for gods sake hedge out with some gld for the coming inflation. \n\nFull disclosure I got like 70% of my equity in qqq calls because I'm expecting giant green dildos.

Room temp superposition and existing nano scale fabrication methods are appealing for silicon, but there is still a lack of ability to sustain superposition for a meaningful amount of time. From an investment standpoint, I don't like pure quantum investments because the field is still up in the air with no clear direction. I also, don't like investing in foreign stocks because they aren't listed on US exchanges and OTC foreign markets have poor liquidity. The reason I really like QUBT is because their software can run on GPUs and CPUs, so they have a market now. Solving increasingly complex NP style questions is needed. I think QUBT is probably the only way to get high exposure to quantum, while still investing in a company with upside unrelated to quantum... aside from google, IBM, and intel of course.",

The financial crisis in '08 blew me out of so many hilariously good positions, like SBAC because the iPhone was just invented and 3G means more cell phone towers... It's not always rocket science. Anyone with some specialized insight into the future, whatever it may be, should consider putting a small well thought out speculative position on and leave it be. Small enough to not hurt if it goes nowhere, but big enough to care enough to check up and manage every few months.\n\nWow, just looked up an email from over 10 years ago. These names are probably in the mainstream investing language now, but wow... 10-100x if they were held. And it wasn't complex quant investing or anything, just looking ahead, positioning, and waiting.\n\nQuotes from the email circa 10 years ago: \"NVDA... They are also making a leap into scientific computing, where there's a lot of money to be made. They're the first major player to enter that arena to fight Intel and AMD in a long time, and their architecture is much more suited to scientific computing than the traditional CPUs that currently rule the top 100 supercomputer list. I think I'll see how that works out before selling NVDA\"\n\n\"I might want to put some money in AMD as well. They're here to stay and may still be undervalued...\"\n\n\"Universal Display Corp and LG Display (PANL/LPL) are also the leaders and partners in OLED screen development, which is bound to catch on eventually. Lower power use and much better image quality mean that it's just a matter of time before more devices adopt this new display technology and it becomes a new standard. I actually expect Apple to eventually partner up with LG (I think LG is their main LCD supplier) and use and use an OLED display on either a new product or a new Iphone version, which will kick OLED production into overdrive.\"\n\nFood for thought... MicroLED is likely going to grow 1000x over the coming decades. AR and LIDAR sensors for AR will probably not just be used for face unlock and will get some killer apps, the next Snapchat or TikTok might be AR based. Self-Driving is going to be powered by thousands of companies, not just NVIDIA and Waymo. Quantum computing? AI providers in the military contracting space? Clean cargo ship tech to get in front of green regulations? It's endless, and so many people know about these little niches of information that very few others do. Even mundane spaces see world changing innovation every day. Getting in front of a curve is inherently speculative but it is also entertaining, educational to follow through development, and can be extremely profitable.\n\nThat's my appeal for pulling a few pennies out of the ETF pile and doing some a little different, especially if you have a \"wheelhouse\" that you know a little bit more about.",

So if people can't find much besides a \"short the shit out of this company\" report, it might be more important for management to attempt to keep the stock afloat, whether it's in their own self interest or not.\n\nIf you try to short Intel it's a bit of a different story considering there are 40 analysts covering it and an ungodly amount of brand recognition. If one analyst comes out with a short and 39 say Intel is fine, it's unlikely the short piece actually does anything. But if you have three analysts covering you, which is very common for small-cap companies, one short piece can actually fuck your shit up. \n\nAlso since companies often use their equity as collateral for a loan, the higher stock price could afford more reasonable loan terms, which could help the company's actual business.",
