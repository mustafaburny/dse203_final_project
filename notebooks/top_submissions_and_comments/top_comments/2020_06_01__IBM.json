(\\~$40k in total profit). If your father's son is looking to wank himself off for the coming few months, I am presenting a new opportunity!\n\n(*caution: This post will contain ideas that are for not suited for the faint in heart, but rather targeting autists who wish to earn a FUCKING PROFIT!)*\n\nAs many of you know, $WORK is, in essence, a replacement for email. It is a remote collaboration tool that allows people to effectively work together, access hundreds of thousands of critical applications and services, and find important information to do their best work. Last week they reported solid earnings, with Revenue jumped 50% from year-ago levels, and the company reported adding 12,000 new paying customers. More than 90,000 organizations signed on with Slack on either a paid or free plan during the three months ending April 30. The number of organizations paying $100,000 or more to Slack in annual recurring revenue rose by nearly half to 963. It also sees the good times continuing. The company projects full-year revenue growth of 36% to 38%.\n\nDespite these solid reports, the company dropped 16%.\n\nInvestors in Slack should be proud of the company\u2019s performance. According to management, the firm did extremely well in what was the first quarter of its 2021 fiscal year. Based on the data provided, revenue at the firm came in at $201.65 million. This represents a gain of 49.6% over the $134.82 million the firm generated the same quarter a year earlier. Such a high growth rate, particularly for a firm with a market capitalization of $22.4 billion before reporting the news, is difficult to come by. Currently the stock is severely undervalued and will probably rebound very quickly before hedge funds and smart money rebalance and pump this to the fucking moon. This morning Motley just posted two articles on $WORK, Investors Observer released improved price targets for $WORK, and the legendary David Hynes is asking you to get into a threesome and start Fucking $WORK in its ass!\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-time-canaccord-buy-rating-231519661.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-time-canaccord-buy-rating-231519661.html)\n\nBesides the fact that $WORK has plenty of room to consolidate growth with its SaaS potential, it's also beginning to form some monstrous partnerships with other tech giants like IBM and AMZN.\n\nPositions:\n\n8/21c $44. Cheap as tits and can only go up after being down 70% from last week.",

Belief that a company is worthwhile and something that one wants to own a piece of and possibly participate in voting/guidance of the company   \n2.  Faith that dividend payouts will generate acceptable passive income  \n3.  A gamble that someone believing any of these three points will come by later and pay more money than you did for the shares you want to sell  \n(For small time investors who aren't buying respectable amounts of shares of companies and getting their names high on the \"pay me out first\" list which will add other ways to make money and more control of the company's direction)\n\nIf you only consider option 3 regarding stocks, there is no difference between buying BitCoin and buying Stocks; it's just a matter of which faith in the gamble being in your favor is stronger.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you are gambling purely on someone else being willing to gamble.  Yeah you can point to acceptance rates for payment services, but that hasn't penetrated enough to really be a factor outside of the true believers.\n\nWith stocks, you have the company to base actions on.  Pretend that  I bought 100 shares of IBM because I think they have good Research back in the early 2000's before Watson went on Jeopardy.  After Jeopardy the public demonstration doesn't change anything about the shares I own, but it caused people to want to buy shares of IBM; whatever reason they had didn't matter because it meant I could sell for an increased value.   And (in theory) I can see that cause an effect if I watch what the company is doing.  Everytime? No;  The market isn't that rational.

        "body": "Hey - great questions so let me shed some light.\n\nMost of these big companies rely on reseller models as they don't have the capacity to go after SMBs. Your point is spot on - CTS goes after small and medium size enterprises while IBM will go after the Fortune 500. It is purely a reseller model...but the company's main focus is converting these clients into more software. \n\nA lot of the targets they acquire are usually product specific - they end up selling a ton of Cisco or a ton of Dell without much overlap. But if they are selling Cisco, it's not as if their clients aren't buying Dell products also. That's the value prop that they pitch when they acquire targets - we are going to give you the tools to sell everything your clients want and need and your clients will love that they will not have multiple vendors. So effectively cross-selling is a huge selling point for the targets. \n\nWith respect to Red Hat, IBM is actually giving Converge market development funds to pursue these markets effectively throwing their full weight behind them. \n\nAnd yes, 700m and still on the Venture...not something you see every day. I am pretty confident they will uplist to the TSX within the year and will aim to go after NASDAQ later this year if not early next year.",

        "body": "&gt;Mostly agree with you but what is your evidence the the big 5 are in a bubble? Looking back at the dot com crash (an actual bubble), interest rates were much higher and you couldn't even talk about earnings multiples because many of those companies had no earnings. Interest rates have a massive impact on valuations. Stocks are somewhat expensive now but were much more expensive back then. Don't think we are in a bubble.\n\nIs not even close to 2K, I agree, so is \"mild\" bubble territory right now (so it could go much higher). But even now IMO they are discounting growth multiple times of what they will be in the next years because a couple reasons:\n\n\\- Those mega-corps face HUGE risks in the future mostly in the regulatory and political space. Take in mind more than any all those depend greatly on foreign growth and regulatory capture. As the public discourse turns towards nationalism, de-globalization, populism, etc. (This theme can be applied to the broad market too, there is a lot of risk that is not priced in the market re. politics, national and international). All this will stall growth for those firms.\n\n\\- Future growth depends for most of those companies on the global economic corporate environment  (MSFT, FB, GOOG, AMZN) or consumer demand and household economy (AAPL, AMNZ). Both for them are poised to be disappointing in the next years, we will either get no growth and deleverage or stagflation IMO. None of these are good for real growth (stocks suffered greatly in the 70's and there was a similar situation with some large stocks greatly valued just before then, back then it was things like IBM, KO, MCD).\n\n\\- They are the \"hot stuff\" right now, have heard this song many times, just as other sectors and companies in other times: \"time is different\", \"a new paradigm\" yada, yada, yada. They are mature and assume a stable unchanging environment with continued growth that just statistically speaking is very improbable to happen. Recency bias with great fundamental reasons to make them appealing, as most stocks that start this kind of mild bubble (is a different animal than the 2K bubble, more similar to the 50-60's that I was talking about).\n\nI could be totally wrong though, since technically right now we are momentum (algo) and liquidity driven the stocks can easily keep going unless downward pressure turns, but from a valuation PoV, forward looking (not next couple quarters, but years down the line) those valuations are rich IMO.",

But that can be achieved without hotels. If 80% of attendees want to go to a conference, the 20% who are afraid are being heard by the Group contacts and travel planners. That will ease over time, but it may take half a decade (like we saw after the Recession) for group contribution to get back to normal percentages. \n\nAs it relates to hotels, the issue isn't as much the individual traveler as much as companies cutting travel requirements out of budgets and putting mandates to hold meetings virtually. Or consolidating quarterly events into an annual event. Or let's say companies send less ppl to trade shows/conventions from their contingencies. Or even a company like IBM mandating a 25% travel reduction would have a major ripple effect throughout the industry. \n\nLeisure travel alone won't cut it for most markets. Even a low to moderate negative shift in corporate travel behavior will be beaten up badly. I believe 85% of travelers will return, but profitability will be inconsistent at best for the next 3 to 5 years.",
