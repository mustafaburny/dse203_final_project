        "body": "I think the semi sector is interesting, however I do not like AMD because their devices are largely manufactured by Taiwanese fabs like TSMC. I dislike Taiwanese companies because 1/3 of Taiwanese identify as Chinese and 99% of the remaining 2/3 are not willing to sacrifice their lives to fight the Chinese, which has big implications for the future viability and shareholder returns of these companies. I am more interested in companies operating within western business norms that can contribute to western manufacturing. I own a basket of stocks for diversification, but currently I have AMAT, LCRX, ASML, KLAC as core names, and WOLF and AEHR as more speculative names.",
