That\u2019s the way you\u2019ll make big tendies in this game. Did you see how everyone got excited today at the rocket fuel phase? Guess what our goal is way higher than that and it will naturally climb up higher again. We don\u2019t need hype. This thing will be driven by the share buy backs alone. It will be beautiful",

Between the limit on buying stocks and hedge funds trading between themselves to drive the price down, and creating a distraction (SLV) to draw attention and fill pockets, this should be throwing off a significantly larger red flag than \"ERMERGERD WSB SAYS GME WORTH $69,420 LOOL\". Who gives a shit, you're completely missing the point here. Short sellers expose themselves to basically unlimited risk. But that risk never actually materializes for them because they can just cheat the system. Meanwhile someone can go buy a stock and lose value because of *their* game OR someone can go short a stock and become insolvent while the *big boys on WallStreet* walk away.\n\nGME isn't an isolated incident. BB, NOK, AMC and a number of others are getting hammered- and have been getting hammered since last Wednesday because the people on the losing side don't want to lose at the game they created for themselves. BB basically experienced a rug pull- it didn't taper off or settle in the 20's... it looks like someone pulled a plug. Look at what happened a month ago (or more) with PLTR and Shitron. Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia... AMD have all been recent targets of this institutional wide short selling.",

        "body": "*\\*\\*\\*Disclosure: I have roughly $30,000 invested in AMD so my opinion might be biased.* \n\nPersonally, I think it is a great time if any to invest in AMD. Main reason why is that recently the stock saw a dip from the 100 down to the mid 80s level mostly due to hedge funds deleveraging because of the whole GME fiasco so you are buying it at a discount in my opinion. \n\nAnother reason why is that AMD is a classic turnaround story. It wasn't too long ago that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy due to failing product lines, but now it has CPUs that can rival and even outperform Intel and the specs for their GPUs shows they can actually go foot to foot with Nvidia. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the market for CPUs and GPUs are still growing so I don't really expect a deceleration of the company's revenue growth. \n\nLastly, keep in mind that the Gov is still doing QE infinity, that and the trillions of stimulus they are gonna give out this year means it is a perfect environment for risk assets, so don't overthink it.",

The short interest prior to S3\u2019s revised ~30% when they said it was 80+ was when NEW funds jumped in at shorted at 400-500. Now those funds have closed out which is why the new short figures are around 30%. \n\n\nThey\u2019ve already profited from the peak to the $200 levels - a 50%+ gain at probably near 60 million shares (&gt;12B made)\n\n\nThat 30% that\u2019s now left short are their yolos. Could a squeeze happen? Yes, but there\u2019s a huge thing you retards are all forgetting.\n\n\nThese shorts are initiated at $400. There is no mechanism for retail to push the price back up to $400 without shorts covering - and they have no fucking need to cover. The daily interest is laughable when they made over 10b in their recent short. So the only way you get an actual squeeze is if retail BUYS up to 400 again WITHOUT a squeeze. Diamond handing will do literally nothing. Holding out will get you nowhere except bagsville. You fuckers need to buy, and without any squeeze momentum, retail doesn\u2019t have the stomach for volume buying. \n\n\nAll their shady shit was indeed shady shit, but it\u2019s worked. The risk to HFs right now is extremely limited. You\u2019re all going to get fucked, but at least we\u2019ll have the old wsb back. \n\n\nY\u2019all are probably gonna kill DFV when he learns that his diamond handing has caused a rope shortage in wsb.\n\n\nFuck you all and much love - AMD @ $7 gang forever.",

Large possibility to climb in market cap.  \n\n\nAMD Bear: Intel had a new CEO change recently. They are still really far behind AMD, but maybe they can start turning it around now. Last CEO explicitly said that they can't keep up with competition anymore.  \n\n\nThink AMD will be 130-140 EoY  \n\\---------------  \n\n\nPLTR \n\nBull, Earnings coming up 11/2, and for the first time I think they will have reached earnings. Years before they never reached because they were focusing on infrastructure and growth. Now it's soon time to make a profit, and over the course of years they will most likely increase steadily. They've built up a good foundation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom Cathie believes in it and has loaded up a lot for ARK, and she is one of the best investors alive atm.  \n\n\nBear, Lock-up period finished soon + Citi marking it as a $15 stock. Bear short-term, but 100% Bull long term\n\nPLTR 50-60 EoY\n\n\\----------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFTCH,   \n\n\nLuxury retailer that is sort of a portal for different luxury shops to add their store so you can browse them all at the same time. It's not a single store like Matchesfashion or SSense so in that sense they are pretty alone in the market. No real competitiors.  \n\n\nBull: Steadily climbing, almost monopoly. People have realized you can order luxury online now instead of going to stores because of Covid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBear: Idk might have grown in market cap a bit too quick, might adjust a bit short term but will be good long term.  \n\n\nFTCH 100 EoY",
