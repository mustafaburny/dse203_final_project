Between the limit on buying stocks and hedge funds trading between themselves to drive the price down, and creating a distraction (SLV) to draw attention and fill pockets, this should be throwing off a significantly larger red flag than \"ERMERGERD WSB SAYS GME WORTH $69,420 LOOL\". Who gives a shit, you're completely missing the point here. Short sellers expose themselves to basically unlimited risk. But that risk never actually materializes for them because they can just cheat the system.

BB, NOK, AMC and a number of others are getting hammered- and have been getting hammered since last Wednesday because the people on the losing side don't want to lose at the game they created for themselves. BB basically experienced a rug pull- it didn't taper off or settle in the 20's... it looks like someone pulled a plug. Look at what happened a month ago (or more) with PLTR and Shitron.

It wasn't too long ago that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy due to failing product lines, but now it has CPUs that can rival and even outperform Intel and the specs for their GPUs shows they can actually go foot to foot with Nvidia. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the market for CPUs and GPUs are still growing so I don't really expect a deceleration of the company's revenue growth. \n\nLastly, keep in mind that the Gov is still doing QE infinity, that and the trillions of stimulus they are gonna give out this year means it is a perfect environment for risk assets, so don't overthink it.",

If I pull out the gain from CCIV, I was still up 0.5%. I have my investments spread across 15-20 SPAC's at any time, in a mix of warrants, units, and commons. Some are close to NAV, some are more speculative (GSAH), and some are post DA (THCB). \n\nOverall, I'm really happy how well my account held up on a day like today. Yes you can have tremendous gains if you go all in on only a few SPAC's, but you can do quite well by spreading out the risk.\n\nThanks again to this community for all of the knowledge!",

In the end, quality always matters. As a part of my framework, I allocate roughly 5% of my portfolio to purchase speculative stocks which don't yet meet my criteria for a core position in my portfolio. Speculative plays include things like IPOs, SPACs, etc. They can also include items like Gamestop, AMC or Blackberry. \n\nHaving a dedicated allocation of your portfolio to take on these items offers multiple benefits:\n\n1. If the play finds support at zero, its a maximum of 5% across my account.\n\n2. Since this 5% total is between any of my new or speculative stocks, it limits exposure overall (e.g. a blend of GME, AMC, BB, + CCIV, IPOE) limits your risk as opposed to dedicating all 5% to one play.\n\nIf a speculative item does well and I start to gather more data to support my position on it (e.g. understand what the company is actually doing/their roadmap, their customers/contracts, and sector risks; hard data/math: volatility, geometric mean, Sharpe/Sortino ratios) I consider adding it to my core portfolio (purchasing more and elevating it out of \"speculative\" status). \n\nOnce added to my core portfolio, it becomes something that I purchase on a regular cadence (e.g. every pay period I purchase my core portfolio). \n\nRisk management takes incredible discipline, but having a strategy and sticking to it (until something materially changes with your strategy to warrant changes) will give you the best results in the long-term, especially if you're buying individual securities. \n\nGood luck",

Sure, they've got hype and good press, but their business is not set up to be competitive in the space tourism sector. Air launch is expensive and a fair bit of hassle, meaning their tickets will be very high price. It may seem at the moment that they're close to launching paying passengers, but let's look at their competitors 3-5 years down the line. You have SpaceX with both Crew Dragon (just announced their first all-civilian flight) and Starship (coming soon\u2122\ufe0f, but will have huge implications for space tourism), as well as Blue Origin, which is less ambitious but about in the same product slot as SPCE. Both of these companies have huge financial backing and are on track to have significantly lower costs, higher launch cadence, and better product. SPCE may have a small niche somewhere in that market, but I don't think long-term it is a good play.\nSource: am space nerd. \n\nDisclaimer: not financial advice, no position in SPCE",
