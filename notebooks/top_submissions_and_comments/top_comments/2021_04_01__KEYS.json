        "body": "A lot of people are investing Crypto ETFs without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual Crypto. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. That is a pretty big risk even though this ETF can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC or BTCC because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. These products are not insured and same goes with the newly released ETF called BTCC. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients.\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin.\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

        "body": "As someone who dabbles in crypto and use multiple exchanges, as well as majoring in a relevant field(comp sci), I personally wouldn't recommend buying into coinbase until it falls below $100. Here are my reasons:\n\n1. The only thing that sets coinbase apart from its competition, for me as a NYer at least, is that they are the only US based exchange that lets me have an account and cash out into fiat. However, that is as far as coinbase goes when it comes to trading. There are many other international exchanges that charge lower fees, have more features/options, and allow unregulated/untaxed transactions like cryptos are intended for. This advantage only applies to 3 out of the 50 states in the US. That means other exchanges, OGs like binance and kucoin as well as newcomers, are competing in every part of the world outside of these 3 states.\n2. Inevitable regulations will be here any moment. Let's not delude ourselves into thinking that the federal and state governments won't start pushing new laws to regulate and tax the crypto market. Coinbase, being on the front page of it all, will undoubtedly take the brunt of the impact since it is based in the US. With regulations/taxes, coinbase will transform into a more tranditional stock broker for crypto. They will report your gains/losses to the IRS, track your public keys and transactions, etc. This is everything crypto is meant to prevent; so it won't look good to crypto owners, who have so many exchanges to choose from.\n3. Coinbase was recently busted for illegal trading practices.\n4. Many people look at coinbase as the face of crypto, but it is not the biggest by any means. Feel free to go to coinmarketcap and sort exchanges by volume. The fact that you need to scroll down a bunch to find coinbase should tell you all you need to know.\n\nObviously none of this is financial advice. But I don't see how anyone, with any sort of crypto experience, can believe that coinbase is truly worth more than 40B, nevermind 100B. If you want to gamble with the inflated valuations, that's up to you.",

Satoshi specifically addressed privacy concerns in a separate section of their white paper.\n\n&gt;The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but **privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.** **The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.** This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were... \n\nThe fact that Satoshi remains anonymous supports the case, I think. It is meant to be transacted in public, but the identify of the parties transacting is meant to be anonymous.",

        "body": "Hey! I appreciate the mods for making this a stickied post. It is a very well written and thought out text. I have been considering going long Cellebrite (from valuation standpoint) but I do have some concerns. Below are some of them. A lot of the points I wrote about are actually just what a close family member of mine said to me in a quick phone call (who works extensively in the area of cybersecurity but not with Cellebrite specifically - I have no experience &amp; knowledge in this industry at all).\n\n* How would you address the potential rise in competitors? Cellebrite is a fairly expensive tool to use, and there are numerous more companies similar to it already that are helping govts and institutions with similar products that may in the future undercut them on pricing and gain market share. These include Oxygen Forensics, AccessData, ElcomSoft and GrayShift. In particular, one of their biggest competitors, GrayShift, is aggressively gaining market share &amp; relationships and constantly bringing their price down. For instance, Feb this year they brought their GrayKey (flagship product) annual license down to under $10,000 from $15,000, which is getting close to Cellebrite \\[1\\].\n* How would you address the rise in encryption in smartphones &amp; other devices that may disrupt Cellebrite's core product offering? It is no secret that Apple, for instance, is cracking down hard on its encryption with respect to preventing bruteforcing for instance. This makes it a tit-for-tat type-industry (more so than regular cybersecurity due to the focus being so narrow), and thus the future remains uncertain as to how Cellebrite will plan to innovate against these threats. (Many techniques used by Cellebrite can instantly be destroyed by a simple iOS update as has happened in the past \\[2\\]). Also, one day it is possible Apple can dedicate 1000s of employees to solve their security issues, can Cellebrite match this?\n\nFrom one Cellebrite employee on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/a1j43j/possible\\_alternatives\\_to\\_cellebrite/](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/a1j43j/possible_alternatives_to_cellebrite/) (For the inability to bypass some devices): \"At the bottom line, we're not perfect. It's always possible you get some model supported by another tool. but due to our efforts I'm very confident these will continue to be the exceptions and very far from the rule \"\n\n* If they are unable to bypass all devices &amp; security features now, what will the future look like? We have to believe that 1) users will not opt for secure solutions &amp; features and 2) Cellebrite will keep up with whatever solutions are out there\n* The FBI itself is focused on finding other ways of getting into devices. In the long-term I have no doubt that they will have their own alternative methods and will only use Cellebrite as a last resort. Also, what happens if Apple finally provides them the encryption keys? Not saying it will happen, but you see the point.\n\nFinal point: Tech media apparently loves to rip Cellebrite &amp; similar companies (NSO group). There are already many articles about Cellebrite tools being used in human rights abuses (such as Bangladesh). This may make Apple &amp; others more driven to find solutions. Cellebrite also stopped the sale of its products to Hong Kong and China over controversy by the US regulatory side - they are so dependent on the US that internal expansion is much, much harder for those the US does not deem allies \\[3\\].\n\n\\[1\\] - [https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/01/the-powerful-graykey-iphone-hacking-tool-can-now-break-into-samsung-androids/?sh=140907564d61](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/01/the-powerful-graykey-iphone-hacking-tool-can-now-break-into-samsung-androids/?sh=140907564d61)\n\n\\[2\\] - [https://www.computerworld.com/article/3268729/apple-appears-to-have-blocked-graykey-iphone-hacking-tool.html](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3268729/apple-appears-to-have-blocked-graykey-iphone-hacking-tool.html)\n\n\\[3\\] - [https://www.cellebrite.com/en/cellebrite-to-stop-selling-its-digital-intelligence-offerings-in-hong-kong-china/](https://www.cellebrite.com/en/cellebrite-to-stop-selling-its-digital-intelligence-offerings-in-hong-kong-china/)",

Well duh to anyone in the tech space, no one in their right mind was going to buy the prior gen chips when a whole new revolutionary architecture was being released shortly.  But, most of the people in the market don't know anything about the companies they're investing in, so the stock tanked.  It was a no brainer.  Oh and they were making all the CPU/GPU chips in all the new gaming consoles coming out too.  I figured I'd buy some, and wait until there was some sign of either Intel hitting back or AMD doing something stupid (like replacing Dr. Su with an MBA).  Up 140% and Intel just keeps shooting themselves in the foot and losing market share to AMD...  The market does not seem to give one single shit about their earnings, though.  The past few quarters they have announced rockstar earnings blowing way past expectations by huge margins and every single time the share price takes a bit hit in response.  Then it grows until next earnings, where they are again monumental, and the share price dips again.  Weird, but whatever.  I'll stick with Dr. Su.",

        "body": "As a disclaimer, I do own a Bitcoin ETF in both my TFSA as well as my RRSP in addition to the real thing. Now, here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC or BTCC because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. These products are not insured and same goes with the newly released ETF called BTCC. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

It will be zero hit to their bottom line.  Pure $100m of grade a cheddar cheese with which we can smother some glorious tendies.  And as we munch down on those deep fried birds, consider this:\n\nIf you were Pfizer, why would you pay $100m per year for something when you could just buy the whole dang thing and only owe yourself $100m per year?\n\nPeople think GME was a squeeze but this has heavy short interest, an insider with tons of shares who could quickly use them in diamond hand fashion when big daddy Pfizer comes in to clear a debt off the books of 100m per year through a buyout attempt, and holds the keys to some effective covid services.  And hint hint, covid isn\u2019t going away, it\u2019s the new flu.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s say Pfizer buys them out, gives frosty a boatload of Pfizer shares (they pay dividends so he can retire and still earn millions) and pays a handsome sum to all of us retailers for our shares.  Frost has already said he won\u2019t sell unless he rescues those who bought during high offerings which means he would be looking at $18-20 per share price point.  \n\nEither scenario gets investors 300-400% gains.\n\nI do live in fantasy land so not financial advice.",

BTC has stuck with SHA 256 for quite a while, and it doesn't seem like it's close to being cracked.  BTC would have a ton of inertia to change algos since a hard fork would require the miners to change hardware.  But SHA-256 is pretty solid.\n\nElliptical curve, on the other hand, is not all that solid.  That's the function for securing  private/public keys and addresses.  That's the one people talk about as being vulnerable to quantum computers down the line.  The real dangers of crypto institutionally is with reusing account addresses.  It's a pretty sloppy, yet common, practice of reusing addresses (you print one qr code, receive deposits to it, then withdraw from that account as needed, or a company has a deposit account that is linked to you, but you withdraw every now and then).  Using a crypto address multiple times is a major vulnerability.\n\nOf course, if Elliptical Curve gets cracked through raw computing power, every single thing done on the Internet will be an open book, so BTC will probably be the least of our worries, as the entire banking system becomes a low lying fruit bush of passwords, account info and free money.",

My vote is that Coinbase is a tech company before a financial one\n\n&gt;\tWhen they implement the plans they are currently evaluating\n\nSure, they\u2019d be reasonably competitive to coinbase today, but at some undisclosed date in the future. Assuming coinbase doesn\u2019t just sit around celebrating going public, they\u2019ll be able to compete with Binance if they keep adding altcoins. The coinbase wallet mobile app already is a (in my usage of it) a polished, well performing product that\u2019s a branded gateway to using crypto on the web. \n\nI could probably say more, but at this point in this walk of text Coinbase needs to send me a check for being a social media promoter lol",

The powers that be in MA, make sure that the MA enforcement agencies take \"new money\" breaking the rules/law that \"old money\" has been breaking for decades, real seriously.  RH won't find any friends in the MA Attorney General's office or for that matter in the Federal agencies on site there.  In other words, Vlad may wanna stay the hell out of the jurisdictional reach of MA for the next 7-10 years, else some Deputy Atty Gen there who is the great grandson of some serious \"old money\" decides to rake him over the coals.  Don't shoot the messenger.  I worked for a time for some of that Old Money.  The MA legislature will make what RH does, a crime and that will be that.  Good luck Vlad.

Right now, based on current futures, the 9 day MA is $8 below and the 50d MA is $21 below. The biggest separation since the Sept crash.\n\nOur 30 day volume is 55 million, which is 4 million more than august before volume spiked to 149M before Spy dropped $14 in a single day. The comparison between later August and this month's volume and price action is nearly identical.\n\nThe reason why I'm comparing this specifically to the early Sept crash is because no news triggered that crash, indicators were just severally alarming and we had been in HEAVILY overbought territory for  7 days. Then a couple firms liquidated their heavily profited tech positions and caused the algos to trigger a crash. Tomorrow marks the first day of our heavily overbought territory.",
