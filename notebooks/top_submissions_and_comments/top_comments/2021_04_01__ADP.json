Btw, the BLS report is based on unemployment insurance claims, they don\u2019t just ask nicely and say \u201cokey dokey\u201d to whatever a business says. \n\nContinuing unemployment claims have been falling pretty consistently. New claims, while a good indicator of the volatility of the job market, are not representative of overall unemployment numbers.\n\nADP tracks only 1/5 of private payroll. It is simply just another indicator, and you should never take one number as the gospel. The two surveys can differ, it\u2019s natural when taking a sample using different datasets. The BLS uses a 90% confidence interval which is +/- 430,000 jobs. Continuing unemployment claims, BLS reports, ADP, labor participation rate, etc. should all be used in aggregate to determine the direction of employment in the country. Evidently though, your lack of understanding of statistics has led you to the predictable conclusion of \u201cthe media is conspiring!!!!1\u201d. Bravo.",

        "body": "I mean... I don't fail to do that. And I hate to be harsh, but the ADP numbers are not what any good statistician would use. ADP is absolutely not randomly selected by companies. If we relied on ADP, we'd exclude entire sectors of the economy that don't process payroll in that manner. Places that don't track time, most importantly. \n\nA sample size of 144,000 is enormous. That is a gigantic sample size, and again I'm sorry to be harsh, but anyone with remote exposure to statistics would know this. Hell, even a sample size of 1,000 (if it is actually random) is good enough to predict most events that occur in the universe. So 144,0000 is crazy huge. \n\nFrankly, the bls method is much, *much* more statistically sound than using ADP. ADP is good at showing a specific type of employment, yes, because it is widely used. But is absolutely not random, and therefore is a horrible way to make predictions or inferences about the population at large. \n\nNow, are there issues with the bls method? Obviously. Of course there are. And, given that it is a government agency, do we think we can kind of predict its bias given the political climate of the time? I would say so. I would say that a lot of the time they're going to err on the optimistic side. I agree with that. \n\nBut we know that. And we can mentally adjust. No human is unbiased, and no data is unbiased either. I think it's a shame people believe that data is unbiased, it never is and it cannot be.",

        "body": "You can download a sample issue from Nate's Notes' website (as well as from the IAS website), and that might give you a better idea of the differences. It looks like Nate's Notes is making multiple buy/sell decisions each month, whereas I would expect that our IAS subscribers are making a handful of buy/sell decisions a year (once they've established their portfolio). IAS is steadfastly devoted to a 5-year horizon, which is a risk management technique that prevents kneejerk decisions and lets company management drive EPS and sales growth over the course of several years.\n\nCabot is another long-standing newsletter publisher, and they offer several different publications. Their Turnaround Letter uses a value investing approach, which can be successful but also can be very difficult to implement since you are buying stocks that the rest of the market hates. John Buckingham's The Prudent Speculator newsletter is one of the best value newsletters, but returns are prone to swings in underlying sentiment about value vs. growth.\n\nThe Buyback Letter has several portfolios that you can follow (if you're looking for income, tech stocks, healthcare/biotech stocks, or the broader market). They also offer a Dogs of the Dow type portfolio -- the Dow 30 stocks that are the most beaten-down (and thus have the highest yields) and are also buying back shares. Personally, I look at stocks that are buying back shares in significant amounts as being a bit troublesome -- it can mean that the stock is in crisis management mode and the board wants to boost the stock, or that the company has too much cash that it doesn't have anything more worthwhile to do with it (such as reinvesting in its business), for instance. As companies have slowed their dividend increases in the last several decades in favor of using cash for share buybacks, I wonder about the overall effectiveness of this approach in the current market and business environment.\n\nJim Stack's Investech newsletter uses stocks (mostly large-caps), funds, and ETFs in an active strategy. Each month there might be a handful of recommended actions to take, and it's not uncommon for the newsletter to push the portfolio into significant cash levels. (We have a longstanding subscriber to the IAS newsletter who is also a fan of Stack; she manages the portfolio in their household, and at a MoneyShow a few years ago, she made a point of introducing her husband to Stack and instructing her husband that if she should die before him, he should just give all their investing assets to Stack's management service.)\n\nThe [HulbertRatings.com](https://HulbertRatings.com) website has returns for 1-year to 30-years for all newsletters that they cover, so that's the best place for an apples-to-apples comparison of results.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the top-performing newsletters don't represent a single investment style or approach in just about any period. You'll find newsletters that follow growth, value, fundamental, technical, market timing, or income strategies, and that use commodities, ETFs, mutual funds, stocks, and options.\n\nMany newsletters do require constant portfolio action, where each month there might be several changes that they advise subscribers to make; others are more of the \"set it and forget it\" approach. \\[Aside: When we say that IAS focuses on the long-term, we mean it -- in November 2020, we recommended buying ADP for the fourth time. The previous recommendations were in May 1997, February 1990, and June 1975. ADP was $2.91 (split-adjusted) in June 1975 and closed yesterday at $195. It's been at least a hold in the newsletter for a very long time.\\] But selecting a newsletter that works with your expectations for monthly transactions and strategy can do better for you in the real world than the hypothetical returns in a performance table.",
