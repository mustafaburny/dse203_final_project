If they can close it, there will be so many restrictions on the deal that Nvidia will barely be able to realize synergies out of it that they can't do right now.

I don't expect a whole lot of price movement THIS earnings report, I anticipate a much larger move near Q3 ER if Q2 provides confirmation (43m to 44m in rev) that they are on target to hit their revenue projection this year (already raised once). At some point as long as AvePoint executes as planned,  the market will respond. \n\nI don't really see a way that the largest SaaS cloud partner for the world's largest software/cloud company growing at 25% to 30% CAGR continues to trade at 9X when similar companies are at least trading at 30% higher. AvePoint also has a great team,  Jeff Teper, VP at Microsoft on board,  Jason Beal from Palo Alto Networks, Epstein as former CFO of Oracle, Koenig as former head of global technology investment at Goldman Sachs who's first IPO was ironically MSFT. \n\nThey have been executing a parallel M&amp;A plan alongside the SPAC process according to CEO, I expect acquisitions soon and AvePoint to execute as planned. The downside here is limited its already at the low range of valuation with a $23 bull target (VRNS revenue multiple). I feel very confident holding this, there's a ton of far worse holds making zero revenue or going backwards. \n\nAvePoint has zero debt (as of now,  who knows if their M&amp;A strategy changes that)  and is in my opinion a strong play whether the economy remains open or shuts down again. Another shutdown will actually benefit AvePoint,  and as we all know,  most companies are either permanently adopting WFH models to save on real estate costs or moving to a mostly WFH model. With so many working from home with access to sensitive data there going to be far more foreign actors attempting to compromise those systems and gain access which will result in more reliance on companies like AvePoint (Varonis too).",

GM was dead forever (went bankrupt, started another ticker, screwed investors). Ford would fold. Amazon was unsustainable. TSLA was a joke company run by a weird financial silicon valley type. SIRI radio wasn't sustainable. Oracle would buy out Microsoft and crush Apple, which would be bought out by Sony. Hulu was too late to the game, and Viacom had made a huge mistake buying them (Viacom was losing whole markets at the time, like NYC and Los Angeles). I also remember Radio Shack had a monster year that sent Bulls into a frenzy and then just died a slow cancerous death.\n\nDoes anyone else remember this?

Wild bullish euphoria, massive fed flooding, \"new paradigm\", market-wide parabolic moves, etc.  \n\nWhen it finally broke, it really broke, and a ton of those names people \"wouldn't mind owning\" fell 90% and stayed there for decades.

        "body": "&gt;But the price still needs to be &lt;$1.2 per mile for the economics to work out for people to want to dump their own cars. And that\u2019s assuming the current prices of cars, which would drop in parallel with per-mile prices dropping for AVs.\n\nI think one of the big pieces of this is transforming the general public's mindset about driving. There's a very strong car ownership culture in America that does need to be unwound (does not exist nearly as much in European cities or in China) wherein people are not correctly recognizing that time driving is **uncompensated labor**. The  layer of resistance is getting people to ditch their cars, and that may mean operating at breakeven or loss. After they've ditched their cars, they may become dependent on the service and may also begin to rethink the act of driving and discover that *not driving* affords them the opportunity to regain leisure time. While some people certainly enjoy driving and enjoy commuting, I think a lot of people would also benefit from being able to take naps in the car, play games, read Reddit, etc and be willing to pay a premium (slight or large) to avoid driving. \n\nPersonal anecdote: When I was living outside of SF, I would often Uber into the city instead of drive because (1) I didn't want to deal with parking my car and paying for parking (2) I wanted to be able to drink and not worry about DUIs (3) It was often cheaper to use public transit / Uber than to pay for gas, wear and tear (I drive a nice car), and parking (4) I like being able to browse the internet instead of drive. While the cost to operate that uber on a per mile might have been sub &lt;$2 I was willing to pay more money because of all of those factors.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Also, she\u2019s saying an $11T opportunity - that would typically be market size (i.e. revenue per year), not market cap\u2026 and autonomous trucks are a stretch to label \u201ctaxis\u201d.\n\nI'm not really here to defend Cathie's numbers. I think they assume a much faster adoption rate than what I think is realistic, but I think that there's something inbetween what the average layperson thinks and her hyperbolic projection (though in all honesty, much closer to Cathie's projection than what's being alluded to in this thread). What I'm here to push on is the closemindedness being displayed by a lot of the doubters in this Reddit post. AV is coming and it's going to be a multi-trillion dollar opportunity that has planetscale impact. It's also coming a lot earlier than many people expect. \n\nI think a realistic TAM for the entire AV space (Taxis, public transit, and trucking) over the next 10 years is around $2T-3T revenue per year, and I would be surprised if the company that launches the first AV ridesharing network doesn't reach a $1T market cap within 10 years of debut. If we expand beyond pure driving and include sale of data, advertisement, oracle services, etc., I think revenue could get up to above $5T per year, though I don't think that AV companies will go that route immediately for fear of regulation. \n\nI think that the biggest constraint on bringing this to market is going to be manufacturing capability. Even if every single automaker in the world pivoted to becoming OEMs for the AV space, we probably aren't able to outfit enough AVs to meet AV demand, which is why I think a 20 year horizon on the &gt;$10T revenue mark is more prudent.",

I hold all the major players in cloud computing, semiconductors, hardware, and defense, as well as some random one-offs like Paypal, Tesla, and Honeywell. Tesla is the perfect example of a stock I wouldn\u2019t recommend, even though I\u2019m holding it. It helps to be sitting on some gains and having taken a lot off the table already. But if you look at the major tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, who are crushing the earnings and skyrocketing, they seem \u201cvery high\u201d, but their P/E\u2019s are not necessarily higher than they\u2019ve ever been. It\u2019s hard to say I\u2019d buy at these levels, but I\u2019m certainly holding. Oracle and General Dynamics are the only stocks I\u2019ve bought this year. But again, I see it as filling out a larger strategy of cloud computing and defense. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend those as a single holding. Oracle continues to be a player in database and cloud software and with General Dynamics, it\u2019s hard to see who would ever replace them and I don\u2019t see navy ships and submarines going out of style.",

Note, too, there was a DoorDash survival thread from a few days ago the looks pretty identical. What I wrote there, and I'll write again:\n\n&gt;\\[H\\]ere's the high-level bullish case on why it may be quite risky to short them:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Their revenue is growing at 2x per year -- 200% -- that's tremendous growth you can't find in too many other places and has held steady for 3 quarters.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;They have 4B in cash on hand, so even if they lose 100M/quarter, as the did recently, they can still stay afloat for 40 quarters  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Most important, cost of revenue (money going to drivers, restaurants and coupons) is only 52% of revenue  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What this last point means is that once they stop being in growth mode, they can presumably cut other costs significantly and still have a nice profit margin. That is, if they fire all the coders and middle managers, their margin would be 48%, which is plenty good. if people are hooked and they get rid of coupons and start squeezing restaurants and drivers, they'll make even more.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Or another observation: if they return to the same proportion of cost of revenue from 9/2020 (43% vs. 52%), but just stay the same size, they'd have broken precisely even, even with all their inefficiencies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When your face is pressed close to the glass, it can be hard to see economies of scale at this size.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Disclosure: I wouldn't touch the stock, long or short, with a 10 foot pole. I'm not crazy.\n\nand\n\n&gt;\\[To\\] reiterate the bull case (there's a million reasons why this wouldn't come to fruition) but back-of-the-envelope: restaurant revenue is \\~$1T, takeout \\~$300B, Doordash could eventually take 10% of that, say $30B, which puts revenue just below Oracle, about the same as Tesla, Raytheon and HPE. Those market caps are $250B, $700B, $130B and $20B.So, if you squint, DoorDash at $60B can slot right in there.I could do a fancy due diligence thing with forward free cash flow yadda yadda yadda, but I'm not that committed.\n\nHope that's what you were actually looking for.",

First of all, they're totally different companies with different businesses, but Palantir was founded in 2003 and AI was founded in 2009. So 6 year head start, which is a good thing IMO. They haven't yet reached the egregious overloaded market cap of Palantir yet, which allows us as investors to get in early on a promising company. \n\nAlso, I think Thomas Siebel is a very promising leader for the company. He was a part of Oracle and started Siebel Solutions (which merger with Oracle) and are both very successful software companies. He has the experience, has done it twice before, and it's cutting edge. They're growing rapidly at a sustainable pace. I'll definitely be holding my shares for the next decade. Been selling covered calls on them as well, so basically the shares were free at this point since IV has been so high but the stock has barely moved for months.",

        "body": "\"TECH seems played out\"\n\n???\n\nBuddy - I just can't even. \n\nMSFT reports that there are currently 1.3 B devices running Windows 10. If MSFT pushes some subscription like \"we'll do anti-virus for you for $1 per device per year\" and they get 10% adoption - that's $130 M in additional revenue in the blink of an eye.\n\nAAPL has an estimated 900 M active iPhones.  Again if they (and they did) bundle Apple TV, Music, and News, and they get 10% uptake (I think I got a deal for like $25 per month for a family membership), they're going to add - let's do quick, rough math:\n\n900 M devices, Family plan is for 5, so divide by 5\n180 M \"families\" (rough and dirty)\n10% of 180 M = 18 M\n18 M * $25 per month = 450 M monthly\n450 M * 12 = 5.4 B in additional annual revenue.\n\nYou know how many companies have a MARKET CAP greater than 5.4 B?\n\nAccording to https://companiesmarketcap.com/page/23/ it's 2249 companies *globally*\n\nIn fact, I scrolled through pages just to find the break point - according to that data, Macy's has a total market cap of $5.41 B, on the list at like position 2246.\n\nGuess who are the #1 and #2 ?  AAPL and MSFT. BRK.A is on that list at #8, and Buffet can't find a better tech opportunity than holding AAPL at over 5% of his portfolio.\n\nMSFT's growth couldn't possibly be *less* played out.  They are making huge inroads with cloud deployments despite AWS's continued dominance, Azure is very likely to run up the market share pie slice over the next 10 years.\n\nThey can easily acquire to continue to add revenue to their books, and there are \"killer apps\" we haven't even dreamed up that will run their workloads on Azure or a competitor without question.\n\nThere is no \"played out\" in tech. There is *only* tech going forward. \n\nBuffet is holding 26.2% of BRK.A in Kraft Heinz - people like ketchup and hot dogs for sure - but where is Kraft putting their money?\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/uk/kraft-heinz-invest-199-million-british-manufacturing-facility-2021-06-01/\n\nNearly $200 M in a manufacturing facility that's going to \"add 50 jobs\"\n\nSo - automation. That factory will be the highest tech piece of kit in that part of the UK by miles.\n\nWhat kind of companies might be vying for the software to run such a facility?\n\nMSFT has a whole division called Dynamics that can compete with the ERP giants of SAP and Oracle.  I worked for SAP once upon a time, so while Dynamics isn't at that Royal Dutch Shell level of ERP, they are certainly in the $200 M manufacturing facility range with a very compelling offering.\n\nAnyway - I'm ranting on here a bit - but your post requires a lot more thought on your part.\n\nI think you're literally out of your damn mind to think that MSFT and AAPL will \"trade sideways and uptrend at index rates for the next few years\"\n\nIt literally only takes one new product, one new announcement, from either company, as demonstrated with napkin math above, to add billions in revenue to their balance sheets.  They've been doing it consistently for a very, very long time.  \n\nI think it's a mistake on your part to assume that just because MSFT and AAPL have been relatively quiet during Covid that their teams are just resting on their laurels and not working on the next game-changing technologies that we'll all be using sooner than you think.\n\nFucking LOOOOOOOONG MSFT and AAPL.",

There are plenty of examples of widely used software that are not open sourced and easily outcompete the open source counterparts. Windows and Mac in Desktop/Laptop space. Office by Microsoft. Database products by AWS/Oracle. Content creation software by Adobe. Many more.\n\n\\&gt; it's Apple vs. the world.\n\nAnd Apple has won in *every single* field they have entered. Self-driving and VR are upcoming techs, but just because its Apple vs world doesn't mean Apple will be at a huge disadvantage. Indeed, it is the world that is at disadvantage when Apple enters a field.\n\n\\&gt; Apple also charges a fee to develop apps. It's free on Android.\n\nDespite iOS being less than 20% of market, more than 50% of revenue developers make are on iOS. Not sure what fee are you talking about, but the fact that iOS is still a priority for developers despite them having to pay a fee actually puts Android in bad light.\n\n\\&gt; iOS it is a massive pain\n\n99% of people on this planet just download from App Store directly, whether it is iOS or Android.\n\n\\&gt; The reality is they're losing margin on their phones\n\niPhones are the most profitable item at Apple, accounting for majority of their profits.

This would be the biggest scam in the history of mankind.\n\n\\&gt; Also we are at peak phones now - I only see downward pressure on margins due to the competition\n\nActually, if you think that smartphone sales are at peak (which is incorrect), then Apple is even more likely to maintain sales (generally, people who buy cheap &lt;$400 Android are less likely to buy a phone when new one comes out when old one works just fine).\n\n\\&gt; I always felt their original PE ratio\n\nPE ratio is high for companies who have high growth potential. Microsoft has been doing not bad in cloud segment and cloud segment market is not even at 5% potential. Now obviously, *you* don't think Apple and Microsoft will grow in future, but others do; so naturally, you would say their PE ratio is high.\n\n\\&gt; This was true years ago. Not true anymore.\n\nBased on sales of phones with cost &gt;= $700, Apple dominates and they do that with iPhone 12 more than they did with any other iPhone apart from iPhone 6.",

        "body": "&gt;Not sure if I\u2019m missing it\u2026 the document you linked here shows the fund she manages following the trend of the market, yet still having higher returns.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Didn\u2019t know looking like a modest librarian helps you con billions out of people. If I learned anything from my time in sales, it\u2019s usually the hot blondes (think Katie Holmes) that have an easier time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s an oracle, I\u2019m saying she has been doing better than the market for decades now. And that\u2019s an incredible achievement in the world of finance. I\u2019m rather curious as to why people are jumping on some sort of bandwagon against her using \u201cthis article says she didn\u2019t predict the future! she\u2019s a joke!\u201d as some sort of evidence that her investment decisions are poor.\n\nFirstly, [have a look at this long-term record she created at her previous outfit](https://imgur.com/a/233jqI3). Her previous financial backer asked her to leave. Think about it. Why do you think they'd ask the great-and-almighty financial beast &amp; guru Cathy Wood to leave? Obviously she wasn't that good. She took from all her \"investors\" 2% of their portfolio as management fees. She took twice what they made !!\n\nSecondly, I don't expect to convince you; and, I am not attacking you. I have an issue with Cathy. I don't like Cathy Wood because I think she is a total sales person. The normal hedge fund and active investing fund is all about marketing. They want clients. Clients bring in money which they can siphon. They have huge presentations with great big powerpoints and amazing ohh-ahh graphs. If you look at the Roaring 20s, you had every so-called investor duping people out of their savings with amazing visions of the future - innovation, new financial systems, booming economic developments, new fresh &amp; rising markets, exciting ever-changing technologies, new communication and - best of all - everyone is going to get rich and make 200% per year. Same thing in the 1950s. Some investor I was reading about collected sums from admiring people and the whole thing flopped after a few years. In 1999, Alexander Cheung from the Monument Fund - after returning 117.3%, predicted his fund would gain 50%+ a year\r on the horizon. And it was new technology - the buzz word. Cathy Wood mentions all the right words. She talks about all the hyped-up exciting mega-sexy ideas of our times like space-travel, gene splicing, cry7ptocurrency, electric cars, semiconductors, RobinHood - and people love her. She doesn't discuss company fundamentals or their balance sheets. Who cares about the financials - people want drama and excitement, and that's what she does. I watched her in an interview, she said \"I want to improve humanity\". This woman just says all the uplifting and mesmerising lines people want to hear. You feel like you're part of something bigger than you. You're going to shape the planet. It's like how a minister speaks. And - of course - we're all going to get rich.\n\nAnyhow. This is how it looks to me, and it upsets me that people will lose so much of their savings going with this egomaniac. If you're a hardcore believer in Cathy Wood then probably nothing I could say would make any difference. At least, I hope you can see a different perspective.\n\nAll the bets with your investments :)",
