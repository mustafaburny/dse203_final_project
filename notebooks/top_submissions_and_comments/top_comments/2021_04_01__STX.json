Great question.  Maybe the better question is why did I keep those 3?  \n\nThe answer is because I still see great share price growth value ahead of both EPR and MO though for different reasons and the SMHB yield (based on pre covid historicals) could yield as high as 72% based on my purchase price.  Though I only collected 10.14% in 2020 and 6.82% so far in 2021.  EPR has yet to reinstate its dividend and I fully expect that when they do, their share price will see a large upward move.  And MO?  Well... it is my opinion that Altria is uniquely positioned to be the largest player in the budding legalized marijuana industry in the USA.  So obviously I will hold that until such a time when that new industry can be realized and profited from and pocket a 9.54% yield (2020 actual) in the meantime.\n\nBut the reality is, I didn't buy some of the best dividend paying companies at the 2020 bottom because I wanted the dividend.  In fact... dividend investing is mostly a waste of time unless you plan on buying and forgetting... in which case... it still is since you'd be better off in an index fund.",

        "body": "This is very cool! Thank you for sharing. I've been doing a lazier man's version of this with different \"super funds\" or pies on M1 since it's built to do just that. They actually do something similar in their app where they compile 10-position funds weighted on 13F filings from some funds and then you can choose to add specific ones to your pie and they update it once 13Fs are released. They call it \"Hedge Fund Followers.\" \n\nI thought it was a super cool idea when I discovered it in their app and you're pretty much taking it to the next level and making it more personalized and concentrated. That said, based on your fund I feel like you align a lot with the M1 ValueAct Capital fund which was a favorite of mine as well.\nTheirs is currently: 22%seagate, 19% ciitbank, 18% KKR, 9% LKQ, 8% trinity, 8% CBRE, 4% Bausch, etc...\n\nIt's not as composed as yours, but considering I just have to click a button to add it to my portfolio it's a nice lazy version of what you're doing, hah.\n\nGlad to hear you got good returns and curious to see how it works out going forward. How active will you be managing it? One thing I like about the M1 doing it for me is I just set it and forget it and it will update over time without me having to... allowing me to focus on my long term personal holdings.\n\nCheers!",

Ownership structure is rather opaque for companies in china, even if its a subsidiary but thats not the point of discussion. \n\nMy point is incorporated =/= founded. Many US companies also incorporate its HQ overseas. I mean you wouldn't call Seagate an irish company back when its HQ was established in ireland would you.",
