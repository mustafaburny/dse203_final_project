So they have a lower risk associated with them.\n\nHowever to your comment, the disadvantage is that they don't seem to execute super well in any areas. AutoCAD, their 2d software, is industry leading, but a dying bread. Revit, their structural and architecture software, seems to be solid (I am unsure here, I'm a mech eng). Fusion 360, the free 3d modeling platform, is solid, but also free so it doesn't directly drive revenue.\n\nAnother observation is that it seems like in the modeling and simulation world, you can either have a good user interface or a program that consistently works. But no one has both. A huge risk to Autodesk is that if a competitor comes in and can deliver a program that's easy to use and actually works, that firm will win.\n\nConclusion? To me it seems like Autodesk is the best positioned from investing standpoint but the industry as a whole is pretty risky. Someone is going to win and win big. But who? I think it's speculative at this point.",

Only Maya managed to keep its clients and that's because , animation wise, they don't have competitors yet. They lost their grip on all the other departments like FX (Maya replaced by Houdini), texturing (Substance instead of Mudbox) and so on.\nAnd before I was working in the architecture field, there are a lot of cheap or even free CAD softwares so buying AutoCAD is not mandatory to work.",

Honestly if it wasn't for the animators autodesk would have lost the sector as a whole. They aren't able to innovate themselves.  \nHoudini has become the lead software for FXs, in the last years it pushed to get a portion of the game development and it's now pushing to get the market for layout and lighting.",

When cisco or autodesk need money they just screw over their existing customers by jacking up sub fees.  ATVI is hot and everyone is becoming a video game junkie nowadays and they're printing money's.  Personally I think AMD is overvalued and it tends to just pop when anything bad happens.  Same with Nvidia it's like either everyone is buying it like crazy or selling.  Those new Nvidia chips look really badass.",

All expiry 7/17. All about 50% down. If we open green ill be down probably 60-70%. Question is - since they are not too far OTM and still have a month and a half till expiry, AND all this crazy shit goin on supporting my original put buying motivation, should I hold and wait for a mini-correction?",

Their moves have been very smart in terms of expanding their moat around management by vertically integrating. They've also moved towards building a platform for third parties and lead the industry in terms of market share. Their software is also very sticky with contractors often forcing developers to buy into the platform as a condition of work. They are also profitable. \n\nTheir early moves have paid off. In their S-1 they talk about the procore platform being taught many schools as well. \n\nIt's all super exciting LOL.

People pirating the software go on to work at companies that buy the same software.  \n\nDitto to OSS, or free accounts below a certain threshold... they are effectively marketing costs to grow the user base which you later hope to monetize.\n\nAs a prime example, I use Fusion360 as a hobbyist.  But if I ever transitioned to a business where I needed to use CAD/CAM for my dayjob, there's a strong chance I'd reach for Fusion because I already know it.  And then I'd be a paying customer (or my boss would be).\n\nRegarding Autodesk in particular, I think they've done a really good job marketing Fusion to students and hobbyists, and are continually adding in functionality from their other software offerings.  It's all over the 3d printing and hobbyist CNC sphere, and at least some of those people will be pushing to use it at their day job.  \n\nNot to say it's the better software by any means, whole industries are entrenched in competitors (CATIA / NX for aero, etc), but they've done a pretty good job pushing the hobby/student angle imo.",

You can find forum posts from 8 years ago with issues that have still never actually been fixed the way they should. I honestly liked inventor more when I was in school, but I haven't used it in 5 years or so.\n\nI still think there is a lot of room for growth, there are sooo many companies in manufacturing still doing things the old school way.\n\nPersonally I am not invested in ADSK but I considered it. I am just not familiar enough with the software at this point to keep up and I think it is overvalued, so I believe the downside risk is greater than the potential returns.",
