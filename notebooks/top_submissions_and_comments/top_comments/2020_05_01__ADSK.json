        "body": "I see Autodesk as having a huge advantage in the sense that they have many products across many different areas. So they have a lower risk associated with them.\n\nHowever to your comment, the disadvantage is that they don't seem to execute super well in any areas. AutoCAD, their 2d software, is industry leading, but a dying bread. Revit, their structural and architecture software, seems to be solid (I am unsure here, I'm a mech eng). Fusion 360, the free 3d modeling platform, is solid, but also free so it doesn't directly drive revenue.\n\nAnother observation is that it seems like in the modeling and simulation world, you can either have a good user interface or a program that consistently works. But no one has both. A huge risk to Autodesk is that if a competitor comes in and can deliver a program that's easy to use and actually works, that firm will win.\n\nConclusion? To me it seems like Autodesk is the best positioned from investing standpoint but the industry as a whole is pretty risky. Someone is going to win and win big. But who? I think it's speculative at this point.",

People pirating the software go on to work at companies that buy the same software.  \n\nDitto to OSS, or free accounts below a certain threshold... they are effectively marketing costs to grow the user base which you later hope to monetize.\n\nAs a prime example, I use Fusion360 as a hobbyist.  But if I ever transitioned to a business where I needed to use CAD/CAM for my dayjob, there's a strong chance I'd reach for Fusion because I already know it.  And then I'd be a paying customer (or my boss would be).\n\nRegarding Autodesk in particular, I think they've done a really good job marketing Fusion to students and hobbyists, and are continually adding in functionality from their other software offerings.  It's all over the 3d printing and hobbyist CNC sphere, and at least some of those people will be pushing to use it at their day job.  \n\nNot to say it's the better software by any means, whole industries are entrenched in competitors (CATIA / NX for aero, etc), but they've done a pretty good job pushing the hobby/student angle imo.",

Personally I feel a small 10-15% correction is coming this summer and so I'm not holding any of the stocks that have rebounded to ATH's.  IE, if feb was a bubble, and we're back at feb prices, then this is an even bigger bubble.  It's not that I feel like there is a lot of downside risk to revenues / earnings and the 2020 forecast is solid, I'm simply holding off for a better entry point.  ADBE, ADSK, VMW, CSCO - love em all and I think they'll navigate this change stronger then ever.",

So I used inheritance received the beginning of this year to pay off my student loans and stashed the remaining 55k into a brokerage account. I started gradually buying into the following positions starting March 18 and have built it up to 68k. Hindsight 20/20, of course I wish I'd gone all in at that point instead of waiting for a lower bottom. As a noob investor with some tech knowledge, the naive strategy was to only buy companies that I personally use in some capacity... well, violated that strategy with NAT fomo and got burned hard! I would be super appreciative on any advice for rebalancing my positions or diversifying into other sectors. I can afford some risk but I'm looking for long term growth as I start work this summer.

Yeah the breakout stock in a recession/depression with extreme unemployment is a solar company that has high costs to convert struggling businesses/homeowners from fossil fuel dependency to solar dependency. Maybe if things were going really well for businesses and consumers, this would. And it probably will be in the future. But to say with 30% or whatever of citizens out of work and majority of businesses showing decreased revenue and earnings, now is clearly not the time to pay a big up front fee to convert when they\u2019re worried about paying employees and leases next month. Long shares, sure. Calls a month out? Fuck no. Maybe leaps. **maybe**. Even jpow said this shit economy will take longer than originally expected to bounce back. Enph is cyclical, it drives up then drives down. I would be weary and trying to find a peak to sell your shares and I goddamn sure wouldn\u2019t be buying a call.\n\nAlso as another comment posted, your claim of 97.5% efficiency from solar panels is only attainable if you have some fucking alien technology, they all sit around 20% and MAX 45%. Ain\u2019t no fucking business or consumer paying 10,000% premium to squeeze an extra 20% off efficiency when I can connect to city power for 1/25 of the upfront cost and even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a recoup of my initial upfront investment of \u201cgoing green\u201d for 5 years.

I don\u2019t think they are necessarily \u201ccompetitors\u201d as they do different things, but they are both the leaders in the industry. \n\nENPH is a pretty great company, with great growth prospects. Although, ENPH is definitely trading at more of a premium in comparison right now, due to crushing its most recent earnings and providing solid outlook. \n\nENPH\u2019s business model is not as capital intensive as you might think, as during 2020Q1 they reported their highest GP margin ever, and their TTM profit margin is higher than SEDGs (31.2% to 10.7%). \n\nI think I might open a position in SEDG within the next week, as I think it\u2019s at pretty fair value right now.
