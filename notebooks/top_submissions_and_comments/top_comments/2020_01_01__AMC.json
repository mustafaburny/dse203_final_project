They also have a new SVP who has been seemingly making big changes.\n\nI don\u2019t think the stock can drop much lower. We should have a good Q4 call. I think it will be perceived in a way that will cause a rebound, that rebound will likely be compounded by the fresh new management making changes, they can also adjust the dividend to make the entire company profitable, and we will see a rebirth in movie theater value in the perception of the masses.\n\nBut for now the masses just have no faith.
