This is exactly what is needed for them to increase their margins, likely by 3x easily.\n\nHopefully they will continue to develop easier-to-implement software solutions that they can sell major subscriptions for and spend less time setting things up (boots on ground).\n\nI'm also banking on them having a simpler and publicly available product that smaller-size consumers can benefit from.\n\nPersonally I also like their mix of commercial and govt contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir future growth potential is absolutely nuts. We've all heard about Target's crazy monitoring software that can tell you when a customer is pregnant before they even know. Imagine ANY company being able to have that capability (and more), without having to build it in-house. How much would you be willing to pay Palantir to 1.2-1.5x your revenue in a single year? \n\nCompanies know that building these types of tools and data analytic programs are HARD. A company like Palantir could really become the goto source for the most advanced type of data analysis. And they will only get better... Why?...\n\nBecause once you solve tough problems for one vertical you can solve it for others in the same vertical for cheaper. So initial cost of setting up data strategy for Nike might be ($10M, loss). But now Adidas wants the same fancy tech and data. The problem space has already been solved! So cost is now +$10M (profit).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSame shit can apply to any vertical industry. Automotive, manufacturing, services, help centers, IT, healthcare, etc... Solve the problem for one company (make less money), then apply solution to other companies (major moolas).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm bullish because I *need* to be.",

I held SSSS calls yesterday, thinking \"alright don't panic sell...\" only for the underlying stock to tank 10% more today. \n\nAt this point I'm just chasing losses.

        "body": "That is when factors that Nikola can't control come into effect. Their positioning on everything I think is to prop stock price until then, which used to include the now canceled Nikola World. \n\nThings that happen in Dec.\n\n1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. \n2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.\n\nQuarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. \n\nRest is storytime:\n\nIf this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.\nSell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. \n\nSo how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the \"new management\" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. \n\nSo the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:\n\nhttps://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98\n\nOkay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.\n\nFantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.\n\nBut there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.\n\nNow we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone. \n\nI know that was long story time. But if you believe they are fraud, then think about what you would need to do if you knew it was a fraud and had millions locked up and you wanted out with out seeing the inside of a jail cell.",

Big money is putting the funds into the market, because it\u2019s one of the only way to make returns right now. Savings accounts are shit because of the lowered interest rates. It\u2019s easier to borrow money, so the banks are lending and people are putting the money into real estate (inflated asset prices)...same with gold, silver, etc.\n\nThe majority of the population don\u2019t understand economics, so they don\u2019t realize how fucked everything is right now. I assume the fed dishes the money out with good intentions, but smart money understands how fucked the economy is and will be in the future. They\u2019re just trying to make as much as they can before the real crash, and the wealth gap will be tremendous.",
