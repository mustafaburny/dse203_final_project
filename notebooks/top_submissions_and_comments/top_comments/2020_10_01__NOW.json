The thing is that somebody tickle with what inflation or deflation is gonna do down the road or keep rates 0% for the next 3 years, you gotta give me a break with that. And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted. I just wish he would back away from financial markets, because that is not going to be about real economy and employers and employee. Not him tinkering with printing money and buying APPL bonds.\n\nHe is not wrong though.",

The company filed bankruptcy and as part of the restructuring dropped their outstanding shares into warrants, at a conversion of 2.5%. The warrants are good for three years for the new ticker, DEN. Long story short, the company fucked you big time. Turned your shares into shit, restructured, launched new shares at around $17 a share and now have a shit ton of cash and you have a warrant for the new stock. Good luck. \n\nPlus side, the warrants are up 96% premarket today, told you to buy the dip....lol",

There is a reason they have already been able to enforce the patents against random Chinese companies.\n\nDon't believe me? Lets look at what happened when Google Waymo, one of the largest companies in the world, tried to sue Uber for LIDAR patent infringement:\n\n[https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html](https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) **rejected 53 out of 56 claims in Waymo's 936 patent**...One of the reasons for the rejection is that some of the core design solutions were **previously patented by another lidar manufacturer, Velodyne**. Coincidentally, Velodyne used to sell its lidars to Waymo before the latter decided to build a product of its own from scratch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Theoretically, **Velodyne could now accuse Waymo of infringing its own 558 patent**, based on the USPTO's recent ruling.",
