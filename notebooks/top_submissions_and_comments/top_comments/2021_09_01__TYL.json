Compared to peers (Axon, Magnet Forensics, Tyler Technologies, etc...), it should be trading at a multiple that has it at $20-$30/shr. But even with the coverage, it has no fanfare, no uptick in sp, I really don't understand the lack of market sentiment on it. I'm heavily in it as a long term value play, so I'll wait as long as it takes for the market to get caught up.",
