        "body": "There is no downside to taking his advice (outside of the options, in which case there is risk). The way I see it, there are a 2 variables: take his advice or not, he is right or wrong, buy options or not (as a subcategory of whether or not you take his advice). Broken down:\n\n1.) he is right, you take his advice and buy options: make money. OR, if you don't buy options and simply pull from the market, stocks are cheap after the dip and you have tons of liquidity. \n\n2.) He is right, you don't take his advice: you lose 20% of your gains and it puts you in the red for a couple of months. \n\n3.) he is wrong, you take his advice and buy options: your options expire worthless and you are out proportional to your option contracts. OR, if you don't buy options, you miss a week to a month of market trading. \n\n4.) he is wrong, you don't take his advice: yeet, you got to stay in the market for a couple weeks with no downside. \n\nHowever, I have to say that his DD looks good. I know this is a meme-ish subreddit that fully encapsulates the modern fusion of entertainment and information, but his shit should be taken seriously, and there just isn't a proven method yet to go full bear while remaining memable until it is too late. I am 100% on his side here. I've been following Steven for the past couple months and he really does know his shit. He might be wrong, anyone may be, but I have good reason to believe that he is more correct in market trading than others. \n\nFor me, I bought TLT (because I am stupid and risk-averse and don't want to get into options trading) at its low a couple weeks ago @155$ and I have only seen it go up ever since.\n\nIf you want my unironic trading strategy: I trust Russians when they talk about chess, gay men when they talk about art, and autistics when they talk about the market (related side-note: look up his youtube channel. For me, the fact that he doesn't shill it speaks to his integrity.) Steven is right, and if you want to avoid the coming dip listen to him. \n\nAll in all though, you can't go wrong. Stocks will EVENTUALLY return back to where they are now, but many stocks still haven't gotten back to pre-lockdown levels. With all the market indicators AND the news AND this DD, I think it is worth it to pull back for a couple weeks until at least after Thanksgiving/Christmas. TBH, I am hoping for airlines and TSLA to take a nosedive so I can score some cheapies with (nearly) guaranteed long-term returns. \n\nFinal point: Steven is worth listening to BECAUSE he doesn't day-trade. Day traders get too caught up in the ebbs and flows of the weekly shit; he does macro. I don't listen to him to know which specific stocks are going up or down, I listen to him to know general market trends (his Sunday night market charts are fuckin' choice, my dudes). \n\nTo Steven: This place is a meme-zone. I can guarantee that the people who are taking your advice aren't posting, and the rest are still giving you shit because that's the meme (perma-bull). To draw from a religious source (gasp): there is a reason it was so common to say, \"whoever has ears, let them hear\"; it's just that some people just don't have the ears for this. Wisdom is wasted on them who don't listen.",

        "body": "Ok because you guys are actually too stupid to understand how this works, I'm just going to copy and paste from Matt Levine.\n\nTL;DR: Robinhood profits because retail trades are random, so HF traders can actually get a small spread. Your prices will be better than institutional prices (so we're winning at the expense of the big boyz).  \n\n\n&gt;Robinhood\u2019s business model is:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Citadel gives it money.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It uses the money to give you free stock trades.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That really is taking money from the rich (high-frequency traders) to give to the poor, sort of (millennials who want to trade stocks on their phones).\u00a0Who did you *think*\u00a0was giving it money?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Not only that. Payment for order flow really is \u201cone of the most controversial practices on Wall Street,\u201d but [the controversy tends to be confused and obfuscated](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-02-25/-flash-boys-exchange-isn-t-about-the-little-guy). The basic idea of payment for order flow is that electronic market makers want to be left alone to quietly make the spread: They want to buy stock for $99.99 and sell it at $100.01 and clip two cents on each trade. If their orders are random\u2014if sometimes people buy and sometimes they sell, with no pattern\u2014then that works out well for the market makers. But their big risk is what they call \u201cadverse selection\u201d: Sometimes, when a customer buys 100 shares at $100.01, it then buys another 100 shares at $100.02, and another 100 shares at $100.03, and keeps going until it has bought 10,000 shares and pushed the price up dramatically. The market maker who sold it the first 100 shares\u2014and who is probably now short and needs to go out and buy those shares at a higher price\u2014has been run over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is a risk of being a market maker on the public stock exchanges: Sometimes you sell 100 shares to a small retail investor and it\u2019s random noise; other times you sell 100 shares to Fidelity and you get run over. But if a market maker can guarantee that it will\u00a0*only*\u00a0interact with retail customers\u2014if it can filter out big orders from institutional investors\u2014then its risk of adverse selection goes way down. The way the market maker does this is by paying retail brokers to send it their order flow, and promising those brokers that it will execute their orders\u00a0*better*\u00a0than the public markets would. (This is called \u201cprice improvement,\u201d and allows the retail brokers to fulfill their obligation to give their customers \u201cbest execution.\u201d) So if a stock is quoted at $99.99 bid, $100.01 offered on the public exchanges, the market maker might buy it from retail customers for $99.991 or sell it to them at\u00a0$100.009. (It\u2019s not usually\u00a0*much*\u00a0price improvement.) It can offer a tighter spread than the public markets\u2014and have money left over to pay the retail brokers\u2014because it doesn\u2019t have to worry about adverse selection. If the retail broker is, say, one designed to let young people day-trade for free on their phones, then those orders are probably particularly valuable, because they are probably particularly random.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are two objections to this practice. One is that it is bad for investors whose orders *aren\u2019t*\u00a0sold to market makers, the institutional investors who instead trade on\u00a0public stock exchanges. Payment for order flow\u00a0fragments the markets, takes retail order flow away from the public stock exchanges, widens out spreads on those exchanges, and, by segregating retail and institutional orders, makes institutional execution worse. This objection is probably true! If you\u2019re a hedge-fund manager, you should dislike payment for order flow, because it makes public markets worse for you. (If you invest through mutual funds, as I do, you should also dislike it, for the same reason.)\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The other objection is that payment for order flow is bad for investors whose orders\u00a0*are*\u00a0sold to market makers, the retail investors whose orders never touch the stock exchange. If the market makers are paying to get their orders, surely they are doing something nefarious with them, right? Otherwise why would they pay? This objection seems mostly wrong. Very occasionally there is some\u00a0evidence of [market makers doing naughty stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-01/tesla-will-try-to-be-more-normal) with the retail orders that they buy, but for the most part, particularly for simple market orders,\u00a0the result is straightforward: Retail customers are instantly able to buy stock at a price at least as good as, and usually better than, the best price available in the public markets. And the market makers pay their brokers for the privilege, so the brokers can offer cheaper (even free!) stock trades. They are unambiguously better off than they would be if their brokers didn\u2019t sell their orders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So by selling its customers\u2019 orders to market makers, Robinhood is actually stealing from two sets of \u201cthe rich\u201d: Rich market makers like Citadel are paying it directly for the orders, while rich hedge-fund managers are getting worse execution on public stock exchanges so that Robinhood customers can get better executions off those exchanges. Big institutions are paying to subsidize free trades for Robinhood\u2019s customers. It feels pretty Robin-Hood-y! If I were Robinhood I would advertise that!\u00a0\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-16/carl-icahn-wants-to-fight-dell-again?sref=2jPYL79S](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-16/carl-icahn-wants-to-fight-dell-again?sref=2jPYL79S)",

While I can appreciate these bull runs; everyday that I able to leave the house (which isnt often bc were back to shelter in place order) I think to myself...what the eff is going on? How anyone has any confidence in the condition of this market is hard for me to understand. \n\nYour main street businesses here are tanking. Restaurants closed with no commercial lease relief. Commercial real estate IMO has lost its mind. There are landlords here with tenants that have been closed for going on 8 months and the landlords are still refusing to make concessions.\n\nKids are not in school. The entire city entertainment base is gone. Want to go to the city for dinner and a show? Not anymore.  How about a ball game? Nope. Hotels? Lol.\n\nWhy does this matter? I dont really care about the health of the Chicago Cubs financially bc I know they can borrow from the MLB but there are literally hundreds of thousands of jobs here that are just gone now. There is an astounding amount of people out of work.\n\nChicago itself looks like a demilitarized zone. Michigan Avenue has store Gucci store with plywood over the windows and black spray on the front that says \"were open.\"\n\nThere is no consensus here. No clear guidance. The restrictions seem piece meal and have not been effective. \n\nResidential tenants are not paying their rent. Landlords get no relief. The eviction moratorium continues with no end in sight. \n\nBut yet, everyone is expected to survive on what exactly? Unemployment benefits in this state are abysmal.\n\nYet Tesla is up? Who the eff is gonna be left to buy a tesla? Zoom, Twilio. Fasly? The tech stocks. Half this stuff is only applicable to your upper middle class. I guarantee you the guy with the taco cart outside Wrigley Field (and the thousands of others just like him) who has a very real family he has to support doesnt care, or use or contribute to the macro of twilio.\n\nYou have a sweeping divide happening right now. If you're corporate and can work from home you can survive right now. But working class, service, front of the house has been done for 6 plus months. \n\nHow they've let this demographic of people go on this long with no assistance is unconscionable. \n\nI dont know how this ends but at some point the reality of the spending power of the people that is now just gone has to set in. It has to.",

        "body": "For anyone that's lost on what I just said, since I had a few people message me and I typed this up for them. \n\nSo, the MMM is the Market Maker Move. It's the dollar move that the market makers are expecting the stock price to move in either the up or down direction.\n\nNow why does that matter? The MMM is what is already \"priced in\" to the options that are expiring during the week of the earnings report. So if for a example, the stock price of NIO is $40, and the MMM is +/- $5, then all of the options with a strike price that fall within the $35-45 range will lose money after earnings is reported because the price of the options have that move \"priced in\".  So essentially, in order for you to make money on options held through earnings, you either need to be deep ITM or the stock price needs to move more than the MMM.\n\nThe IV is the implied volatility of the stock. Or how high or low the movement of the stock price is expected to move. So in this case NIO. This is because there's a highly anticipated event this week (earnings). So why does this matter? Another factor that influences the price of options is the IV. For every 1% that IV increases or decreases, the price of the option increases or decreases by the amount that's listed as the Greek known as Vega. So if we know the IV of options expiring this week (the week of NIO's earnings) as opposed to next week's options then we can get a good idea of how much IV is \"priced in\" or how much money we can expect to lose due to \"IV crush\", which is where the option loses value because the IV decreases, which brings down the value of options even if the stock price is moving in our desired direction.\n\nThe next thing is the standard deviations. They're basically a probability equation that I really don't know off the top of my head or enough to explain without looking up, BUT all you need to know in terms of the stock price is that for every one standard deviation increase, the range at which the stock price can increase or decrease from its current price increases in size. So essentially, there's a higher probability that it'll stay between that given range. Now why does this matter? Playing spreads with options, especially for earnings is much, much safer, cheaper, and in some cases gets you paid as opposed to you having to pay for the options. If we know the price range and the probability at which the stock price may stay inside that range, then we can plan appropriately and increase our odds of making money while decreasing our odds of losing money.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, about 80% of options expire worthless. So if we know the information I gave then we can gauge what those options that fall under that 80% are and we can use spreads to increase our chances of success as opposed to buying straight up calls and puts.\n\nCan you make money with straight up calls and puts? Definitely! However, that brings with it lots of risk. With the market in general, especially with options, the higher the risk the higher the reward. But, many would rather risk $100 to make $50 68-96% of the time than risk $100 to make $1,000 at a much much lower success rate. \n\nHopefully that helped. If not, let me know and I will explain further. \ud83d\udc4d",

This company has disrupted to such an extent that the name of the company has actually become a verb that people use to describe their action.  I'm actually looking at the top comment here right now and the poster said \"they permanently banned people from **AirBnB'ing** their primary residences\". I think this speaks to the power of the brand and the influence it has had on the culture, especially considering how it's a pretty crappy verb with verb with four syllables compared to other examples like \"Just Google it\" or \"We're going to Uber\". Is this a relevant consideration and can you guys think of any other companies that have such brand power that the name of the company or product actually became a verb in the English language?\n\nSecond, I think looking at the user age demographics for Air Bnb point to a bullish future:\n\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/796646/airbnb-users-by-age-us-europe/#:\\~:text=In%202017%2C%20the%20majority%20of,more%20popular%20among%20younger%20users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/796646/airbnb-users-by-age-us-europe/#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20the%20majority%20of,more%20popular%20among%20younger%20users).\n\nWhen I look at this all I see is as those 25 to 34 year old people age they will continue to view Air BnB as a viable option of places to stay. That's not to say that as people get older they might prefer hotels more, but Air Bnb will become more of an option and there is more market to penetrate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurious to hear thoughts on this.",
