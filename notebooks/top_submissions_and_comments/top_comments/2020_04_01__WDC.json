Had TRTX, TWO, RC, RWT, and AHH. When the market topped on those guys a little over a week ago (EDIT: holy hell, time is distorted, that was two weeks ago!!), I exited RWT and RC, cut down on AHH.\n\nDid the same thing with tech stocks. Still holding all my CSCO, but sold off my T and WDC entirely.\n\nI don't like to be too far into any one sector. When i trim down my positions in a sector, I try to identify the weakest companies and trim them the hardest.\n\nIt's the same logic, just applied to the tankers. I've always lerved NAT because they're my kinda people when it comes to dividends so they get a free pass. Stayed in TNP because I got them dirt cheap. The only one I really regret parting with is TNK after it hit its previous peak, which was a downright stupid move.\n\nIn other words, it was part of a larger strategy rather than a condemnation of any specific tanker play.\n\nFTR, I took a flyer on TOPS at $0.26.

They have practically zero chance of going bankrupt, and have adapted well to the new takeout landscape. Within 6 months it's going to be back to normal.\n\nFor this year it's all about companies that can weather the virus and that'll return to normal, rather than looking for companies that deserve higher valuation multiples. That's long term stuff. Bloomin has absolutely no growth prospects but can weather the storm well. They are flush with cash though and have been looking at a merger or buying their own shares back.

        "body": "I look at it like this: If you have a 10% chance of losing $50, consider it as if you have lost a straight $5.\n\nSo a 20% chance of losing 50%, means a 10% downside; a 80% chance of making 3.5%, means a 2.8% upside. So you are 5x skewed in the downside direction. At this point it's your call. What I do is this: if you're leveraged 5x in the down direction, don't you want to inverse that for your portfolio? Take out 80% of it.\n\nIn the same way, when you have positive leverage, and you're borrowing 2x from the bank, you should be 2x as confident that the stocks are gonna be going up. If you're 5x as confident that they're going to go down, shrink your leverage to be 1/5.\n\nIt's the same thing for individual stocks. I think Ally has an upside of 2x this year, and WDC has an upside of 1.8x. My portfolio is balanced accordingly. It's like a parimutuel bet. Put your money on the \"horses\" (stocks) in proportion to their expected return. There are many opportunities to make money in excess of what the stock market does on average.\n\nSo you see how quickly this particular bet becomes more and more clear what to do though. If you thought a 60% chance of a pullback, you're looking at 30% downside and 1.4% upside, around 22x negative leverage, implying that you should move to 95% cash.\n\nThe market is usually not on the edge of collapsing from a global pandemic, so usually these sorts of analysis are not so incredible. But in this case, the math demonstrates that the choice is clear; it is a hugely lopsided gamble in favor of removing your money. By keeping your money in, if you thought at all that the stocks would correct themselves, you were making a big bet for a small return",

        "body": "I have GM because I think they are the best suited to take advantage of the electric car market going forward. People love Tesla because they don't have unions and so can make vehicles a bit cheaper, but at the end of the day, Tesla just doesn't have the capacity or infrastructure to actually distribute vehicles and service them on a wide scale. But the bigger thing is, after shopping for an electric vehicle recently, and actually exploring the options, Tesla came out way, way on bottom. Expensive and expensive to repair, easy to damage. Tesla is on top of the electric vehicle market right now in the west because the people who can afford them are well off, usually highly paid programmers (like 90% of tesla owners I know are software developers). I don't think they will be in 10 years when the majority of vehicles sold are EV in America. Most will be Chevys, a better vehicle, and a brand that most americans already know.\n\nWestern Digital over Seagate because they have more of a foothold in the SSD space. WDC has had negative profit recently only because they bought Sandisk, an expense which they have been writing off. Western Digital has 2x revenue, but 4x the net income of Seagate, yet has a lower market cap than seagate does right now. So yeah, I expect WDC to outperform it in the short and long term.",

STZ will *only* have 56% *after* they've executed the remaining three tranches: ~ at the 48CAD, 76CAD, and VWAP pricing.\n\nThat said, I still think CGC is going to be a monster in a decade. The number of paths of revenue they will have - no other cannabis company compares to: Canadian ops, ACRG + TER, This Works, BioSteel, Storz &amp; Bickel, clinical trials, all their partial investments in other companies...\n\nSTZ sure may regret their purchase price, but they don't regret being in this space - they know how massive it's going to be. Like Klein said last fall: \"[STZ] might've been early, but we weren't wrong\" for what the cannabis industry is going to be globally. STZ is fine apparently spending lots of money now to explore different cannabis revenue streams and get each product just right to ensure they're the dominant player in town a decade from now.",

Two limited-license markets with huge current upside on medical growth, as well as long-term upside upon adult-use legalization. Will be great markets in 2020 and beyond, and will drive most of their revenue growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nTHE MEDIOCRE- California. This is more a challenge of the high taxes/black market competition in the state, but i would struggle to call TER a leader in Cali. Revenues are stagnating/declining showing a lack of both retail and wholesale growth, with their long-established Apothecarium stores still unprofitable and dragging on cash flow. There is still potential in this market, but operational results have not been great in the state since TER took over.\n\nTHE BAD- CBD Business and Canada. Q4 showed declining revenues and growing EBDITA losses for both these segments. Saying TER is the only company with US and international exposure is a nice talking point, but in reality, their financials are struggling as a direct result of these non-US THC operations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Q4 2019 which included a full quarter of Illera (PA acquisition), TER had some negative impairments that somewhat skewed the actual result, but gross margins were negative on the quarter at -16% (and still quite poor compared to peers with those impairments removed), they had an ajt EBDITA loss of almost $6M, and a much larger OCF and FCF loss. Cash position is solid with recent raises and i think 2020 should be a better year, but TER definitely needs to show improved profitability metrics over the coming year and focus on key limited-license US markets.",
