The margins aren't there yet, but the sheer volume and low valuation makes them a strong long term buy in my opinion.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSolaredge and Enphase (SEDG &amp; ENPH) are market leaders in the inverter space and have opportunity to expand in the battery storage industries as well. Both have differentiated technology and in my opinion, room to expand greatly in the future. Enphase is the leader in micro-inverters, which increase efficiency in residential systems, while Solaredge uses string inverters and optimizers, which are used in residential and commercial systems. They trade at premium valuations, but that's because of high gross margins in the inverter business and future growth expectations. \n\n-----------------------------\n\nVestas and Tpi composites (VWDRY &amp; TPIC) are my two wind energy plays. Vestas is the market leader in wind turbine installations/manufacturing and has a long term order backlog of $35 billion in instillations/service contracts.\nThere's no doubt that they have been/will be a major beneficiary from the transition towards renewables, specifically wind energy\n\n-----------------------------\n\nTPI composites manufacturers wind blades and sells them to wind turbine companies. They have long term contracts with the top 5 non Chinese wind turbine companies (Vestas, GE, Siemens, Nordex &amp; Enercon.) 63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with a certain EV company that I can't mention on this subreddit apparently (DM if you want more info) to manufacture vehicle parts for them. I'm going to make a full DD post on TPIC soon because nobody talks about them but there's tremendous potential here\n\n--------------------------\n\nPS: I have positions in all 5 companies mentioned, plus First Solar (FSLR) , Jinko Solar (JKS), Brookefield Renewables (BEP), and of course Tesla (TSLA)",

Solid hold long term.\n\nTWOU - aiming to facilitate a robust educational infrastructure online. Alot of naysayers.\n\nGRWG - selling hydroponics and other equipment used to grow marijuana. Classic \"providing pickaxes for the gold rush\" argument to be made if weed becomes legal nationwide. Has had a HELL of a run for the past month. Would be nervous getting in right now. But on any sign of pullback seems like a good bet.\n\nENPH/SEDG - A lot of shorters like to FUD these now and then. Especially ENPH. They basically have a duopoly on the microinverter market with big room for growth globally. Smart solar/alternative energy play.\n\n\nOh almost forgot about PINS.

Another mistake I made, I bought airlines, DAL and Lufthansa...both are more than 20% down. \n\nI have kept like half of my amazon stocks  and also got lucky with ENPH and very lucky with LVGO (150%+), which gave me the most gains, percentage wise.

Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.\n\nDivesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP\u2019s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom &amp; will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.\n\nMain downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this &amp; the sky didn't fall.\n\nTLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP",

Look at who their CTO is if you're looking for technical competence.\n\nAMD isn't doing well because Lisu Su somehow engineered a better processor on her own and by far her personal contributions to really improving the company's fundamentals were in pushing the company into the game console market, amending the wafer supply agreement and putting a much needed axe in the Bulldozer line of processors in favor of a new architecture.  I'm sure she's a great engineer too, but that's not the job she was hired for when she was appointed CEO.  She's made great decisions as a CEO, but this whole idea there's any kind of 'wizard' out there is just wrong.\n\nIntel's problem is their fabs and no 'wizard' is going to fix that.  These are extremely complex and expensive processes that take years to set up and are not easily changed or fixed.  That's a big part of why Intel has basically given up on their 10nm process at this point and is focused on their 7nm node.  If you build something that involved and complex that's fundamentally flawed you can't just turn it around and make it work.  Intel's literally been trying for years here and that more than anything else is what's contributed to AMD's meteoric rise.",

        "body": "Ur getting downvoted, but as someone who has experience making computers, Intel has really nothing on AMD anymore. For almost any computer being built these days, AMD processors are more efficient, cheaper, and better suited for a variety of different needs. Sure intel might have other products but with zen 3 coming out this year for AMD, Intel won\u2019t be able to reclaim their spot anymore on the chip market. I feel sorry for people going all in on Intel.",

        "body": "Intel's issues are only just beginning. They've been stuck trying to get 10nm for years now and it looks like the next node will be the same. I believe 7nm is expected 2022. I'd say 2023 given their recent track record. They have a lot of internal problems as well with company culture, management etc.\n\nMeanwhile AMD still shows little sign of stopping in terms of CPUs, cutting deep into Intel's bread and butter. I imagine Apple were probably quite a big customer numbers wise as well.\n\nIf you're looking long term, then I don't see Intel as a bad buy as they will recover eventually, but next 2-3 years, I can't see them growing very much at all.",
