What percentage of the market values companies purely in DCF anyway?\n\nI think this is more a broader correction around fears that the Fed will not live up to it's word on 'average inflation targeting' and will have to raise rates sooner and quicker than normal. I personally can't see this happening, as the Fed has shown itself to be extremely dovish and is trying to recover the real economy first (jobs ans solvency issues). \n\nThere is also the huge debt problem they now have from all the money printing they've done, the easiest way for them to solve that is to inflate it away as quickly as possible, so long term high inflation seems like something they would try for.

That end of year statement was a bit of a \"Guh\" moment since everything I had earned plus some basically had evaporated.   But, wasn't like I was going to touch that money then.  I did nothing to change the strategy I had picked for investing and instead doubled up on my 401k contributions.\n\nBest decision I ever made in regards to my retirement investments -- I came out way ahead because I was able to buy more while everything was recovering.\n\nMy biggest regret over the last year is when COVID hit I was too focused on the disaster itself and neglected to make any real changes to how I was investing to take better advantage of it.  If this continues and goes deeper - don't look at it as a loss if your investing for the long term.  Look at as an opportunity to get more potential long term value out of the money you put in now. \n\nAs a current example - I bought NVIDIA because I believed they have a potential for real growth through the autonomous vehicle industry.  But, yeah stocks down since I invested in it.  Bought more this morning - why?  I **STILL** believe it's going to grow in the next 5-years because of the rise of autonomous vehicles tech.  *It's just on sale now.*",

        "body": "March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.\n\nAfter the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.\n\nProspects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a \"very strong\" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.\n\nThe Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.\n\n\"This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,\" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.\n\nA slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.\n\nTech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.\n\nThe divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\n\"The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,\" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. \"The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,\" he said.\n\nBy 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.\n\nBanks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.\n\nWalt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.\n\nGameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash in New York, Karen Pierog in Chicago and Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Lisa Shumaker)",

Some of this price action the last couple of weeks just defies any semblance of logic.  Companies like $NVDA should be sitting at 600 right now.  There's zero reason why $BE (the most interesting story in the energy space, IMO) goes from 42 to 27 in 2 weeks.
