One change might be that ETF owners get to vote for the underlying shares and BR/Vanguard collect all the votes and consolidate them instead of choosing themselves. Not sure how it would work in practice, but I can\u2019t think of a better way.",

        "body": "Alright, let's delve into this a bit, shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUTI's - This was a single study in 1985.... Since then, additional studies show no increase in risk of UTI's between circumcised and uncircumcised. Ref: Thompson 1990\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPhimosis - Can't diagnose in a young child, since it's part of the normal process for the foreskin to be attached.  Forced detachment leads to issues, including some listed below.  Pathological Phimosis happens in 0.6% of boys, or 0.4 in 1000 by the age of 15.  Ref: Phimosis in Children, 2012\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReduces AIDS/HIV - Flawed studies in Africa in 2005, 2006, did not complete the studies before showing results.  HIV spread in the USA when most men were circumcised... It's also spread less by intercourse and more by needles, blood in the USA.  Recent study shows no difference between circumcised and uncircumcised. Ref: Connolly 2008, Wawer 2009, Jameson 2009\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBalanitis - 1 in 30 impacted in their lifetime.  This is primarily due to a lack of good hygiene of the penile area, and clears up within 3-5 days with treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBalanoposthitis - 12-20% of uncircumcised males experience this.  While infection, trauma, and cancer can cause this, the leading cause is poor hygiene.  Wash your junk correctly.  Ref: Balanoposthitis: Oswald S. Perkins; Sara Cortes. 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProtection against penile cancer - Sure, if you're in an underdeveloped country... This isn't an issue in developed countries.  In the USA it is &lt;1% of all malignancies in men and 0.1% of cancer deaths.  You'd need to circumsize 300,000 kids to save 1 from cancer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReduce risk of cervical cancer in women - Based on a study in Uganda in conjunction with HIV RCTs.  Self-sampling, no actual reporting of cervical cancer as an outcome, lead-time bias and a high rate of loss to follow-up.  Since then, 16 studies have attempted to connect cervical cancer in women and the circumcision status of their male partners.  None of them have succeeded.  Even the often cited Castellsagu\u00e9 et al. failed to show a significant association.  \n\nRef: Castellsagu\u00e9 X, Bosch FX, Mu\u00f1oz N, Meijer CJ, Shah KV, de Sanjose S, et al. Male circumcision, penile human papillomavirus infection, and cervical cancer in female partners. N Engl J Med. 2002;346:1105-12.\n\nRef: Connon AF. Cancer detection survey gynaecological and epidemiological data. Med J Aust. 1972;1:738-41.\n\nRef: Aitken-Swan J, Baird D. Cancer of the uterine cervix in Aberdeenshire. Aetiological aspects. Br J Cancer. 1966;20:642-59.\n\nRef: Abou-Daoud KT. Epidemiology of carcinoma of the cervix uteri in Lebanese Christians and Moslems. Cancer. 1967;20:1706-14.\n\n.... and 12 others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo boil it down, circumcision is for appearances or religion... unless you're in an underdeveloped country.  Teach good hygiene.  Wash your junk.",

Please also note that there were 400-450k Shares to borrow on IBKR, and only 45k (Last i checked) has been returned. That leaves 350-400k borrowed which is still the vast majority. \n\nMy guess, is they are actually doing Due Diligence of their own and have realized we've been bandying around the IBKR numbers, so their trying to mask their movement a little. With that said, at the end of the day only 45-50k has been been returned to IBKR leaving a very significant amount left over. They haven't really begun to cover.\n\nFinally, if you're going to sell your shares, and are cognizant of the gamma squeeze for the love of god sell deep ITM covered calls instead. Gets you out with guaranteed profit (and ekes you an extra percentage point or two), while simultaneously not hurting the upward momentum of the stock for Friday since the Market Makers will need to hedge before it ends above 9.",
