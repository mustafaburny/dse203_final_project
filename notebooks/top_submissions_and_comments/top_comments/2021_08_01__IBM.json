While the curve is inverted, time is a benefit for long VIx positions, in a true crisis, as panic rolls from one asset class to another, keeping the Vix elevsted for a long time, this can be very beneficial. This even at 20 or higher the Vix becomes cheap to own.\n\nThere are the find like you said, where basically the vix future inversion is a process, it takes time to manifest and is almost always  accompanied by some degree of equity drawdown, not crash. This hedging using VIX term structure will always be late as compared to always on hedges, so yes it might not be leading on second thoughts.\n\nBut my assertion that it is leadimg  implied here as in here is on a  whole another level. I have yet to see Covid (there were some problems there), but, the US downgrade in August 2011, the Lehman crisis Sept 2008, the subprime Auhist 2007, the Chinese Deval in 2015 all had the inverted coming in HARD..\n\nHigh vol periods and VIX fitires are a iterative process, that devolops over days amd weeks. (It's trading, it's not easy ha ha). One off shocks like the Japanese tsunami or the flash crash in 2010 can cause large spikes in the VIX but are usually transitional and do not lead to inversion beyond a few days.  This can be balanced by always on or a mixture that is proprietary.\n\nEverything I have explained is almost word for word from Sebastian. His books are grest. So are any of the others I mentioned above.\n Vol Vega is trademark product of Mark Sebastian and Group One Trading. \nMy point was, you are combining fear metrics that you are gathering using a neural network and coordinating that with the Vix. You need to be mindful of the futures snd how all the three mix together.\n\nHey, you and I both know, although it takes super smart people like you to implememt visions and projects like these and I commend you for that. But we dont really know what the fuck is going on in there. We do t know really know how the neural.really works. So it's worth a short to let HIM decide with your coaxing.\n\nI thought this connection might give you something to expand  on in the future, and maybe see what in the hell does HE (the network) come up with, Frankenstein style, you know what I mean.\n\nSorry for the miscommunication at first, I should have been clearer.\n\nI quite understand this differently actually, and I have a seat of the pants method that works for me with my adjustments (at least so far), so o  reproduced most of the stuff to inspire you to understand one VERY key thing.\n\nI'm.an ex comp sci major, way back when windows just came out 1992, and we used Pascal and ibn.mainframes.like Dec vax and ibm 4381.\n\nBut even in college, I saw that the main money THEN was made by systems analysts that bridged the gap between end isers and coders.\n\nToday if you side by side step your education up in the areas and things you are tackling (even if it's.not options or Vix). Remember the  time you spend knowing the topic thru and thru will come.out in the form of brilliant code and innovations that you might not even think possible.\n\n\nSomething truly special.\n\n\nThis didn't take.long to type,.most of it was copied but I wanted to get the idea across to you without putting you through the excruciating process of actually figuring out how I individually understand it.  Read the books. The knowledge will last you a.lifetime.and when your software becomes a state of the art software like what for example BlackRock makes (starts with a P I forgot), you can actually know what to do with the cash, instead of relying on a scammer or a.guy much less smarter then you. It can't hurt.\n\nTrading is the final frontier, everyone ends up here eventually, whether it be Gates or Jordan.\n\nAll the best.",

Also, I would love it if you can list several Large Cap Growth companies that pay a 3% or higher dividend. I know of one (BX) that has gone up quite a bit in the last 2+ weeks.\n\nNo one buys AAPL for their .60%, MSFT for their .79% dividend, or NVDA for their .80% dividend. Because you might be able to make more money opening up a Savings/checking account or a CD in a bank. People buy those stocks because of their growth. I own all 3 of those stocks. I've had NVDA for about 4 years and it has grown 415%. I've owned MSFT for a little over a 1 year and I am up 55%. I've owned AAPL since August of last year and I am up 18%. \n\nHowever, people will buy NLY specifically for its 10.37% dividend, or EPD specifically for its 7.98% dividend, or T specifically for its 7.42% dividend. But, none of those companies are considered \"Growth\" companies and of course, they do not grow much either.\n\nGrowth stocks similar to the ones you mentioned will never pay a high dividend, even though they could afford to. IBM pays a good dividend, but its stock never moves. Three years ago it was at a $152 and today, it is down to $140 (It's not a growth company). CVX pays a good dividend, but it grows at a snail's pace. Three years ago it was at $120 and today it is down to $102 (Not a Growth Company). \n\nPlease, share your knowledge/wisdom.",

        "body": "True, IBM is an interesting case. Where did it go wrong? I think that's an interesting question to consider. IMO Apple is doing great right now in sheer dollar terms and growth there, but is showing some cracks behind the facade. Services like Apple TV aren't doing great, car=making isn't a great business really (if it happens), and hardware penetration is getting saturated. Of course, sales of airpods can make up for it! Either way, enough people are locked into the ecosystem for now. Watches and airpods are nice, and maybe can sustain Apple long enough to get to the Next Best Thing. I'd bet on it still. Buffett is, it wuld appear. Their ARM chips are the best in consumer devices, though, and that's underappreciated.\n\nI like GOOGL least actually lol. It's an ad company at this point. Lots of investments in AI and other things that are going on behind the scenes that can one day become monetizable. Unclear if GOOGL knows how to do that, though\n\nDon't know if you can buy just any company in US markets, but so many great stocks that are hidden gems in value stock land that don't get talked about enough IMO. I actually used to own CAI, which got bought out. \n\nSome more besides JOAN: BXC, ONEW, CWH, AQN, FLGT, PRG, X, AMKR. All industries represented in those, and all are growing revenues very, very nicely over the years. And of course, VIAC, F, GM, all of which I like because their multiples are low and they're underestimated given what they could one day grow into if they turn their commodity businesses into multi-pronged service based revenue generating empires.\n\nBTW, you should watch the show Halt and Catch Fire.

In prior decades the earlier version of you would be swearing to hold IBM and Commodore for 20 years.\n\n&gt; No one talks about the latter just the former. \n\nYou continue to speak for yourself, not \"everyone\".  \n\nThe rest of your rant is a false construction where you stumble to try and make this about how active professional fund managers are, instead of what your actual contention was: that an individual blindly picking the meme of the day and then tying their head, eyes, hands, and mind for 20 years.\n\n\nYou then go on to parrot institutional-originated myths that only serve institutions.  You're their mark, not their disciple. \n\n\n\n\"Universities\". Well David Swensen of Yale (most famous endowment manager) and Charlie Ellis (used to run Harvard endowment) actively writes about retail should only be in index funds. \n\n&gt; Both have great books if you are interested. \n\nPlease.  This is like the episode of KUWTK where Kim offers an astronomy book to Stephen Hawking.  \n\n&gt; only 4% of ALL stocks public traded since 1926 beat Tbills. So there goes that idea\n\nThank goodness it's not 1926.  I guess I just got lucky beating 1.8%  for the last few decades.\n\n\nMy point is that it is not impossible to beat the index, but so hard that most retail should not be trying \n\nYes, we should absolutely fork our money right over to the institutions who wrote your script for you.  Even though I have more education and experience and better track record than anyone who works in the fund they'd pitch me, at least I'd have the comfort of knowing their high fees and sluggish performance came pre-endorsed by you.  \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;  peer reviewed \n\nYou keep misunderstanding this term.\n\nWhile I find your approach irksome and I'm responding in kind, I'm going to be nice in the following and give you the best lesson I learned in decades spent in this industry.  That lesson was when I was finally taught that much of the conventional/textbook/institution \"wisdom\" is deliberate and sometimes inadvertent BS.",

It\u2019s all game theory (rational choice theory) \n\nIt\u2019s all about cost-benefit analysis for option determination and application of mathematical analysis for strategic interaction in a competitive environments. \n\nwith competitive situations where the outcome of a participant's choice of action depends critically on the actions of other participants. \n\nBut no. I would not do the same. Eternal intelligence must be equated with eternal power.  That is the equilibrium. Everything else is just worthy of sacrifice. \n\nEventually, a bad decision will cause a loss of power. And these bad decisions are more likely with a lack of intelligence. But with eternal intelligence in a place of power (control over environment), these events are infinitely less likely than before. \n\nMental illness and power being together is an inefficiency in the system. And any friction or resistance to intelligence carries eternal harm. Of course this goes into ontology and epistemology. (Study of being and study of knowledge) \n\nBasically, people are localized (since a persons awareness and thoughts aren\u2019t everywhere at once) - I.e. disabling one persons neurons doesn\u2019t effect another ones consciousness. \n\nEssentially we are discussing Individualized, Localized, Sentient, sapient, conscious, autonomous(self-ruled) units. These units impart changes into the environment, or vice versa. \n\nAre all units the same? \n\nI would say no. Fundamentally, conscious choices define a \u201cconsciousness\u201d and not all choices are capable of being made by every consciousness. \n\nAnd taking this into account, some \u201cconsciousness\u201d will contribute tonight the inefficiency or a system more than other consciousness. \n\nAnd because of that, this warrants any applied judgement as valid, since a judgement is simply a recognition of an in efficiency that should not be there and only contributes to eternal harm. \n\nConsciousness tries to avoid eternal suffering, harm, and death. And there are conscious forces out there  that are eternally more aligned with inefficiencies. \n\nSo while rationally it might not be wise to ever \u201clet go\u201d of power and control over an environment, such actions so reveal the alignment to fundamental inefficiency. And such inefficiencies carry an eternal cost to existence. A cost that some existence would rather not pay. And thus, the legitimacy of a judgement is created.",

        "body": "Yo answer your question; yes, as a Rule Utilitarian, I do prefer to avoid certain companies and sectors entirely. I think the human species needs to collectively invest in things that improve the world, not the contrary. To discern what improves the world is no small feat, and this substantially limits diversity in my portfolio, but I think it is worthwhile.\n\nThe most difficult aspect in making a utilitarian moral calculation is wrapping one's head around Game Theory, making an informed decision, and sticking with it despite potentially tremendous pressure to yield. This also means understanding Kant's Categorical Imperative:\n\n&gt;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\n\nOnce that's understood, the question is much more simple. Which maxims, when applied universally, will probably produce the most good? To answer that, I research ecology, biology, and anthropology for a sense of what has occurred, then I study contemporary issues (from macro to micro) in order to infer what is presently erroneous/detrimental, what functions, what is likely, and what is ideal.\n\nAt this point, I avoid doing anything within reason that (in my approximation) produces too many detrimental latent dysfunctions in exchange for (what amounts to) a meager reward. If the disparity between what's intended to benefit the world -- \"the world,\" defined as an ideal abstraction, an apparatus which best secures the fate of healthy organisms through the organic virtues of diversity, abundance, and equilibrium -- and what inadvertently causes the world harm is irreconcilable, I avoid the (in)activity.\n\nTL;DR\nYes, I avoid certain stocks on strictly moral grounds.",

You have to eat beans every day, no entertainment, have a crappy or no car, and work 40 hours a week minimum to get a nice emergency fund going, but that's reality, and whining about how things shouldn't be that way isn't going to make the emergency fund magically appear.",
