While the curve is inverted, time is a benefit for long VIx positions, in a true crisis, as panic rolls from one asset class to another, keeping the Vix elevsted for a long time, this can be very beneficial. This even at 20 or higher the Vix becomes cheap to own.\n\nThere are the find like you said, where basically the vix future inversion is a process, it takes time to manifest and is almost always  accompanied by some degree of equity drawdown, not crash. This hedging using VIX term structure will always be late as compared to always on hedges, so yes it might not be leading on second thoughts.\n\nBut my assertion that it is leadimg  implied here as in here is on a  whole another level. I have yet to see Covid (there were some problems there), but, the US downgrade in August 2011, the Lehman crisis Sept 2008, the subprime Auhist 2007, the Chinese Deval in 2015 all had the inverted coming in HARD..\n\nHigh vol periods and VIX fitires are a iterative process, that devolops over days amd weeks. (It's trading, it's not easy ha ha). One off shocks like the Japanese tsunami or the flash crash in 2010 can cause large spikes in the VIX but are usually transitional and do not lead to inversion beyond a few days.  This can be balanced by always on or a mixture that is proprietary.\n\nEverything I have explained is almost word for word from Sebastian. His books are grest. So are any of the others I mentioned above.\n Vol Vega is trademark product of Mark Sebastian and Group One Trading. \nMy point was, you are combining fear metrics that you are gathering using a neural network and coordinating that with the Vix. You need to be mindful of the futures snd how all the three mix together.\n\nHey, you and I both know, although it takes super smart people like you to implememt visions and projects like these and I commend you for that. But we dont really know what the fuck is going on in there. We do t know really know how the neural.really works. So it's worth a short to let HIM decide with your coaxing.\n\nI thought this connection might give you something to expand  on in the future, and maybe see what in the hell does HE (the network) come up with, Frankenstein style, you know what I mean.\n\nSorry for the miscommunication at first, I should have been clearer.\n\nI quite understand this differently actually, and I have a seat of the pants method that works for me with my adjustments (at least so far), so o  reproduced most of the stuff to inspire you to understand one VERY key thing.\n\nI'm.an ex comp sci major, way back when windows just came out 1992, and we used Pascal and ibn.mainframes.like Dec vax and ibm 4381.\n\nBut even in college, I saw that the main money THEN was made by systems analysts that bridged the gap between end isers and coders.\n\nToday if you side by side step your education up in the areas and things you are tackling (even if it's.not options or Vix). Remember the  time you spend knowing the topic thru and thru will come.out in the form of brilliant code and innovations that you might not even think possible.\n\n\nSomething truly special.\n\n\nThis didn't take.long to type,.most of it was copied but I wanted to get the idea across to you without putting you through the excruciating process of actually figuring out how I individually understand it.  Read the books. The knowledge will last you a.lifetime.and when your software becomes a state of the art software like what for example BlackRock makes (starts with a P I forgot), you can actually know what to do with the cash, instead of relying on a scammer or a.guy much less smarter then you. It can't hurt.\n\nTrading is the final frontier, everyone ends up here eventually, whether it be Gates or Jordan.\n\nAll the best.",

It hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nPeople look at Intel and assume, due to their manufacturing footprint, etc, that they can easily turn it around and deliver better tech than AMD and retake that throne.  I\u2019m also not so sure they can.  We are talking about a fundamental shift in their way of thinking and doing business.  It\u2019s easy to point out and say what needs to be done but organizations that size are really heard to change.  \n\nIt could easily be another ten years of Intel slowly declining and right sizing before they are agile enough to change and move forward in another direction.  \n\nThen again they could drop a redesigned and better chipset, socket, and chip in three years.  Both ways are a gamble.  Myself personally, I need to see better tech on the horizon before I go long on Intel.",

But that's not going to help you since they are not tax consultants. \n\nWhat you really want is a tax accountant to talk with. You can always start with one of the big retail tax preparation services like H&amp;R Block or Intuit TurboTax.  They have articles for expats online and you can talk with a tax preparer. \n\nBTW - you may want to check out the expat subreddits like r/expat . There is also r/USExpatTaxes \n\nLastly - the IRS actually has a free help line for international that you can just call if you have tax questions - [https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-my-local-office-internationally](https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-my-local-office-internationally) \\- there are other numbers on the IRS web site that you can check out if you have a different set of questions.",

They're obviously pretty single-quarter focused with tax season, but I'm guessing this quarter will look pretty good due to COVID deadline extensions.\n\nMy theory on this company: investing is more accessible now which means that a bunch of dipshits now have to pay for upgraded Turbotax so they can claim losses, and they're probably more likely to fall for grifts like audit protection.\n\nBeyond that, they paid off a bunch of debt last quarter and bought back a few hundred million worth of shares. COVID doesn't affect this business. They will continue to print money. The only risk they face is pre-filled tax forms/simplification and this admin has shown no inclination that that's on the agenda.",
