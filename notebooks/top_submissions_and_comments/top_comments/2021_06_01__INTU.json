        "body": "Saw a DD on a different sub, reposting here cuz I think it looks okay \n\n&gt;Alright, we all know that there was a record number of new investors/traders/retards last year, and they all either had to pay capital gains taxes or wanted to claim capital losses. Surprise, they now need to pay more for tax prep services.\n\n&gt;INTU had earnings for tax season already and somewhat missed expectations because tax season was delayed (the deadline was mid-May, not 4/15 as usual). INTU still raised their guidance for the full year, though, because they were seeing so many more people paying for the highest package than usual. When INTU missed their expected earnings, HRB's expected earnings were revised downwards and HRB's share price fell accordingly.\n\n&gt;However, I think HRB dropped too much, and HRB will beat current estimates. HRB reported that they were, for the first time, in years gaining market share among retail tax prep. I think this is because their new CEO has been making some great moves with the company (e.g., good ads, virtual services), but I'm not sure. For whatever reason, though, this news about gaining market share didn't do much to the stock price. It came out around the same time INTU missed earnings, so I think the miss by INTU overshadowed the fact that HRB is gaining market share.\n\n&gt;I'm super autistic and my career is in research, so I downloaded all old EPS estimate data (last revisions pre-earnings) and a bunch of different Google search trends (e.g., \"H&amp;R Block\", \"HR Block\", etc.) and ran some regression models. The only Google search term to be a significant predictor of reported EPS above EPS estimates was \"H&amp;R Block near me\". That search term predicted earnings surprises. Here's the five-year plot for that search term from Google trends:\n\n\n\n&gt;So this earnings-beat search term was at an all-time-high in late March of this year. HRB is going to kill it--unless people have changed their reason for googling \"H&amp;R Block near me\" (but why google that unless you want to go use them for tax prep?).\n\n&gt;HRB IV is pretty low for earnings because the stock is a boomer stock and has relatively slow movement (although it's been great lately) and hardly anyone buys options on it. Call IV is around 45%, and the stock hardly needs to move at all for earnings calls to end above breakeven. For example, HRB only needs to increase about 5% for the $25c to go above breakeven. But historical movements around HRB earnings from big surprises have usually been movements of 15-20%, possibly because of its relatively low market cap ($4.7B); even small surprises usually lead to 4-10% movements. HRB also usually runs up into earnings, so if you buy a call now you would benefit from that run-up. Alternatively, theta sucks, so if you don't think it'll have a run up to earnings (earnings for HRB is 6/15), waiting until market close 6/14 works too.\n\n\u200b\n\nI might toss some dosh at this \ud83e\udd78",

That's probably a good sign, but as a newish investor, I'm also wondering if there's a perspective where they have less room to grow than H&amp;R Block. \n\nThough also, H&amp;R has been around forever, and the history of the price action doesn't look promising.
