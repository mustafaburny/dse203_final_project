Before the app/itunes stores really took off, or the iphone was released if i recall. \n\nLosers too like FIT, @ $15, still holding too.  Was hoping the Google purchase would have boosted it more.  Just one disappointing product release after another.  Needs new senior leadership, their real strength is their community, not their products.  I think they fail to realize its importance.

FFIV I've never heard of but they seem to skyrocketing in the technology world, or is that everything in the market at the moment? HOG, SIX, WYNN should be up with the summer. NXPI looks to finally be bouncing back from the crash. TAL is an education group, they look like a really good buy, their stocks seem to have always been trending up. YNDX, i have never heard of but they look to deal with ride shares in russia, that doesnt seem like a safe bet. They also offer media services which should be up with the global climate, maybe its not that risky of a buy. UPS didn't perform as well as expected, which i think is weird considering how everyone is ordering everything online.\n\nLH (labcorp) juat got approved for at-home covid 19 test kits.
