Before the app/itunes stores really took off, or the iphone was released if i recall. \n\nLosers too like FIT, @ $15, still holding too.  Was hoping the Google purchase would have boosted it more.  Just one disappointing product release after another.  Needs new senior leadership, their real strength is their community, not their products.  I think they fail to realize its importance.

They also offer media services which should be up with the global climate, maybe its not that risky of a buy.
