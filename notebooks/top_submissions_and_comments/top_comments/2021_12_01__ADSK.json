My stocks lost about 33k in value in the past week and on top of that, I bought 15k worth of 270strike autodesk calls after the big dip. I thought it was foolproof. Then the new variant came out of nowhere and wrecked my calls. I have 2 weeks left in them and am down 75%. \n\nSo yeah, loss is still accurate..ish. down over 40k in a week. I'm not sweating though. I am just averaging down on positions.",
