At first I was like well the price will plummet $12 after the dividend but NLOKs lowest price the past 5 years isn't even that far down. So I bought the shares, but I also bought puts... not for FDs, but for their true purpose of hedging my bet\n\nEven the puts were cheap, I actually think I stand to make more if it crashes than if I get the dividend and the price stays stable\n\nHow can this go tits up?",

This is a one time cash injunction from the sale of a division that only negatively impacted cash flow. If nlok was worth 27 with former enterprise, its worth way more now that that albatross is divested. So this external cash flow should in no way impact its stock price, as that is sound based on actual cash flows from consumer group. If this stock drops, its a sure sign that no one knows what the fu k they are doing when it comes to valuation. \n\nIn the meantime, im loading up as much as possible.",

        "body": "My experience has been that with a large special dividend, the share price will drop equal to the amount of the dividend on the payment date.  So if NLOK is $28 now, when it pays the dividend you will get $12 cash and the share price should drop to $16.  If you then sell your shares, you will end up with the same amount of money, but will have to pay additional taxes on that dividend.  \n\nTax treatment of special dividends can be different from regular dividends, and can sometimes be treated by the IRS as ordinary income or a return of capital (meaning your cost basis will adjust, and you won't get a capital loss for taxes).  And if you don't hold the shares for 61 days, those dividends will be unqualified and taxed even higher.  As a short-term bet, you're probably losing money after taxes.  \n\nMore on Special Dividends: https://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/234-special-dividend-definition-rules-and-impact-on-stock-price\n\nYou need to do a lot more research before chasing special dividends.  There's no free money.\n\nIf you really like NLOK and want to own it long-term, I would wait until after the share price drops on the dividend date and then buy it.  Avoid the taxes on the dividend and buy more shares with the same amount of money.",
