        "body": "There is some reason to be skeptical that they can ever reach their current valuation though. Gaming industry will be all about market share. GME has a ton of opportunity and is in a great position to acquire a large part of future market share but nothing is guaranteed. Microsoft is making it increasingly difficult to need any middle man in its products for instance. Games are downloaded straight to Xbox, same with Playstation and Steam on PC. Microsoft and Netflix are also entering the cloud gaming space. Facebook, Microsoft, Sony, and others are all chasing VR.\n\nSo there are some legitimate concerns. A lot GME could do, especially in emerging tech spaces like VR/AR/E-Sports. I love the idea of them acquiring Corsair somehow. Elgato and SCUF are fantastic brands. They'll have to do a lot more than that to maintain a $21B market cap though.\n\nI'm not a bear and I don't own any GME. I just like gaming. Always good to keep an eye on the downsides of the stocks you own though. Unbridled optimism usually creates bag holders.",

        "body": "You're not thinking about it correctly.\n\nWhen I was buying AAPL a few years ago, their dividend yield was higher than it is now despite the fact that they've raised their dividend every year since I originally bought it. So my dividend yield is lower but my cost basis dividend yield is higher.\n\nIt's not that MSFT doesn't pay a lot of dividends, it's that their dividends/future dividends are so highly coveted that it makes the yield look low. \n\nHere's an example: Buffett bought KO between 1988-1994 for a total cost of $1.3B. Since then Buffett has made $8.5B in total dividends. They will pay out $672M in dividends to Berkshire this year on an investment of $1.3B. KO only has a 3% dividend yield, but that is irrelevant because the cash on cash return doesn't care about current unrealized gains. \n\nSo let's say you bought MSFT exactly ten years ago at $23.71, then your cost basis dividend yield would be 9.2%. \n\nMost importantly, you wouldn't have to sell shares to receive that payment. That's the problem with appreciation, you have to sell a productive asset (shares) in order to receive an unproductive asset (cash), and even worse, the cash value for your shares is net taxes. Dividends are also net taxes but you didn't have to sell an asset to get them.",

        "body": "Credits to /u/ixamnis\n\n\" Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I'm also going to include **EFA** and **EEM**. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. **EFA** is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and **EEM** is rated only 5.7/10. **EEM** appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. **EFA** appears to be more tilted toward the European market. \n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I'm adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**.  Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\nRead through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW!

I've been buying into it heavily for months, at a minimum I've been buying 2 shares every pay check. But I rarely see others calling MSFT a buy at reddit or in investing channels. I've seen some people argue that they just won't keep growing, and a lot of others saying it's just too expensive. It doesn't normally get that much love (or even a lot of mentions at all) in investing youtube channels either.\n\nAMZN is almost always called a buy whenever anyone talks about it, I practically never see anyone argue not to buy it, and I've never seen anyone use any kind of analysis/numbers to justify it being overpriced.\n\nAAPL has some people who say it's stupidly overpriced, and some who say it's a crazy steal right now if you look at the forward PE ratio. It's just a more polarizing stock that has a lot haters and a lot of loyal fans.\n\nGOOG &amp; FB have their haters, but also have a lot of people who have been saying for a while that they're really undervalued. I've seen so many youtube videos over the last year or two calling both of them great buys.\n\nNFLX has it's doubters with many others making their own streaming services these days, but I still see a lot of people who argue they're still a great investment and will continue growing despite these challenges.",

        "body": "Thanks for the comment! \n\nI guess for background, I\u2019m 24 and a half, just finished grad school in stats, and I\u2019m making $65k/year (living with my parents rn but will be moving back to the RTP for work in late July). Before taxes, every two weeks I\u2019ll be making about $2700. Thank god I have no debt (love my parents so much \u2764\ufe0f), but my current portfolio is this:\n\n100 shares of CRSP\n15 shares of AMC\n10 shares of WISH\n10 shares of CLOV\n\nThe 100 shares of CRSP I really don\u2019t want to touch. I originally had 50 shares of MSFT at around $245 at its peak (then), sold it all for GME, diamond handed it, and then sold it for a slight loss at $90/share (bought in around $94/share). Used that money to buy CRSP because I felt like an idiot with my GME purchase, thinking it wouldn\u2019t ever spike again. Also, like an idiot, while I was still living with my parents back home in Ohio, I was still on my lease back in NC and gambled $2500 (about 6 months worth of rent) in the market as well and lost about $1900 leaving me with just south of 2 months worth of rent. \n\nI\u2019ve learned my lessons for sure, and I\u2019m happy that I put money into CLOV and WISH yesterday, and I\u2019m optimistic about AMC, but my goal is \n\n100 shares of BEAM, \n100 shares of FATE, \n100 shares of NTLA, \n25 shares of NVDA, \n25 shares of TSLA, \n50 shares of AMD, \n50 shares of AAPL, \n50 shares of MSFT, and \n50 shares of AI. \n\nThat said, I really want to get into purchasing calls, I just don\u2019t really know how to. I use TD Ameritrade and I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing it right and be super careful. I definitely have opinions about what prices certain stocks will be at by some time point I think, I just don\u2019t know how to trade calls on those. I also don\u2019t really know what \u201ctheta\u201d is so that\u2019s why I\u2019m not in the options game. I see so many people making big bucks off it though. I don\u2019t know the math/logistics of how that works but damn, I want my piece. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk haha.",

They can use NFTs for digital trade-ins, digital goods, dividends, as a stock alternate, as a cryptocurrency, or for a myriad of other use cases. I know I\u2019ll get downvoted here, but remember when people used to crap on Amazon who was JUST an online book store\u2026.\n\nIf you are one of the many of us who thought \u201coh if I had only bought Apple/Amazon/Tesla when it was cheap\u201d then this is your sign. GameStop had no right surviving COVID and the shorts piling on to drive it to bankruptcy, but thanks to deep value investors, new life has been breathed into the company. Even if it doesn\u2019t \u201csqueeze to the moon\u201d (which I personally believe it will) the long term value of GME is insane based off the gaming industry alone.

I had a great time. \nHowever, that little company up the road from where I lived was called Microsoft. You do the math. \n\nEarlier in the year before their split, I didn\u2019t do a good job convincing the wife that we needed to buy Tesla. The money that was supposed to go to Tesla are in Reits that are down 5% since we bought. I bought Netflix at $20, sold at a $100. That was before they blew up and split the stock. I think each one is worth $2800. My friend tried to convince me to Bitcoin in the beginning when it was around $100.  Who knew?\n\nI even sold AMC, took the profit, reinvested my initial seed money. Sold it again today, and forgot to reinvest the seed money. That means if it blows up again, oh well. If I didn\u2019t sell in the first place, I would be in a better position. At the same time, I bought Amazon at 20, sold at around 3200. And it hasn\u2019t done anything since. \n\nAs you can see, some bets pay off, some don\u2019t. You can only do things that make sense for your situation, and sense of risk. You have to ask yourself what would have happened if AMC went to 0.

        "body": "I'm a LT investor in INTC. LT as in nearing decade rather than years.\n\nIMO INTC isn't good for the short term and you'd have to have a lot of faith in Gelsinger turning the ship around. Right now Intel is not undervalued but IMO fairly priced given the risks involved in investing in it. The price is right but I think OP is looking at the upside potential compared to the price and sees a deal. As someone holding the company and considering my holdings, I would say there is upside potential (esp if you hold long) but it's not \"undervalued\".\n\nThe reason why it's not \"undervalued\" is because it's losing and getting disrupted. It's a tech company in the sense that it's in the field of high tech semis, but it's NOT a tech company in the sense of growth and disrupting others. In fact it's looking like a dinosaur. TSM, CSM, Samsung, etcetc. AMD, NVDA, ARM, etcetc. All bombarding it from all sides. Cheaper &amp; faster manufacturing, 7nm/5mn foundries built and running, 7nm/5nm designed and selling, already developing 5nm/3nm, etctec. \n\nAnd that's before we get into the real problem: the FAAAMs &amp; BATs are looking for places to expand and the semi space is where many of them are looking. \n\n&gt;Apple recently stopped using Intel chips and have their in house designed M1/M2 chips manufactured by TSM. Apple isn't going back to INTC anytime soon. And Apple doesn't go away. Nokia/Motorola phones basically dead, watch industry forever changed, Ipad industry disrupted, app store still dominating, apple computers aren't made by someone else, etcetc. Intel cannot fight back against Apple and it will NEVER kill Apple. Maybe Apple gets too comfy and declines, but that's not something Intel can control. If anything, the last 20 years have shown Apple only gets stronger and better with each reiteration of their products.\n\n&gt;MSFT? Doing the same thing AAPL is doing. Intel ain't effecting, killing, or pushing out Microsoft either. MSFT is bigger, more corporate, more innovative, and has stronger ties to China which INTC does not have. INTC isn't going to kill the Xbox, windows, office, github, skype, linkedin, bing, etctec. Nope. INTC has it's hands full desperately struggling to catch up to AMD/NVD/SMG on development and SMG/TSM/CSM in manufacturing. \n\n&gt;AMZN? Already dominating everything. Has AWS needs. Will look to in-housing their chips if supply issues become a problem. AMZN make so much money it has to actively lose money going into new businesses to keep from paying boatloads of taxes. Right now it's shipping, but chips could be next now that it sees MSFT/AAPL doing it.\n\n&gt;GOOG? Already doing chips in their own way. Leader in AI. Can use chips in their own chromebooks/phones. Fighting a cloud war in AAPL which chips might come in handy. Also has tons of cash laying around.\n\n&gt;Now FB is in a war with AAPL with apple using it's products to lockout FB datamining. FB is complaining about Apple app store fees and monopoly. FB will look to ways to circumvent that by going into hardware. And thus they'll be incentivized to not use INTC or go into chips themselves.\n\n&gt;Chinese BATs looking to do the same. Japanese tech leaders playing defensive but not backing down. Europe doesn't have the same tech titans but will pull some legislative B.S. to protect their own markets.\n\nSee the real reason I say INTC isn't \"undervalued\" is because it's fairly valued given the very real threats that surround it on multiple sides. It's big, has US government backing, in a still growing industry, and can whether a beating. But INTC was INTC because it was a technology leader that disrupted the industry. It's technology lead was what kept AAPL using INTC chips and everyone off their back. It was their moat. And now that moat is disappearing if not gone with a lot of bigger, stronger, more innovative, more driven, better runned, and better funded companies that they have no answer to eating it's market share.",

You do the math. \n\nEarlier in the year before their split, I didn\u2019t do a good job convincing the wife that we needed to buy Tesla. The money that was supposed to go to Tesla are in Reits that are down 5% since we bought. I bought Netflix at $20, sold at a $100. That was before they blew up and split the stock. I think each one is worth $2800. My friend tried to convince me to Bitcoin in the beginning when it was around $100.  Who knew?\n\nI even sold AMC, took the profit, reinvested my initial seed money. Sold it again today, and forgot to reinvest the seed money. That means if it blows up again, oh well. If I didn\u2019t sell in the first place, I would be in a better position.

He also said during the same speech that he doesn't regret not buying Microsoft before it took off because he didn't know enough about the business.\n\nThe point is that you shouldn't take risks for the sake of taking risks. You should not use that quote to justify uncalculated risks. Like many have said on here, your investment may go down, maybe as soon as you buy into it, and may stay down for months before it builds back up (if it ever does). The reason why someone is willing to lend you money at 3% instead of investing the same amount in stocks, is because that 3% is guaranteed. It was guaranteed after the dot com crash, and it was guaranteed after the subprime crisis. Like the comment above pointed out, there's no free lunch.",

        "body": "Here's my normal recommendations for someone starting out:\n\nLearn \"time value of money\" like the back of your hand. You should be able to apply it to any aspect of your life, a company, a purchase decision, a loan, etc. You should be able to know, for your own financial situation, if it's better to delay a payment for 6 months if that costs you $3 now.\n\nThen learn Discounted cash flow models, which is #1 applied to companies and stocks.\n\nLearn about financial statements and how they represent the underlying business. I.e. if you are studying, say, Microsoft, understand where their coats are, what makes them most of their money, where they are investing that money, and what they have loans for, if any.\n\nLearn about macro economics, such as how government policy can affect companies. A good current example is that US stimulus for the unemployed is quite generous and is a strong disincentive for low wage labor to find work. This is causing major inflation pressures or shortages in low wage industries. Other examples include central bank policies, inflation in general, droughts and floods and natural disasters, etc.\n\nLearn how to visualize and imagine the future lives of people, and what kinds of services/goods they will use or need. At the end of the day, all this learning relies on good understandings of the future to be profitable.\n\nAs for how to buy and sell, that's called a \"Brokerage\" and I recommend Fidelity, Schwab, Vangaurd, and if you really, truly must, Robinhood (don't they have mediocre support, taxes, and security). The more professional ones will help you learn more.\n\nWord of warning: don't touch options for at least 3-5 years from now. I still haven't started using them and making plenty (30%+) returns without that or leverage in general.",

So while they aren't showing significant profits yet, it's only a matter of time.  \n\nSecond, from that earnings report: Another major advantage of our technology is its capability to demonstrate \r\nscalability. To demonstrate this, we successfully developed and installed our long-range lidar \r\nsensor pilot line in Redmond. This pilot line is sophisticated. It includes six custom active \r\nalignment stations that our team developed working with our automation partners to enable \r\nscalability and performance. Our team has launched multiple pilot lines in the past for our \r\ndisplay, augmented reality, and interactive display products. \n\nHe goes on to say:\nThis pilot line will allow us to validate designs and manufacturing processes in house \r\nin faster cycles. We expect limited quantities produced from this line will support exploring \r\npotential partnerships. This pilot line will also enable us to take our designs, process maps and \r\ncontrol plans, and launch a new highly automated production line to support expected initial \r\nsales inventory in the second half of 2021 through a contract manufacturer.

You can sell your assets but you'll pay taxes on your capital gains.   \nI would suggest you keep both. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nIn my opinion, how you invest your money depends on the amount of time you want to spend researching. If you don't want to spend time researching companies, balance sheets invest with ETFs. If you want to learn more about the stock market and it is something that you enjoy doing, you can go ahead and find companies you like and invest in individual stocks. \n\nIf you go the ETF route you can find ETFs by Fidelity online. I would suggest you invest 50% of your portfolio in an S&amp;P500 ETF and then chose whatever you like. Technology, Semiconductors, Energy, whatever.\n\nIf you want to learn more about stocks you can find everything online. I would suggest watching Peter Lynch and Warren Buffet interviews on youtube or reading Books like \"One Up on Wallstreet\", \"The Intelligent Investor\" and stuff like that. \n\nYou can also do both. You can own an S&amp;P500 ETF and then some stocks like Apple, Microsoft, or whatever you like.",

Even after being in deep red earlier this year, and finally realizing some profits, I can't help but think about the \"could haves\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I need to realign and shift perspectives, even though I know that's the path to heavy losses, how do you guys deal with?\n\nOversaturation with $600 ain't a thing unless it's a really risky, or really underperforming, choice.  MSFT and APPL are solid performers.  \n\nYes, diversification is a thing... but perhaps that would be with something more like $4k or $10k total.",
