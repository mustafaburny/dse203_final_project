For example Ansys repos is about 20 GB take 7-8 hours just for daily build, therefore they will need to store and effectively distributed the update code for developers around the world. That's why they need Artifactory to package library and improve build speed for their developer. Show me the list of Sonatype Nexus customers? I know JFROGs customers and it's very impressive.",

Wuppose ylu pay something over 48 months and each payment does not get adjusted to inflation, you are effectively paying a little bit less each month. \n\nNow, in a country with a 30% inflation rate average each year that won't help because they alredy take that into account and bump up the prices of everything by a lot if you want a payment plan instead of paying up front. But in the US where the inflation is not always present in everybody's mind you might br able to save a little bit with payment plan sjch as buying a house, etc,since eachpenny is worth a little bit less each months. Of course, that's assuming both salaries and your investments do not lose to inflation, wich is a pretty damn big if.",

My point is if you would do it for 10k and obviously you were making a profit you were comfortable with by doing so, padding like 5k ok whatever to the guy doing 4th br but this guy is 5xing the cost which is an 500% increase ... thats just wrong imo.",
