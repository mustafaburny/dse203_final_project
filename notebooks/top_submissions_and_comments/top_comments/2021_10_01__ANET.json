For example Ansys repos is about 20 GB take 7-8 hours just for daily build, therefore they will need to store and effectively distributed the update code for developers around the world. That's why they need Artifactory to package library and improve build speed for their developer. Show me the list of Sonatype Nexus customers? I know JFROGs customers and it's very impressive.",
