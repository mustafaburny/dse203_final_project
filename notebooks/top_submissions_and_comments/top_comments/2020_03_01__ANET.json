        "body": "Yes...look for better rates and more importantly, buy a house you can afford.  Also think about cost of utilities (is well insulated, is an old house or new house) you can get the costs for the year from the seller, real estate agent or the utility company. also the cost of taxes, yard maintenance.  I think the housing market is relative as far as going up or down. I feel the pricing of the house will be more dependent on comparables near it and days on the market as well as the sellers position.  You would be amazed how much you can negotiate if you have an eager seller.\n\n I would look at several houses that have all of the things you are looking for to get a feel for pricing.  This should give you an idea of what the market is for example, a 3 br house with garage, 2 ba etc.  Check out the neighborhoods in the day and at night.\n\nAlso do some research and think about what type of house you want.  Fixer upper....little bit of work needed or move in ready.  There are pro's and con's to both.",

        "body": "Yes...look for better rates and more importantly, buy a house you can afford.  Also think about cost of utilities (is well insulated, is an old house or new house) you can get the costs for the year from the seller, real estate agent or the utility company. also the cost of taxes, yard maintenance.  I think the housing market is relative as far as going up or down. I feel the pricing of the house will be more dependent on comparables near it and days on the market as well as the sellers position.  You would be amazed how much you can negotiate if you have an eager seller.\n\n I would look at several houses that have all of the things you are looking for to get a feel for pricing.  This should give you an idea of what the market is for example, a 3 br house with garage, 2 ba etc.  Check out the neighborhoods in the day and at night.\n\nAlso do some research and think about what type of house you want.  Fixer upper....little bit of work needed or move in ready.  There are pro's and con's to both.",

By the way, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with the internet now due to the removal of Net Neutrality laws. \n\nIf healthcare was not private, prescription drugs would be more affordable because you wouldn\u2019t have lobbies in Washington creating laws that prevent competition. Did you notice that it\u2019s illegal to import drugs? Why isn\u2019t it illegal to import engine parts then? Or soy beans?\n\nSame with housing. If housing was a non profit business because a minimum amount of feelings would be built for people to live in, you could still be paying extra for a nicer home but you wouldn\u2019t be forced to pay $4,000 for a 1-BR apartment just because you work in a densely populated area (Look up rentals in San Jose CA and you\u2019ll know I\u2019m not making this up).\n\nAs long as retiring generations finance their life style through stock market investment, we will have engineered inflation because without it there would be no growth.",

I used to put it up on airbnb when I would go out of town for $120/night.\n\nI now pay $600/mo for a shared spot which is absurdly cheap around here. \n\nI also had a new Charger and used Corolla. Sold both a few years ago and bike/metro to commute.\n\nAt some point I got really upset about how I earned a lot of money but never really saved anything. I decided to basically live like a hobo for a few years, save, invest and YOLO.\n\nIt's paying off pretty well actually.",
