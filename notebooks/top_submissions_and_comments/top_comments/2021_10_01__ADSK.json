This is not VCR-level of complexity. That was not gonna happen. On the other hand, if only a company could revolutionize the way to interact with the model and the machine, to dumb it down, this could've been another story. Autodesk and other CAD companies have been spending millions and decades trying to solve this problem for their own markets without major success. Their users still have to be engineers or highly skilled technicians and designers. \n\nOpen source is not the solution here. It requires the ruthlessness and vision of a Steve Jobs to make 3D printers ubiquitous. Otherwise, they should be relegated to commercial and industrial applications. \n\nI still think 3D printing should take off, but I'm not following the stocks any more.",

So the ones I couldn\u2019t place were ASAN and RBLX but I would have won those too. I just figured the tattoo was a pretty good high stakes bet I was also fairly confident I wouldn\u2019t have to get it. Does that make more sense?",
