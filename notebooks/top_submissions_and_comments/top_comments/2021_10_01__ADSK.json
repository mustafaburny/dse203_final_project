This is not VCR-level of complexity. That was not gonna happen. On the other hand, if only a company could revolutionize the way to interact with the model and the machine, to dumb it down, this could've been another story. Autodesk and other CAD companies have been spending millions and decades trying to solve this problem for their own markets without major success. Their users still have to be engineers or highly skilled technicians and designers. \n\nOpen source is not the solution here. It requires the ruthlessness and vision of a Steve Jobs to make 3D printers ubiquitous. Otherwise, they should be relegated to commercial and industrial applications. \n\nI still think 3D printing should take off, but I'm not following the stocks any more.",

On top of that they have to compete to get contracts. The downside to this is that the number of contracts can be sporadic and unreliable. To my knowledge there isn\u2019t much, if any, advantage to choosing Ericsson versus Nokia components. Further, BofA recently came out with their 14 moonshot technologies report that said 5G will be the shortest cellular generation before we move into 6G. Also, the S&amp;P has risen 26% in the last year (98% in last 5 years) and Ericsson has risen 3.9% in the past year (54% in last 5 years) so it\u2019s significantly trailing the market. If you are dead set on 5G, I\u2019d suggest looking in $FIVG because they own holdings that have performed greater than Ericsson.

        "body": "Glad I avoided WATT at $8 around their IPO. \n\nI believed in it when Apple thought about using them 5 years ago for OTA charging.  They had a grand idea of whole house charging. You walk in and your phone automatically starts charging anywhere in your house (within distance of the charging station - like WiFi). FCC and Apple squashed that idea when they didn\u2019t approve it and Apple went with Broadcom Qi. \n\nEven with this approval I\u2019m not so sure. There are a lot of physics hurdles that it would face. You would need a lot of these devices to cover a house or multiple devices to cover even a room in a standard US home. Also distance plays a big factor - longer = less charging power to the point it may not even be relevant.  WiFi has less of these hurdles obviously. \n\nThrowing a couple hundred at it as a speculative stock may be worthwhile.",

There is less exposure (&lt;=25%) at NVidia, Intel, Apple, CAT, Ford, GM, Starbucks, Nike, and Apple all have some exposure but not a huge amount, which is good. \n\nYou can search for more companies using Tijori Finance's website, for example have a look at Apple here: https://tijorifinance.com/us/company/AAPL/overview",
