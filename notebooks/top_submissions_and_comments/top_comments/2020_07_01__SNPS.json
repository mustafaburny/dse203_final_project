It means price cuts\n\nAs an investment it's doing poorly. I don't know about you, but up 3% over the last year doesn't seem good. It competes with several companies. I will list their competition\n\nAMD: up 94% since a year ago\n\nTSM: up 57% since a year ago\n\nIt's going to try to compete with NVDA as well, which is also up 134% since a year ago\n\nYou could literally throw a dart at hardware and do better\n\nMU: 12%\n\nSNPS: 46%\n\nASML: 67%\n\nLiterally any company I follow outperformed Intel. Micron is the only one that kind of sucks as well",
