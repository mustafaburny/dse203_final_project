I had a great experience with Seagate, and this Roku was giving me a similar vibe.

Again....TOTAL speculation and totally forgot I owned it! And if it weren't for some chatter about it yesterday, I would never had known how much it had appreciated. Lol, my PT was only $100, but when I saw that it was $150, I sold it all! Doubled my money in just a few months on something I wasn't expecting much.
