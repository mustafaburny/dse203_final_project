There is certainly much upside in the sectors LMT is currently in, but currently F35s alone make up about 25% of total revenue for LMT. I don't feel secured, in a sense that one product alone can have that much impact on revenues. In the event of manufacturing delays or problems for the F35s, this can really cause significant drops in revenues. What are your thoughts on this?\n\n2. Also, their Debt to Equity ratio is rather high,  of about 7.4 (31/12/20) compared to similar companies in the industry. E.g RTX 1.2, GD 2.4, TDY 0.57, NOC 3.2. Do you think that this is any cause for worry?",

If I were constructing a Defense ETF it would have LMT top holding, followed my NOC, RTX, then LHX. LHX isn't as well positioned to compete for the huge modernizing contracts like HGV or 5G.
