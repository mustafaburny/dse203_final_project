I think this is okay to do here, because it's not the daily thread. \n\nI'm pretty new to WSB, but I have been trading [badly] for a long time, and I have to say it's felt like treading water. I used to think that unless I was some trust fund baby with 2mil in cash waiting to be invested, it was gonna be the long haul for me.\n\nThen I found WSB, and it was great, but with each gain, there'd be things I couldn't control, or I'd chase the advice of people who didn't really do their DD. I was convinced that with all the bad news we were getting, that stocks would plummet last week, as I learned the hard way something I [and I would imagine, all of us] already knew -- the market doesn't do what it is supposed to, it does what the MMs want it to do, and in the process it takes advantage of the common trader.\n\nBut every once in a while, we get someone like /u/Variation-Separate who not only takes the time to share his secrets, but breaks it down for us, interacts with the community, and even fucking gives us confidence when the market seemingly isn't following the prophecy. He doesn't have to do any of this.\n\nI cannot do what he does as well as he does it. Not yet. But I am thankful for the knowledge I've gained, thankful for the tendies, and thankful for having my faith in good people and challenging corrupt systems resurrected.\n\nMuch love, OP.

I've got a bit riding on this, a lot of which will die if a viable downtrend doesn't start before May and I can't adjust. I don't subscribe to telling people diamond hands, or blindly worshipping VS. We all have to adapt. But I am incredibly appreciative for the time he's put into these posts and educating us.\n\nThat said, we have no idea yet what will actually happen long term. /u/Variation-Separate has put together a really compelling plan. He didn't have to share it. No one has to follow it. But if you, like me, believe that there is validity and truth in his analysis, then do your own DD to embrace that vibe. Yesterday, people were freaking out in the first two hours of intraday when there was no drop, then we plummeted. Today, we flirted with 252 and are at risk of another leg up. If in the last two days, you have decided that this uptrend in the market is enough to call it quits, no one can blame you, but I would argue, maybe VS's posts aren't for you. \n\nI am a bear rn. I'm a bear not just because I have positions that reflect it -- I truly believe we're in a bad spot, and corporations, MMs, the Fed are being really irresponsible right now.  We're being set up for some horrible economic rebuilding in the 2020s. The longer the market waits to reflect this, the more fucked ordinary people are when they do. They don't have our best interests in mind. Deep down, I want us all to get through this and come out on top.\n\nI hope I'm not foolish in thinking that, collectively, we have the tools and minds to figure this out and at least make a little money before things get really bad. It's a difficult time to have conviction, but that's why I'm here in this thread (and no longer checking the dailies). Keep strong, fellow autists. Let's find patience and figure out what the next move is.",

If we hit 270, we are going to 300. It would be a sharper \"V\" shape recovery. \n\nTomorrow, or even next week, it is possible to do battle at 248 and win and signal a downward movement towards 231. Here we get into a faster free-fall.\n\nIt looks like a bear flag is happening on SPY and it is possible that the movement down is an escalator. If SPY breaks 263, the bear flag is pretty invalid IMO. VIX would mellow and we could reach the goal, but with more sideways trading (drawn out over months).\n\nCorrect or comment, please\n\nEdit: could also be other continuation patterns, but this theory more aligns with a quicker drop, like the bear flag...",

In order to delta hedge those contracts they are having to sell more underlying equities which is putting even more downwards pressure on the market. \n\nGiven that DIX is the second highest print the system has ever seen, even on a -5% day, it\u2019s likely that market makers are being forced to buy to prevent an even greater collapse. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong here but this could get ugly tomorrow.\n\nEdit: looking at December 2018 recovery we saw a large discrepancy between the DIX and GEX. DIX was in the high 40\u2019s and GEX was extremely negative. Negative gamma causes the movement of the market to be accelerated, no matter if it\u2019s up or down. In the 2018 recovery it was an upward movement...today we\u2019re seeing a downwards trend. This is why I think it will continue to trend downwards.",

Do you think prices will get back down to those levels? I\u2019m worried that next week we\u2019ll have another \u201cbear market rally\u201d and prices won\u2019t get back down to where I\u2019m hoping.

It has also directly bounced off the 200MA which is good to see as well.\n\nMarket EOD was $18.xx or so, but VWAP is around $15\\~. Perhaps a good entry tomorrow for a long position will be if it returns to VWAP, but regarding the explosiveness and nature of the stock I'm also debating just buying ASAP with expiry for next week.\n\nAs for the strike price I'm looking at, I'm looking at around $25/26, which is where it peaked last time in early march.\n\n**Sentiment** \\- Talks about Americans getting used to the idea of having to wear masks. The thing is 3M, DuPont, etc. make PPE (personal protection equipment) but really APT has been sort of the front man of that for a while now. \n\nWith fear going to spike up again this week, I think it'll be good to get in and take a long. Plus volume was only 20 million today, so hasn't been \"discovered\" by the media yet. \n\nAny tips/advice for a newbie would be very beneficial.",

Dollar cost averaging on retracements.\n3. Fib levels for entry.\n4. Double top level for exit (Thursday high).\n\nA lot more work than the casual investor is looking for.  But if I strictly followed the buy/sell at the signal, I would have lost money.  Probably the same $2000.",

        "body": "Reasonable options, but they all have notable downfalls.\n\nOne of the big ones is that a centralized blockchain will never suffice to replace something like Visa.\n\nThe current international transaction rate of credit cards peaks around 25,000 per second (christmas eve of 2019) combining major brands (visa, mastercard, etc)\n\nCash is probably significantly higher than that worldwide.\n\nFor a currency to \"replace\" money or credit cards or banks, as the long-term stated goal of crypto enthusiasts, it has to scale to numbers on the order of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nBitcoin, Zcash and Monero as they are designed, are all fundamentally centralized public blockchains that implement various forms of anonymization for wallet transactions.  \n\nHowever, in reality, it's probably not practical for all nodes to know about all transactions everywhere in the world at all times.   That requirement fundamentally means that every node everywhere has to constantly consume 5-20mbps of incoming transaction data, 24/7/365 and that's assuming no significant growth in transaction volumes.\n\nEven with aggressive pruning of transactions, the volume of data to accurately summarize the net worth of 7 billion people plus their various businesses, teams, organizations, accounts and otherwise would be extraordinary (trillions of transactions, at least - possibly a petabyte of data).\n\nIn the current blockchain concept, any transactions that have any significant notable value to the network have to be recorded on this chain, or they can't be verified.  Concepts like lightening network on bitcoin can \"shard\" some of this off, but these side transactions are fundamentally unverified, and the money used in them is fundamentally locked out of the main wallet of anyone using these channels, making them practical for certain activities (say, buying some gum), but impractical for something like transacting your rent, or any other dollar value that you value.\n\nSome concepts of more broad global sharding of the main chain exist, but under \"proof of work\" that doesn't really work well without establishing \"trusted nodes\" to referee the sharding and that doesn't make the decentralization proponents happy.\n\nIt's probably possible to design something, maybe using a proof of stake system with stakeholders pooled into smaller shards, but that runs a greater risk of having network takeovers, unless you have a referee system that patrols for large movements of stakeholders into shards in order to pool stakes and subvert the voting system for monetary gain.\n\nIt's not a solved problem and no platform currently exists that could plausibly take over world currency transactions, or even a smaller credit card player like Discover, in terms of size and volume.\n\nProof of work, in my opinion, is a poor tech and while I play in crypto as a speculative instrument, I view it like a penny stock in a worthless industry from a true fundamentals perspective.\n\nBut that's just my educated opinion.",
