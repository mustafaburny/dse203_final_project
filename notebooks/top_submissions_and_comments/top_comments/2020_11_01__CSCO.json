The downside is they have to be able to survive the bad lows (like now for oil) to have that next shot when the cycle progresses. \n\nOthers are just straight bubbles. Look at Cisco stock from the late 90\u2019s. That\u2019s \u201clikely\u201d what\u2019s happening with EV stocks right now and Weed stocks 2 years ago.

        "body": "Recent/relevant plays.\n\nYesterday, I bought a few hundred ZM calls for 550/600 strikes for late December. I am up 60-90% on them. I do not plan to hold the through earnings (a few).\n\nI am short PLTR (very risky given the speculative nature).\n\nI am short CSCO, but risky again since so much bad news is already priced in.  Long term, I see this company price falling. I do not know if this earnings will be the catalyst.\n\nI have a decent put position on NIO. Tomorrow is the day I decide to hold or jump.\n\nI closed out my CRSR positions today.\n\nI have fetfetch positions I held since $26. Selling half tomorrow.\n\nI have a put position for DKNG.\n\nNote: I am using money out of my large gains pot for risky bets. I have plenty in reserves to end the year with my by far best year. So do not copy my plays as this is all money I am willing to lose in the hope of bringing home a big prize.\n\nI have some reverse iron butterflies for a few trades next week I am opening.\n\nMany of my other trades are just based off momentum in the moment during the day. I have no idea how you guys trade on a phone without having access to charts, scanners, scripts to run backtesting for quick modeling, etc.",

I believe the P/E reflects CSIQ's slow growth being a slightly more mature company (founded in 2001) whilst its competitors came around 5 years later. Also, if you look into these renewable ETFs like TAN, they favour SEDG (10.98%), ENPH (9.61%) and FSLR (7.70%) more against CSIQ (3.71%). It's the same story if you look into ICLN.\n\nThat's a just few areas of concern for me as a current investor in CSIQ.",

They're solid companies set for excellent growth. \n\nCSIQ managed entire projects from end to end without the client having to do much, or they have the choice of managing it themselves and they can buy all the products from them starting with the proven highest efficiency solar panels to the inverter and battery.\n\nENPH has a nice website and a good product. Micro inverters allow you to check in each panel individually. That does cost a bit more, so they have a product that'll put two modules in one to control two panels at a time. Eventually, I think they'll make inverter panel racks, like a server rack. It's a different product that not a lot of other companies offer, and that gives them an edge.\n\nI don't like SolarEdge because their product, the array inverter, is not unique. Sure they're doing well, but every company that offers panels also offers inverters. They're not set for the future IMO.\n\nI'm also eyeing JKS and NIO. They're both Chinese, and China is setting itself to grow in this area. JKS is growing due to being the highest manufacturer for solar panels. NIO is entirely dependent on how the government supports them IMO.",
