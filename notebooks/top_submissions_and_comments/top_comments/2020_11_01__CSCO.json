If you look at Big Commerce's or Lemonade's financials, they aren't great.  And some of the SPAC mergers are pretty suspect especially when compared to how much they run up around merger time.  \n\nI agree that there was more vaporware back in the late 90s, BUT, the fervor, the blind investing into companies without knowing anything about their financials, the double or triple digit gains within a single year.... remind you of any recent times?",

The downside is they have to be able to survive the bad lows (like now for oil) to have that next shot when the cycle progresses. \n\nOthers are just straight bubbles.
