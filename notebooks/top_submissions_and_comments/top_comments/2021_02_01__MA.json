        "body": "This applies to small and mid cap companies:\n\nhttps://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/\n\nOtcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. \n\nUnbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.\n\nFinviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .\n\nMy stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .\n\nTD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. \n\nI trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .\n\nThe general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. \n\nWe all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . \n\nI don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. \n\nI go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. \n\nBefore a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.\n\nI also go to Stocktwits for the same .\n\nSomeone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. \n\nBut these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.\n\nFinally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.",

There is a lot of sus about the company but I also think there\u2019s a good amount going for it.\n\n1. I have emailed them before, and they have responded. That at least tells me that there is someone actively working on this, regardless if it\u2019s a scam. \n\n2. The website is updating daily to reflect the new preorders being submitted, this page in particular: https://aabbgoldtoken.com/aabb-gold-token/ \n\n3. There is a third party website, as it\u2019s not affiliated with them, confirming that they in fact exist and have made a transaction before in gold mines. This is the website: http://mnamexico.com/en/ma-january-2021-2/ It was to Qiangda, who they supposedly work with. Regardless of that, the transaction being made does in fact show that they owned some form of a gold mine in the Guerrero Gold Belt. \n\n4. The token is in the etherium website. Not too familiar with it, nor do I know if I got the name right, but it shows source codes for various cryptos, and AABBG is on there. \n\n5. This company also has SEC filings for financials and whatnot. They\u2019ve been doing this for years so it\u2019s definitely some form of a company to even have financials in the first place.\n\nThat\u2019s it for now pretty much. I\u2019m gonna keep holding as any claim of scam would get shut down if the app releases, since they kept their word on that. If the app is good and they actually fulfill the orders remains to be seen, but I\u2019m gonna keep watch on that. Again, you\u2019re perfectly fine to think it\u2019s a sketch company. It 100% is. But I\u2019m gonna keep riding this out. They\u2019ve been doing PR every Tuesday so if anything, we can keep checking those to see if something is off or not",

        "body": "I don't have any recommendations for reading but:\n\n* Look for tickers either trading sideways or preferably trading sideways at a slight upward angle. Preferably good companies you wouldn't mind long holding. FANG, MA, SJM, and HD are good examples and ones I usually use, but this changes all the time. If you see a bunch of red and start panicking, you already fucked up because you bought companies you didn't believe in long term. This whole red week crap everyone was screaming about because all the overpriced speculative stuff dropped a bunch? Yeah I'm only down like 2% and doing just fine because I bought good companies on the dip before that even happened, so they didn't really dip much after I bought them and even if they did I know they'll be back. And if they don't jump back, odds are everyone is hurting a lot worse which means more buying opportunities.\n\n* Learn about support and resistances, where stocks stop falling and start going back up, and where runups start ending.\n\n* Learn about moving averages and using multiple moving averages over different time periods to determine if something is roughly under or overvalued. Don't rely too much on them but they help.\n\n* Have entry and exits points in mind before you buy and before you sell. This goes for both profit taking and loss realizing. Set stop losses if you don't think you can handle being rational in a market dip, and limit orders to prevent being greedy. There will always be more swings. It's not worth blowing up your account because you got stupid and wanted just a little more or don't have the stomach to eat a loss beyond your risk tolerance. Before you buy imagine the company dropping 10% from where you bought it. Would you be alright eating that loss, or be confident enough in the company to hold? Would you be alright if it shot up 20% past where you took profits? Those are both very real scenarios.\n\n* Don't get greedy. You're not trying to double your money. You're trying to get in a few easy percentage points then get out in a reasonable time. Set reasonable profit margins. There's absolutely nothing wrong with walking away with like 3% in 2-3 weeks, in fact something like that is incredibly good, especially if you can do it reliably. Do that four times in a year on some safe companies and you've already beaten SPY for crying out loud.\n\n* Traders don't speculate, that's what investing is for. If you're hitting ATH as a trader, you're doing it wrong in my book. Your goal isn't to sail uncharted waters it's to get really good sailing the existing ones. If you find yourself trying to hold into new highs, you screwed up. You're not sticking to your plan you set out. There's nothing *wrong* with investing, but it's not trading.\n\n* Don't micromanage it. Sometimes this stuff takes weeks to play out and sometimes you'll be sitting in the red. Resist the urge to day trade your position unless you have a good reason to do so. Have your plan and stick to it.\n\n* Always have the next few potential trades lined up at any given time. I'm always on the lookout for new deals, even in the middle of a trade. That doesn't mean screw your current trade over because of impulse, it means you're ready to move on to the next opportunity within a couple days of the current one finishing. And sometimes there's just not really anything good going on and you should never try to force a trade that you're not fully comfortable with just to have something going on.",

        "body": "My issue with TA is that it's looking at a chart, comparing it to your repository of \"patterns\", and drawing lines and moving them around until they fit a pattern, thinking you have some sort of advantage.\n\nThe moving averages is basically the only thing I use because it's simply a function of the math. \n\nFor stuff like retracements and fibanocci and spaghetti, the areas are so wide that no shit the stonk will fall into them.\n\nFurther, and this is just a side rant, every TA YouTuber looks at a chart two months later and draws 38 lines on a past chart saying how you could have predicted this. Much easier than looking into the future.\n\nThen you have people looking at one indicator. Omg the rsi went down. This stonk will moon! \n\nCorrect me where I'm wrong and give me some new indicators and I may reconsider.\n\nBut right now I just use the bare minimum, that aren't really even TA:\n\nLong and short MA, volume, and sometimes ADX",
