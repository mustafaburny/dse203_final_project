They stopped paying dividend that year. It was the dividend she lived on. She had no social security as women did not work.  Fast forward, if all your savings are in 1 basket. You could repeat her mistake.  \n\nA lawyer's secretary was asked to buy stocks for her boss. She knew nothing about stocks but bought smaller positions of everything he owned.

For growth companies, like Tesla, investors do not expect dividends any time soon. However, once the growth slows, investors will want dividends. At this point, if a company cannot justify its valuation because it is not earning enough profit per share, it will not be able to provide a high percentage dividend. For example, AT&amp;T and IBM offer 5%+ dividends. Tesla would need to earn $90 per share to be able to sustain a 5% dividend at the current $1800 stock price. If Tesla cannot offer a competitive dividend and it had similar growth prospects, investors will sell their shares and invest elsewhere.",

The big 4 US cloud providers provides what Cloudflare offers (CDN, networking) along with a lot of other compute/data capabilities. However, Cloudflare's networking/CDNs are great value for small customers. Cloudflare integrates well with all 4 major US cloud providers, which helps get a few bigger customers who are in enterprise cloud. I would consider Akamai a more direct competitor to Cloudflare.\n\nThe Cloudflare serverless offering is new to me and sounds interesting, but AWS/Azure/GCP/IBM serverless integrates with numerous other AWS/Azure/GCP/IBM services. Not everything can run well in a serverless configuration. This will be a disadvantage to Cloudflare's serverless in attracting any big enterprises. However, again, smaller customers may want a simplified experience and go with Cloudflare over the very feature rich cloud offerings of the big 4. Also, I'd bet Cloudflare's serverless would be cheaper as well.\n\nBasically, Cloudflare won't be getting much of the big lucrative enterprise contracts that the Big 4 have, and their only real moat is the better value they give to customers who only need their small set of services. And there's a lot of small businesses out there that need what Cloudflare offers.\n\nDisclosure: I own shares of IBM/AMZN/MSFT",

        "body": "I am not an expert at all but I will answer your question as I understand it. I am slightly old school so my investment and retirement plans existed before Robinhood and other brokers offered free trading:\n\nI will move from specific to broad.\n\nLevel 1: stocks and bonds. These are a specific entity one can buy. I can buy a specific share of apple or an actual T-note. Think of stocks as an individual m&amp;m candy piece and a bond as a pretzel \n\nLevel 2: index funds and ETFs: these are essentially a mix specific stocks that can be purchased more easily than creating the mix yourself. This is your first layer of diversification. Say I want to invest $100 in \u201ctech,\u201d I can buy $100 share in a tech ETF that is a mix of apple, IBM, Amazon stocks. This is beneficial because many of these individual stocks are worth more than $100, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy an Apple share with my $100/month investment, but I can buy a $100 share of a \u201ctech\u201d ETF. Brokerage fees. My bank charges $7 per trade. It cost me $21 dollars in brokerage fees to buy the 3 above shares but only $7 to buy the ETF which is a mix. Think of an ETF like a bag of different m&amp;ms. Some peanut m&amp;ms, some regular, etc...\nIndex funds are similar but the target an index like the SP500. If you want to invest \u201cin the market\u201d without anymore thought than that, an index fund is recommended.\n\nMutual funds: (may be wrong on this) The way I understand mutual funds is they are offered by a specific broker or bank. For example, my IRA (see below) is comprised of mutual funds. With my bank, I pay no brokerage fees to purchase monthly, reoccurring positions in my mutual funds. Mutual funds can be targeted to an index, like the SP500 or they can be even more broad. My index funds are called \u201ctargeted lifecycle funds\u201d these are platforms set up for dummies like me as an automatic diversification geared towards a retirement date (in my case 2050). This fund is a mix of American stocks, international stocks, and bonds. Back in the day there were increased brokers fees to purchase international stocks on a foreign stock exchange. My mutual fund lets me diversify even outside of the American economy at no additional cost in brokerage fees. Additionally, the \u201clifecycle\u201d of the mutual fund means that as the years progress, it buys different specific entities. When it\u2019s young, it is skewed towards stocks and international as they are riskier but also higher yield. As the fund matures towards 2050, it becomes less risky and buys more bonds. The idea being if there\u2019s a recession when I\u2019m 30, i have time to ride the upswing, but if a recession occurs the year before I retire and my portfolio is only stocks, I could lose half of the value of my portfolio right before retirement. Bonds are more secure. Think of mutual funds like a bag of trail mix, a mix of m&amp;ms and pretzels.\n\nTax Shelters: 401k and IRAs - these are not something you can buy, but rather a bucket you hold your specific investments in. They have tax benefits and other benefits (like employer matching %). My IRA is fully composed of mutual funds purchased monthly from my bank via autopay with no brokerage fees. Additionally my IRA is a Roth IRA which means I pay taxes on the money before it buys a mutual fund. But I don\u2019t have to pay taxes when I withdraw. This is recommended if you expect your salary to increase as you get older and more senior in your company (most people) or if you are unsure if tax law will change and be higher when you retire. So for every $10 of my salary, i pay $3 in tax and buy $7 in mutual funds. If it were a traditional IRA i could buy $10 in mutual funds but pay out at my tax bracket when I retire.\n\nA lot of this stuff has changed with technology and no fee brokerages. So don\u2019t necessarily copy what I do. My system works for me because it\u2019s easy, diversified, and automatic. I have additional \u201cplay\u201d money that i more activity engage with the market, but because I\u2019m a dumb idiot, I treat that play money as essentially gambling money and if I lose it all on Tesla stock, my retirement isn\u2019t affected.\n\nI call my above strategy the \u201cget rich slow\u201d scheme. And it works for me.",

        "body": "I'm just a casual, but here's my broad take.. The industry is broadly categorized between semiconductors (71 listed companies) and semiconductor equipment (ie making the machines used to make the chips, 38 listed companies). It covers a wide range of technologies-- analog chips, processors, network equipment, LEDs, etc.-- and generally companies need to have their niche in the global supply chain in order to have an advantage. This is because the supply chain from silicon wafer to finished product is too complex to completely vertically integrated. You can't be a foundry, equipment designer/maker, and chip designer/maker all at the same time efficiently. Also, your equipment maker can also potentially sell the manufacturing equipment to your competitors. In fact, many offer \"turn key\" solutions-- just give us the cash and the space, and we'll set up the whole factory for you! So the companies that do well tend to have (or had) an exceptional R&amp;D performance/expenditures to differentiate (AMD, NVDA, TSM today; INTC and IBM in the past). That also makes it a difficult business to maintain an advantage in, since sometimes you just run into an R&amp;D problem and no matter how much money you throw at it the engineers just can't come up with a workable solution (eg INTC).",

At this point, if a company cannot justify its valuation because it is not earning enough profit per share, it will not be able to provide a high percentage dividend. For example, AT&amp;T and IBM offer 5%+ dividends. Tesla would need to earn $90 per share to be able to sustain a 5% dividend at the current $1800 stock price. If Tesla cannot offer a competitive dividend and it had similar growth prospects, investors will sell their shares and invest elsewhere.",

The big 4 US cloud providers provides what Cloudflare offers (CDN, networking) along with a lot of other compute/data capabilities. However, Cloudflare's networking/CDNs are great value for small customers. Cloudflare integrates well with all 4 major US cloud providers, which helps get a few bigger customers who are in enterprise cloud. I would consider Akamai a more direct competitor to Cloudflare.\n\nThe Cloudflare serverless offering is new to me and sounds interesting, but AWS/Azure/GCP/IBM serverless integrates with numerous other AWS/Azure/GCP/IBM services. Not everything can run well in a serverless configuration. This will be a disadvantage to Cloudflare's serverless in attracting any big enterprises. However, again, smaller customers may want a simplified experience and go with Cloudflare over the very feature rich cloud offerings of the big 4. Also, I'd bet Cloudflare's serverless would be cheaper as well.\n\nBasically, Cloudflare won't be getting much of the big lucrative enterprise contracts that the Big 4 have, and their only real moat is the better value they give to customers who only need their small set of services. And there's a lot of small businesses out there that need what Cloudflare offers.\n\nDisclosure: I own shares of IBM/AMZN/MSFT",

        "body": "I'm just a casual, but here's my broad take.. The industry is broadly categorized between semiconductors (71 listed companies) and semiconductor equipment (ie making the machines used to make the chips, 38 listed companies). It covers a wide range of technologies-- analog chips, processors, network equipment, LEDs, etc.-- and generally companies need to have their niche in the global supply chain in order to have an advantage. This is because the supply chain from silicon wafer to finished product is too complex to completely vertically integrated. You can't be a foundry, equipment designer/maker, and chip designer/maker all at the same time efficiently. Also, your equipment maker can also potentially sell the manufacturing equipment to your competitors. In fact, many offer \"turn key\" solutions-- just give us the cash and the space, and we'll set up the whole factory for you! So the companies that do well tend to have (or had) an exceptional R&amp;D performance/expenditures to differentiate (AMD, NVDA, TSM today; INTC and IBM in the past). That also makes it a difficult business to maintain an advantage in, since sometimes you just run into an R&amp;D problem and no matter how much money you throw at it the engineers just can't come up with a workable solution (eg INTC).",

After awhile I figured I could do at least as well as the meager returns they were earning, read the classic One Up On Wall Street, and decided to use my professional knowledge of the computer industry to guide my investments. This has worked incredibly well.\n\nI was an early investor in AAPL, ADBE, AMZN, UI, TWLO, TSLA. And in companies that are gone due to acquisitions: Macromedia, Pixar. Others I rode up and sold off long ago when they lost their luster: IBM, Nokia. Many others.\n\nMy best results have always been from playing the long game buying companies with outstanding and unique offerings, when they were not well-known, hard to explain, unfairly maligned, or otherwise undervalued. They don't come along very often.\n\nInvestment funds can provide a decent return, by soothsaying financials, news, and trends, and you probably won't lose money in a well-managed fund.\n\nHowever, if you have specialized knowledge, you can do incredibly well. It's a hobby that can lead to wealth, but if you're not interested in following the markets, decent is the safe bet.",

I reverse-engineered the app, and feel confident in stating that I have a very strong understanding for how the app operates (or at least operated as of a few months ago).\n\nTikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, or your device... well, they're using it.\n\n* Phone hardware (cpu type, number of course, hardware ids, screen dimensions, dpi, memory usage, disk space, etc)\n\n* Other apps you have installed (I've even seen some I've deleted show up in their analytics payload - maybe using as cached value?)\n\n* Everything network-related (ip, local ip, router mac, your mac, wifi access point name)\n\n* Whether or not you're rooted/jailbroken\n\n* Some variants of the app had GPS pinging enabled at the time, roughly once every 30 seconds - this is enabled by default if you ever location-tag a post IIRC\n\n* They set up a local proxy server on your device for \"transcoding media\", but that can be abused very easily as it has zero authentication\n\nThe scariest part of all of this is that much of the logging they're doing is remotely configurable, and unless you reverse every single one of their native libraries (have fun reading all of that assembly, assuming you can get past their customized fork of OLLVM!!!) and manually inspect every single obfuscated function. They have several different protections in place to prevent you from reversing or debugging the app as well. App behavior changes slightly if they know you're trying to figure out what they're doing. There's also a few snippets of code on the Android version that allows for the downloading of a remote zip file, unzipping it, and executing said binary. There is zero reason a mobile app would need this functionality legitimately.\n\n... Here's the thing though.. they don't want you to know how much information they're collecting on you, and the security implications of all of that data in one place, en masse, are fucking huge. They encrypt all of the analytics requests with an algorithm that changes with every update (at the very least the keys change) just so you can't see what they're doing. They also made it so you cannot use the app at all if you block communication to their analytics host off at the DNS-level.",

Stocks are the rich mans game in 2020, this isn\u2019t 1950 anymore, stocks are the price that they are at because of a lot of manipulation by our government. I like that you\u2019re in small caps. Learn about Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ampleforth, Decentralized Finance, staking, private keys, exchanges, absorb it all. Jump into the new stuff don\u2019t even think about it just learn as you go. IMO there\u2019s more opportunity in Cryptocurrency than Stocks and I personally think it\u2019s more fun and a 24 hour market and can be done entirely on your phone if you want and buying in is so cheap right now, like pennies to invest in good tokens. If you don\u2019t believe me check out AERGO, a Token that has more impressive partnerships than hundreds of thousands of companies in the stock market. I don\u2019t think that dropping money into an index fund is a BAD idea, but IMO it\u2019s more of an 80s-2010s idea that isn\u2019t going to be as successful when the market is so disconnected from the realities facing America at the moment. I would HIGHLY recommend \u201cHow to Make Money in Stocks\u201d by William ONeil; the founder of Investor Business Daily. His strategies helped me make money in crypto this month in particular. But man just learn. That shit is free. Learn, explore, make folders and book mark shit. Definitely also recommend \u201cSteal Like an Artist\u201d",

I started investing at the beginning of last year and have about a little over 30k in my account. However, I am trailing the s&amp;p500 and nasdaq (quite considerably) for the period and would like to get some advice on what would be the best approach for \u201ccatching up\u201d to the market. Currently my portfolio is GOOGL 18%, FB 14%, V 10%, MU 9%, INTC 8%, OXY 8%, BA 7%, WFC 5%, INTU 4%, KEYS 4%, FLT 4%, UBER 3%, JNJ 3%, GILD 3%, MCD 2%.\n\nGiven the holdings above, where do you recommend I reduce/add or exit positions? I am considering selling the portfolio entirely and buying a few index funds instead to avoid the hassle of trying to beat the market, which I\u2019m clearly not good at lol.\n\nAny feedback appreciated. Thanks",
