In this capacity they are the ultimate source for whether a stock is permitted to trade (they are the primary source for regulatory halts in trading).\n\nBesides this governance requirement, the primary listing market is also where the official opening and closing price originates through that market\u2019s opening and closing processes. Besides the auction, trading in the stock occurs freely on all other venues.\n\nThere are industry run systems called Security Information Processors that are responsible for consolidating quotes and trades for all of the venues trading a stock. This is typically where most retail (think Google/Yahoo Finance) sites source their data, and it permits people who do not want to have to receive data from all of the venues individually a place to see what the market as a whole is doing in IBM or AAPL (or whatever) on a very high level.\n\nEach exchange will typically publish a symbol directory/universe that provides details on symbols they will permit trading in for a given day.",

BAC has good financials and has remained strong. A few others, NTDOY, SNE, XOM, IBM, a share of BRK.A(parents got it for me back in 2013 for 15x or something) and a few other stocks. I literally never look at that portfolio, it's just buy, forget and reinvest divys. I add on when the opportunity arises. \n\nI look for things that are a staple product and integrated into society and the world to the extent that if they were to disappear, it would have a significant impact. A simpler way to look at it, \"too big to fail\". Obviously there are other plays I make into low vol illiquid stocks.  Day to day, I just play options for fun. \n\nATVI and ETSY are good. AMZN is something to consider holding long-term. As for HD and LOW(good plays), also consider some home builders LEN and DHI. They have been performing well Q/Q. PINS, I don't know too much about them. PTON is good because they're one of the few publicly traded fitness stocks. Another is NLS(~60 times smaller market cap than PTON) which makes good quality workout equipment(much better than  PTON in my opinion) but most people want something simple and would probably pay someone to workout for them. I think the future is also dependent on the outcome for bat soup. If people are more inclined to work from home, then it's a buy. If gyms get the green light to open up nationwide, people will dump it. This is just speculation.",

Apple dominates the consumer technology market. They're no longer a \"tech\" company to me, they're a consumer products company that has positioned themselves squarely at the forefront of every major consumer technology cycle in the past two decades. They're a powerhouse of innovation and ever growing market share in smart phones, tablets, streaming, and personal computing. Their consumer ecosystem is unparalleled, and extremely sticky. I have a MacBook Pro, an iPad Pro, AirPods, iPhone, HomePod, Apple Pencil, Apple TV....they all work cohesively and I don't see myself ever transitioning away. Moreover, the proliferation of IaaS/SaaS platforms for enterprise computing has made their compatibility shortcomings less relevant in the enterprise space. \n\nApple's strong cash position allows them to hold true to their innovative culture, and dive into developing markets. Their R&amp;D budget dwarves most of their industry peers. Their 3rd party app store has made the iPhone/iPad the cornerstone of most people's interactions with the outside world. Lastly, they're even making strides in the microprocessor segment increasing product performance, further vertically integrating their supply chain. \n\nLong story short, I'm long Apple.",

Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.\n\nDivesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP\u2019s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom &amp; will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.\n\nMain downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this &amp; the sky didn't fall.\n\nTLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP",

        "body": "Intel doesn't need a wizard, I'm not sure what it is lately but historically the people running companies need more experience in management within a given industry than they do something like an E.E degree.  Look at who their CTO is if you're looking for technical competence.\n\nAMD isn't doing well because Lisu Su somehow engineered a better processor on her own and by far her personal contributions to really improving the company's fundamentals were in pushing the company into the game console market, amending the wafer supply agreement and putting a much needed axe in the Bulldozer line of processors in favor of a new architecture.  I'm sure she's a great engineer too, but that's not the job she was hired for when she was appointed CEO.  She's made great decisions as a CEO, but this whole idea there's any kind of 'wizard' out there is just wrong.\n\nIntel's problem is their fabs and no 'wizard' is going to fix that.  These are extremely complex and expensive processes that take years to set up and are not easily changed or fixed.  That's a big part of why Intel has basically given up on their 10nm process at this point and is focused on their 7nm node.  If you build something that involved and complex that's fundamentally flawed you can't just turn it around and make it work.  Intel's literally been trying for years here and that more than anything else is what's contributed to AMD's meteoric rise.",

They have a lot of internal problems as well with company culture, management etc.\n\nMeanwhile AMD still shows little sign of stopping in terms of CPUs, cutting deep into Intel's bread and butter.
