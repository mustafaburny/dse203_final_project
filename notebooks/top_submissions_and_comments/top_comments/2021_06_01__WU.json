If you're sending money from the US to here, you barely pay normal western Union fees, which are like $8 for every $100. People over here are not educated enough to know the risks this move implies for our population. \n\nCurrently, this idiot cut ties with OAS and is looking to cut ties with the US and have China as our main economic partner, just as Nicaragua did (take a look at their economy and see how they're doing). This is a disaster, uneducated population taking on high risk speculation, while cutting ties with the country that supplies 80% of our oil, for one that enslaves its people.\n\nThis move will basically make El Salvador safe haven for the corrupt ones in the world because it wouldn't be possible to trace their stolen money to have them accountable for something. By cutting ties with OAS, we're becoming a no-extradition country. The worst part is, ignorant people who voted for him still supports this crap even after being explained to.",
