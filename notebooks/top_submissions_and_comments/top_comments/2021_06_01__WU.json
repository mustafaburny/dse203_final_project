If you're sending money from the US to here, you barely pay normal western Union fees, which are like $8 for every $100. People over here are not educated enough to know the risks this move implies for our population. \n\nCurrently, this idiot cut ties with OAS and is looking to cut ties with the US and have China as our main economic partner, just as Nicaragua did (take a look at their economy and see how they're doing). This is a disaster, uneducated population taking on high risk speculation, while cutting ties with the country that supplies 80% of our oil, for one that enslaves its people.\n\nThis move will basically make El Salvador safe haven for the corrupt ones in the world because it wouldn't be possible to trace their stolen money to have them accountable for something. By cutting ties with OAS, we're becoming a no-extradition country. The worst part is, ignorant people who voted for him still supports this crap even after being explained to.",

I think their business model is obsolete unless they're adopting crypto in some fashion but I haven't paid enough attention to know what they're up to these days.

        "body": "I'm not a huge crypto bull, but you really oughtta consider it seriously if you want to go long on WU. The world doesn't have to become crypto-centric for WU to head for the exit, there just needs to be an infrastructure in remittance-receiving countries for converting crypto to fiat (local or USD) to threaten WU's business model, let alone its margins. I'm sure you know (rather hope if you were serious about WU) El Salvador plans to be providing such infrastructure and is incentivizing its population to use it, I'd closely follow (as data permits) how remittances evolve there (WU vs. BTC), if there's a drastic shift from WU usage towards BTC, I'd see no margin of safety holding WU as its moat is getting filled before our eyes. \n\n&gt;there may be some room to expand their operations\n\nWU is pretty damn mature AFAIK, revenue hasn't grown in years and it has a well-established worldwide presence, why would you think there's a growth story there? The stock makes sense as a cashflow machine, but it seems highly disruptable now that we have decentralized methods of sending digital goods having value, the landscape won't be static in the next few years, let alone 10-20 years, as it has been so far.\n\nIf the crypto scenario does unfold, they would be in a position to incorporate it to their business (redeeming crypto to fiat for ridiculous fees), but I'm not keen on betting dinosaurs are best positioned to compete in new markets, think of all the sunk cost and margin erosion if it materializes.\n\nFWIW, I am 5% long on crypto (BTC/ETH) and considered going short on WU with the El Salvador news (but fuck this from a TFSA, I hate paying for time-premium).",

        "body": "I see a lot of speculation in these comments regarding the so-called quality of the company\u2019s business model without regards to any of the fundamentals. The free cash flow has been positive for years now and the relatively low ev/ebitda is a good sign as well. Remember specific catalysts are not necessary to determine whether the company is trading at a good discount or not, therefore disruption in fintech via crypto or other payment programs is irrelevant. Looking at one competitor, paypal, we see that the discount appears to be steep therefore this warrants further investigation. I would look into the SEC filings and see what they\u2019re ($WU) up to in recent quarters. The insider ownership for this company is extremely low, which is a bad sign, however the CEO is awarded stock awards which means he has an incentive to restructure the company to make it more valuable.",
