The main predictor here is going to be capital liquidity.  When an event such as an interest rate hike adversely impacts capital liquidity globally, we can expect an abrupt pullback of some of the $3 trillion or more in excess liquidity that has been pumped into the markets during the pandemic.\n\nCapital liquidity, Shiller PE and market to GDP benchmark indicators were at their most significant deviations from their 20-year mean in 1929, 1997, and 2007.",
