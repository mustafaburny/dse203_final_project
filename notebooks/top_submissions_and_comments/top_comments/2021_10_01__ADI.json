        "body": "Thank you so much for these two meaningful and insightful posts. For a long time I have been trying to convince my friend to drop Intel stock (mostly based on their shrinking market share, your data nicely adds), but he still believes in the power of inertia. Nevertheless, I had gathered a list of stocks one IMO can use instead, not overperformative, but solid. \n\nI think that top pick is ASML - instead of betting on a sloppy big player in a growing market, you switch to the main supplier of players in this market. \nTexas Instruments and Analog Devices are good picks if you trust in the electronics segment as a whole, and they provide a wider product mix in terms of electronic components and integrated circuits.\nAnd my favorites also are companies, that produce good measurement instruments. I do solid state physics, and there is funny coincidence - producers of devices I like and use generally show good performance at a stock market. Those are Ametek, Agilent, Keysight, Danaher (Fortive).\n\nWhether you have the opinion on these companies, I would highly appreciate it.",

You can also check investor presentations and earning calls. \n\nThere is sometimes interesting information in those. \n\nThird is probably some information you can check in Yahoo Finance as well, like forward P/E, debt etc.\n\nThe last place is probably Google. You can simply Google the company and read recent news. Google makes it even easier because you can sort news based on dates and read the most recent news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, I invest in Analog Devices, Intel, Pfizer and some of the FAANG. \n\nI Google Analog Devices, Intel and Pfizer every day to read the most recent news about them, and sometimes you can notice rumors that make it worthwhile to invest more or buy in.",

The other companies are more growth than dividend but they provide dividend too (INTC, PFE, MSFT, AAPL and ADI).\n\nI do have a bit of money in VOO and VTI (accidently bought VOO instead of VTI so waiting to break even and then move what I have there to VTI).    \nI don't plan to focus that much in ETF though, as it stands right now I have only 3% of my portfolio in ETF. On one hand I want to learn more, on the other I think the stocks I have can do better than the overall market.",
