        "body": "There is no downside to taking his advice (outside of the options, in which case there is risk). The way I see it, there are a 2 variables: take his advice or not, he is right or wrong, buy options or not (as a subcategory of whether or not you take his advice). Broken down:\n\n1.) he is right, you take his advice and buy options: make money. OR, if you don't buy options and simply pull from the market, stocks are cheap after the dip and you have tons of liquidity. \n\n2.) He is right, you don't take his advice: you lose 20% of your gains and it puts you in the red for a couple of months. \n\n3.) he is wrong, you take his advice and buy options: your options expire worthless and you are out proportional to your option contracts. OR, if you don't buy options, you miss a week to a month of market trading. \n\n4.) he is wrong, you don't take his advice: yeet, you got to stay in the market for a couple weeks with no downside. \n\nHowever, I have to say that his DD looks good. I know this is a meme-ish subreddit that fully encapsulates the modern fusion of entertainment and information, but his shit should be taken seriously, and there just isn't a proven method yet to go full bear while remaining memable until it is too late. I am 100% on his side here. I've been following Steven for the past couple months and he really does know his shit. He might be wrong, anyone may be, but I have good reason to believe that he is more correct in market trading than others. \n\nFor me, I bought TLT (because I am stupid and risk-averse and don't want to get into options trading) at its low a couple weeks ago @155$ and I have only seen it go up ever since.\n\nIf you want my unironic trading strategy: I trust Russians when they talk about chess, gay men when they talk about art, and autistics when they talk about the market (related side-note: look up his youtube channel. For me, the fact that he doesn't shill it speaks to his integrity.) Steven is right, and if you want to avoid the coming dip listen to him. \n\nAll in all though, you can't go wrong. Stocks will EVENTUALLY return back to where they are now, but many stocks still haven't gotten back to pre-lockdown levels. With all the market indicators AND the news AND this DD, I think it is worth it to pull back for a couple weeks until at least after Thanksgiving/Christmas. TBH, I am hoping for airlines and TSLA to take a nosedive so I can score some cheapies with (nearly) guaranteed long-term returns. \n\nFinal point: Steven is worth listening to BECAUSE he doesn't day-trade. Day traders get too caught up in the ebbs and flows of the weekly shit; he does macro. I don't listen to him to know which specific stocks are going up or down, I listen to him to know general market trends (his Sunday night market charts are fuckin' choice, my dudes). \n\nTo Steven: This place is a meme-zone. I can guarantee that the people who are taking your advice aren't posting, and the rest are still giving you shit because that's the meme (perma-bull). To draw from a religious source (gasp): there is a reason it was so common to say, \"whoever has ears, let them hear\"; it's just that some people just don't have the ears for this. Wisdom is wasted on them who don't listen.",

Also, unlike average WSB denizen I know a little about spreads, covered calls and puts. I even have boomer Schwab account which qualifies me for having experience handling assets in multiple portfolios. Furthermore, I mentioned that I did excessive swing trading this spring. \nI only asked for a decent pay, hefty annual bonus, nice sexy secretary (can be someone\u2019s wife) and good health insurance benefit package. Given my level of experience I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask. They listened. Oh, yes, they did.

I certainly enjoy having them along side my equities, but there are several drawbacks that reduce the leverage benefits.\n\n1: The amount needed to negate every type of geographic risk. The building itself has risk of a single event. Fire, flood, etc. You have city risk if there is one industry. Rust belt is/was all factory work. Military towns could be crippled if a base is closed. Climate risk like Arizona is going to suck to own real estate as all the above impact the desirability to rent or own real estate in their area.\n\n2: Vacancy hurts. 1 month is 8.3% of the year. Imagine if your stock stopped trading for 1 month a year? S&amp;P rises 10% but your company only rose 9.2% This excludes the fees involved to find another tenant.\n\n3: Illiquid. When I want to sell stock I click a button and get filled. If I want to sell property at best it will be a couple months and lots of fees to brokers and banks.\n\n4: Expenses. Stock dosn't need multiple insurance contracts on them. Stock don't dosn't need a new roof replaced. Though many of these are tax deductions. It does add a lot more complexity though than just buying SPY.\n\n5: Local laws can vary. Every state seems to be quite different in how much they favor property owners vs renters.\n\nOne advantage of real estate is the crazy amount of tax deductions and depreciation.",

        "body": "Most fund managers don\u2019t beat the market. Because they\u2019re not trying to. Many fund managers and professional investors also have regulations they have to follow. They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

If you look at Big Commerce's or Lemonade's financials, they aren't great.  And some of the SPAC mergers are pretty suspect especially when compared to how much they run up around merger time.  \n\nI agree that there was more vaporware back in the late 90s, BUT, the fervor, the blind investing into companies without knowing anything about their financials, the double or triple digit gains within a single year.... remind you of any recent times?",

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

This year it hasn't that much. People are timid, but I largely think that is overplayed. Many companies reported great numbers for Q3. Whether the election is contested, biden wins, or trump wins, it doesn't really matter. The private sector is marching on. Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if people riot. Stimulus will pass whether its biden or trump. Even so, we know we have until next year to sort it all out. Im keeping some cash for buying opportunities, but I'm largely bullish.

So, if your purchase price for MSFT shows your actual strike price of the put (207.50), then that $300 premium just went into your account (as cash proceeds) but not counted as a P&amp;L because it's not tied to the underlying performance.\n\nmake sense? basically, if you now sell MSFT at 204.50, you've broken even (if you include proceeds from the premium). what you *should* do is now sell a CC a couple strikes above where MSFT is.\n\ngood luck have fun",

        "body": "To add on: selling covered calls is a pretty easy way to make some extra money on non-meme stocks.\n\nBasically, you're selling your shares at strike+premium, e.g. if you sell a $10 call for 1.5, you're basically selling your shares for $11.50 each. You're solidly in the green as long as the share price stays below strike+premium. If it looks like it is going to blow past your strike, and you want to hold the shares, you can usually roll to a higher strike for a net credit by adding some time. Collecting the premium also gives you some downside protection if the stock starts to drop.\n\nA basic strategy that is very popular among wealthier people is to own shares and sell monthly/quarterly strangles. E.g. own 10k $MSFT shares and sell 100 calls at +15% and 100 puts at -15% each month. Basically, getting paid to buy the dip and renting out your shares for cash.\n\nYou can easily get 10-20% monthly returns holding shares on stable companies this way, but you'll sometimes miss out on the massive rallies, so it's not suited for anyone in this sub. You'll also get screwed in the event of a covid-type crash if you've done this on margin, but if you're holding shares, you'd be screwed short-term anyway.",

If one of these companies takes a fall, the others are likely to pick up their market share in some capacity.\n\nYour example only works if all these large companies are unseated over a short period of time by companies outside the S&amp;P 500.",

Facebook (the site) itself has been viewed quite negatively by the younger generation, and it might go the way of MySpace, if there\u2019s a newer and cooler social media platform in town. Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest is a success and can be big for them, but the VR market is still very niche. \n\nAmazon has a ton of upsides, especially during and even after COVID, where everything will move towards online, everyone already knew. Despite how big Amazon is, eCommerce is still only 16% of retail sale, so there\u2019s still room. Cloud is booming, and AWS is still king.\n\nI am the most bullish on MSFT. They have a good mix of the old stuff that have been steadily making them money for decades and are still here to stay (Windows, Office/365, .NET, SQL, Xbox) and the cool new stuff that has a lot of growth potential (Azure/Cloud, Surface, GamePass, Teams). On top of that, their recent acquisitions have been doing a lot better than the failed ones in the past. I think MSFT is very solid, and they are one killer product away from taking over Apple as the #1 company in term of market cap, again.",

        "body": "Wall street expectations for gamestop are bottom of the barrel.  They still think its going bankrupt soon.  Normally this would be their worst earnings of the console cycle, but the last one had forced store closures.  I'm thinking we see better numbers this quarter. And better than worst will be a surprise.\n\nThat said, I've been saying for months that I expect the stock to drop on EPS posting for Decembers ER, but I expect a huge rally during the call.  They will absolutely talk about console presales and interest.  That itself is pretty bullish.  They're sold out of preorders and will continue to be even after the next batch drops.\n\nThis will also be a great time to talk about other activities.  Is Cohen taking an active roll in the turnaround?  He is still invested, so this is still very feasible, and an official announcement that he is actively involved would be good for at least +2-3 bucks tacked onto the stock price.\n\nTalking about continued increase in website sales and how people are responding to the massive improvements is also a likely topic.  If they don't bring up the MSFT deal, there will absolutely be questions from investors about it.  If they start forward guidance again, we could see crazy movement on that as well.\n\n\nFinally, and rather amusingly, a lack of console supply is actually bullish for GME.  People start selling used consoles to gamestop starting the day they release.  Why?  I can't fathom a legitimate reason for this, but it happens.  Super demand and no supply means people will pay new console prices for used consoles.  There will be a massive profit margin on these for gamestop, and even better, when the console is an XBox, that console starts generating passive revenue for them as well.",

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

Cardlytics, Roku, Trade Desk, etc. Yes, was difficult for a brief period in March and April but has recovered considerably. If you bought any of these at the lows you've done exceptionally. \n\n\"Surely that means they stand to take a hit by proxy if consumers have less money in their pockets due to job losses within other industries?\"\n\nThere's been countless discussions by companies that many aspects of the current crisis have forced further adoption of technology and pulled forward years of growth. Businesses are spending on tech. That's why you have SaaS companies up 100-200-300%+ YTD.\n\nSatya Nadella on Microsoft's quarterly call about a week ago: \n\n\"The way I think about the computing landscape going forward is if you sort of said at the highest of levels today as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is 5%. We think it will double in the next 10 years. And if anything, this pandemic perhaps has accelerated that doubling. And in that context, what\u2019s the large -- the most secular need, it\u2019s the need for distributed cloud infrastructure. It\u2019s both needed for modernizing existing applications you have, and so that\u2019s why -- by the way, 20% penetrated, so there\u2019s more 80% that needs to move. But more importantly, there\u2019s going to be new application starts which need infrastructure. And so, if you sort of add those up, I think that we\u2019re still in early innings. There will be between quarters, volatility, all of the points that Amy made even earlier. But, we think distributed cloud infrastructure is the most important layer. But, the way we\u2019ve approached it is not to just think of that layer in isolation but the data layer work we do composes, the AI layer composes and more importantly, our SaaS applications, whether business applications, Power Platform, Microsoft 365, all reinforce that same modern tech stack. So, I would still say that digitization in its -- this new tech stack is in its very infancy.\"\n\nIn the Spring, Nadella:  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months.\"\n\n\"consumers have less money in their pockets due to job losses within other industries?\"\n\nConsumer tech? Yes, unfortunately there are a lot of people who are not doing well. But there's still plenty of people who are doing well and who are buying the latest phone - people are streaming, they're constantly looking at the news with everything going on, etc. The phone is a staple at this point. Video games are doing exceptionally well. \n\nYou also had a complete trade off this year and there were some companies that lost out and some that benefited. Apparel lost. Travel lost. That money went into home furnishings and technology as people stayed home. I think technology spending is becoming more and more a priority with each passing year and this year accelerated that considerably, but there was certainly an aspect of people didn't spend on A and B so that money went to C and D.",
