        "body": "There is no downside to taking his advice (outside of the options, in which case there is risk). The way I see it, there are a 2 variables: take his advice or not, he is right or wrong, buy options or not (as a subcategory of whether or not you take his advice). Broken down:\n\n1.) he is right, you take his advice and buy options: make money. OR, if you don't buy options and simply pull from the market, stocks are cheap after the dip and you have tons of liquidity. \n\n2.) He is right, you don't take his advice: you lose 20% of your gains and it puts you in the red for a couple of months. \n\n3.) he is wrong, you take his advice and buy options: your options expire worthless and you are out proportional to your option contracts. OR, if you don't buy options, you miss a week to a month of market trading. \n\n4.) he is wrong, you don't take his advice: yeet, you got to stay in the market for a couple weeks with no downside. \n\nHowever, I have to say that his DD looks good. I know this is a meme-ish subreddit that fully encapsulates the modern fusion of entertainment and information, but his shit should be taken seriously, and there just isn't a proven method yet to go full bear while remaining memable until it is too late. I am 100% on his side here. I've been following Steven for the past couple months and he really does know his shit. He might be wrong, anyone may be, but I have good reason to believe that he is more correct in market trading than others. \n\nFor me, I bought TLT (because I am stupid and risk-averse and don't want to get into options trading) at its low a couple weeks ago @155$ and I have only seen it go up ever since.\n\nIf you want my unironic trading strategy: I trust Russians when they talk about chess, gay men when they talk about art, and autistics when they talk about the market (related side-note: look up his youtube channel. For me, the fact that he doesn't shill it speaks to his integrity.) Steven is right, and if you want to avoid the coming dip listen to him. \n\nAll in all though, you can't go wrong. Stocks will EVENTUALLY return back to where they are now, but many stocks still haven't gotten back to pre-lockdown levels. With all the market indicators AND the news AND this DD, I think it is worth it to pull back for a couple weeks until at least after Thanksgiving/Christmas. TBH, I am hoping for airlines and TSLA to take a nosedive so I can score some cheapies with (nearly) guaranteed long-term returns. \n\nFinal point: Steven is worth listening to BECAUSE he doesn't day-trade. Day traders get too caught up in the ebbs and flows of the weekly shit; he does macro. I don't listen to him to know which specific stocks are going up or down, I listen to him to know general market trends (his Sunday night market charts are fuckin' choice, my dudes). \n\nTo Steven: This place is a meme-zone. I can guarantee that the people who are taking your advice aren't posting, and the rest are still giving you shit because that's the meme (perma-bull). To draw from a religious source (gasp): there is a reason it was so common to say, \"whoever has ears, let them hear\"; it's just that some people just don't have the ears for this. Wisdom is wasted on them who don't listen.",

Of course, I sent a few applications, got some calls back and shortly after I met with some hedge funds managers. I told them that I am very bullish, that stonks always go up and that I have a RH trading account (negative gains YTD but it depends on your risk tolerance and overall perspective). Also, unlike average WSB denizen I know a little about spreads, covered calls and puts. I even have boomer Schwab account which qualifies me for having experience handling assets in multiple portfolios. Furthermore, I mentioned that I did excessive swing trading this spring. \nI only asked for a decent pay, hefty annual bonus, nice sexy secretary (can be someone\u2019s wife) and good health insurance benefit package. Given my level of experience I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask. They listened. Oh, yes, they did. They generously offered me a position as well as this spacious office with my own leather executive seat in the heart of Manhattan. Starting tomorrow before the morning bell.

        "body": "I have several residential rental properties. I certainly enjoy having them along side my equities, but there are several drawbacks that reduce the leverage benefits.\n\n1: The amount needed to negate every type of geographic risk. The building itself has risk of a single event. Fire, flood, etc. You have city risk if there is one industry. Rust belt is/was all factory work. Military towns could be crippled if a base is closed. Climate risk like Arizona is going to suck to own real estate as all the above impact the desirability to rent or own real estate in their area.\n\n2: Vacancy hurts. 1 month is 8.3% of the year. Imagine if your stock stopped trading for 1 month a year? S&amp;P rises 10% but your company only rose 9.2% This excludes the fees involved to find another tenant.\n\n3: Illiquid. When I want to sell stock I click a button and get filled. If I want to sell property at best it will be a couple months and lots of fees to brokers and banks.\n\n4: Expenses. Stock dosn't need multiple insurance contracts on them. Stock don't dosn't need a new roof replaced. Though many of these are tax deductions. It does add a lot more complexity though than just buying SPY.\n\n5: Local laws can vary. Every state seems to be quite different in how much they favor property owners vs renters.\n\nOne advantage of real estate is the crazy amount of tax deductions and depreciation.",

        "body": "Ok because you guys are actually too stupid to understand how this works, I'm just going to copy and paste from Matt Levine.\n\nTL;DR: Robinhood profits because retail trades are random, so HF traders can actually get a small spread. Your prices will be better than institutional prices (so we're winning at the expense of the big boyz).  \n\n\n&gt;Robinhood\u2019s business model is:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Citadel gives it money.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It uses the money to give you free stock trades.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That really is taking money from the rich (high-frequency traders) to give to the poor, sort of (millennials who want to trade stocks on their phones).\u00a0Who did you *think*\u00a0was giving it money?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Not only that. Payment for order flow really is \u201cone of the most controversial practices on Wall Street,\u201d but [the controversy tends to be confused and obfuscated](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-02-25/-flash-boys-exchange-isn-t-about-the-little-guy). The basic idea of payment for order flow is that electronic market makers want to be left alone to quietly make the spread: They want to buy stock for $99.99 and sell it at $100.01 and clip two cents on each trade. If their orders are random\u2014if sometimes people buy and sometimes they sell, with no pattern\u2014then that works out well for the market makers. But their big risk is what they call \u201cadverse selection\u201d: Sometimes, when a customer buys 100 shares at $100.01, it then buys another 100 shares at $100.02, and another 100 shares at $100.03, and keeps going until it has bought 10,000 shares and pushed the price up dramatically. The market maker who sold it the first 100 shares\u2014and who is probably now short and needs to go out and buy those shares at a higher price\u2014has been run over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is a risk of being a market maker on the public stock exchanges: Sometimes you sell 100 shares to a small retail investor and it\u2019s random noise; other times you sell 100 shares to Fidelity and you get run over. But if a market maker can guarantee that it will\u00a0*only*\u00a0interact with retail customers\u2014if it can filter out big orders from institutional investors\u2014then its risk of adverse selection goes way down. The way the market maker does this is by paying retail brokers to send it their order flow, and promising those brokers that it will execute their orders\u00a0*better*\u00a0than the public markets would. (This is called \u201cprice improvement,\u201d and allows the retail brokers to fulfill their obligation to give their customers \u201cbest execution.\u201d) So if a stock is quoted at $99.99 bid, $100.01 offered on the public exchanges, the market maker might buy it from retail customers for $99.991 or sell it to them at\u00a0$100.009. (It\u2019s not usually\u00a0*much*\u00a0price improvement.) It can offer a tighter spread than the public markets\u2014and have money left over to pay the retail brokers\u2014because it doesn\u2019t have to worry about adverse selection. If the retail broker is, say, one designed to let young people day-trade for free on their phones, then those orders are probably particularly valuable, because they are probably particularly random.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are two objections to this practice. One is that it is bad for investors whose orders *aren\u2019t*\u00a0sold to market makers, the institutional investors who instead trade on\u00a0public stock exchanges. Payment for order flow\u00a0fragments the markets, takes retail order flow away from the public stock exchanges, widens out spreads on those exchanges, and, by segregating retail and institutional orders, makes institutional execution worse. This objection is probably true! If you\u2019re a hedge-fund manager, you should dislike payment for order flow, because it makes public markets worse for you. (If you invest through mutual funds, as I do, you should also dislike it, for the same reason.)\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The other objection is that payment for order flow is bad for investors whose orders\u00a0*are*\u00a0sold to market makers, the retail investors whose orders never touch the stock exchange. If the market makers are paying to get their orders, surely they are doing something nefarious with them, right? Otherwise why would they pay? This objection seems mostly wrong. Very occasionally there is some\u00a0evidence of [market makers doing naughty stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-01/tesla-will-try-to-be-more-normal) with the retail orders that they buy, but for the most part, particularly for simple market orders,\u00a0the result is straightforward: Retail customers are instantly able to buy stock at a price at least as good as, and usually better than, the best price available in the public markets. And the market makers pay their brokers for the privilege, so the brokers can offer cheaper (even free!) stock trades. They are unambiguously better off than they would be if their brokers didn\u2019t sell their orders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So by selling its customers\u2019 orders to market makers, Robinhood is actually stealing from two sets of \u201cthe rich\u201d: Rich market makers like Citadel are paying it directly for the orders, while rich hedge-fund managers are getting worse execution on public stock exchanges so that Robinhood customers can get better executions off those exchanges. Big institutions are paying to subsidize free trades for Robinhood\u2019s customers. It feels pretty Robin-Hood-y! If I were Robinhood I would advertise that!\u00a0\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-16/carl-icahn-wants-to-fight-dell-again?sref=2jPYL79S](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-16/carl-icahn-wants-to-fight-dell-again?sref=2jPYL79S)",

        "body": "Animal health stocks (IDXX and ZTS): Should accelerate growth in 2021 after restrictions are lifted and people are more comfortable going to the vet. See the earnings call for IDXX, revenue growth and vet visits are actually positive this year because despite the restrictions... people still care about their pets and more people WFH = more first time pet owners\n\nLYV: What I learned is that most people don't care about social distancing and are ok with packing a venue to watch concerts and sports again. So many of the mom and pop shop venues are probably going to close due to $0 cash flow this year. As long as LYV can make it out alive until restrictions are lifted... the only competitor in there way will be pretty much AEG and they can continue its pre-COVID momentum. Warning... the stock hasn't dropped a lot for a company that is in a cash crunch and has +95% revenue decrease, which surprises me. E\nWhat won't surprise me if the stock drops to $20 - $45 and I'll be a buyer.\n\nV and MA: Should also accelerate growth once a vaccine is available and transactions are lifted. They should recover a big chunk of their spending volume and cross-border fees, but I think business travel is permanently impaired. Right now I'm a V holder, but I like PYPL a bit more as my favorite fintech.",
