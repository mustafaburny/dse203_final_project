        "body": "MCD is a good dividend play, good yield and growth. V has a low yield but high growth. I own both. \n\nI own dividend stocks because it makes it easier to hold things like SHOP, AMZN, PAYC, NFLX, GOOGL, NVDA (negligible dividend but I\u2019ll take it). The dividends pay my living expense and the non-payers just sit in my portfolio and get bigger. All my stocks have a job, though not the same exact function. \n\nWould I have been better off with a portfolio of 100% SHOP calls? YOLO FTW? That would have done even better than QQQ, VUG, MCD or V, right? Well yeah, but I want to preserve my wealth as well as grow it. I also want to preserve my sanity. I want to sleep well at night, most nights. If I doubled my  net worth tomorrow it would not have a dramatic effect on my life, but if I lost it all I\u2019d be ruined. I\u2019m too old for that shit. \n\nSo it all depends on your goals and life circumstances too. If you\u2019re young and in accumulation mode, go for capital gains. Dividends literally do not matter to you; total return is all. If you\u2019re old and in withdrawal mode, dividends have a place (so do bonds). Chasing yield rarely ends well though.",
