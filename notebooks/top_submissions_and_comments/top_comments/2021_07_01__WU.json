Not good or bad just changed.\n\nIt's been all over the place since last year between Vogel and Wu. But this is the final iteration it seems.\n\nThe last iteration was\nWu: 25% locked for 1 year unless above $15 for 20 days. 75% two year locked \n\nOther Microvast shareholders: 6 months\n\nVogel/Tuscan: \n50% is locked for 1 year, unless it trades above $12.50 for 20 days. The other 50% is locked for 2 years.\n\n\n\n**Now it is**\nWu: 25% locked for 1 year unless above $15 for 20 days. 75% two year locked. (Yes unchanged)\n\nOther Microvast shareholders: 6 months\n\nVogel/Tuscan:\n**READ THIS CAREFULLY**\n \nOf 75% of shares, 67% of the shares are locked for 1 year unless above $12.50 for 20 days. The other 33% is locked for 1 year regardless of price. \n\nOf the other 25% of shares, 50% is locked for 1 year unless it trades over $12 for 20 days. The other 50% is locked for 1 year unless it trades over 15. However he will lose his shares if none of these conditions are met.\n\nThese lockups are fairly similar (e.g 67% of 75% is 50%). I don't know if he's fucking with me or I'm just stupid). In summarize it's leaning more positive in my opinion that Vogel got himself a poor man's \"FDs\" and is either bullish or likes to gamble. Can slightly sell more now if it goes up, but will forfeit ownership to them for $0 if it doesn't.",
