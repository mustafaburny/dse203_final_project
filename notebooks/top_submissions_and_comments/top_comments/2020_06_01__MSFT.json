People often associate market impact with buying stocks, but little do they know, retail investors can amplify their impact via option trading. \nReason why is that when you buy lets a call on the $SPY, market makers will hedge that position by purchasing shares of SPY in order to delta hedge their exposure. \n\nHere is an example: last year, some guys on r/wallstreetbets discovered that if enough call options are bought on a certain stock, in this case $MSFT, market makers will be forced to hedge their position by purchasing the shares on the open market thus driving up the stock price. I remember seeing my call options go up 50% by tomorrow open and MSFT going up 2% (keep in mind at this point they have a trillion dollar market cap). Right after close, someone posted an article saying how MSFT went up a lot for no reason and how suspicious option acitivty might be driving it.",

Wrote them down to remind myself during the next crash. \n\n1. **Don\u2019t sell.**\u00a0Unless you are able to predict the top and bottom, selling would mean you make a loss and miss out when the market rebounds. I made the mistake of selling PayPal at a loss, thinking I would switch my funds to buying Microsoft, which was doing well with their video conferencing app. At the time, PayPal was slow moving compared to the other tech companies. I sold PayPal and did not manage to get into Microsoft early enough to ride the gains. As a result, I not only missed out on the opportunity on Microsoft, I missed out my gains for PayPal had I held. PayPal has since gained 20% from my average price.\u00a0\n\n2. **Don\u2019t panic, average down.**\u00a0During a crisis, don\u2019t panic! (I know, easier said than done) Determine value of the stock and its fundamentals. If the fundamentals are still intact, ignore the noise and just average down. Divide your spare cash in 3 pockets. Every time the stock drops 10%, buy in. The economy will eventually recover and this is how you make use of the opportunity to make high returns.\u00a0\n\n3. **Follow the trend.**\u00a0The market may not always make sense. During this crisis, despite rounds of weak economic data (unemployment, GDP decline etc.), the market has rallied 25%. Follow the trend, ride the wave, don\u2019t try to go against it. Shorting this market will only hurt you. Don\u2019t fight against the Fed.",
