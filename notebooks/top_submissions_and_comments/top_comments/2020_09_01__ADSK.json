It's extremely odd to say the least that Unity and Snowflake are rocketing up while the rest of tech is coming down...it points to the fact that growth/tech investors are parking their money here and will be shorted later. So I believe in unity long term, but I'm going to wait to jump in.",

        "body": "Just reading their S-1 I don't think it's nearly as large a market as they think.\n\n&gt;industries beyond gaming, we estimate the market opportunity for our Create Solutions and Operate Solutions to be approximately $17\u00a0billion today, based on the number of software developers, architects and designers our solutions could potentially serve. \n\nWhich is $5 billion more than they estimated the value of the gaming market to be as of 2019.\n\nSurely there's some need for interactive 3D, but the product examples they give are not compelling. Here are all the examples they give in the s-1 of non-gaming uses of their technology:\n\n&gt;Architecture:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For architects, transforming building development and architectural data for the 3D world has been a challenge. Seemingly small post-design changes can take months to rework. Architects, designers and project partners use this real-time 3D to simultaneously contribute to the planning and development of a building with rapid, cost-effective iteration. Onsite construction teams and technicians can visualize before, and as they build. Interactive, 3D designs can be virtually overlaid onto actual construction through augmented reality, to detect design flaws early, which significantly reduces the risk of future rebuilds and drives project efficiencies. \n\nFirst of all professional CAD tools are hellishly complex which makes the market entrenched and difficult to disrupt. Architectural tools are not where you want lots of frills and real time effects, so I'm not sure what they think they are contributing over traditional 3D cad tools in terms of planning and design stages. Existing tools are hundreds of iterations deep and have huge momentum based on their widespread use among college professors, newly graduated engineers and seasoned designers. That unity can leverage their 3d game engine to disrupt that market is laughable.\n\nThere is however the VR/AR aspect, which probably does have some merit. That said, I just don't see how much money is really worth it for an architect or designer to be able to strap on a be helmet and look at their design. Keep in mind that the target audi nice here is already comprised of people who are necessarily very good at visualizing objects and spaces from 2d schematics.\n\nAs for AR used to aid in construction, I have no doubt that it has potential to ease certain aspects of large projects. That said, setting up and maintaining accurate AR on an active build site is not a solved problem, and I'm unconvinced many builders would find the marginal benefits to be worth potentially large cost increases.\n\nThen you have this\n\n&gt;Automotive:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The automotive industry is often challenged by a long, slow development cycle for new car models. The traditional process involves disparate tools in the iterative creation and recreation of a new model. Real-time 3D technology is driving efficiencies in car development and sales cycles, allowing for interactive, life-like models of cars to be rendered in real-time. These \u201cdigital twins\u201d can be used for marketing or personalized sales experiences at dealerships and online. \n\n\u00a0Their whole argument here is basically that real time 3D and VR can be used as a sales gimmick. I think it could be useful for initial car shopping, but people are always going to want to physically sit in their cars (and test drive them) before the purchase. Of course more car shopping is being done online now due to covid, but unless the covid crisis continues for much longer than public health officials expect (passed 2021) I think unity may be too late to take advantage of that temporary market.\n\nI guess the question here is how valuable would this be as a marketing tool really? Is it worth billions of dollars to allow shoppers to pretend to sit in a car? Who owns the VR equipment in this case, the dealership or the purchaser? Does this rely on much broader VR adoption than we've seen in recent years?\n\nThen the last example they give is this:\n\n&gt;Film:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filmmakers are finding that real-time technology yields faster results and provides more creative freedom than traditional filming and editing solutions. Real-time technology removes the need for server farms that generate single frames over hours, eliminating the need to wait days for dailies or for servers to fully render a digital scene. Because creation becomes be real-time, a filmmaker can edit and review a scene instantly, allowing higher quality productions to reach audiences more quickly. \n\nWhich honestly is the most laughable part. The implication here seems to be that unity's realtime engine will allow filmmakers to preview their work without having to wait for the full render. This is obviously invaluable when iterating visual computer generated effects and animations, which is why every professional 3D suite already has this capability. Why would you export your scene to a unity 3d tool for real time rendering when Maya [can already do this](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-Rendering/files/GUID-2FFD2E18-DEAC-4D73-8F07-082FAD5B4A16-htm.html)? The only way into this market for unity is either to replace Autodesk's existing real time renderer (which would be expensive and hold no benefit for Autodesk) or replace tools such as Maya and others entirely (which again would be hellishly expensive and time consuming)\n\nTL;DR \n\nThe market just isn't as big as unity claims it is, and the examples of non-game applications are far from convincing.",

        "body": "Unity is mostly used for the entertainment industry, video games and visual effects. I don't need to explain the importance in video games. But for the visual effect, maya isn't used as a real-time engine, in fact Autodesk doesn't have a robust real time rendering engine and their software is mostly used for animating or creating the 3D meshes which are then exported to another software like unity or in the API to render engines like arnold or vray (which are not real-time). Similarly for Autocad project you would do the same thing, build it once in Autocad and then the designer/architect would export it and make the futures changes in unity using AI and some scripting.\n\nReal-time rendering is much faster than any renderer used for film and television, which produce the same quality for the most part, so it can be very useful on a film set to have the director watching his render already done as a temporary real-time version or for a pre-vis company like \"the third floor\" to produce the whole movie in matter of few months for the director and producers to carefully schedule and redesign the movie based on the objectives of the producing company very fast.\nWeta has some existing real-time proprietary software that are already doing that I beleive. Autodesk products are complimentary of all of these tools, they are essential but they don't make it at the whole.",

People might benefit from your experience. \n\nAlso, Unity is a household name for engineers, software/game developers, animators, and is becoming increasingly relevant in a number of other industries. Good comparison to Autodesk, so maybe look at the relative valuations and financials of those two companies and see which you think presents the better value. I'm seeing ADSK as the better value right now while U is pretty trendy. But that's only part of the picture.\n\nAutodesk vs Unity would also be a good post.

It's still a speculative position for me (&lt;1% of portfolio). If it goes down but I still see a growth story, I'll buy more. If it goes up and solidifies as a major player in a number of industries, I'd buy more. If its revenue growth accelerates and/or its path to profitability becomes clearer, I'd buy more.\n\nBest of luck to you",

Just seems like something\u2019s missing for them to become a major player\n\nUnity has been at or near the top of popularity charts going back several years. It has far more market penetration than Unreal, particularly for mobile and in certain foreign markets.\n\n&gt;Just seems like something\u2019s missing for them to become a major player \n\nI'm curious where your perception comes from, it seems like they're already the one to beat and are well-poised to ride the expansion of the industry.",

There's also billions of dollars currently being poured into the industry from companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Tencent, Sea Ltd, Sony and others. That doesn't even include the software side of things with companies like Unity, Epic, MatterPort, Autodesk and others continuing to invest in the VR/AR side. \n\nI'd imagine that it will become more common across a variety of industries especially when you're projecting out over the next decade.

Autodesk discontinued their Stingray game engine in 2017 and now offer tools that [work with Unity](https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/real-time-rendering) for doing real-time visualizations.\n\nYes, some Autodesk tools (Maya, 3DS Max, MudBox) are used by artists to make game assets that are then dropped into another game engine such as Unreal or Unity. But they're specialized, only used by a few members of a game team and have competition from other tools (Blender, ZBrush and Adobe's Substance Designer for example.)\n\nNote that a lot of these tools and engines are very \"sticky\", in that game developers and companies take time to get comfortable and then stay with them for years. They are also the product of their generation: Unreal is still more popular for PC games because it was first; Unity is more popular for making mobile games because it addressed those platforms first.\n\nFor example: Amazon even has their own game engine (Lumberyard) but basically nobody uses it - even though it's effectively free - because Unity or Unreal are more mature and the preferred tools for most developers.\n\nAnyway, here are Unity's own numbers:\n\n[https://unity.com/our-company](https://unity.com/our-company)\n\n&gt;*2019 - 51% of games were powered by Unity (PC/console/top mobile games combined)*\n\nAnd on some more:\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/how-unity-built-a-gaming-engine-for-the-future/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/how-unity-built-a-gaming-engine-for-the-future/)\n\n&gt;*Unity dominates in mobile games \u2014 now the largest (and fastest growing) segment of the gaming industry \u2014 where it has over 50% market share and where Unreal is not a common alternative. Unity has kept the largest market share in AR and VR content, at over 60%.*",

So essentially a ton of people bought a ton of upside calls today could account for this massive IV increase. \n\nHowever, from a trading perspective this seems super exploitable. Essentially here's what it's implying. \n\nIt's saying Yesterday there was an X % chance for Tesla to be &gt; 800 (or pick any other upside strike) by September 18. Now Today, despite Tesla going down 4-5% at this current point, there is still an X % chance or even &gt; X% chance for Tesla to be &gt; 800 by September 18. That's insane!\n\nDespite 1 day passing by and a 4-5% drop in stock, the probability, according to MM, didn't change or even increased at certain points in the day! And it's not like there's that many days until September 18 anyways.\n\nI feel like this isn't a supply/demand issue. I think actually it's possible this market got broken due to outsized, black swan moves from stocks like CRM, ZM and DOCU who didn't even have an earnings yet that MM are so pressed to selling vol they jacked up everything arbitrarily across all names, which includes Tesla and CRM but should include others, which I haven't delved into.",

So we don't want to sell any more options at an x volatility. So retail keeps on buying at x+y and then x+y+z, etc. We keep on making sales at these 'inflated' prices and they keep on buying them.\n\nI presume this phenomena is happening in AAPL. Got steamrolled in CRM (what a move) and ZM (today). So we keep on offering at higher and higher levels (and retail keeps on buying) which is nuts.\n\nBecause the big tech stocks make up a huge portion on the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY), we can get a little hedge on buy bidding up calls in the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY). Because we are bidding up calls, we are now impacting VIX.\n\nThis is the only explanation I have for you. I think you are probably OK selling a little vol here (but I would go smaller size because of this craziness... vol can still go higher).",

I would bet that a senior trader/partner has taken over these names (TSLA AAPL CRM FB GOOG etc) to make sure that the firm doesn't get clobbered too much.\n\nWe all know to respect the markets, but at some level the 'madness' has to end. Of course, nobody knows when that will happen. Notwithstanding, the 'edge' you get selling at x+y+z volatility is more than you got at x+y which is more than what you got at x. You may be wrong at the x and x+y levels, but at the x+y+z level you made up for your losses (from x and X+y) and then some. Thus, the snowball effect of implied volatility becoming actual volatility might be true at the x and x+y level and overstated at the x+y+z level. (There has to be some edge selling options because you need a balance sheet selling options versus buying options).\n\nSo I do agree with what you are saying that the implieds will eventually be overstating what is happening with actual volatility. Unfortunately, nobody knows what level this will be. Thus, selling vol in small pieces at higher and higher levels is probably the safest way of doing this (and this is probably what the market makers are doing). You should have enough edge that you can scratch a trade if it doesn't feel right...",
