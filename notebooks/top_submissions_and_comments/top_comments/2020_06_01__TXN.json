For other financials, check out PRU, BEN (study risks). Maybe also MET and AFL.\n\nCVS, WBA, BMY, PFE\n\nSafety here, especially amid COVID-19.\n\nCSCO\n\nNot now, but when yield is closer to 4%.\n\nOKE\n\nMore risk (but less than the REITs IMHO), high payout ratio, worth researching and watching.",

I was researching on this further and it seems Wealthsimple does not support holding USD currency in my account, therefore norberts gambit wouldnt work there as once I sell the USD ETF it will convert back to CAD. Conversion fee is the only way they make money so it seems accurate that they wouldnt allow this.\n\nSeems like the best bet for me would be to transfer over to Questrade and then use norberts gambit to convert into USD. I would have to pay the $4.95-$9.95 commission per txn but this is faaar better off than the 3% conversion fee!\n\nThank you!",
