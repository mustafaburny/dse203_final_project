I know these companies in and out. Then I wait for a dislocation in the stock and or a sell off in the market. Once this happens I buy call LEAPs at least one to two years out, waiting for mean reversion and or whatever catalyst I believe takes place. Most importantly, I trim gains along the way up by setting specific targets. Thus at 20% gain I sell X amount of position, 50% x amount of position etc etc. This protects my gains even though does limit a bit of my upside but found this to be important in locking in gains before they all erode. Especially in options. IE earlier this year CEO of VWM left for INTC, VMW was crushed by over 15% for a stock that barely moves. That was an easy play knowing there was a dislocation and the stock soldoff based on their CEO leaving which really didn't matter since the company is essentially controlled by Dell. Then I bought calls on VMW, stock went back to previous levels and I trimmed at 40% and 70% initially then let the rest ride. Ended up closing my position a few weeks later for a bit over 60% gain in about 3 months by using target goals I set myself for each position and play.\n\nDoesn't mean I am always invested all the time, I patiently wait for the right opportunities but do sit in higher cash position than most before striking. Currently 40% cash as markets are a bit frothy.\n\nHave had excellent returns with this approach but it took time to develop and learn through my experiences.",

While NVidia sometimes puts their boot up their asshole wrt drivers, they generally just tickle the ring whereas AMD started with the booth firmly ensconced in the lower intestine and have been struggling to remove it. They have improved, but are still a ways behind.\n\nTheir CPUs are really good right now and Intel are floundering. That said they are still hampered because most current software isn't very good at multi threading so single core performance is important, especially for gaming, and Intel are competitive there. They are eating Intel in data centers though.\n\nThe big thing for me is that AMD have a runway - theyre still behind but have better CPUs and the data centre uptake is very bullish. Supply could become an issue here, because the big data centre players won't want to wait or to overpay. But assuming adequate supply there should be noticeable growth in the data center side, and of course GPU supply constraints mean that they will continue to sell as many as they make.",

The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD. \n\nA plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and \"5G-cloudification\" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI &amp; tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM &amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China's Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.",

The RISC architecture has advantages over CISC architecture which we are observing right now and/or will observe in the near future. And these can't be undone, worked over, or something else. Every x86/x64 processor developed today can run programs written 30-40 years ago, while a company like Apple can come and say screw that, we start from scratch. This and other issues in the x86 architecture make it an (apparent at least) dead end. AMD is also offering a big competition to Intel, and in the server space there is also big competition.

Every % improvement of performance per watt makes a huge difference when you have millions of machines. After Intels problems with performance and vulnerabilities, datacenters / cloud platforms learned that they need to diversify a bit and have rapidly introducing AMD based servers. \n\nWhile I do think Intel will fix their issues and is still valuable, in terms of pure growth, it seems like AMD has more potential as datacenters are diversifying to use more AMD. I guess the main risk is if AMD can keep up with demand.\n\nWhat I'm more interested in is Intels venture into ARM based chips.",

Intel has needed an engineering leader for a while and they\u2019ve only had finance and sales guys.\n\nYou are counting out Intel based on their record of past failures over the last decade. However, my belief is that their execution and product line are going to improve drastically over the next couple years.\n\nThere\u2019s room in the market for both TSM and Intel on the fab side. There\u2019s a massive shortage in semiconductor capacity. Everything is going to need high performance chips in ten years. Current investments by TSM and Intel are just a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed to create capacity to meet future demand. So it\u2019s not a zero sum market between TSM and Intel.\n\nAMD vs Intel vs ARM is a bigger threat \u2026 however, people underestimate what Intel\u2019s server group has cooking. Here also I think x86 with Intel cores will reign supreme for some high value work loads. Having said that, I think it\u2019s unavoidable that ARM based VMs are going to swallow a lot of low end cloud compute. We tested AWS ARM VMs for many work loads and they were an absolute win on a cost adjusted basis. Intel will have to do some serious work to stop that drift.\n\nAlso, having my dev machine as an ARM Mac instead of an x86 MAc this year for the first time, means I\u2019m actually running ARM server binaries natively and x86 binaries under emulation, instead of vice versa which was the case in previous years.",

Its not super clear that its a slam dunk win for AMD. Its more moving parts in the future whereas we prefer less moving parts with current competitive advantage.\n\nNVDA is kicking AMD's ass inside out on GPU and hardware acceleration in datacentre/AI. We just have to accept it as it is. NVDA is something you should also look to get into when the price isnt so stupid. AMD is not NVDA though. Dont expect those price levels. NVDA has a fucking stranglehold in market sectors that AMD does not have.\n\nAMD is however takings Intel's lunchmoney on x86 and its mainly because Intel fucked up on EUV. Intel's comments on \"chiplets glued together\"? Well those chiplets glued together are what allow AMD to make much better yields on smaller die sizes. When a wafer has an issue, you lose a lower portion of the wafer if you have smaller dies, or chiplets. So now AMD has several years lead on making chiplet designs talk to eachother faster or more efficiently.\n\nIntel is however throwing in the towel and going to pay for EUV by TSMC in 2023. AMD has advance plans for 2023 with TSMC anyway and think they are second customer behind Apple so should be on a more even playing field moving forward in 2023, with the advantage of maybe 5 years with infinity fabric and chiplet design instead of monolithic dies. However if EUV pellicles come good by then, monolithic dies may be better - cant tell.\n\nTrying to figure out short term moves with AMD is nuts. Just buy stock or leaps.",

The best thing Mr. Ishrak did was bring the pacemakers to market. So, let's say I want a personalized AI, that learns from me and continuously recalibrates for my unique body in real time. I'm gonna need Intel level computational support to run my implantable, like a pacemaker. The big problem Mr. Ishrak ran into in his life was that the pacemakers got hacked. So, bear with me, if I'm a theoretical whale, I can afford a badassed implant. 1) I'm wise enough to know I want it to be AI &amp; computationally gifted, super smart, and personalized. 2) I need that implant to be autonomous and never talk to the cloud for security reasons, as if my health data goes public or gets hacked, it can be used to tank my stonk, or kill me, or in the case of a world leader, bring political turmoil. I'd like to see CPUH go visionary and make a chip on chip neuromorphic device that is implantable.

        "body": "LEAPs are a specific type of option (Long-Term Equity Anticipation) that expire more than 1 year out. Right now most LEAPs are for January 2023, and I think we'll see some January 2024s coming out in the next few months.\n\nWith the synthetic long, you should aim for as far out into the future as possible. This allows ample time for your investment thesis to play out (somewhat moot because you can roll indefinitely), and more importantly helps with taxes if you make gains on the long call (assuming USA here). No need to worry about the greeks in this strategy because the long call and short put offset the greeks on each other, but important to know your delta will come out to 1 after you buy the call and sell the put. Opening 1 of these positions with a delta of 1 means you are tracking the gains and losses of 100 shares. That's what gives this strategy the leverage it has, because you get a delta of 1 while sometimes getting paid to open the position.\n\nBuying a call does not take care of the collateral for the written put and this strategy will use some of your available margin. Most securities will require 30ish% collateral for the short put, and higher for more volatile securities. So in this instance, entering at the 55 strikes for INTC will require $1,650 of margin, but you'll receive $.10 credit with yesterday's prices. Compare that to the cost to buy 100 shares, which is about $5,600 today, so this is where the leverage shows.",

All the DDs written on here continue to ignore how important the Xilinx merger is. It was hated on by many, but Su Bae is no moron, she is strongly positioning AMD to dominate the CPU and Semi-Custom solutions. AMD will continue to make progress in the GPU and gaming market but the growth and tendies will come from expanding further into and dominating the server industry and building strong relationships that will establish profits for years, as well as expansion into 5g, aerospace and defense, and AI.",

        "body": "Stay away from day trading. It's a nasty habit to pick up and most people aren't cut out for it. Swing tradings a lot less work and typically safer\n\nMy advice is:\n\n* The best trading comes from companies that slowly go up long term, but trade \"flat\" over the medium term with stable tops and bottoms.  Amazon and mastercard are good examples of this right now. It's a common mistake to think that companies have to constantly be going up to make money, when the opposite couldn't be truer. You also can't go wrong with swing trading safer companies with lower volatility, especially when you're new. Those are the companies you can safely hold if things go south.\n\n* Don't get married to a single stock. This is a rookie mistake. There's going to be plenty of moments where stocks just don't make sense to trade, typically when they're outside of a predictable trading range(such as breaking a support or resistance) or if it's just not at a good price within the trading range. Do not force trades that don't make sense because you think you need to trade constantly.\n\n* Following that, sometimes you just have to say fuck it and take a stock out of your watchlist because it's no longer favorable to trade within your strategies. I just did that with HD and FB after their insane runups since I now have no idea what they'll be trading within and speculating that is a complete waste of my time for now. The market is always changing and favorable companies can and will become unfavorable.\n\n* If you're trying to get 10% swings constantly you need to curb your expectations. 3-5% is much more reasonable and can be achieved faster as most stocks have +/- 1-3% volatility. Reliable profits always beat occasional large profits",

NAT SEC determines critical roles, infrastructure, and resources, whether language or minerals, in our home grown knowledge base. That means they may determine there are no native born US citizens who speak a certain language. Imagine our dependence on translators in any conflict environment. They may determine we are fucked on cobalt if we want to build batteries. Their job is not actually to staff current conflicts, but to actually project, as far as reasonable, future conflicts and anticipate the need and staff it. They also will wish to staff folks who sow seeds to *avert conflict* and or stage preparedness for future conflicts, in a manner that shifts said conflict in their favor. Interestingly enough, I am American woman, and I abide by rule of law while promoting it overseas, as a service,very cheaply. It is my honor. Why? They don't pay me enough to be loyal. I am loyal because it is my honor and the fabric of my being. They chose me because they know for a fact that I am loyal. Sure, I'm gonna eat street meat in Beijing, savor Crickets on a stick in Burma fed to me by unemployed physicists, feel tanks in my sternum in Moscow in 1990-1991, get Jack Ma heads up from folks to whom I provided VPNS in 2000 in the PRD, 12 hours before BABA tanks. But, ultimately, I have never ever been told what to tell people on the ground when they drop me in country. I am a free agent with (as you may have noticed) every liberty in my free speech. I was allowed to go places in 'transition,' to help or provide tech and humanitarian aide, and I was taught better facility in languages to do so... NOT because I work for the US Gov, but because they vetted me and knew our interests coincided. I wanted the same things they did. It is fairly random. I have signed many agreements, to secure my language training in the many languages I deploy. Those agreements say I will drop everything and serve, if we ever declare war, as a translator. As long as they use plenty of swear words while at war, we should be ok. ;D lol.. I would have have dropped everything, anyway, to serve, so those agreements never bothered me one bit. Why do I like Ginkgo? Because it is in the best interest of global citizens and the USA to form both a biosecurity protocol, and deploy this new tech. It is simultaneously in the best interest of the planet to harness this technology and to have a measured democratic access to the power and promise Syn Bio holds, while sharing, with bio/cyber/controls for the public good. Ginkgo will never weaponize it. I'm banking on that. In the ecosystem I have studied, Zy, not so much. Ginkgo, yes. They will not weaponize it. I invest accordingly with my own eyes wide open. I think Ginkgo is the way to go. I am not paid to do so, but I do enjoy the favor of tax payer dollars to have become a polyglot and represent this technology in multiple languages in places you would most likely never travel of your volition. I do so willingly and with no coercion. I think it will be a breakthrough the likes of the Marshall Plan, following on the Covid catastrophe. I would like to see American democratic values adapt and once again become the shining light on the hill we once were. This pisses people off who have not traveled as widely as me and seen the poverty and potential in the rest of the world when they met young STEM kids abroad. I have very different reasons for making the Ginkgo play than you. You are a quant, I am a qual.",

Mostly, I keep the balance by contributing to those which are underweight, not selling the overweight winners. I consider virtually all of these as hold forever stocks, but I do occasionally switch them up (if it's a good time to sell, e.g. I can do that without capital gains tax - selling at a loss or after a year of holding in my country).\n\nI reevaluate my portfolio pretty regularly, but my goal is to keep my stocks at \"set it and forget it\" as much as possible. However, if my thesis changes, I don't hesitate much to sell. TTD was one of my biggest winners, for example, but it's no longer in my portfolio. What made me sell in that specific case was mostly Apple's approach to privacy.\n\nI'm only 24, so I tilt towards tech and growth, but I try to keep some balance with stocks like JNJ, LMT, BAC, JPM, and within my ETFs.

Let's look at some examples:\n\n\\- So in this case, Didi's operation got suspended because \"Didi had illegally collected users' personal data.\"\n\n\\- Alibaba got fined because of monopolistic practices.\n\n\\- Ant Group's IPO got slashed because the CCP wanted to regulate Ant Group like an actual bank.\n\nTo be honest, these sound pretty reasonable to me. Facebook was in trouble for collecting data without content too. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal? But now everyone is hot for FB stocks.\n\nMicrosoft has been fined millions by the EU for monopolistic practices as well. But everyone loves Microsoft stocks nonetheless. \n\nAnd as to Ant Group, they are a massive financial service company that can offer customers credit. How come they don't get to be regulated like a bank? My point is that these actions make sense and good regulations is beneficial for investors too in the long run.",

It was the #1 company by marketcap in 2019 and march 2020.\n\nMoreover, It has never fallen out of the top 10 list for more than 20+ years even with failure of Ballmer, tech bubble crash, Nokia, etc. Now with the new ceo, I dont see it going out of the top 10 especially since it is so far ahead from #10 spot which is Alibaba at 600 billion market cap. (Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).\n\nBack in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.\n\nMicrosoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2012",

Tesla sells under 1% all vehicles worldwide but is somehow worth *more than all the other carmakers combined* because lots of people were buying Tesla stock and not because of any financial status of Tesla. dogecoin started LITERALLY as a joke but somehow was more valuable than companies like Ford Motors only because a ton of cash flowed into Dogecoin. this is all sheer insanity by traditional stock valuation guidelines. asset bubbles are nothing new, but Burry believes it's being exacerbated by passive investing. \n\n- Burry believes this situation of prices being based on cash flows is similar to what happened in the housing bubble, when multi-zillion Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) were being priced not by a reasonable estimate of their fair value but by cash-flows. \n\n- when flows reverse and lots of people want out of index funds, it will get ugly because so many stocks are linked/benchmarked to major stock indexes *including lower volume stocks*. consider VTI: the top holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson) might have a billion shares in total and hundreds of millions of dollars trading each day. but the smallest company stocks might have only a few million shares and a few million dollars trading each day. if too many people want to sell all at the same time, it will drive prices down sharply because these stocks are so often sold as a bundle/unit. as Burry puts it: \"The theater keeps getting more crowded, but the exit door is the same as it always was\"\n\n&gt;since the guy predicted 2007-2008 crash.\n\nhe also predicted the dot-com bubble.",

The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD. \n\nA plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and \"5G-cloudification\" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI &amp; tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM &amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China's Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.",

Likewise, if you had been selling RIOT/MARA puts the first 4 months of the year, you could've been making 10% a week. \n\nEverything in the market is perspective.
