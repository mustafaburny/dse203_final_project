        "body": "Lol, yes they vertically integrate so well. How is their cloud computing business going? You'd think with the amount of iCloud data, the size of the apple pay network, and all the other services they have that they'd build their own cloud based server network, right? Oh, funny - they still use google, azure and AWS for those services. They pay other companies millions and millions of dollars to use their cloud services. They wont vertically integrate within their key business, and you think they will integrate a global payments network? Note, they could buy a minority stake of visa with their cash reserves, and that's not including taxes for repatriation, currency float, etc. Be realistic here pal, removing a headphone Jack to sell more bluetooth product is nothing like the development work that would be necessary to compete in that industry.",
