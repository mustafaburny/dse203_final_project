        "body": "Possibly Very Bullish Sectors for the Next 3-12 Months Amid Troubled Times. The examples below are certainly not buy recommendations. Just examples.\n\nBelow is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\nAnyway enjoy the dips now because these are likely to get beefed up as the supply chain &amp; worker shortages unwind\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

I'm not a scientist, but I talked to many, and I'm impressed with the innovations and accomplishments the tiny team of Moderna achieved when there were literally hundreds of teams - most of them with way more people and capital - who could not produce the vaccine that Moderna did. MRNa technology does not stop here, so Covid vaccine is only the beginning for them, as opposed to a lonesome success.\n\nI also feel the urge to say what I do **NOT think is undervalued**: the absolutely and utterly ridiculous Tesla price. I used to be a Tesla bull. I said I bought shares here at 560 and people attacked me. I sold them in this crazy run and wouldn't touch them at these prices with a ten-foot pole. This is one of those moments like last January when Tesla was around 900, and it took a loooong time and a lot of uncertainty to see if it will ever be there again. Nah, thanks, I'm good. There might come a moment when the market becomes \"rational,\" and at that moment I do not want to hold Tesla bought at a thousand bucks.",

AMD is a ant company compare to Intel, Samsung and TSMC. On top of that China SMIC is growing like a weed. This is why Lisa Su is trying to close the deal with Xilinx. She knows they need them to survive. It is though to be in semiconductor business. PLTR on the other has a huge moat it is national security business with next to zero competitor. However, the big issues with PLTR is that it is not a new company and yet its grow is extremely slow. They need to get more commercial clients if they plan to grow.",

Similarly they'd have no problem selling more CPUs in the laptop/desktop market, chips for the PS5 or hugely in demand GPUs (even though nvidia still has an edge there). \n\nThey'll also buy Xilinx, which adds some nice synergies with the FPGAs. I feel like they most of all need to work on their software and GPUs, but they kind of already have the product range that nvidia would like to achieve by purchasing ARM (which so far doesn't seem to happen).",

By the time they are resolved, Intel will capitalize on laptop and server processors with Alder Lake using its own capacity.\n\n\\- Xilinx merger may get cockblocked or delayed by China, as well as force AMD to make costly concessions.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw a few astrological lines and prey.",

Early August there was a crazy AMD bull run that caused a big spread between the stock values and conversion ratio (as much as a 40% upside of holding Xilinx shares when AMD hit 120). Idk exactly what the catalyst was at that time, but I imagine the WSB hype added to the push (+good Q2). The stocks have been moving very similarly apart from that bull run. \n\nIts impossible to say how aware of the full picture the average retail investor is, but my guess is that they've barely heard of Xilinx whilst AMD is more of a household name. \n\nCheck out this link for ratio movement over time: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio",

AMD is a ant company compare to Intel, Samsung and TSMC. On top of that China SMIC is growing like a weed. This is why Lisa Su is trying to close the deal with Xilinx. She knows they need them to survive. It is though to be in semiconductor business. PLTR on the other has a huge moat it is national security business with next to zero competitor.

Starting Monday, I only have about 8 or 9 more market days for half this portfolio.\n\nThen I might be jumping 100 percent to cash. This of course will be a temporary move, but I'm expecting November and December to just be months that most stock enthusiasts would like to forget. So, it's going to take a lot of discipline for me to hold out for the real lows that I'm expecting (at least 25 percent of all-time highs).\n\nBasically, I think when I buy back in either in November or December, I will load the boat with XLNX shares over AMD shares, but who knows if the spread will be as big then?

Similarly they'd have no problem selling more CPUs in the laptop/desktop market, chips for the PS5 or hugely in demand GPUs (even though nvidia still has an edge there). \n\nThey'll also buy Xilinx, which adds some nice synergies with the FPGAs.

One of my favorite stocks going forward.\n\n(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",
