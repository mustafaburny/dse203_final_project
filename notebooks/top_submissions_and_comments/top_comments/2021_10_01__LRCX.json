BABA being a $150 stock today is also because of uncertainty. No one in Wallstreet knows if Xi will simply break up the company. Wallstreet  again could care less about politics, you call me naive yet you reference YouTube as a place where you think anti Chinese sentiment is driving the equities markets. Are you listening to yourself? Wallstreet doesn't care what some random Youtuber with 200 subs feels about China. It's all about earnings reports and going through them with a fine tooth comb. However when a good company like BABA is being attacked by a whole ass country, smart money gets out and waits to see what shoe will drop next. No amount of great earnings reports can combat Xi deciding to simply shut down BABA. As far as you not wanting Chinese stocks in Western markets, be careful what you wish for, the only reason BABA's market cap is what it is today is because of Western money. If all Chinese stocks get delisted, they lose 95% of their value instantly. China alone will not be able to keep BABA's MC $500 bil+",

They've also got a great software team (I'm personally hoping they let some of those guys rub off on AMDs GPU driver team...).  It'll be a great acquisition from that perspective.  From the perspective of investors, on the day the merger completes, every share of XLNX stock will turn into 1.72 shares of AMD.  But XLNX shares only cost as much as about 1.5 shares of AMD... and that price gap has been maintained ever since the 1.72 ratio was announced by hedge funds actively manipulating the market.

I see October 20th or 21st as the last chances to exit before everybody starts to get really nervous about November 2nd. Starting Monday, I only have about 8 or 9 more market days for half this portfolio.\n\nThen I might be jumping 100 percent to cash. This of course will be a temporary move, but I'm expecting November and December to just be months that most stock enthusiasts would like to forget. So, it's going to take a lot of discipline for me to hold out for the real lows that I'm expecting (at least 25 percent of all-time highs).\n\nBasically, I think when I buy back in either in November or December, I will load the boat with XLNX shares over AMD shares, but who knows if the spread will be as big then?

Since they actually don't manufacture their chips and instead rely on TSMC for doing so, they are actually limited by the shortage. \n\nThey have the better product compared to Intel especially in the hugely important server market. They are gaining market share, but the lack of supply actually saves their rival at the moment. Similarly they'd have no problem selling more CPUs in the laptop/desktop market, chips for the PS5 or hugely in demand GPUs (even though nvidia still has an edge there). \n\nThey'll also buy Xilinx, which adds some nice synergies with the FPGAs. I feel like they most of all need to work on their software and GPUs, but they kind of already have the product range that nvidia would like to achieve by purchasing ARM (which so far doesn't seem to happen).",

I've traded the stock back and forth since February, and I can tell you that the stock was mostly not doing much of anything for long stretches, and then it finally had a big breakout, that pushed it above $100. This happened in this most recent 6 month period, so it seems like AMD is this outstanding performer in the most recent 6 months, but for 4 of those months, it didn't do much of anything.\n\nI still love AMD by the way. One of my favorite stocks going forward.\n\n(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",

        "body": "I reckon there'll be some sell pressure initally, yea. Xilinx haven't paid dividends since the merger was announced, so they'll bring a decent chunk of cash. Current market cap for Xilinx and AMD is 39B + 128B. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't their combined total value push more funds to pick them up? Scaled up production and synergy effects should so some work as well.\n\nI'm really not sure how the market will react, so it's just a wild guess from my side. Only been following AMD/Xilinx since the merger announcement",
