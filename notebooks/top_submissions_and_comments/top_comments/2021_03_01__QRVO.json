Otherwise, with a 2-year time horizon, you don't time the market, you just get in and hold. I changed all my shares for leaps on Monday afternoon, so my timing worked out nicely. One of them is NXPI, which just got added to the S&amp;P since then. Lots of luck involved, but at the same time, when I bought the leaps, the premiums were ~25% of the share price, meaning I needed large and growing chipmakers to grow by 25% in 22 months to cover my premium. With the right timing (a gamble-y qualifier), that can be a serious no-brainer. \n\nNXPI: 20 Jan 2023 170c at 42.40 premium, and it hit 195 in AH following the S&amp;P announcement. \n\nMRVL: 20 Jan 2023 40c at 10.47 premium, and it's already back up over 47. \n\nSimilar, but not quite as awesome numbers for AMD, QRVO, SOXX, SWKS. My timing was good/lucky, but using the \"be greedy when others are fearful\" approach, with Monday's bloodbath following an already-brutal two weeks for tech, converting shares to leaps felt like the way to go, and it's going to pay off much more handsomely than had I just held.",
