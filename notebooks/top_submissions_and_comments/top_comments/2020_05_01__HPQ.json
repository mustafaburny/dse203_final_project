        "body": "Thinking EPS is that much more significant than forward looking. Rookie mistake. Hitting expected EPS is a good starting point for adjusting forward looking statements for analysts, but earnings can be windfalls, seasonal, etc. This is the same story with HPQ. Business shot up thanks to covid but it's looking a little dry going forward. \n\nYou should have known that the price target would drop significantly after EVERY \"covid economy\" success story has either been slowly dropping over the last few weeks or stayed totally flat while industrials, B&amp;M retailers, and service companies have skyrocketed.\n\nPeloton anyone? That was about to hit $50. Look at it now. Logitech, ZM, Chegg have stayed almost totally flat  since Jpow's \"we digitally print money\" miracle.",
