If a company like ADP has increased its dividend every year for 47 years, it shows they're committed to it as it opens them up to a sizable group of dividend investors. As a result the dividend is a priority and not just some added bonus for shareholders. \n\nI'd say share repurchases are the preferred way of spending extra capital as companies pretty much do it whenever they want but aren't expected to, like dividends.",

Microsoft on the other hand, missed several technology transitions and came back last decade. While yes, they participated in the SaaS transition, that was one of many strategic changes Satya Nadella enacted when he took the helm.\n\nI see the SaaS transition as secular rather than company-specific driver. From my perspective, Adobe's primary competitive threat was piracy, but that was an industry-wide phenomenon (particularly in software and music) and not unique to the company. I'd say both of these industries as a whole came back due to the SaaS transition. You could literally pick any leading software company in 2013-2016 and watch as they reclaimed profits from piracy during this transition. Some that are transitioning later, like Autodesk, are going through that now. You could also argue that Universal, Warner, and Sony regained their competitive advantage, but it is actually Apple (via Apple Music) that participated in the SaaS transition (Spotify was SaaS only).",

Aside from the usual bug schedule (which cisco is no better/worse than anyone else) their hardware is rocksolid, it really comes down to the software for the API on the devices, or the software of tools to manage it.\n\nCisco is only a leader in the market when you look at the entire breadth of their portfolio because: No one else is spread as thin.

Furthermore, if you expect the price to go down further you would be good to buy a put contract on Cisco. \n\nIf you want to hang on to your shares of Cisco because you expect them to go up, but want \"insurance\" against that, you could also buy a put contract in case the price goes down.",

Cisco has slowly gone up.\n\n\nLets say your required holding period is 1 year. That means if you hold the stock for 1 year and the stock doesn\u2019t budge in price. If you sell you gain the 15% in the discount plus 4% from the dividend you gained as well. Historically, the stock has gone up as well, which also increase your gains.\n\nSo, continue to buy your company stock.\n\n\nNow there is some people I bet at your work, just like mine, that have bought their company stock for 20+ years and never sold. Doing this increasing your exposure to that one company. If the company tanks, your stock will be worth a lot less and you could be out of a job.\n\n\nHowever, if you go with selling right after your lock out period it\u2019s a great way to use that discount to generate more money for you. \n\n\nRelax investing is a marathon not a sprint.",

If, for example, you attempt an elementary level of stock analysis and summarize your thought process, while asking for feedback, that would be more appropriate. Simply stating \"should I buy X, I have Y money\" is somewhat lazy. Also, presenting questions in this fashion does not foster discussion in any meaningful way. \n\nTo answer your question:\n\n1. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon (Established Tech)\n2. Ecolab, Honeywell, 3M, Corning, Cisco (Blue chip)\n3. ETFs (i.e., VOO or VTI) \n\nStart here. See if you agree after researching.

The issue is a supply shock: Apple is going to produce less, Cisco is going to have trouble obtaining their parts, Twitter's advertisers are going to experience similar shocks and buy fewer advertisements, and PG is going to have trouble sourcing the inputs for its laundry detergent.",
