        "body": "$BROS is a great price right now could come down further in the very short term but they're a great company who could easily take over Starbucks in the next ten years. At the current rate of growth they're already projected to do so and it's recession resistant. It's also not over exposed like all of these other sectors. It's going to be an amazing long term hold and possibly some good short term games if the market turns around. Options are meh but still probably viable tendie material. \n\n$CDAY. I won't go into this like I did $BROS but they make a program/app that takes care of a lot of HR responsibilities such as payroll, scheduling, announcements etc. Basically all of the on paper and email related tasks. Super smooth system that I can see changing the way the workforce looks in the future. \n\nThe best thing is you can choose to get paid directly through them. Cutting out the need for a bank in a lot of aspects. They allow you to use your money as you get it rather than wait for payday. \n\nLook into the financials yourself. They're not very well known right now so the volume is low and volatility is kinda high. But they're quite under valued and that volatility could make for some good option plays. Long term hold as well if you think they'll be crazy popular like I do.",
