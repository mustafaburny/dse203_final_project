        "body": "My mom looks at her account, and she thinks she has $200K to spend.\n\nShe is CONfident that the balance shown reflects actual currency, even though what she owns is microscopic parts of various companies. She has no idea which, no idea what they do, no idea who is earning real, actual, money off this scam.\n\nOn some levels she grasps that she owns parts of companies, and she assures herself that owning a lot of different stocks protect against wild swings, and instead provide one long, steady 5-10% increase in the number she sees on her screen.\n\nI can explain to her, that there is no safety in diversification if everyone is doing it, and thus the sausage factory is highly correlated with the microchip fab and the company that makes plastic dogshit. I can explain to her that the forward P/E ratio is now (once again) at a record high, so \"buying the dip\" may be a bad move.\n\nShe pays zero attention to it.\n\nAnd it was the right move. Her balance shows $230K now, and in her world she has \"made money\". Never mind that she actually owns the EXACT same basket of companies as before, only these companies are now - in many cases - totally fucked. Loaded to the hilt in debt - debt they accrued before the dip, and debt they have taken on now.\n\nHer, and millions of others, are highly conditioned to believe that a) diversification is magic, and b) if it isn't \"they\" will help us. And this has been proven over and over again.\n\nThe problem is this. Because they have no fucking clue, if that $230K becomes $200K again, and then $180K, and then $160K they WILL pull the trigger. The ONLY reason they have to stay long is that stocks go up.\n\nIf you're 70, and the stock portfolio is falling, you are literally watching your life-quality erode. You have no way of improving the situation, and once the panic spreads I don't think the Federales will be able to stem the tsunami of selling.\n\nMost of these people would prefer seeing 5-10% increase every year, while having the cost of living rise at 10-15%. Than to see 0% increase and having c-o-l stay low.\n\nSo, yeah, it's a con.\n\nBut, never forget, con can run for much longer than you expect. People can act very irrational for a very, very long time. You may never see a return to \"rational\" in your lifetime.",

The ISS will likely be printing it's own hardware with this in time. NNDM already tests their other equipment on board.\n\nThe licensing potential revenue of the IP is the golden goose here.

And thus subject to rules agreed on by the public.\n\nYeah but if I have a business with a storefront. That's my private property and I can do what I want with it. \n\nIf the government wants to shut down court rooms and the DMV, whatever I don't care but the issue is they're telling me I cannot open my hypothetical business which is how I afford to live but they won't do anything about mortgage regulations or banks and credit card companies. The people that are protesting have bills to pay, children to feed, and monetary obligations that aren't going away just because of the Coof. \n\nThe fed reserve printed $3 trillion dollars in a day and Americans got a check for $1200? You realize how fucking stupid that is right? Like do you understand the sheer magnitude of stupidity that it is to print $3 trillion dollars to bail out businesses that don't need the money while the middle class suffers and will eventually have to foot the bill for that when it comes due in a generation or 5?\n\n&gt;restrictive measures against you should be lifted.\n\nThey won't be lifted. \n\nThis is the critical thing that people of your mindset do not seem to understand. Once a government is granted a power, it never rescinds that power back to the people. It literally has never once happened in history. That's why people are pissed, that's why people are protesting and that's why you have armed protesters standing outside of the governor's office. \n\nTemporary restrictions means permanent changes to how the government is allowed to control the population. \n\nWhat's going to happen the next time we have a new and exciting disease? Are we going to have to get mandatory vaccinations that may or may not work? Am I going to have to get a microchip with my ID and medical records so I can get into public buildings? Where does the \"interest of public safety\" stop? The short answer is that it doesn't. \n\nAll I'm going to leave you with is this. Just stop pretending to care about the health and safety of the general population. You probably just got on that train 20 minutes ago and you're going to go right back to not caring as soon as the talking heads tell you it's cool to do so.",

Not sure if that was for some period of time but if not then the entire board can now be held liable for his tweet\n\n2) the turnover of the board is extremely high and they are uninsured so all of the newbies are likely personally liable for his tweets as well\n\n3) no way there won't be some class action or individual lawsuits\n\n4) last time he lost his chairmanship. This time I think he loses his CEO position as well\n\nHe screwed up BIG!",

From technicals I think the market will hover between the latest high or SP $3000 and SP $2500 until some significant news come (vaccine or new major outbreak/longer quarantine). There is no reason for equities to go back to ATH anytime soon because results won't be there and the risk premium just got a lot higher. There is no reason to discount the whole market by more than a third from ATH because rates are lower than ever and even a full year of lost income wouldn't reduce the value of a decent company by 35-40%, especially not with gvts throwing money at companies to keep people on payrolls and already bailing out whole sectors. IMO the markets values of the past 4 weeks make a lot of sense when you keep in mind previous highs, the effect of super low interest rates on valuation and the difficulty to forecast anything right now. We're in limbo, but volatility will make it a messy limbo.\n\nThis is not a bull market, it's not a bear market. This is a new animal, this is a beaver maket.",

Apple and Nvidia seems to be slowing down now waiting for competitors to catch up but they were going ham on generational improvements. We will soon see what Nvidia has up their sleeve with Ampere as AMD starts catching up on the GPU front as well. AMD single handily put a fire in both the CPU and GPU industries previously dominated by Intel and Nvidia, and now they are starting to haul ass. I wouldn\u2019t count out Intel yet because yesterday\u2019s announcement was the first competitive move that Intel has done in a long time. Yes it lowers their margins, but this move to drastically lower price and enable previously locked features like hyper-thread on their lower end chips will definitely help to take back some of the market share from AMD.

This is GOOD NEWS because they're selling through old inventory at a premium rather than a discount before the new consoles come out.\n\nThey have more than enough liquidity to buy back debt below par and/or refinance. They're obviously controlling operating expenses and cutting costs, so I'm not expecting operating losses to be significant. Additionally, I'm sure they qualify for gov't covid-19 support if needed.\n\nPeople are shorting this stock betting on bankruptcy that isn't happening for years down the road until optical drives are obselete. The short's timing is wrong, so that means their short positions are wrong and they'll be forced to cover in the short/medium term. Gamestop still has much flexibility in time and balance sheet to innovate, especially with the new executives on board. \n\nWhich makes more sense - short YEARS early paying ridiculous borrowing costs (some 200%), or short years later after the new cycle boom when there's evidence Gamestop isn't succesfully pivoting?",

Out of curiosity, what do you think the average profit margin in The US is?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; The average person has basically no savings or investments, so the average person is benefiting less and less from economic growth now compared to previously \n\nNo. Even with no savings (which, btw, are exactly equivalent to investments) economic growth benefits everyone. This is why the least expensive car in 1980 was sold for around $16,000 in today's USD while the least expensive car today goes for $14,000 and has airbags, backup cameras, bluetooth conectivity, wifi connectivity, and other features that didn't even exist in 1980. Even if wages had stagnated for 40 years you would still be able to buy much better things for the same amount of money.\n\nAssume no inflation:\n\nIf your wages and my wages are both $10/year and you sell me your house for $10 we have GDP of $30 and wages of $20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext year I sell you back the house for $10 which you then sell back to me for $10 and then we repeat this 4 more times. Our wages haven't changed relative to inflation so now we have wages of $20 + sales of $100 for a GDP of $120.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur wages are now a much smaller share of GDP, but we are no worse off than last year. We could very easily increase our wages as a % of GDP simply by not trading the house back and forth.",
