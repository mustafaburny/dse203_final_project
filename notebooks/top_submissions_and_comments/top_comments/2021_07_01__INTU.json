        "body": "I debated this as well. Here are my thoughts...\n\nSoFi is banking on gaining lifetime customers (members) through two concepts. The all-inclusive business model, as well as the feel-good \"we're here to help you\" model. Leading corporations have proven the all-inclusive model works well, and is always preferred by customers over the pick-and-choose products from different companies. Consolidation is key.\n\nThe feel-good model gains that customer loyalty, and entices customers to stick with SoFi when in the market for other services/products even if the price or rate is slightly higher. SoFi gives perks for using as many of their services as possible, and they have just about every single fin product you can think of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look at them as a bank, insurance company, broker, advisor, and data company all wrapped in one. They operate as a bank but without the overhead of an institutional bank with physical locations. They provide insurance products, without acting as a scummy insurance company and I think most people hate dealing with insurance companies. They are a broker and provide all the benefits of other brokers, just shy of offering options (soon) and other advanced trading services. They have great money management services, advisors, and give the sense that they really do want to help people be more knowledgable and become financially independent. Lastly, they are utilizing tech to improve all of their current services, mobile app, etc. and are improving their revenue/margins with their technology acquisitions. Currently owning Galileo that powers some of their competitors like robinhood, as well as acquiring part of Apex Clearing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, SoFi doesn't bring anything industry-changing to the table just yet, but is proving to wedge it's way into many financial industries that have had the same players for years. It's also proven to grow it's customer base significantly with the above models, and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nLastly, I would say their strongest aspect by far is their upper management team. Anthony Noto CEO, coming from Goldman Sachs as lead underwriter for the Twitter IPO, CFO of Twitter, as well as CFO of the NFL. The rest of the team comes from roles in Uber, Amazon, Citi, Intuit, GS, Zynga, Toyota etc. I would check out their investor presentation for more info on this team.\n\nCurrent valuation is $14.2 billion, and a 14.5x CURRENT year revenue multiple",
