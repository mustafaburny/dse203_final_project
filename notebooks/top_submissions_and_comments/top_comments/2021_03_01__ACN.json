        "body": "Alright smoothbrain, here's some math so you realize how ridiculous what you're suggesting is. Try and keep up.\n\nIf SPY drops 20%, then a 40% overlap between the two means QQQ drops (0.4 * 0.2) = 8%.\nIn order to make up the remaining 33.4% - 8% = 25.4% drop, the remaining 60% of QQQ must drop by (0.254/0.6) = 42.3%. \n\nTo suggest that the remaining stocks will drop at a rate more than *double* that of the other stocks in both SPY and QQQ is ridiculous from the get go, but it's even more absurd when you consider the following:\n\n1. Although QQQ is tech-heavy, it is not *only* tech, there is a sizeable chunk of consumer cyclical and healthcare stocks, some of which are not in the S&amp;P500 and provide QQQ with sector-diversification. A crash in tech alone would not be enough to reach the -33.4% mark.\n\n2. There are *many* tech companies that are part of the S&amp;P500 but not listed on the NASDAQ: Salesforce ($CRM), Visa ($V), Mastercard ($MA), Accenture ($ACN), IBM ($IBM), etc. The situation that you are describing would affect these companies just as much as those listed on the NASDAQ. \n\nIn what conceivable scenario do **all** QQQ stocks drop, *across* sectors, but somehow the SPY stocks in those same industries remain relatively untouched such that the QQQ stocks not part of the S&amp;P500 drop more than **double** that of their counterparts? Please enlighten me.  \n\nIf you're getting so hung up on the circuit breakers, just go with $UPRO, but either way the scenario you concocted in your head is just not realistic by any means. The 20% circuit breaker will go before we hit -33.4% on QQQ.",

Besides that, Microsoft and Ansys are closely following the project.   \n\n\nSource: (you probably need to translate it through Google, but you can simply ctrl+f the above names)\n\n[https://www.ed.nl/eindhoven/tu-e-onderzoek-biedt-sportscholen-hoop-apparaten-verwijderen-aerosolen-uit-lucht\\~a0ea76e3/](https://www.ed.nl/eindhoven/tu-e-onderzoek-biedt-sportscholen-hoop-apparaten-verwijderen-aerosolen-uit-lucht~a0ea76e3/)  \n\n\nAs for sales, it's not for sale yet. People have been researching and developing this technology recently. The biggest issue is that purifiers are extremely costly and can cause more harm than good if they arent installed properly. They want to spend a lot of money on marketing to properly educate people how and where to install it, so I doubt its going to cost 45k$, probably more towards 50-60k$, but that is still a massive difference.\n\nAs for how it will end up performing on the stock market, I doubt the stock will keep rising, but I am fairly certain that it will at the very least spike once it is proven to have any positive results on covid, let alone that a lot of aging purifiers can be replaced with higher end hardware for the same cost.  \n\n\nAs for which ticker belongs to the company providing the new technology, I have no clue exactly, but according to other comments, there is vyst(for cheap play), LLC, trox, carr, jci(carr and jci might already be too late to invest), xiaomi, haier and midea(last three for china market). Not to forget the prototype companies Phillips, Trotec and Plasmamade ofcourse.",

Option prices were dirt cheap yesterday, and still pretty cheap compared to GME. This is about making money, period. Be smart.",

So, we could assume the same was happening with other brokers. At the same time, I know that at least TDA isn't allowing short selling of GME at all (was on the phone with them the other day, and the guy told me they haven't allowed it since the end of January).\n\nStill, the price has not only held, but risen pretty significantly today. I'm having a hard time seeing the downside to continuing to hold, I just don't think it's a wise thing to sell at this point. The gamma squeeze seems like it'll happen, the short squeeze is likely too. And even if it's not, the company is pivoting and may become a big player in the years to come. All those things are why I will keep holding.\n\nAt the same time, if you haven't covered your initial investment, please do so. I sold off enough at the end of January to pay off almost $50k of CC debt and to have a bit leftover to provide for me and my kids. Now I'm playing with house money, so it's easier for me to weather the dips.\n\nI'm holding 307 shares @ \\~$70 per share. I also have a 17 calls for different dates.",

You should do your own research, read the DD, and make informed decisions. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.\n\nIn other words, fuck safely, or you'll get fucked.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060There is no \"we.\"\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I'm holding because that's my choice. I believe in GME\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I will not buy because someone else says to do so\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I will not encourage others to buy\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Nothing I say is financial advice\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060If you're confused, read the rules. No market manipulation.\n\nReport posts that encourage everyone to buy at the same time. The primary reason for this is legal, but the secondary is that the media will cherry-pick comments like this to give us a bad name and put more negativity out there through their articles, broadcasts, etc.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060There will be plenty of FUD (or \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\")\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I am including this out of belief, if not pure spite\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060There are redditors being paid to scare you\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060There are bots made to SPAM negativity\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060There are people profiting when you sell\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060This starts ramping up in the afternoon\n\nThere are two sides to this fight, and we have to remember that there are people profiting if we fail. There are people playing the other side who will come into the thread and try to throw us off track by ruining the morale. We mustn't give in to them. Besides, they can't even provide any good DD for their bear-case, it's all just \"sElL iT's OvEr.\"\n\n\u2022\t\u2060This is the motherfucking GME Megathread\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Do not push other tickers\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Do not jingle keys in our faces\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Fuck you\n\nI, personally, go out of my way to CTRL/CMD+F and search for other tickers. If you're bringing up non-GME stocks in order to distract the thread, I'm one of the downvotes on your comment. Sue me.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060We can fucking do this\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060We have them where we want them\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060We can name our price\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060As long as we hold, we have what they want\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060They will pay out the ass to get it\n\nThey'll do whatever they can (manipulate the market, short the stock further, short EFTs, etc.) for as long as they can manage, all hoping we'll give up and sell (Hell, they've even tried to bore us to death). But they don't understand just how dumb we really are. We are far too stupid to be afraid of their fearmongering, and we'll hold 'til the moon.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060If you're new, this may not be for you\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060This is something you have to be really brave or really stupid for\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060You will either see enormous gains or enormous losses\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Invest wisely, don't spend your rent money, and read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060DD is short for Due Diligence, and it's basically just researching a stock before you buy in. There's plenty of great DD on this sub, and you can sort by the DD flair to see the highest-voted posts. Do that before asking dumb questions and risking your karma.\n\nIf you think there's anything else I should add, please reply and tell me.",

The best time to buy GME was 2 months ago, the second best time is NOW.\n3. Buy shares, not options. Invest only the money you can afford to lose.\n4. Don't fall for FUD. Any account can be a shill/bot, even the ones created before January. They are PAYING users to spread fear and enroll you to post negative comments/posts.\n5. GME has been and will always be the only play. Anything else is a distraction to limit the impact GME can have. (Yes, even RKT). Never will the planets align this perfectly again to trigger the biggest short squeeze of your lifetime.\n6. The most important point : Don't sell. Supply and demand : you have something they want, we all do. So YOU set the price you want. And the price can actually go up to infinity. This is going to be the biggest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen, don't ruin it being a paper hand and selling low.\n7. Hold. Hold. Hold. Selling at 1k is trolling. They want you to sell at 1k, that's why they keep spamming comments saying they put stop limits at 1k. 1k is lowball. 1k could just be a gamma squeeze. 10k is lowball.\n8. As stated by u/Polihanna, the squeeze will last multiple days. Don't be afraid that it lasts a few seconds and you'll miss it. You won't. \n9. Don't day-trade GME. It's extremely volatile, and you actually help them by selling shares that they can buy for cheap. You delay the squeeze and reduce its impact if you day-trade.\n10. THIS IS NOT A GAME OF GREED. IT IS A GAME OF TRUST.",
