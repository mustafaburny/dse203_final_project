Even if you believe the TSLA story, that'd take 20 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\netc. etc. etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course valuation matters. A good company doesn't mean it's a good stock to buy.  When buying a stock, you're buying a piece of the business. You need to expect a reasonable return on this purchase. If I were to offer you amazon stock for $1,000,000/share, would that make sense? Would the valuation not matter because it's a good company that has expected growth? How about $10,000,000/share? $100,000,000? Of course that's ludicrous. The valuation always matters. There is a point there, well before $1M/share where it becomes ridiculous to buy into AMZN, regardless of how \"good\" you think the company is. To say valuation does not matter is complete and utter nonsense.",

        "body": "The comparisons to the dotcom bubble are absolutely maddening to me. A couple additional points below:\n1) To add onto your first point, the Nasdaq also jumped from like 1,400 to a peak of 5,050 in less than 2 years, while the Nasdaq is only up ~31% between February and 12/31/20. \n\n2) My central point of frustration is these articles, tweets, posts, etc all make it seem like the dotcom bubble burst over night, just like magic, poof 90% of the Nasdaq wiped out overnight. In reality, the crash took over a year to play out and there were plenty of opportunities to sell your positions. For example: Cisco peaked in March 2000, then decreased by about $10 per share on a monthly basis until April 2001. Even if you won 1st place in the bagholding competition, how long did you decide to hold the bag? \n\n3a) although there is certainly a lot of speculation going on now, the dotcom bubble was all speculation. Even Wall Street was buying up shit companies because tech was new and few people understood it. Everyone wanted a piece of tech but tech wasn\u2019t ingrained into our daily lives as it is now. The Covid Crash proved that tech is essential to not only our daily lives but critical to the global economy. Over the next decade, tech will become bigger, stronger and faster but that can\u2019t be said about other sectors who were adversely affected by the crash. \n\n3b) personally, I think we (the global economy) are at the dawn of the next tech revolution (industrial revolution 4.0). By 2030, technology will be so far ahead of where we stand today that the tech of our childhoods will be almost unrecognizable (if you have small children, now might be a good time to do a 10 or 20 year time capsule with them). 5G will pave the way for autonomous driving, robotic surgeries, AI and automation. Renewable energy is declining significantly in price where we will reach a point that it becomes widely adopted. First, the government will push forward green energy initiatives garnering business interest &amp; adoption which will result in the wide spread adoption by the general public. By 2030, you will be \u2018shunned\u2019 by society for not being \u2018green\u2019, \n\n4) there will be bubble stocks that pop, but I think this will be compartmentalized and the blows will not drag down the entire market. Moving forward, it is critical that you are investing in great companies and industry leaders. Do you due diligence. Have a plan in place. Dont invest in a company because everyone else is doing such (I.e. no FOMO trades). Determine where the \u2018smart\u2019 money moved / is moving \n\n5) Tesla is one that will always be an internal struggle for me. Based on their historical performance, they are extremely overvalued but if Elon\u2019s plan comes to fruition they might be substantially undervalued. Even though they have experienced some delays, Elon has executed his long range vision almost to a T. 1) build luxury long-range EV to garner interest while earning higher margins due to limited production capacity, 2) use cash flows from luxury model to create mid-tier model to increase awareness, 3) after enough factories have been built, use cash flows from 1 &amp; 2 to create economy class EV. 4) as technology improves over time, begin building robo-taxis, which will eventually change the way we travel from A to B forever, 5) use profits and future capital calls to expand business and revenue streams: solar panels, insurance, battery production, battery storage, semi-trucks and software licensing. \n-he\u2019s nailed point #1, #2 and part of #5, point #3 sounds like it\u2019s in the near future \n-from my view, Elon was never about selling the most cars. Elon sells cars only to bridge the gap until technology caught up to his vision of a world where autonomous vehicles reign supreme. At some point in time, it will become more cost effective to use a robo-taxi than to buy your own car. This is what Elon aims to capitalize on, he isn\u2019t concerned about everyone buying his car as he wants his cars to take you everywhere. \n-the biggest issue I have with comparing Tesla to the likes of Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota is that these companies often sell their cars at a loss or break even point because they make their profits from repairs, maintenance and selling OEM parts which is why they were so resistant to EVs as they require far less than maintenance than ICE vehicles.",

I remember Cisco as it was one of the buys I made with my meager funds as a 20 year old. So I basically bought this wonderful company Cisco for an insane valuation probably about 50 times warnings which translated into ludicrously high growth thst was simply not possible.\n\nThere were so many examples of this even non tech companies like coca cola I recall there was a book I read which noted its valuation in 2000 would mean that they'd need several Americans to start taking baths with coca cola.\n\nI'm glad I learned these lessons early in my life as now I might miss out on things like tesla and Shopify mania but I can still scoop up solid companies at good valuations.\n\nMy example to a young guy like you would be the following - there is a massive difference in a buying a great company like Apple at 20x earnings vs 40x earnings. It's not a great investment at any price.\n\nImo tesla Shopify investors will learn the hard way. No way on earth is Shopify a better business than td or rbc yet its got a larger market cap than banks which make money hand over fist and are the backbone of any nations economy.\n\nValuation is the key as we can't predict how and when the bubble will burst (yes we are in one) hope that helps.",

(I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",
