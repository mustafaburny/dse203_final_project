If you have, chances are they operate on a conglomeration of programs that have accumulated over the years that all don\u2019t talk to each other. Decision making at these companies takes longer and is inefficient because they have to pull data from multiple systems and sometimes the data you get is unreliable because the programs are old af. \n\nMy old job and my current job are both at Fortune 500 companies and both operate on a Frankenstein system of multiple programs for CRM. Both companies constantly talk about overhauling the system but it never gets done because of the legacy spaghetti code involved. You change/upgrade one program and then it becomes incompatible to the rest and you need to upgrade everything. Upgrading would mean overhauling everything at the same time which is a MASSIVE project. \n\nPLTR is coming in with one propriety program/OS that\u2019s plug and play. Get rid of your old Frankenstein CRM that\u2019s 50 different programs and replace it with Gotham. Now the entire system and database talks to each other and you can get real data in real time.",

CRM, SNOW, Microsoft and Amazon would technically be competitors but with different twists.\n\nAMD is also positioned in a cyclical environment , which I hate. Cyclicality + not knowing how things are going to turn out for them long term make it a no go for me.\n\nIn the near term ( maybe 5 years ) Id say AMD is a no brainer buy, but the cyclicality of it makes it so It cant be a core holding for me. IF I had to invest in the sector, I'd go with something like ASML or ASYS. A supplier to the cyclicals. A pick and shovel play if you will.\n\nPLTR also benefits from the government contracts. Some people have said that its both its strength and its weakness, but Id argue that it provides no exposure to weakness what so ever.\n\nThe fact that PLTR has been the government's T1 data analytics and AI supplier for over a decade means they are sitting on technology light years ahead of the private sector. When and how they will be able to execute said technology is an unknown.\n\nPLTR has a lot of unknowns, as you stated, and this is a big reason why institutions shy away from the company. We will never be able to get a full peak behind the curtain, but I argue that this is PLTR's strength. Its relationship with government ensures its longevity.\n\nPLTR is just starting its foray into the private/commercial sector.\n\nIf a company is good enough to protect American lives and Uncle Sam's interest's , it projects a level of security , trustworthiness and safety  that they will be able to leverage in the private sector.\n\nLastly, considering AMD exists in the hardware ecosystem, growth will always be dependent on externalities such as supply chain issues ( currently on full display ) and commodity availability etc.\n\nPLTR doesnt require external inputs to sell their products. So exponential growth can be achieved with much less resistance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, thats my pitch. PLTR is my second biggest holding. Its also the one that lets me get the best sleep at night. I truly never worry about it. Max drawdown I figure is about 50% but with everything it has going for it, even in an economic recession, I see it as unlikely.\n\nOnce their SPAC deals and investments start bearing fruit, you're going to see institutions begin to FOMO into the company. At that point government contracts will be nothing but a distant memory.",

Cisco. Oracle. \n\nWhat operating systems do majority of servers run? It's not windows, or iOS, or android. It's Linux. And the best one is redhat. It can run on and interface with any of the cloud providers securely. It's a platform to switch between any cloud provider easier than conforming to each cloud setup separately. \n\nWhat company makes the best server to process transactions for credit cards, banks, large retailers and service companies? Ibm, their processors are purpose built. Some like banks, hospitals, insurers are require by law to run their own data transaction systems. Their 7nm power 10 / telum processors can handle more work load any one else. Amd and Intel chip followers take note of ibm's CPU architecture. Specifically their cash system that result in much lower latency and cash pools in the size of gigabytes, also shared memory pools in terabytes. \n\nThey came up with the 2nm and lower transistor process for chips. They led in creating a programming language for quantum computing. They set a world record in data storage solution with their 580 terabyte tape units. Not worth listing all the little things they do. \n\nTheir new CEO is outspoken about collaboration and getting ibm out from being a siloed company. I am sure they will find the right partners for their tech. He switched the company over to Salesforce and slack and such. Deepens partnerships with companies like SAP and others. Increasing consulting business. IBM was also early in jumping in and providing lots of online open courses with100s of thousands taking part across the world. \n\nIBMs role might be niche and you might not understand them. But, it doesn't mean they are not relevant globally. $75B in revenues.",

I own SCHB, SCHA, and DGRO and will never sell.\n\nI also own one \"never sell\" stock (AAPL) and there are certainly more examples of those types of companies.  Buy and only buy.  \n\nBut for more \"trades\" or stocks you're uncertain about or concerned about locking in profit?  It can be very tough to know when to sell.  Sucks to watch a 20% gain shrink back to zero or negative, but oftentimes that's necessary to enjoy those big gaps up (would have made me a millionaire with ATVI &amp; AMAT). Also happened to me recently with CRM.  Up nice amount, pulled way back, then rocketed back up.  Still holding.\n\nAt the end of the day it's best to just focus on Index funds and leave a small % (5, 10, maybe 20) to play around.  So no matter what happens with your higher potential, more volatile portion, you always have that \"never have to worry\" 80+% to let you sleep at night and keep you continually invested.",

The truly best cybersecurity companies aren't public, let me make that clear. The best companies in this industry that I wish I could invest in are private. Crowdstrike doesn't even have the best products in its own industry; I know at least a dozen people who work there and their sales staff is straight out Wolf of Wall Street. Churning through sales reps left and right doesn't give me confidence that they'll continue to hit their revenue goals, and that's on top of that fact that they don't have the best security software in the space. So many people in this sub get their dicks hard from CRWD, but I just don't see it, and I'm an insider. The only way I can see them being a top dog is if they continue to acquire the hottest new technologies. That's what Microsoft did, that's what Salesforce did, that's what all the great and large companies do. I remember when everyone was crazy about FireEye back in like 2015 or so, that this was going to be the top security stock to own. Palo Alto Networks was another one, because their Traps software was supposed to be next big thing in endpoint security. Crowdstrike has had its day in the sun, but I've yet to see technology from them that is better than the likes of BitDefender, Malwarebytes, and others.",
