If you have, chances are they operate on a conglomeration of programs that have accumulated over the years that all don\u2019t talk to each other. Decision making at these companies takes longer and is inefficient because they have to pull data from multiple systems and sometimes the data you get is unreliable because the programs are old af. \n\nMy old job and my current job are both at Fortune 500 companies and both operate on a Frankenstein system of multiple programs for CRM. Both companies constantly talk about overhauling the system but it never gets done because of the legacy spaghetti code involved. You change/upgrade one program and then it becomes incompatible to the rest and you need to upgrade everything. Upgrading would mean overhauling everything at the same time which is a MASSIVE project. \n\nPLTR is coming in with one propriety program/OS that\u2019s plug and play. Get rid of your old Frankenstein CRM that\u2019s 50 different programs and replace it with Gotham. Now the entire system and database talks to each other and you can get real data in real time.",

CRM, SNOW, Microsoft and Amazon would technically be competitors but with different twists.\n\nAMD is also positioned in a cyclical environment , which I hate. Cyclicality + not knowing how things are going to turn out for them long term make it a no go for me.\n\nIn the near term ( maybe 5 years ) Id say AMD is a no brainer buy, but the cyclicality of it makes it so It cant be a core holding for me. IF I had to invest in the sector, I'd go with something like ASML or ASYS. A supplier to the cyclicals. A pick and shovel play if you will.\n\nPLTR also benefits from the government contracts. Some people have said that its both its strength and its weakness, but Id argue that it provides no exposure to weakness what so ever.\n\nThe fact that PLTR has been the government's T1 data analytics and AI supplier for over a decade means they are sitting on technology light years ahead of the private sector. When and how they will be able to execute said technology is an unknown.\n\nPLTR has a lot of unknowns, as you stated, and this is a big reason why institutions shy away from the company. We will never be able to get a full peak behind the curtain, but I argue that this is PLTR's strength. Its relationship with government ensures its longevity.\n\nPLTR is just starting its foray into the private/commercial sector.\n\nIf a company is good enough to protect American lives and Uncle Sam's interest's , it projects a level of security , trustworthiness and safety  that they will be able to leverage in the private sector.\n\nLastly, considering AMD exists in the hardware ecosystem, growth will always be dependent on externalities such as supply chain issues ( currently on full display ) and commodity availability etc.\n\nPLTR doesnt require external inputs to sell their products. So exponential growth can be achieved with much less resistance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, thats my pitch. PLTR is my second biggest holding. Its also the one that lets me get the best sleep at night. I truly never worry about it. Max drawdown I figure is about 50% but with everything it has going for it, even in an economic recession, I see it as unlikely.\n\nOnce their SPAC deals and investments start bearing fruit, you're going to see institutions begin to FOMO into the company. At that point government contracts will be nothing but a distant memory.",

Cisco. Oracle. \n\nWhat operating systems do majority of servers run? It's not windows, or iOS, or android. It's Linux. And the best one is redhat. It can run on and interface with any of the cloud providers securely. It's a platform to switch between any cloud provider easier than conforming to each cloud setup separately. \n\nWhat company makes the best server to process transactions for credit cards, banks, large retailers and service companies? Ibm, their processors are purpose built. Some like banks, hospitals, insurers are require by law to run their own data transaction systems. Their 7nm power 10 / telum processors can handle more work load any one else. Amd and Intel chip followers take note of ibm's CPU architecture. Specifically their cash system that result in much lower latency and cash pools in the size of gigabytes, also shared memory pools in terabytes. \n\nThey came up with the 2nm and lower transistor process for chips. They led in creating a programming language for quantum computing. They set a world record in data storage solution with their 580 terabyte tape units. Not worth listing all the little things they do. \n\nTheir new CEO is outspoken about collaboration and getting ibm out from being a siloed company. I am sure they will find the right partners for their tech. He switched the company over to Salesforce and slack and such. Deepens partnerships with companies like SAP and others. Increasing consulting business. IBM was also early in jumping in and providing lots of online open courses with100s of thousands taking part across the world. \n\nIBMs role might be niche and you might not understand them.

I have seen what it was, and now what it is.  \n\n\nI stand by my assessment as does Facebooks own internal research and 3rd parties that the platform is at large an echo chamber for those that do not think critically, are manipulated easily by what the algorithm is feeling them and is an older population of users.   It's not debatable.   \n\n\nIf you are a FB user it does not mean that's you or your friends (if you're taking this personally) peer group, age group, experience and interests can not be other than what I'm describing, you could see a feed of content that is yours and feel FB is not what I'm saying, that is the social bubble / echo chamber effect at work with their algorithm, they are not all bad, just the majority of them are.",

Also happened to me recently with CRM.  Up nice amount, pulled way back, then rocketed back up.  Still holding.\n\nAt the end of the day it's best to just focus on Index funds and leave a small % (5, 10, maybe 20) to play around.

But from a valuation perspective, it's still an almost 2 billion dollar company with a high multiple with a lot of uncertainty around it. I know people are defensive about it and another certain 3D printing company, but there are questions to ask to make sure it's a quality stock in this sort of risk-off environment.\n\nDoes it have long term staying power in 3D printing? How does the market even value that sector, outside of speculation? Will it have proven cash flows? As a former SPAC, does it have skeletons in the closet and is there something we don't know about it (SPAC route to becoming a public company undergoes less scrutiny, and is partly why they're priced at a discount for a while, not to mention some very shady SPACs meaning guilt by association)? \n\nPeople are selling this sort of uncertainty about sector, company, and valuation, and moving to proven quality names in tech in this sort of environment, as well as mainstay sectors like energy and financials, and this may be why it's selling off so hard, along with other small cap names that have a lot of potential but are speculative in one way or another, like SKLZ, FUBO, etc. It doesn't mean it's a good deal, though if small cap growth stocks come back in force, DM can surge back to $10. But it's hard to say. That's a gamble.\n\n\"Quality\" is really hard to gauge admittedly. But I'd say a company that's been around for at least a few years and has proven cash flows and a business with less speculative risk factored in is what this post is getting at.\n\nIn contrast, take a look at $PRLB, another 3D printing stock. Has been around for a while, consistently doing good business, and now trading close to March 2020 lows. Why? It's just out of favor in the market and very likely being manipulated. Buying it is still a gamble somewhat and carries some of the same risks as DM, but at least with it we have a much larger span of relative valuation to draw on and a company with solid financials to fall back on. \n\nThat said, PRLB is a falling knife and still not truly quality by any means. But if I wanted to buy in the sector, that would be it. Most fundamentally sound company in the sector is what to go for IMO\n\nI've been buying small cap growth, too, but very selectively and slowly over time, because they can dip to stupid low levels. INMD, ATKR are two. VSH is an oversold very cheap semi stock that's extremely good fundamentally and trading nowhere near its peers that are well above pre-covid highs. CRNC is a unique AI company that's hitting the bottom of its multi-month range and valued at modest multiples despite growth. SMG has been walloped as if it were a MJ stock, but obviously it's not just that -- Barron's laid out a great case for it last week.\n\nOther than that, it's been stalwarts like ABT, BMY, CRM, NVDA that I'm going to keep buying over time. VALE is a new one I'm adding because it's never been this cheap by PE (IIRC) and key to any economic recovery.",

What's up with logistics only having 3 players, and UPS being the outright monopoly? Seems like a huge opportunity for Uber and Doordash to make a name for themselves in on-demand delivery.\n3. It's funny how the first US bank appears at #62. Just shows that people aren't loyal to their banks, they only use them because they're locked in or it's convention. Makes me even more bullish on Square and Paypal. \n4. Why did they classify Google as a media/entertainment company? Either way, the Facebook brand is super strong, despite all the hate it receives on Reddit. \n5. I'm impressed that Zoom and AMD made the list. I expect in the future they will overtake Oracle, Salesforce, Cisco etc in terms of brand recognition and loyalty.",

Slack Salesforce acquisition is a good example of a deal that took a while.\n\nYou may also want to consider doing a call spread, and potentially buying a higher strike call and selling a 70 call against it.",
