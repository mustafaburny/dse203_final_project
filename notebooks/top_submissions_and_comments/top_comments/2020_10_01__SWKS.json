I wasn't trying to promote or even really suggest buying n0k beyond the fact they have 3 things going for them that have landed them on my more ambitious portfolio, where I buy calls/LEAPS and lately lose money on. First two are safety related in an uncertain 5G future. They're very undervalued, when their dividend comes back they'll be lucrative and if it's just that I'll transfer shares to my roth. They won't go bankrupt, Finland and Europe have too much stake in them. Third is potential. They lost a major verizon contract yet won 100 other 5G ones. Theyre giving out a lot of tastes. They're also an acquisition target yet a merger with say er!c could potentially allow them to become formidable in the sphere. \n\nTheir past management has been atrocious, they do carry a lot of debt, and when I initially excercised a few call options on them this summer I figured I'd leave it as such. when my stop loss was triggered I learned of the new ceo's strategy and am looking at them in a different light. I think they could be a direct or indirect recipient of US 5G infrastructure investment and see a sizable upside, which is why I'm still holding a thousand (recently acquired) shares. Again, very different from qc0m and aforementioned 5G plays but not dismissable for me. Of course, if it's still trading like this come January I'll sell and hold leaps but I think something will. They're not special i just dont see the same downside risks, some of which feel like I'm betting on horses.",

However, I wouldn't be full on stocks that did great in the 1st round of covid in spring (like zoom) cuz people got used to this shit and there is not a lot of space to grow. Take zoom for exemple. Now everybody is using it and those who dont wont convert (like most of the universities in EU. They make their courses on MSFT Teams or GOOGLE classroom cuz Zoom is shitty). \n\nNow, here's the list:\n\n1. Retail (both online and physical): Walmart, Costco, Target, Amazon, Shopify, Etsy, Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowe's\n\n2. Construction: DR Horton, TOLL Brothers due to low interest rates \n\n3. Materials: only wood shit or lithium if you are risky af. Silver and gold suck atm but will get a boost soon due to the stimulus\n\n4. Tech, semis, comms: (carefull with the FAANGs. Might get blown if Biden wins) Crowdstrike, Telekom, Verizon, NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, Skyworks, Broadcom, Keysight, Texas Instrumets, Taiwan Semi, you get the idea. Every 5G and powerfull cyber company. \n\n5. Consumer discretionary (if you are truly a bear and life sucks in COVID, quarantine shit, depression and you dont like easy money): General Mills, Pepsi, Cola, other bullshit like this\n\n6. This is my power move: Energy: EVERY FCKING THING THAT IS RENEWABLE ENERGY. Buy an etf and it should be all good. I have a position in one since last month, up 20%. \n\n7. Video Games: EA, Activision, Sony, MSFT, Ubisoft",

A great place to park some long term cash... especially GE as they restructure. Energy sectors and oil will double as well as demand rises as we break out of the pandemic. Same for airlines... I see Alaska Airlines as the best value play. If I were you I\u2019d invest in all of these industries that are down 50-70% and wait to reap your rewards. Value investing is better than chasing momentum in my opinion. Buy low sell high, easy enough. There are a couple momentum stocks I\u2019d buy right now as in ASAP! Apple, Verizon, TMobile, Skyworks, Bloom Energy, Qualcomm, WiFi (boingo), these companies are set to reap the rewards and huge cash flow into 5g. SPY is a great diversified etc to park some cash too. It\u2019s the ultimate set it and forget it stock. I would definitely recommend you check out some great etfs as a new investor.",
