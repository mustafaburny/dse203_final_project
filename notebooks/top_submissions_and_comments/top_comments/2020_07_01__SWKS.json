BOA (and other big banks in general) gave out A LOT of money in PPP loans, which are almost all currently under review for government forgiveness eligibility under the CARES Act. Depending on how that all plays out, they are going to come into a shitload of cash from the Feds to immediately extinguish those notes or have a shitload of PPP receivables on the books for the foreseeable future. Which given the true economic state of America, not just the imaginary stock market, could obviously result in catastrophic loan default losses from broke ass bankrupt corporations. \n\nBuffett obviously knows more than us plebs, and if I had to guess he\u2019s banking on the better scenario here. I don\u2019t generally obsessively sniff his nuts like a lot of boomer stock investors, but I do respect his success and am very cognizant of the fact that he wins more than he loses.
