Go look at the Dow or S&amp;P components from 1980 and see how the castoffs have fared. \n\nFor the Dow, changes used to be VERY rare. From 1959-1976 there were ZERO changes. \n\nNow? It changes its components several times\na year. \n\nIf it didn\u2019t keep doing this, it wouldn\u2019t \u201cperform\u201d\nNearly as well.\n\nLook at how shitty GE has done over the past three years. They used to be THE corporate bellwether of the US economy. But GE\u2019s plunge didn\u2019t hurt the Dow at all. It was removed as a component in the middle of 2018. \n\nIn March of 2015 the Dow added Apple to replace AT&amp;T (once so big and fearful it had to be busted up by regulators, but is now a dogshit dividend stock). That one change alone did wonders for the Dow average. \n\nIn Sept 2013, Nike, Goldman Sachs, and Visa replaced such dogs as Hewlett-Packard and Alcoa.\n\nIn 2009, Cisco Systems replaced GM.\n\nAnyways, you get the point. The Dow and S&amp;P, by definition, will always go up over time. They will simply drop dog sticks with no future and replace them with up and coming stalwarts. \n\nI\u2019ve often looked, but have never found, a report that would show how the Dow and S&amp;P would have performed if they didn\u2019t modify their components and always stack the decks. \n\nTLDR: the Dow and S&amp;P change the component stocks to always contain far more winners than losers. They will rise over time. They don\u2019t reflect the more broad stock market as a whole, nor do they reflect how the average American family is doing economically. They just reflect a basket of \u201cwinning\u201d stocks.",

        "body": "I would be careful about TSLA as a long-term play right now for 3 reasons:\n\n1) it\u2019s fairly unclear if Tesla will be able to retain their lead in EV. Many other automakers are entering EV. For instance, Toyota claims to have game-changing solid-state battery tech in the works. If this is true, then Toyota could potentially be the leader in EV (especially if you combine game-changing tech with their already-stellar reputation and market share). Or maybe some other car company. Who knows?\n2) Tesla is currently very expensive. At a valuation of 600B, Tesla\u2019s current price tag is on par with the largest, most successful, and highest-profit companies in the world. To buy now means you expect them long-term to continue going up on top of this already-massive valuation. Possible, but definitely risky (especially for a company that is very new, has relatively low profits, and isn\u2019t very diversified).\n3) currently, tesla\u2019s valuation relies a lot on expectation of future earnings (nothing wrong with that; I like this style of investing). If the overall market takes a significant downturn before tesla can become very profitable, then their stock price will probably plummet (once the stock price goes down, people/institutions on margin need to sell, causing the price to go even lower, causing a cycle the way down; speculative stocks tend to get hit worst when this happens). Could be similar to Cisco circa 2000. Note that if this does happen, this might actually be a good time to buy shares for cheap if you do still believe in the long-term for tesla\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Not financial advice. I personally own put options on tesla (but also own shares of tesla in an account that someone else manages for me)",

I had fun in my last post but I'll explain more about what you ***probably should do.***\n\n1. Buy 100 shares @ reasonable stock and price. If you like Amazon, CSCO may be reasonable alternative though it's in the 50s price range. Tech sector - strong - good dividend. Yatta yatta.\n2. Sell a covered call @ strike price  you're willing to sell. Ideally put it in the expected move range. Delta = About 30. Or if you think the stock will go down (hence you want to sell out of it), sell a call at a strike somewhere in the money.\n3. use the covered call to buy a put.\n4. Using JPM as an example: Sell a covered call at $150 strike for $275 and buy a put for $117 dollars. You get paid $158 dollars to lock in a price between now and $149.\n5. If the price is going to drop below $149 you simply buy back the covered call (Buy to Close) which will now be cheaper or if it falls out of the money you don't even need to worry about it, it expires worthless.\n6. Exercise the put and sell your shares for $149, a price close to the top you wanted to sell out at anyway.\n\nVoilla - a collar, in a nutshell.\n\nYou literally got paid to **EXIT** a stock when **YOU** wanted to.",

Uber is basically something that skirts labour laws and wants to be a monopoly. Medical breakthroughs on news are mostly lies/held by red tape (which it should be). \n\nYeah, you got Apple and such, but these companies actually proved their worth on the balance sheet. China will (at least I strongly believe) have a great tech industry, but if you knew what they were, you wouldn't be here, you would be in some big boys club getting told what they are and aren't. Tech is an industry where the government boosts you up (lets be honest, the US heavily backs people like Cisco or Microsoft) or you do something that is a real breakthrough.

Facebook was in trouble for collecting data without content too. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal? But now everyone is hot for FB stocks.\n\nMicrosoft has been fined millions by the EU for monopolistic practices as well. But everyone loves Microsoft stocks nonetheless. \n\nAnd as to Ant Group, they are a massive financial service company that can offer customers credit. How come they don't get to be regulated like a bank? My point is that these actions make sense and good regulations is beneficial for investors too in the long run.",

It was the #1 company by marketcap in 2019 and march 2020.\n\nMoreover, It has never fallen out of the top 10 list for more than 20+ years even with failure of Ballmer, tech bubble crash, Nokia, etc. Now with the new ceo, I dont see it going out of the top 10 especially since it is so far ahead from #10 spot which is Alibaba at 600 billion market cap. (Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).\n\nBack in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.\n\nMicrosoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2012",

Tesla sells under 1% all vehicles worldwide but is somehow worth *more than all the other carmakers combined* because lots of people were buying Tesla stock and not because of any financial status of Tesla. dogecoin started LITERALLY as a joke but somehow was more valuable than companies like Ford Motors only because a ton of cash flowed into Dogecoin. this is all sheer insanity by traditional stock valuation guidelines. asset bubbles are nothing new, but Burry believes it's being exacerbated by passive investing. \n\n- Burry believes this situation of prices being based on cash flows is similar to what happened in the housing bubble, when multi-zillion Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) were being priced not by a reasonable estimate of their fair value but by cash-flows. \n\n- when flows reverse and lots of people want out of index funds, it will get ugly because so many stocks are linked/benchmarked to major stock indexes *including lower volume stocks*. consider VTI: the top holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson) might have a billion shares in total and hundreds of millions of dollars trading each day. but the smallest company stocks might have only a few million shares and a few million dollars trading each day. if too many people want to sell all at the same time, it will drive prices down sharply because these stocks are so often sold as a bundle/unit. as Burry puts it: \"The theater keeps getting more crowded, but the exit door is the same as it always was\"\n\n&gt;since the guy predicted 2007-2008 crash.\n\nhe also predicted the dot-com bubble.",

FULL STOP. Not at bargain price points, or for certain niche applications just straight up expecting to have the best GPUs on the market next gen. Nvidia having something spicy up their sleeve non-withstanding; you never know with Nvidia.   \n\n  Add in plans to buy back 4 billion worth of shares over the next 4(?) Years with cash on hand and plans for 3nm production by 2024 and everything I hear about AMD makes me think up up up. They have new deals with Samsung for their phones and google/amazon for servers, to add to the pile of deals like making chips for Sony and Microsoft consoles. The future looks bright.\n\nI put 90% of my account in AMD last month when they were hovering around 80$ without a single worry and I haven't unwound my position yet. Hoping for 2021 guidance to be adjusted from 50% to 75% growth to set this thing off again. Or merger approval, whatever comes first.",

The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD. \n\nA plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and \"5G-cloudification\" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI &amp; tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM &amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China's Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.",

AMZN and MSFT have risen/dropped as a result. I imagine Pelosi's position would make her privy to this news in advance of the general public. Could be a reach that this is the reasoning for the move though.",

If you bough a SPY leap the day before the market crashed last year from covid, and bought 100 shares the day before the crash in covid, the LEAP would be worth more today.\n\n2-5% a month seems super low, but options are a grind. When in doubt, zoom out. 2-5% a month is 25-60% a year. Consider the indexes historically return 10%, doubling that on your bad years and quintupling it on your good years seems like a good trade.\n\nAnother note, this past year has been a historic bull run/recovery for most of the stock market. You can't compare throwing money into microsoft or google and watching it appreciate vs selling options on the same underlying. Likewise, if you had been selling RIOT/MARA puts the first 4 months of the year, you could've been making 10% a week. \n\nEverything in the market is perspective. If you think 2-5% a month is too slow/boring... You might consider roulette.",
