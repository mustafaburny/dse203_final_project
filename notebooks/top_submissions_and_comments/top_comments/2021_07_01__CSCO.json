        "body": "One reason is that they aren\u2019t static indexes. They are dynamic survivor bias indexes. What does that mean? \n\nIt means they replace losers with winners. Go look at the Dow or S&amp;P components from 1980 and see how the castoffs have fared. \n\nFor the Dow, changes used to be VERY rare. From 1959-1976 there were ZERO changes. \n\nNow? It changes its components several times\na year. \n\nIf it didn\u2019t keep doing this, it wouldn\u2019t \u201cperform\u201d\nNearly as well.\n\nLook at how shitty GE has done over the past three years. They used to be THE corporate bellwether of the US economy. But GE\u2019s plunge didn\u2019t hurt the Dow at all. It was removed as a component in the middle of 2018. \n\nIn March of 2015 the Dow added Apple to replace AT&amp;T (once so big and fearful it had to be busted up by regulators, but is now a dogshit dividend stock). That one change alone did wonders for the Dow average. \n\nIn Sept 2013, Nike, Goldman Sachs, and Visa replaced such dogs as Hewlett-Packard and Alcoa.\n\nIn 2009, Cisco Systems replaced GM.\n\nAnyways, you get the point. The Dow and S&amp;P, by definition, will always go up over time. They will simply drop dog sticks with no future and replace them with up and coming stalwarts. \n\nI\u2019ve often looked, but have never found, a report that would show how the Dow and S&amp;P would have performed if they didn\u2019t modify their components and always stack the decks. \n\nTLDR: the Dow and S&amp;P change the component stocks to always contain far more winners than losers. They will rise over time. They don\u2019t reflect the more broad stock market as a whole, nor do they reflect how the average American family is doing economically. They just reflect a basket of \u201cwinning\u201d stocks.",

        "body": "Boring is the best, but it\u2019s not fun. Here\u2019s my strategy and I have been investing since I was in MY twenties: \n\nThere was a time when you couldn\u2019t just open an account and start buying investments. You had to have broker and usually you had to buy 100 share blocks of stock. Some companies had DRIP services where you obtain 1 share in the open market and then the company would register this share so that you could buy directly from the company thereafter. For example, Computershare.com is the transfer agent for many public companies and you can buy shares today directly from them. However, it\u2019s costly and very regimented when you want to sell. I still have some shares in DRIPs. Today, however, the world is your oyster. It\u2019s actually a bit dangerous, because with the push of a button you can lose a lot of money. \n\nStart a core position in a broad index fund, Schwab, Vanguard, and Fidelity all have good, low fee index funds (either ETF or mutual fund). Invest in this every month automatically if you can (dollar cost averaging). Keep this chugging along through thick  and thin. If it\u2019s only $50/month, so be it. \n\nAs you make more money, diversify and have fun, but keep that core chugging along! I remember delivering pizzas on the side when I was in the Air Force so I could buy Intel stock through DRIPs. Later worked a different side job to buy Cisco stock. I now have only retirement income so in order to max out my IRA each year, I work a part-time job. Last year I made $7110 and put $7000 in my IRA. \n\nNo investment is perfect. Time in the market starting at 22 is YOUR advantage. Don\u2019t worry about Timing the market. Make a move now and you can adjust it later; but if you start with a broad market, low fee index fund, you may never have to adjust it. Just add to it with other investments as you learn and make more dough. Quicker you get that core up and rolling, the quicker you can budget for some cannabis, renewables, or EV stocks. Or, whatever you find interesting and valuable.",

        "body": "I would be careful about TSLA as a long-term play right now for 3 reasons:\n\n1) it\u2019s fairly unclear if Tesla will be able to retain their lead in EV. Many other automakers are entering EV. For instance, Toyota claims to have game-changing solid-state battery tech in the works. If this is true, then Toyota could potentially be the leader in EV (especially if you combine game-changing tech with their already-stellar reputation and market share). Or maybe some other car company. Who knows?\n2) Tesla is currently very expensive. At a valuation of 600B, Tesla\u2019s current price tag is on par with the largest, most successful, and highest-profit companies in the world. To buy now means you expect them long-term to continue going up on top of this already-massive valuation. Possible, but definitely risky (especially for a company that is very new, has relatively low profits, and isn\u2019t very diversified).\n3) currently, tesla\u2019s valuation relies a lot on expectation of future earnings (nothing wrong with that; I like this style of investing). If the overall market takes a significant downturn before tesla can become very profitable, then their stock price will probably plummet (once the stock price goes down, people/institutions on margin need to sell, causing the price to go even lower, causing a cycle the way down; speculative stocks tend to get hit worst when this happens). Could be similar to Cisco circa 2000. Note that if this does happen, this might actually be a good time to buy shares for cheap if you do still believe in the long-term for tesla\n\nThese are just my thoughts. Not financial advice. I personally own put options on tesla (but also own shares of tesla in an account that someone else manages for me)",

        "body": "&gt; Those shit companies were not in any index and pets.com was 300-400 million market cap at its peak (which it held for a very short time). You can equate pets.com to companies like NKLA which make gravity powered trucks. NKLA was ~ 30B market cap at its peak -- and it's still worth 5B+\n\nThat kinda helps my point though. NKLA tanked but it has no correlation to the overall stock market, and the whole stock market went up in fact. Same with the entire SPAC bubble. Yes it was a bubble, but it popped and the market moved on its way without missing a beat. \n\n&gt; The \"real\" megacap tech companies of 2000 were hewlett packard, microsoft, ibm, csco, intel, sun, compaq, etc. Their P/E ratios are much closer to the FAANGs of today. And most of the peak P/E ratios happened after a series of bad earnings.\n\nEven then the PE ratios are not the same. MSFT in it's peak in 1999 had a PE ratio of ~82, it now has a PE ratio of ~35. \n\nI'm not gonna say that *every* company today is fine. Many are not (including NKLA). But the 2000 was endemic throughout the market (i.e. say \"internet\" and stock 10x'd at ipo). Today the market is much more varied and plenty of companies trading at high multiples do so because they're growth is very real.\n\nSorta unrelated but I personally believe tech got an insane boost from covid which is/will be driving huge digitalization efforts and  accelerate growth for many saas/cloud centric companies.",

        "body": "I think there is always relativity in valuation metrics, and not just P/E.  \n\nThere is always a certain amount of relativity to valuations based on industry -- different industries have different typical P/Es, different P/S etc.  What % of market cap industries are holding definitely affects broad average measures of market.  And market conditions, of course, cause some relativity.  We are in a late cycle bull market - a late cycle bull that has been dominated by Tech which often carries higher P/Es than other industries.  Are today's valuations way ahead of where they often sit in late cycle bull markets?  not really and definitely not compared to the tech led bull that ended in 2000 -- although that one pulls most of the averages up.  The Covid panic also brought a ton of write downs which also has the effect of depressing earnings when looking strictly at P/E, so other valuations are important -- I am suspicious the current market is growing ahead of proof of earnings.\n\nThe bear cycle is the only thing that will reset the P/E norm.  Corrections never really do.  And as the bear occurs and matures the average P/Es will become lower than norm but that doesn't necessarily make individual stocks raging buys on a relative basis either.  Some bull market leading companies get their business cycles wrung out pretty hard and may not recover back to pre-bear norms, some may go away entirely.  Look at CSCO as an example of that -- it still hasn't recovered its prior market high.  The current market is interesting to me because it seems kind of like a redo on the Nifty Fifty bull market.\n\nYou are right to point out the risk in bonds.  There is a very long cycle of potential rate raises if we are just to return to traditional global norms in interest rates.  That by itself makes stocks more interesting IMO.\n\ncheers.",

I had fun in my last post but I'll explain more about what you ***probably should do.***\n\n1. Buy 100 shares @ reasonable stock and price. If you like Amazon, CSCO may be reasonable alternative though it's in the 50s price range. Tech sector - strong - good dividend. Yatta yatta.\n2. Sell a covered call @ strike price  you're willing to sell. Ideally put it in the expected move range. Delta = About 30. Or if you think the stock will go down (hence you want to sell out of it), sell a call at a strike somewhere in the money.\n3. use the covered call to buy a put.\n4. Using JPM as an example: Sell a covered call at $150 strike for $275 and buy a put for $117 dollars. You get paid $158 dollars to lock in a price between now and $149.\n5. If the price is going to drop below $149 you simply buy back the covered call (Buy to Close) which will now be cheaper or if it falls out of the money you don't even need to worry about it, it expires worthless.\n6. Exercise the put and sell your shares for $149, a price close to the top you wanted to sell out at anyway.\n\nVoilla - a collar, in a nutshell.\n\nYou literally got paid to **EXIT** a stock when **YOU** wanted to.",
