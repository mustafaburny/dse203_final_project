        "body": "It's a nuanced topic. My recommendation is to understand at the foundational level what an option even is, without worrying about how to make money. There are different ways to use options to make money, so examples people give you are just that and not necessarily the one true way to make money with options. Options are famous for offering many different ways to make money with them.\n\nIn the simplest terms, an option is the right to buy or sell stock at a fixed price within a specific time period. But even the option itself has value, and thus it is a derivative market of the stock market. \n\nThe important thing to understand is that the value of the option will change depending on the stock price change, the time to expiration, and the volatility of the market (the greeks). Since time is always moving, volatility is always changing, and stock price is always changing (at least in high volume markets), the price of an option will also change constantly. This is what people clue in on and how they learn to make money with options. They can sell an option at a better price than they bought it (or buy an option at a lower price than they shorted it). But it gets even more complex as then strategies emerge which involve multiple option contracts in the same stock hedging each other (option spreads). So it's like a layer cake of complexity because options have so many variables (the greeks) and thus many different ways to use them. This is why it's hard to come up with a brief explanation of how to make money with options. I definitely recommend taking a full options course online, as it's the sort of thing you'll never truly get until you dedicate a few hours into really exploring the concepts. It's not hard, but there are simply many things you have to be cognizant of before options make any sense. What I've laid out is just scratching the surface.",

BOA (and other big banks in general) gave out A LOT of money in PPP loans, which are almost all currently under review for government forgiveness eligibility under the CARES Act. Depending on how that all plays out, they are going to come into a shitload of cash from the Feds to immediately extinguish those notes or have a shitload of PPP receivables on the books for the foreseeable future. Which given the true economic state of America, not just the imaginary stock market, could obviously result in catastrophic loan default losses from broke ass bankrupt corporations. \n\nBuffett obviously knows more than us plebs, and if I had to guess he\u2019s banking on the better scenario here. I don\u2019t generally obsessively sniff his nuts like a lot of boomer stock investors, but I do respect his success and am very cognizant of the fact that he wins more than he loses.

The term of our current agreement with Baidu expires at the end of 2020. Since the on-going tensions between US and China might have an affect on this agreement.\n3. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\n4. Sales and Marketing Expenses are increasing at a rapid pace\n5. Their competitors are well established and they always pose a threat, see below the list of them in each domain\n   1.

Cloudflare and google collectively did a research on Browser Isolation. Even though, the results weren't promising, they are working towards it.   \n\n\nAlso, a key point to note is, Cloudflare leverages the idle network bandwidth to provide the free service to their customers since the highest priority is given to enterprise customers. By doing so, they were able to increase their exposure as well as establish more routes that been said, they want these customers to at least go for pay-as-you-go subscription which might help Cloudflare in terms of revenue.",

Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.\n\nDivesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP\u2019s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom &amp; will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.\n\nMain downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this &amp; the sky didn't fall.\n\nTLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP",

I only open my mouth because I've been pissed when people keep easy plays to themselves I miss out on.\n\nLet's be honest, as long as you don't date these calls for a single day or two, you WILL make money. 2-4 week should be a safe gamble. Date them later if you are concerned. Firstly, the same thing happened after weak Q2 guidance last year and Intel proceeded to skyrocket 30% after bottoming around 45. Secondly, Intel relies on less than 25% of revenue from chip manufacturing. In addition they have double digit YOY growth 10+ years in a row, and they have beaten earnings both quarters this year. Finally, they have 18 BILLION in free cash flow. This company could be a disorganized mess for the next 10 years and still be valued highly just from how strong their financial spreadsheet is. Your call. But this is easy money.",

        "body": "User /u/bangorlol reverse engineered this himself, here are the findings:\n\nSo I can personally weigh in on this. I reverse-engineered the app, and feel confident in stating that I have a very strong understanding for how the app operates (or at least operated as of a few months ago).\n\nTikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, or your device... well, they're using it.\n\n* Phone hardware (cpu type, number of course, hardware ids, screen dimensions, dpi, memory usage, disk space, etc)\n\n* Other apps you have installed (I've even seen some I've deleted show up in their analytics payload - maybe using as cached value?)\n\n* Everything network-related (ip, local ip, router mac, your mac, wifi access point name)\n\n* Whether or not you're rooted/jailbroken\n\n* Some variants of the app had GPS pinging enabled at the time, roughly once every 30 seconds - this is enabled by default if you ever location-tag a post IIRC\n\n* They set up a local proxy server on your device for \"transcoding media\", but that can be abused very easily as it has zero authentication\n\nThe scariest part of all of this is that much of the logging they're doing is remotely configurable, and unless you reverse every single one of their native libraries (have fun reading all of that assembly, assuming you can get past their customized fork of OLLVM!!!) and manually inspect every single obfuscated function. They have several different protections in place to prevent you from reversing or debugging the app as well. App behavior changes slightly if they know you're trying to figure out what they're doing. There's also a few snippets of code on the Android version that allows for the downloading of a remote zip file, unzipping it, and executing said binary. There is zero reason a mobile app would need this functionality legitimately.\n\n... Here's the thing though.. they don't want you to know how much information they're collecting on you, and the security implications of all of that data in one place, en masse, are fucking huge. They encrypt all of the analytics requests with an algorithm that changes with every update (at the very least the keys change) just so you can't see what they're doing. They also made it so you cannot use the app at all if you block communication to their analytics host off at the DNS-level.",

        "body": "This is weird advice and don\u2019t take this as \u201cdont invest\u201d: invest SO much man, but invest in the new stuff. Stocks are the rich mans game in 2020, this isn\u2019t 1950 anymore, stocks are the price that they are at because of a lot of manipulation by our government. I like that you\u2019re in small caps. Learn about Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ampleforth, Decentralized Finance, staking, private keys, exchanges, absorb it all. Jump into the new stuff don\u2019t even think about it just learn as you go. IMO there\u2019s more opportunity in Cryptocurrency than Stocks and I personally think it\u2019s more fun and a 24 hour market and can be done entirely on your phone if you want and buying in is so cheap right now, like pennies to invest in good tokens. If you don\u2019t believe me check out AERGO, a Token that has more impressive partnerships than hundreds of thousands of companies in the stock market. I don\u2019t think that dropping money into an index fund is a BAD idea, but IMO it\u2019s more of an 80s-2010s idea that isn\u2019t going to be as successful when the market is so disconnected from the realities facing America at the moment. I would HIGHLY recommend \u201cHow to Make Money in Stocks\u201d by William ONeil; the founder of Investor Business Daily. His strategies helped me make money in crypto this month in particular. But man just learn. That shit is free. Learn, explore, make folders and book mark shit. Definitely also recommend \u201cSteal Like an Artist\u201d",
