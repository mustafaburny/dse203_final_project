        "body": "Well, can't blame you for giving up after that, plus TD is probably better anyway, I just have love for Fidelity as they've always done right by me and is my 'hometown brokerage' since I grew up and remain in Boston.  I'm certain they gave me level 2 off the bat, but it may have been because I'd had the account for a long time (I was lucky enough that my parents had opened a Roth account in my name at 15 when I began working my crappy first job at $7.25/hr and put in whatever small contributions my 20-40 hours a week allowed, so I was already a decade + long customer when I opened my investment account), or just that I exaggerated my 0 years of experience to be more like 3 or 4. \n\nRegardless, TD is mostly the superior platform with ToS so no reason to care too much, kind of a bonehead move on Fidelity's part though.  There'd be 0 risk to them at level 2, besides a loss reducing their overall customer holdings, but any loss would still be better for them than you leaving entirely.  Once you get to naked positions, it's more understandable as with margin one could certainly lose more than they have selling naked.. but just buying options, even on margin, the worst one could do is simply wipe out their account.  I can't understand their logic for denying that on a six figure account (and my account was also around the same size at that time), especially if you pressed for it.  \n\nThe fact someone even said \"no clue\" doesn't sound like the Fidelity I know, I guess you just happened to have crappy staff answer your calls, luckily if anything they did you a favor if you're liking TD and ToS.\n\nI still would consider keeping something in a Fidelity account, since personally I do like some of their resources and functionality -\n- Active Trader Pro / ATP is, imo, a great equities platform, and since options all have underlying equities, this is of use to me.  \n\nI started writing and got carried away, so this isn't so much for you as I'm sure you're set, but anyone reading that is curious about Fidelity, these are some aspects that have kept me around:\n\n- Wealth Lab Pro is a pretty robust programming tool to screen stocks and implement a wide array of technical indicators as well as back test them.  Of course one has to be cognizant of the fact that finding a fitting method for trading based on past data does not necessarily mean this will be a winning strategy going forward - as the most winning strategies when running on 20-30 years of historical data must be tailored to that data, which does not necessarily mean success going forward.  \n\nFor example, I've developed programs that can turn $20k in 1991 into billions today, however thst doesn't mean it would be effective in today's market (not to mention, to get to the billions, trades can sometimes exceed a company's entire market cap or a big % of it, which would both be near impossible and would have significant effects on an the equity's price that isn't reflected in the data - ie, buying up 50% of outstanding shares would doubtlessly send the price up, making the strategy completely ineffective - so finding a happy medium is key), looking for realistic trades and outcomes, i.e, from '91 to now $20k could conceivably be turned into $50M, maybe even $200M, but if it's $200B after 29 years, that's just not happening and the strategy could be majorly flawed.  \n\nThat said, if it's coded using a specific set of stocks (generally not S&amp;P or others that have all done well to even be included - better to bundle together 50-200 equities, some that have grown, some that have peaked and declined, some cyclical and some that went bankrupt, since this is a better representation of a random list of stocks today), decent comparisons can be made.\n\nWLP can even initiate trades for algo trading, but I prefer to use it as a screener for potential option strategies.  It's definitely useful and while I think ToS has similar, I'm used to it and find it to have significant potential.\n\nStill I have a TD account to use ToS as it's far superior to Fidelity's ATP for analyzing risk, P/L and PoP %, however ATP is still decent enough for placing orders and actually imo better, for my own personal workflow, for:\n\n* Watching price movement (anywhere from 1 equity or index, option, etc. up to 9 or even 18 or more if you have the monitors for it) - I remember when I was newer someone acted like seeing 12 or 15 charts at once was overkill, however especially day trading, I think it's useful to monitor many equities rather than feel pressured to make one work.\n\n* Setting alerts that can push to the ATP mobile app, the main desktop program, texts or other options such as email etc., and:\n\n* Setting position-specific notes including ones that combine with alerts to help track why a given alert is set - ie, one may trigger at +30% growth from purchase and helpfully remind you \"$XYZ profit target reached (+30%) - \" and then a reminder of your exit strategy such as \"Sell to close immediately\", or, \"Place stop loss order at -5% from current MP and set alert at +7.6% (+40% of cost basis total) with similar conditions\" \n\n------&gt; This is my preferred way of walking up my exit prices to not miss potential gains without letting \"realized\"-ish gains waste away - if it backslides it will sell at a 25% profit, if it continues upward to 40%, a new stop loss is set at a 35% gain and a new alert at +50%, and so on.  \n\n     This is especially useful for day or swing trading where short expiry periods of 1-10 DTE mean positions' P/L can swing wildly in a short time and sticking to exit strategies is key, since it's easy to get caught up if a flurry of buy-side trades sends the price of the position skyrocketing past your profit target.\n\n    Using this, any FOMO mistakes are avoided by auto-selling when the gains are reversed enough, but there is still allowance for maximizing returns even though the target has been passed by walking up your stop loss to help lock in any significant increases.  Without it, it's all too easy for it quickly to dip back 5% and keep going, while the trader waits thinking the gains will continue - before long it could fall back below even the original target, especially as it's natural to want it to reverse and hit the highest gain seen.  Taking that need for mental fortitude out of the picture helps all but the most self-disciplined traders to maximize gains. \n\nToS has plenty of feature overlap, but I like ATP's feel, ease of use and general look.  It's certainly optimized for equity trading but with some extra work, is useful for an options trader.  \n\nAlso, this is more in contrast to a platform like RH, but Fidelity essentially never interferes.  For newcomers this can be dangerous, as if you miss an expiration you'll automatically exercise a position, even if it results in a significant margin call.  An equity could also drop over a weekend, costing you serious money.  However, it won't auto-sell a position like RH, meaning you can fully benefit from a late day rally rather than losing out on potentially a large % due to their 2-3 pm autosells\n\nAnyway.. that got off topic and long, but hopefully is of mild interest to somebody out there",

I would advise a web based discount brokerage if you're willing to learn the ropes yourself. 500-1000 is perfectly fine to start with and you'll find that making that first step makes the rest easier.\n\nMost online brokerages have tutorials on how to use their platform in their help pages.\n\nThis is both a good time and a bad time to get into the market. Volatility is high, prices swing high and low. There are bargains to be found but some companies could very well go to 0 after this. Do not place your hopes in companies skyrocketing. If you plan on buying stock as opposed to trading options or shorter termed derivatives, you need to look for the long term. Where will that company be in 10 years?\n\nA lot of those med companies will have a surge in value due to the pandemic, but will those same conditions hold 10 years from now? \n\nVersus say a bank stock that might be a bit pricier but that you know will weather the storm (because you did your due diligence on them) and will reliably grow for 10-20-30 years and pay you a dividend.\n\nMake a plan of how much you want to invest and at what frequency. \n\nDon't let fear and greed drive your decisions. Every time you want to reassess your portfolio, begin the process anew of asking yourself \"If I didn't own this stock/ETF, would I still want to buy it today with all the information I have available?\". Be cognizant of your cognitive biases (sunk cost fallacy, confirmation bias, selection bias, etc.)\n\nYou need to be able to read company filings and balance sheets to see how much debt they're carrying vs earnings. The Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio can be a powerful tool to see valuation at a glance, the average on the index before this crash was between 12-14 for solid companies, but much higher for tech companies due to expectations of growth.",

Covid19 is important in that cannabis is now being perceived as a medical necessity just like any other drug.  Companies in places like Illinois must prioritize medical patients over recreational and this puts them in an interesting position as a perceived essential service right now.\n4.  Covid19 is also important because politicians do not have the luxury of fucking around on a new industry worth hundreds of thousands of new jobs, income and taxes.\n\nThey say it is darkest before dawn.

        "body": "look at vega. every percent move up or down in IV the options vega value gets added or subtracted from the value of the option. Theoretically your option could be worth an infinite amount of money because it's just whatever someone is willing to pay for the contract based off of what they believe it could be worth. This is where the implied volatility comes from. It's implied that volatility would have to be x for the contract to be worth the price it is selling at. \n\n\nAt a certain point IV gets so high that just for the contract to actually be worth the cost of by expiration the stock would have to move drastically in your favor, as where if IV were lower it would not have to move as drastically in your favor. Now of course it could move drastically, which most stocks have these past 2 weeks.\n\nIV raises the cost of an option. Obviously, you want to buy low and sell high. Right now IV is pretty damn high. It could and very well may go higher, but it is starting to get ridiculous, so you should be careful. You should be moving in and out and being cognizant that even if you play the underlying correctly you could get burnt by IV falling. \n\nI sold a Unilever 5/15 $62.5c for .55 about 2 and a half weeks ago. Unilever has fallen ~4-5% since i sold that call, but the call HAS GONE UP to .85. Consider that for a second, the underlying stock's price has dropped a good bit, but since volatility is up there is now a significantly better chance that it gets to the $62.5 strike? Now it's entirely possible that would still be a winning trade, but the value just is not there. This is one example to show my point. Keep in mind Unilever had low IV previously. So yes options look sexy right now because everything is moving so violently, but just realize it's priced in to some extent at least, if not overly accounted for. \n\nIn and out. Ride something up and protect your gains. I would not be holding large positions over weekends. Now is not a time to be greedy, opportunity is abundant.",

The Company's Ford F150's are a classic and have been number one sellers for a very long time. Their number one sellers of commercial vans.

Their streamlining their body models from, i believe, over 20 to 6 which will make for more uniform cars but lower costs. Their also doing something to lower warranty costs. Finally their partnering with Rivian and have invested in it. All in all there's things to like.",
