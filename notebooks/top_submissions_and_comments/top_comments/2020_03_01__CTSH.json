Sure, when it was +40C outside, it was hot, but they also had fans and were quite cognizant and monitoring for heat distress. Shit - I've worked outside in that type of heat. Try roofing. Try wildfire. \n\nAll sorts of jobs aren't \"cushy\" - but they certainly aren't a risk to human rights. Obviously, in the developing world, factories/warehouses often don't subscribe to the same standards.",
