        "body": "I read analysts reports from Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley all the time and they\u2019re pretty valuable. You do need to make sure you understand their agenda, and whether they\u2019re a sell-side or buy-side CFA.\n\nThe problem is that many analysts are great at analyzing established industries with years and years of data at their fingertips, but they aren\u2019t benefited with the same advantages when looking at the new kids on the block (FAANG, etc) \u2014 especially companies in intangible goods where their best data outside of corporate confessions will come from alternative data sources provided by iffy sources that companies like Bloomberg and FactSet sell to them (this much insurance was sold on these electronics, making ____ the likeliest amount that they\u2019re selling\u201d). I\u2019m paraphrasing an Economist article here, but it makes sense. Still, they have to have an opinion on the innovating companies, and so they swing away anyway. Check their sources when looking at GOOGL compared to, say, ROST or XOM.\n\nI think WSB is too harsh on analysts sometimes, which I think comes from a twisted spin on loss aversion. You remember when an analyst was wrong far for more than when they were right. For years I\u2019ve trusted reports prepared by CFAs over autists and been happy with the results, but I also am still holding MU bought at 55 and it hurts a lot more than the MCD I bought feels good.\n\nTL;DR Analysts sometimes have agendas, and sometimes are talking out of their asses when it comes to intangible goods-providing companies. But it would be a mistake to still not read their reports and their collected info over the opinions of a 13 year old WSBer in his pajamas who is looking up Step Mom porn while he writes his \u201cDD.\u201d",
