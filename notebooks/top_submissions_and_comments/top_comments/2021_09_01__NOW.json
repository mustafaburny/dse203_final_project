        "body": "Reposting here: you\u2019re missing the point of his bet.\n\nPeople don't see the full idea behind Michael Burry's TSLA short. Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.\n\nHe doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.\n\nLet's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.\n\nIt's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.\n\nSo how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.\n\nBurry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \\~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.\n\nInterest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThe Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).",

I\u2019d \u201cgamble\u201d with maybe 5% on good potential up-and-coming companies in industries that show a strong promise of growth and expansion.\n\nYou have to have an emergency fund. There\u2019s simply no telling what can happen day to day, and risking your livelihood just isn\u2019t an option nowadays. I just got hit by a car 6 weeks ago and am unable to work. Luckily, I had an emergency fund to cover my bills or I would be colossally FUCKED.  $15-20k in cash is not going to make you rich invested over decades. Why risk it? It\u2019s worth more if it\u2019s kept close to insulate you in case of unforeseen circumstances. It simply doesn\u2019t make sense not to. \n\nFidelity, Vanguard, &amp; TD all offer their own (as well as assess to) any and all small return/low risk ishares type shit to park good money in. They\u2019re a great option to have as far as \u201csafe\u201d plays that will mostly keep pace with the markets and still not over leverage you as far as risk. \n\nThe well-established individual stocks will always be a good play so long as you don\u2019t get caught up in every little detail of day-to-day pricing. Anything in the top 20 of the S&amp;P will keep you right on pace with the greater economy, and give you some security and reassurance that you\u2019re getting the most out of your money. \n\nThe \u201cgambling\u201d is what will keep you interested, educated, and give you potentially the most bang for your buck. I\u2019m not talking about YOLO\u2019s into some Foreign penny stock. I\u2019m talking about common-sense plays that\u2019s anyone who doesn\u2019t have their head in the sand. Electric cars. 3D printing. Green Energy. Shit like that. These are budding industries that are obviously going to grow and expand over the next decade. Which companies will rise to the top? Who the fuck knows, but it\u2019s sure as the weather that there\u2019s a garage out there with the next Jobs, Bezos, or Musk out there right now. Why not try to catch it, and learn a little in the process?",

Then I launched my own consulting company - quickly figured out that services work doesn't scale well - pivoted the business to a product startup and used the consulting to finance it.  All told, it took 20 years to get a really big exit - like net of over $200M.  \nThere is no shortcut that I know of - education, skills, experience,  lots of hard work for years and then luck.\nNow I get to do whatever I like, I am typing this from a private jet on the wifi coming back from vacation... I know, wtf. I pinch myself too.\n\n\n2) How can I invest like you?\n\nWell. I have a lot of money so I can make risky bets.  I don't do options though, only stocks. I put $50k into GME on a whim at $65 and sold when it hit $350.  That was a laugh.  \n\nBut seriously, I invest in stocks that I feel like I know. I use HUBS - they are in a great space and really appealing to SMB. I see them as the most viable competitor to Salesforce - go look at Salesforce's market cap. Classic Clayton Christensen - you will be eaten from below.\n\nI am not really much of an investor - just see things that make sense. I bought Amazon at $350 - should have put in more...\n\nI typically invest in tech stocks because I feel like I understand the business.\n\nMy stock account is just my plaything. My real investing is much more structured and done with my wealth advisor at a large brokerage.",

        "body": "In my opinion, on a personal level no, it's probably the greatest thing the average person could do to build wealth. I encourage everyone in my family to do it, and have helped many people learn about investing and about their 401ks. I am maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA this year.\n\nOn a collective level, I think it is. So much of our futures are wrapped up in these accounts, that the way we think and perceive about policy is almost guaranteed to change. It's easy to make a big environmental push like in the 70s when the average person wasn't involved in the stock market, and if they read that Coal Factory Into Water Inc.'s stock fell due to new rules, they'd shrug. Now when the subject of regulating or reigning in big pharma, big energy, big tech, big Telco, big agra, the military industrial complex, etc... comes up, way more people are going to have reservations. \n\nIf these titans of industry and index funds start posting bad years because of changes that objectively help people (like better food and water or safety standards), there will be public resistance to that. As another example, most Americans don't like the idea of outsourcing. But if 3M outsourcing is letting them continue to post big gains year over year, I think these new 401k investors, whose quality of life in retirement depends on market performance, are more willing to look the other way and cross their fingers and hope it's not their job that comes up on the chopping block. Once new 401k investors look at their first 401k calculator and go \"Wow, if I keep putting this percentage and maybe up it a little every year, I'll have like 1.5 MM!\" in their mind, they have the 1.5MM if they scrimp and save. If anything threatens that average 7-10% stock market gain every year, they're willing to change their minds about public policy to get that 1.5MM they feel they were promised. If Amazon factory workers get a new wage floor, their stock might go down, and people might notice and be affected. I think that's overall a bad thing.\n\nOn a conventional macro-economic scale, I think it must have some effect on market liquidity, volatility, interest rates, propensity to invest, overall participation in the stock market, etc... but I don't have a formal education in that area to say with any authority.\n\nBut that's basically just my political opinion, I'm a leftist in /r/investing, so what do I know.",
