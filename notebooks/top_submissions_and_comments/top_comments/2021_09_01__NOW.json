Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.\n\nHe doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.\n\nLet's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.\n\nIt's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.\n\nSo how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.\n\nBurry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \\~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.\n\nInterest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThe Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).",

I\u2019d \u201cgamble\u201d with maybe 5% on good potential up-and-coming companies in industries that show a strong promise of growth and expansion.\n\nYou have to have an emergency fund. There\u2019s simply no telling what can happen day to day, and risking your livelihood just isn\u2019t an option nowadays. I just got hit by a car 6 weeks ago and am unable to work. Luckily, I had an emergency fund to cover my bills or I would be colossally FUCKED.  $15-20k in cash is not going to make you rich invested over decades. Why risk it? It\u2019s worth more if it\u2019s kept close to insulate you in case of unforeseen circumstances. It simply doesn\u2019t make sense not to. \n\nFidelity, Vanguard, &amp; TD all offer their own (as well as assess to) any and all small return/low risk ishares type shit to park good money in. They\u2019re a great option to have as far as \u201csafe\u201d plays that will mostly keep pace with the markets and still not over leverage you as far as risk. \n\nThe well-established individual stocks will always be a good play so long as you don\u2019t get caught up in every little detail of day-to-day pricing. Anything in the top 20 of the S&amp;P will keep you right on pace with the greater economy, and give you some security and reassurance that you\u2019re getting the most out of your money. \n\nThe \u201cgambling\u201d is what will keep you interested, educated, and give you potentially the most bang for your buck. I\u2019m not talking about YOLO\u2019s into some Foreign penny stock. I\u2019m talking about common-sense plays that\u2019s anyone who doesn\u2019t have their head in the sand. Electric cars. 3D printing. Green Energy. Shit like that. These are budding industries that are obviously going to grow and expand over the next decade. Which companies will rise to the top? Who the fuck knows, but it\u2019s sure as the weather that there\u2019s a garage out there with the next Jobs, Bezos, or Musk out there right now. Why not try to catch it, and learn a little in the process?",

Then I launched my own consulting company - quickly figured out that services work doesn't scale well - pivoted the business to a product startup and used the consulting to finance it.  All told, it took 20 years to get a really big exit - like net of over $200M.  \nThere is no shortcut that I know of - education, skills, experience,  lots of hard work for years and then luck.\nNow I get to do whatever I like, I am typing this from a private jet on the wifi coming back from vacation... I know, wtf. I pinch myself too.\n\n\n2) How can I invest like you?\n\nWell. I have a lot of money so I can make risky bets.  I don't do options though, only stocks. I put $50k into GME on a whim at $65 and sold when it hit $350.  That was a laugh.  \n\nBut seriously, I invest in stocks that I feel like I know. I use HUBS - they are in a great space and really appealing to SMB. I see them as the most viable competitor to Salesforce - go look at Salesforce's market cap. Classic Clayton Christensen - you will be eaten from below.\n\nI am not really much of an investor - just see things that make sense. I bought Amazon at $350 - should have put in more...\n\nI typically invest in tech stocks because I feel like I understand the business.\n\nMy stock account is just my plaything. My real investing is much more structured and done with my wealth advisor at a large brokerage.",

        "body": "Great article on Evergrande written by former hedge fund manager Marc Rubinstein here:\nhttps://www.netinterest.co/p/ever-grande\n\nChina is a country full of paradoxes and one of them sits at the heart of the residential real estate market where Evergrande operates. Lest you forget, China is a communist state, and all land is owned by the state. In order to solve a funding problem, early reformers came up with a fudge. Zhao Ziyang, a former premier, describes in his memoir how he was introduced to the idea of selling land to raise funds:\n\n&gt; It was perhaps 1985 or 1986 when I talked to Huo Yingdong [a Hong Kong tycoon better known as Henry Fok] and mentioned that we didn\u2019t have funds for urban development. He asked me, \u201cIf you have land, how can you not have money?\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought this was a strange comment. Having land was one issue; a lack of funds was another. What did the two have to do with one another? He said, \u201cIf municipalities have land, they should get permission to lease some of it, bring in some income, and let other people develop the land.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed, I had noticed how in Hong Kong buildings and streets were constructed quickly. A place could be quickly transformed. But for us it was very difficult.\n\nIn 1988, the government changed the constitution to allow rights to use land \u2013 not to own, to use \u2013 to be bought and sold under long term leases. Residential use typically comes with a seventy year lease; commercial use with fifty years. No-one really expects land to revert to the government after that time, but the fudge serves a purpose. In the seven years between 2009 and 2015, the Chinese government collected 22 trillion yuan from selling land. By privatising this state asset, the government has been able to fund massive infrastructure investment on a scale that the taxpayer wouldn\u2019t have been able to bear. \n\nThe constitutional change paved the way for a commercial market to take root around residential property. But the real turning point came later, in 1998. At the time, most city dwellers lived in housing provided by their state employer. The problem was that state employers lacked the motivation and resources to build housing on sufficient scale. In 1998, the government introduced urban housing reforms that removed the obligation of employers to provide housing. People were encouraged to buy their homes from their employers, who sold them at heavily discounted prices. A massive transfer of wealth took place between the state and its people. That transfer of wealth seeded the growth in the residential housing market as homeowners reinvested their gains back in the market by buying bigger and better homes. \n\nThe investment thesis was simple: China was urbanising fast and that drove an insatiable demand for residential real estate. Developers could buy land from local government and turn it into aspirational accommodation at 25% margins. Back in my hotel room I would fire up my laptop and plug in values for the inventory of land and unsold homes sitting on developers\u2019 balance sheets to gauge what their stock was worth. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the market to get frothy. Demand for housing came not just for its utility but also for its investment features. Interest rates were kept exceptionally low and easy money boosted investment demand for housing. Since 2002, housing prices in China\u2019s tier 1 cities, like the ones I visited, have risen more than six-fold (which compares with an 80% overall national increase in US housing prices between 2000 and 2005). With the market this frothy, analysts began plugging into their laptops the value of land developers hadn\u2019t even acquired yet, but might. \n\nIt was into that environment that Evergrande was listed, at the end of 2009. It was the biggest residential real estate developer of them all. At the end of the year, it had a total land reserve of 55 million square metres, giving it years of runway compared with the 5.6 million square metres of gross floor area (GFA) it sold that year. The company\u2019s strategy was built around scale, affordability, turnover and brand. It adopted a standardised approach to its operating procedures. One of the bankers on the deal called Evergrande the McDonald\u2019s of the Chinese residential property market. Its stock was 46 times oversubscribed in the retail tranche and it popped 34% on its first day of trading. \n\nThe IPO also helped Evergrande clean up its balance sheet. In the years prior to IPO it had operated with very high levels of debt relative to equity. Following its IPO, it sat on a net cash position.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t to last. The company immediately geared up and started to expand in a literal land grab. The year after IPO, it grew its land bank by 75%, investing in a pipeline of developments across 62 cities, up from 25 the previous year. It took scale to a new level, building mini-cities rather than just apartment blocks that could accommodate as many as 65,000 people on a single site. The company raised cash from pre-sales, signing up prospective buyers years before completion. And it also raised debt: net gearing (net debt as a percentage of shareholders\u2019 equity) rose to 52% in the year after IPO.\n\nA couple of years later the company attracted the attention of short sellers at Citron Research, the team that would later give up short selling in the aftermath of the GameStop affair. They highlighted the risks creeping into Evergrande\u2019s balance sheet. The company had grown its assets five times faster than peers in the past five years and was burning cash. Citron\u2019s report made a number of other accusations about the company and its chairman, and Andrew Left, Citron\u2019s founder, was eventually fined for market manipulation on the basis his report had been somewhere between negligent and reckless. But he was right about one thing: Evergrande was burning cash. \n\nIn the ten years leading up to 2020, Evergrande has overseen RMB230 billion in cash outflows from operations. Its net debt currently stands at RMB536 billion, reflecting a 153% net gearing ratio. Excluding the revaluation of investment properties, that ratio is over 170%. Add in large accounts payable obligations (RMB829 billion) and the company\u2019s liabilities are even larger. Much of this debt has been channeled into land acquisitions; the company now owns 231 million square metres of land across 234 cities (equivalent to four Manhattans). Over the past few years the company has been funding at rates of 8-11% via dollar-denominated bonds, but even these bonds were trading at higher yields before the recent bond price collapse.  \n\nOver the years, the government has intervened numerous times to influence the residential real estate market in China. Using tax, mortgage rates, mortgage quotas, controls on secondary market listing prices and other tools, it has attempted to steer the residential property market between boom and bust. More recently it imposed some \u2018red lines\u2019 on property developers that require them to control their debt levels. Evergrande remains firmly in the \u2018red group\u2019. 1\n\nSome people liken Evergrande to a giant pyramid scheme. There are periods in the cycle where real estate isn\u2019t a cash flow business, it\u2019s an asset appreciation business. As long as debt can be serviced, that can work, but problems emerge when it can\u2019t. To address this, Evergrande has pursued two strategies.\n\nFirst, it diversified into other businesses. It\u2019s had a football team since 2010 which has gained success under coaches Marcello Lippi and Luiz Felipe Scolari. It operates theme parks, is involved in grain, dairy and mineral water businesses and has a cultural entertainment division. Its electric vehicle business is now worth $26 billion (down from $93 billion in April).\n\nSecond, Evergrande has made itself too big to fail \u2013 literally ever grande. Real estate investment is a very important driver of the overall Chinese economy. It has grown from a 5% share of GDP in 1995 to over 13% in 2019, of which over 70% is residential. Incorporating industries downstream and upstream of real estate, the sector makes up 29% of Chinese GDP (comparable internationally only to pre-crisis Spain and Ireland). \n\nBanks are particularly co-joined. Real estate loans make up around 28% of their loans and 40% of new loans. As a robust source of collateral, banks have an incentive to extend more loans to firms with land holdings. Incentives are similarly skewed in local government, where construction activity represents measurable economic output against which officials are assessed. Zhao\u2019s economic realisation still drives local government budgets today. \n\nBecause it\u2019s too big to fail, Evergrande\u2019s demise may be less a product of its financial position and more its political position. Recently, China\u2019s financial regulator instructed banks to conduct a stress test around an Evergrande failure so the endgame could be getting close. How they choose to allocate losses will determine whether Evergrande bonds bleed out of the canary screen and onto the main screen.",

They are dollars instead of coins now. \n\n1. Keep buying if you are able. Sell nothing if possible. \n\n2. Delete your trading apps and start using finviz or some other portfolio tracker. Even then, try to limit your check ins to one Day a week or less. It helps with the anxiety. \n\n3. Take up a strenuous, time consuming hobby like Kayaking or some such.

Evergrande borrows money from investors and entities and pre-sells apartment units to people who want cheap apartments to live in or flip later. Evergrande uses money to lease more land and finish some of the buildings. Evergrande decides to floor the gas pedal and all is fantastic for a while. Sometime last year, China says that Evergrande can't use the unit presale money to lease more land and puts limits on how much it can keep borrowing. Evergrande decides to pre-sell new units cheaper to keep money coming. People wake up and decide that this is fucked up and decide that they wanna cash out on their investment and new people stop buying, driving prices further down. Now nobody wants Evergrande stuff and Evergrande can't finish its projects or repay anything. People are currently speculating about how much EG owes to whom and how bad it will be for the rest of the world. That's how my ape brain understood it.",

I encourage everyone in my family to do it, and have helped many people learn about investing and about their 401ks. I am maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA this year.\n\nOn a collective level, I think it is. So much of our futures are wrapped up in these accounts, that the way we think and perceive about policy is almost guaranteed to change. It's easy to make a big environmental push like in the 70s when the average person wasn't involved in the stock market, and if they read that Coal Factory Into Water Inc.'s stock fell due to new rules, they'd shrug. Now when the subject of regulating or reigning in big pharma, big energy, big tech, big Telco, big agra, the military industrial complex, etc... comes up, way more people are going to have reservations. \n\nIf these titans of industry and index funds start posting bad years because of changes that objectively help people (like better food and water or safety standards), there will be public resistance to that. As another example, most Americans don't like the idea of outsourcing. But if 3M outsourcing is letting them continue to post big gains year over year, I think these new 401k investors, whose quality of life in retirement depends on market performance, are more willing to look the other way and cross their fingers and hope it's not their job that comes up on the chopping block. Once new 401k investors look at their first 401k calculator and go \"Wow, if I keep putting this percentage and maybe up it a little every year, I'll have like 1.5 MM!\" in their mind, they have the 1.5MM if they scrimp and save. If anything threatens that average 7-10% stock market gain every year, they're willing to change their minds about public policy to get that 1.5MM they feel they were promised. If Amazon factory workers get a new wage floor, their stock might go down, and people might notice and be affected. I think that's overall a bad thing.\n\nOn a conventional macro-economic scale, I think it must have some effect on market liquidity, volatility, interest rates, propensity to invest, overall participation in the stock market, etc... but I don't have a formal education in that area to say with any authority.\n\nBut that's basically just my political opinion, I'm a leftist in /r/investing, so what do I know.",
