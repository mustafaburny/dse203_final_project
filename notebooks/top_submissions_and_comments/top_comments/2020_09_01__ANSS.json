Zoom had insane revenue and their billing is provided by $Zuo.  $crm crushing earnings + $zm crushing earnings = $zuo crushing earnings is my theory.\n\nZuo earnings tomorrow after market close and stock up 13% today and 5% after hours so might be too late to buy calls, maybe long dated calls out. If you want to buy in I think buying stock almost 100% makes you some money..",

        "body": "So this is the theoretical explanation. Basically the IV increased so much to overwhelm any loss of delta, which is quite a big move in itself. So essentially a ton of people bought a ton of upside calls today could account for this massive IV increase. \n\nHowever, from a trading perspective this seems super exploitable. Essentially here's what it's implying. \n\nIt's saying Yesterday there was an X % chance for Tesla to be &gt; 800 (or pick any other upside strike) by September 18. Now Today, despite Tesla going down 4-5% at this current point, there is still an X % chance or even &gt; X% chance for Tesla to be &gt; 800 by September 18. That's insane!\n\nDespite 1 day passing by and a 4-5% drop in stock, the probability, according to MM, didn't change or even increased at certain points in the day! And it's not like there's that many days until September 18 anyways.\n\nI feel like this isn't a supply/demand issue. I think actually it's possible this market got broken due to outsized, black swan moves from stocks like CRM, ZM and DOCU who didn't even have an earnings yet that MM are so pressed to selling vol they jacked up everything arbitrarily across all names, which includes Tesla and CRM but should include others, which I haven't delved into.",

So we keep on offering at higher and higher levels (and retail keeps on buying) which is nuts.\n\nBecause the big tech stocks make up a huge portion on the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY), we can get a little hedge on buy bidding up calls in the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY). Because we are bidding up calls, we are now impacting VIX.\n\nThis is the only explanation I have for you.

I would bet that a senior trader/partner has taken over these names (TSLA AAPL CRM FB GOOG etc) to make sure that the firm doesn't get clobbered too much.\n\nWe all know to respect the markets, but at some level the 'madness' has to end. Of course, nobody knows when that will happen. Notwithstanding, the 'edge' you get selling at x+y+z volatility is more than you got at x+y which is more than what you got at x. You may be wrong at the x and x+y levels, but at the x+y+z level you made up for your losses (from x and X+y) and then some. Thus, the snowball effect of implied volatility becoming actual volatility might be true at the x and x+y level and overstated at the x+y+z level. (There has to be some edge selling options because you need a balance sheet selling options versus buying options).\n\nSo I do agree with what you are saying that the implieds will eventually be overstating what is happening with actual volatility. Unfortunately, nobody knows what level this will be. Thus, selling vol in small pieces at higher and higher levels is probably the safest way of doing this (and this is probably what the market makers are doing). You should have enough edge that you can scratch a trade if it doesn't feel right...",

        "body": "My top performers are: AAPL, FB, MSFT, MU, ACA, VWSYF, CTXS, TRN, MRVL, INO, CSCO, DOX, SNY, ABB. All with total gains over 40%. Those are *not* my recommendations, just my top performing holdings.\n\nI'm self taught and ignorant about a lot, but try to learn. But I do have an investing philosophy. One of the big investing mistakes I think we all make is believing that how things are now is how they will always be, so I try to buy for a better future. And along with fundamentals I buy what I believe in, and what I've seen and used.\n\nI do socially responsible self-directed investing. So I try not to buy anything that makes money directly from fossil fuels, war, harming people or animals,, prisons, poor treatment of immigrants, refugees, or asylum seekers, or, predatory financial industries, or any other industries that cause people, animals, or the environment harm. I think there's a fair argument to make that I'm breaking this rule to include tech companies like Facebook and some biotech, so that's my failure to work on. But my investments since the early 2000s have beat all the markets, and all the funds, just by choosing to have principles and trying to invest in companies that do good.\n\nI also own other green energy, tech, grocery, railroads, data/commercial real estate, biotech. In the early 2000s I bought the companies that have become big tech, right now I'm buying transportation, biotech, 5G, AR, VR, and green energy companies along with companies I think will do well during the upcoming COVID-19 repeat. Despite the awful world we live in, I believe a better future is possible.",
