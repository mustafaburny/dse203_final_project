Their customers are getting tired of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't invest in Intel but one thing that's very important to keep in mind is what Intel excels at is support. When you buy Intel hardware for your server farm they are there to help you at every step with whatever problem you encounter. AMD's support is substantially poorer. One of the reasons Intel has stuck around, and will probably continue to stick around, is they offer top-tier support. That's not important for the individual intel processor buyer, but it's a big deal for people building super computers, server farms, etc. A real deal-clincher.",

Intel's CPU designs are fine. The issue is manufacturing. Intel quite literally doesn't have the physical ability to manufacture their own designs (and have been forced to purposefully nerf their own designs, in order to use the crappy last-resort manufacturing space they can obtain).\n\nThat's because Intel traditionally did their own manufacturing (having \"fabs\" -fabrication center-, as its known in the industry). An intel CEO about 20 years ago famously said \"Real men have fabs\", in reference to being the only chip designer that also manufactured their own chips. The problem is that Intel severely underestimated just how much money and resources it would take to maintain their fab game on the same level as TSMC. Taiwain Semiconductor has been pumping literally **hundreds of billions** of dollars into not just new fab centers, but fab research itself. The fact is that TSMC can manufacture at such insanely small scales that Intel just can't compete because their own fab science just isn't as advanced as TSMC. Taiwain Semi is currently fabbing down to 3 nanometers. Intel was struggling to hit 10nm last year.\n\nIntel's designs are fine CPUs.

Only US-domiciled major player with any relevance\n\nTrades cheap due to bad industry reputation for cyclicality and commoditization (for example, everyone has read Andy grove\u2019s book trashing memory at intel decades ago) so high implied returns available from scaling the position up and down over time if you learn to understand the swings of the cycle \n\nExcess returns for companies in this sector are able to be generated by the leading edge player.  The leading edge player captures a premium pricing from end-users while the capability is scarce and then others attempt to replicate and catch up with the capability. Micron management has been able to improve its competitive R&amp;D position so it is more likely to be the leading edge player going forward\n\nHardware is unpopular relative to software business models because its capital intensive and high barrier to entry.   No need to worry that venture capitalists will fund a new entrant to the industry. It\u2019s just not exciting to them for fundraising purposes.",

AMD is yielding off of old Keller designs and nvidia has cuda for crypto / etc., but neither of those are moats\n\nHere's a list of all the semicounductor fabs in the world: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_semiconductor\\_fabrication\\_plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)\n\nMost of them fucking suck in terms of density, because, most things aren't iPhones and don't need cutting edge nodes (cough cars cough cough).\n\nBut, if you'll notice, intel isn't *that* far behind. In fact, they're among the closest to taiwan semi, and we get into niche things like 7nm not really being 7nm (it's more about transistor density, where intel 10 is close to taiwan 7, etc.)\n\nAnd in terms of durable competitive advantage - chip fabs are like nuclear reactors, highly capital intensive, highly complicated, hard to run == giant moat.\n\nFor value investors, you buy from pessimists, and intel pessimists follow jimmy crames saying they don't have 7nm, while Pat is investing 20 billion in new fabs building out that moat. Even if they fab crappier chips there's a shortage, companies that need chips (like fucking everything) will buy from intel if it's attractive. Also USA national interest won't let intel go under, especially with the alternative consolidating into taiwan  \nThat's not to mention the top line consumer initiatives like their new GPU line and continuing processor line, which could adapt to RISC-V / ARM if needed (they have the cash flow for R&amp;D to do it).",

What, is Apple going to abandon its long term plans and switch back to Intel? Suddenly decide to start using Exynos Samsung silicon instead? AMD likely wouldn't contract Intel to fab its processors. Even if they could and wanted to, Intel can't just magic up new fabs overnight - they're already investing and building new facilities but it'll take years to come fully online.",
