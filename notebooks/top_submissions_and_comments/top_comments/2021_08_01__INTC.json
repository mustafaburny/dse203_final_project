Who has the option to leave?  The best people.\n\nThis threat after a layoff that hit 11% of Intel's workforce.  They did this layoff under dumb rules too that impacted a lot of the most senior/smartest/skilled people.\n\nI'm in a development group.  Who did they layoff?  Anyone with a ding on their record.  To someone in HR or Finance this seems like a good call - you got an imperfect annual review? Laid off...   Anyone in cutting edge development knows that the worst (most useless) people can have spotless records and the people doing the work (see innovating) will break a wafer or two.  A senior engineer is also held to a higher standard so their reviews are more critical of their performance.\n\nI came in to work on a Monday and security was escorting a critically important engineer off campus.  His boss had refused to lay him off because his boss was an engineer too.  He begged HR to keep him.  They didn't.  That set development back 6 months as the team tried to regroup.  Me and a few others had to pick up where this guy left.  Literally sifting through hand written notes in a notebook.\n\nWe literally missed a chip deployment because of that layoff.\n\nCouple that with a BIZARRE hiring environment that sets merit way WAY down on the list of priorities for a new hire.

The meme stocks of the day, Nvidia, AMD - they just *design chips*, but do not manufacture them, so they're all contracting out to fabs (which hurt margins), the cutting edge of today being taiwan semi. AMD is yielding off of old Keller designs and nvidia has cuda for crypto / etc., but neither of those are moats\n\nHere's a list of all the semicounductor fabs in the world: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_semiconductor\\_fabrication\\_plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)\n\nMost of them fucking suck in terms of density, because, most things aren't iPhones and don't need cutting edge nodes (cough cars cough cough).\n\nBut, if you'll notice, intel isn't *that* far behind. In fact, they're among the closest to taiwan semi, and we get into niche things like 7nm not really being 7nm (it's more about transistor density, where intel 10 is close to taiwan 7, etc.)\n\nAnd in terms of durable competitive advantage - chip fabs are like nuclear reactors, highly capital intensive, highly complicated, hard to run == giant moat.\n\nFor value investors, you buy from pessimists, and intel pessimists follow jimmy crames saying they don't have 7nm, while Pat is investing 20 billion in new fabs building out that moat. Even if they fab crappier chips there's a shortage, companies that need chips (like fucking everything) will buy from intel if it's attractive. Also USA national interest won't let intel go under, especially with the alternative consolidating into taiwan  \nThat's not to mention the top line consumer initiatives like their new GPU line and continuing processor line, which could adapt to RISC-V / ARM if needed (they have the cash flow for R&amp;D to do it).",

The 12900k is apparently outperforming even the 5950X by as much as 25% in some benchmarks. And the release also means Intel will be first to market with PCIe 5 and DDR5 compatibility. \n\n\nThen the GPU launch to break the current duopoly could open up a new, extraordinary lucrative segment for Intel. And rumors there are that the top Intel GPU will be a 3070 level which IMO is very good for their first round of discreet GPUs. \n\n\nThe thing is that\u2019s all rumors and leaks. And Intel is (with good reason) associated with failing to deliver. Hopefully with the new CEO and some renewed vigor after being humbled by AMD/Nvidia recently, Intel will execute the next 6-12 months well. If so I think there will be a huge sentiment change on INTC. And of course long term, their own manufacturing is the true value. Somebody needs to step up to challenge TSMC.",

Imagine that this has the added bonus of dividends to investors, despite being publicly traded for less than a month.\n* [Modest capex spend in their S-1; immediate FCF generation](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021013318/1?cik=1783879&amp;hl=1029918:1029933&amp;hl_id=4yjqwnqyi) - capital light business that is shitting free cash flow L2Y. Help me understand why RH is such a shit investment again?\n\n* Cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, and other logical fallacies that /r/investing and /r/stocks are ***ridiculously*** susceptible to (me speculating here) - most $HOOD bears arrive at their thesis from extrapolating personal experience over RH's entire user base\n * e.g. - reddit incorrectly assumes the RH the user base consists of day traders looking to profit off of short term price movements that are based off of what the billions of other public capital market participants are going to do in the immediate term.....rather than making buy/sell decisions based off of firm-specific and macro fundamentals. \n * The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of investors see brokerages as offering a commoditized service where you're offering the same service at the lowest cost. **The smart money** sees RH for what it is: a brokerage that charges me $0 in fees and is awarding me free yield. Why tf would I trade away additional return in the form of lower fees relative to what another brokerage would charge me? \n\nSo, again, I'm open to hearing a rational bear case on RH or any sort of pervasive, idiosyncratic risk associated with the ticker that isn't being properly reflect in the current share price.",

        "body": "I'm a pretty big computer hardware enthusiast.\n\nI'm putting my money on Intel right now.\n\nAMD is coming off a brilliant 5 years with breakthrough CPUs every generation and have recently recovered ground in the GPU space as well. They are running on a high, and their P/E ratio shows it.\n\nIntel has struggled to get good products to market recently. Their laptop offerings have been decent, but margin on laptop CPUs is nothing like the retail desktop CPU margins that AMD is feeding on. Intel's desktop offerings have been very uninspiring, still being on 14nm for it's flagship offerings.\n\nI see Intel turning this around starting late Q4 2021 or early Q1 2022. They have products on the horizon like Alder Lake that are a huge departure from current CPU designs, much more akin to how many ARM CPUs work, with heterogenous cores (also known as big.LITTLE architecture). So they have a new core design (Golden Cove, which is sort of new, as it's used in current Rocket Lake CPUs, and Gracemount, which is their new high efficiency cores, similar  to the older intel Atom CPUs). Alder Lake is also the first mainstream desktop line to finally run on Intel's 10nm process, which despite the naming, is even denser than TSMC's 7nm process that AMD currently uses. Preliminary benchmark leaks show Alder Lake with quite incredible single core and very competitive multicore performance compared to AMD. \n\nIntel also has follow on product lines in Raptor Lake (which is an expected optimization of Alder Lake) as well as Meteor Lake, which should be a major node shrink and new core design.\n\nOn top of all of this, Intel is also just about to bring it's new Xe graphics architecture into a consumer dedicated graphics card product, the first ever for Intel. Preliminary benchmark leaks suggest that this will arrive with their high end card being very competitive with mid-high level AMD and Nvidia cards. Given the current shortages of GPUs, a performance competitive card is basically guaranteed to be a money maker.\n\nCouple this with the fact that Intel is currently in the process of a major expansion of their semiconductor fab factories. They are going to the prime beneficiary of the US government's new focus on expanding domestic semiconductor production. Intel is in the preliminary stages of possibly purchasing Global Foundries, the other major American semi-conductor contract foundry (which was actually spun off AMD at one point). Intel has indicated they are looking to expand their business as a 3rd party manufacturer of semi-conductor chips, which is a HUGE business right now, with many companies bidding record amounts to secure contracts on production capacity.\n\nIntel is currently undervalued. It's an established company many decades old, with dominant market share in the server and consumer PC space, very large company that is well positioned to capitalize on many of the market situations in semi-conductors and technology.\n\nThey are also trading at about a P/E ratio of 12, which is not only an excellent ratio for a technology company, it's an excellent ratio for a company in any space. Their competitors are trading at P/E ratios between 30 and 100. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Intel is likely at a low based on their recent products, but may be on the uptick now and are well placed to benefit from current tech trends. I think now is the time to buy and hold them for the mid-long term. I'm buying right now with the expectation that their stock price could be at $150 by late 2023. \n\nThank you for listening to my Ted Talk.",

        "body": "I have mixed feeling on selling prior to earnings. Beucase of exactly what happened. If youre buying weekly options then yeah, youre playing with fire holding options through earnings. But if you have options contracts that has a lot of time left after the earnings call then you have time to recover. If your options contracts has months left until expiration then holding through earnings is not going to hurt you too bad. I bought calls on AMD at the end of June and they were down 50-80% leading up to earnings. I have been slowly (maybe prematurely) selling my calls all for profits of 150-300%. My calls expired in September, November, and December. I like to stagger mine. \n\nWith that being said, I think people grossly missunderstood the position AMD is in. The signs were all there. Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely.",

So for example the glass screen, it's made by Corning, the same company that makes Gorilla Glass, which really developed on the Pentagon's budget to make super durable glass for the military, point being this is an extremely secure technology that the Pentagon has a vested interest in not letting others have access to. And this puts into perspective the fight for independent statehood of Taiwan \\[1\\], which hosts/controls TSMC, pretty much the only fab company other than Intel making competitive chips. China's chip fab capabilities are usually on the magnitude of 28nm down to around 10-14nm, where the state of the art in the US/Taiwan/Israel/other US satellites are now at 3nm. \n\nAnother example is Boeing (US) and Airbus (France), and how China is completely dependent on these two companies for their airline industry. The technology in commercial airplanes is so great that it took China/Russia decades to kind of - maybe build unreliable competitors, and the US / France (US satellite) isn't going to just let that tech slip for free. Again my point being, Nike can be replaced, but the high tech industry can't be so easily.\n\n\\[1\\] https://thediplomat.com/2020/12/taiwan-chips-and-geopolitics-part-1/",
