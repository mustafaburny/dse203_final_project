What do you do when Musk randomly tweets out his stocks too high and it loses 10% - who predicts that???!? You may win big but you will also lose big. 78% of day traders lose money over the long term which is probably very similar to gambling addicts. \n\nDCA stands for dollar cost averaging. Basically what it means is just buying small amounts of a stock at regular intervals. This allows you to on average get a good price for the stock. It's been shown that trying to time the bottom of the market is basically impossibly difficult so don't even try, you'll lose more money than you gain. So let's say you've got 1k to invest a month, just out that in every month. Don't save it all up waiting for the bottom of the market.\n\nBasically don't try and be a smart ass and just invest for the long term. The 200iq boys on wall street with their AI and trading algorithms don't consistently predict the market so what chance have you got? One of the keys to being smart is to realise when you're not that smart and plan accordingly. That's what dca does.\n\nHope that helps.",

Giving up control is against the interest of businesses, so I don't see it going anywhere big other than the occasional hype. Signing datafiles with company or personal encryptions keys is all you need, and thats been around for a long time, and still barely used as much as it could.\n\nI've used bitcoin before it became popular (yes really, you had the menu option to get new coins in the original client).

Apple and Nvidia seems to be slowing down now waiting for competitors to catch up but they were going ham on generational improvements. We will soon see what Nvidia has up their sleeve with Ampere as AMD starts catching up on the GPU front as well. AMD single handily put a fire in both the CPU and GPU industries previously dominated by Intel and Nvidia, and now they are starting to haul ass. I wouldn\u2019t count out Intel yet because yesterday\u2019s announcement was the first competitive move that Intel has done in a long time. Yes it lowers their margins, but this move to drastically lower price and enable previously locked features like hyper-thread on their lower end chips will definitely help to take back some of the market share from AMD.

        "body": "Which is more or less my point... if the \"P/E is low because the potential for growth is low\" then everyone is already assuming Intel's not doing a great job. And if that's the case shorting it now may lead nowhere.\n\nWe're not talking about NVDA with a P/E of 60+ or AMD with a P/E of 100+. Those are priced for perfection. We're talking about a company that had a great lead for a long time and is now selling at 11 times earnings. Sure, the earnings may drop, but will the price drop accordingly? Or will it just adjust to a slightly higher P/E? Look at JNJ, for instance, it has a P/E of 23 right now.\n\nI think we all agree that Intel is not going to disappear (as a company). Their prices will have to come down given their current position with respect to competitors, but they will adjust and survive. And if the price drops some 20 or 30% (which would give you a decent gain if you're shorting it) it just starts making sense to buy it for the dividend and the low P/E for a decent blue chip.\n\nSo, I'm by no means telling you you shouldn't short it. Go ahead, I'll be happy to be proven wrong. I just think it's not as clear cut a case for shorting than say ZM.",
