The other thing is that the banking system there is an oligopoly, so I don\u2019t run into regional banks, and unfortunately can\u2019t help you there.  I think with wholesale vs retail, especially if you\u2019re dealing with smaller banks, you have to be cognizant that wholesaled can be a much flightier source of capital if there\u2019s a crisis of confidence. I would make sure you understand average deposits/ broker, you don\u2019t want one broker controlling $100s of MM. \n\nOne thing to also focus on is % of revenue that comes from fees - you have some banks in my geography where 60% of the revenues come from account and credit card fees, which is hugely advantageous as you aren\u2019t exposed to rates. Then you\u2019re almost a tolling business, not a bank. Not sure if that helps considering how oligopolistic my universe is, but that\u2019s my $0.02!",

As for REGI, I invested a couple years ago and since then they have shot up during the lockdowns. I think it's fairly valued finally, but if you want to buy in I wouldn't discourage you. They have so many positive catalysts going for them right now. With higher RIN prices, rejections of oil refinery exemptions from the renewable fuel standard, price target increases, Blender's Tax credits through 2022 and a future renewable diesel plant TBA, I'm still very bullish on this stock long term. Not to mention they could beat earnings in Q3. As for ENPH, I've been doing research on the company and its fundamentals before I invest in them. From what I've learned, the company seems to be rising due to recent analyst upgrades along with positive sentiment for renewables in general. I'd say that long term, clean energy is a great investment and you won't regret buying in even at it's high valuation. My advice, I'd look more towards a mix of clean energy stocks in ICLN or TAN, which will give you exposure to solar stocks broadly.",

The course I went through helped with that and may be most people don't necessarily have the issues that I ran into using these courses.

It's from ZipTrader. You can get 70% of the information from his youtube channel. But, I wanted something more structured and he really goes in a lot more detail in the course. I highly recommend it.

That's a mindset that will likely lead to financial ruin.\n\nThis is Reddit.\n\nAs such, be prepared for people looking to sell you on stocks that might just be trash just as much as they might just be diamonds. Bias abounds as people post about the stocks THEY are invested in, meaning they are basically selling others on something to help THEIR cause. Can everyone benefit? Sure, but everyone can also get fucked over.\n\nRule #1 of r/pennystocks (or trading in general)\n\nSTUDY, RESEARCH, PLAN, PRACTICE.\n\nNever take another's word for ANYTHING. Verify yourself.\n\nIf you want to be consistently successful you kind of have to treat this as a job, not a hobby.\n\nMy #1 tip?  Don't fall in love with a stock. I know this, I breathe this, and I STILL fall in love with stocks. It happens, but it is insanely dangerous.\n\nAlso, get rid of Robinhood unless you are keeping it really low key and just practicing. Robinhood is for newbies wanting to casually phone trade. A good portion of stocks mentioned on here are OTC's which you can't trade on Robinhood because they are riskier due to less oversight. Get a real broker that offers real services and better coverage for all aspects of trading. I'm talking Schwab, or TDA, or Fidelity or other such brokers. And don't let anyone tell you Webull is a real broker. It's better than Robinhood but comes with the same drawbacks.",

Consider that:\n\n\u2022 Through the end of 2019, Berkshire Hathaway, run by one of the worlds best investors ever, has appreciated at the rate of 20.3% per year.\n\n\u2022 Fidelity Magellan Fund under Peter Lynch is widely acknowledged as being the best performing mutual fund ever, and its record under his leadership was 29.2% annually.\n\n\u2022 The 30 years since him have not been as kind, and Magellan's average performance through October 2019 had fallen to 15.74% annually.\n\nSo we've got Peter Lynch doing 29.3%. You've got Warren Buffett doing 20%. And you're coming into this expecting to do 17-30%? \n\nYou need to temper your expectations. Your performance year to date sounds fine, a little ahead of the market and a lot ahead of a lot of actively managed equity funds. \n\nKeeping doing that, and keeping doing that through different market cycles will be an achievement on its own. You might be feeling discouraged because your efforts have yielded very little in real dollar terms - I get that, but again have to remind you that you're at the beginning of your investing career, and have many decades ahead of you. As you work and are able to add more and more money to your investing accounts, you'll see greater rewards. But you have to start somewhere, and truthfully, that you're even investing at your age puts you miles ahead of your peers.\n\nI would only say cheer up, enjoy the ride, and know that it will get a whole lot more exciting as you are able to add more and more money to your accounts. Learning now and making mistakes now, though, is probably the best thing you can do, rather than waiting til you have $50,000, $100,000, $500,000 in the market.\n\nGood job!",

Some people complain that they can\u2019t get to the level they want so they change brokerages. \n\nIn my experience Tastyworks is the most liberal in giving out option permissions and I think they are a little cheaper.\n\nI trade with TW, TDA and Fidelity. I trade Roth accounts and cash accounts. \n\nThe Roth and IRA accounts have limited trading permissions but I\u2019m ok with that. You can\u2019t have margin you can\u2019t sell naked calls. \n\nYou want to be able to trade ...\n\nCash secured puts\nCovered calls\nSingle leg calls/puts\nAnd importantly call/put spreads\n\nIf you BUY an option, that is your max loss. \n\nIf you SELL an option, that is your max gain. \n\nI strongly suggest that you take advantage of TOS paper trading. It\u2019s free. Practice trading options for months. For free. No risk. You can practice all the strategies and most importantly learn to manage a trade. \n\nYou will need to roll a trade out in time to give yourself more time to be right. You can also roll a trade out and up/down. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to teach you how to trade, but option trading requires management. It is as important to manage winners as well as losers. \n\nMonths ago I bought SNAP at $19.8x and sold a $20 covered call for $1. That is 5%. Not bad for a month. \n\nI\u2019ve rolled it out and up so I now have a $25 covered call. I\u2019m still ITM but the point is that it\u2019s never only one trade. And the trade isn\u2019t over. \n\nAm I an expert - no. But just realize that options trading is not one and done. It\u2019s not. \n\nAnd it is a sum zero game. Your lose is my gain.

Some mutual funds, but not all, have initial and/or ongoing minimums required for purchase (example: Vanguard's VTSAX requires $3,000 for initial, $1 for any purchases after that; Fidelity and Schwab are generally only $1 for both initial and continuing).\n\nETFs at most brokerages must be traded as whole shares. A few places are now allowing fractional ETF trading though (Fidelity, M1, Robinhood to name a few).\n\nETFs and mutual funds have some important differences like how they trade and in most cases, tax efficiency (if you'll be holding outside tax advantaged accounts).",

It's from ZipTrader. You can get 70% of the information from his youtube channel. But, I wanted something more structured and he really goes in a lot more detail in the course. I highly recommend it.

I trade Roth accounts and cash accounts. \n\nThe Roth and IRA accounts have limited trading permissions but I\u2019m ok with that. You can\u2019t have margin you can\u2019t sell naked calls. \n\nYou want to be able to trade ...\n\nCash secured puts\nCovered calls\nSingle leg calls/puts\nAnd importantly call/put spreads\n\nIf you BUY an option, that is your max loss. \n\nIf you SELL an option, that is your max gain. \n\nI strongly suggest that you take advantage of TOS paper trading. It\u2019s free. Practice trading options for months. For free. No risk. You can practice all the strategies and most importantly learn to manage a trade. \n\nYou will need to roll a trade out in time to give yourself more time to be right. You can also roll a trade out and up/down. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to teach you how to trade, but option trading requires management. It is as important to manage winners as well as losers. \n\nMonths ago I bought SNAP at $19.8x and sold a $20 covered call for $1. That is 5%. Not bad for a month. \n\nI\u2019ve rolled it out and up so I now have a $25 covered call. I\u2019m still ITM but the point is that it\u2019s never only one trade. And the trade isn\u2019t over. \n\nAm I an expert - no. But just realize that options trading is not one and done. It\u2019s not. \n\nAnd it is a sum zero game. Your lose is my gain. We all don\u2019t profit. Stocks go up and everyone wins. That is not true with options. \n\nYou need to be very smart to make money. Smarter than average. Are you?\n\nPaper trade.

(I've only ever used Schwab, which is fantastic, but the others are known for great support.)\n* Financial advice and free workshops\n* As far as I can tell, better order flow. Schwab abides by NBBO and provides price improvement on approximately\n90% of orders. (Unlike RH, other brokerages apparently don't make a lot of money on order flow.)\n* Native real-time trading apps (Schwab has StreetSmart, Fidelity has Active Trader Pro)\n* Roboadvisors\n\nNone of this costs anything extra, though tailored financial advisor services do come extra.\n\nI think one of the big draws of a brokerage like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard is access to mutual funds. At Robinhood you're limited to stocks, which includes ETFs. Mutual funds offer a wider range of funds, including target date funds and tax management funds. (Contrary to what many people on Reddit seem to believe, mutual funds don't just mean expensive actively managed funds! There are tons of cheap funds, and some that are even cheaper than ETFs.) For example, my IRAs are all in target date funds that have a fee of just 0.08%.\n\nIf I were starting out today, I'd pick Vanguard. Fantastic company with a uniquely altruistic vision.",

I'm interested in companies that are doing well, where the earnings outlook is positive, where earnings per share is growing. Maybe it's growing faster than people think. What do you have on your list that would fit that bill even if it's more expensive than the average company in your group?\u201d** So, it's that's sort of give-and-take. And I might encourage an analyst to reorient their priority list to help me look for stocks that fit my ideal pattern.\" (https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/the-long-view/40)\n\nToo many people I think jump to an Intel because \"LOOKS CHEAP!\" when they'd have been better off with the things that appear more expensive where the company is doing well and the outlook is positive.\n\nIntel spent $15B on Mobileye, and for all the discussion of self driving, I don't know that I've heard anything much regarding Mobileye probably since they bought it.\n\nLastly,\n\n\"Intel completely missed out on the smartphone revolution, too, having been unable to come up with an answer for the rise of the ultra-low-power ARM SoC. After its smartphone insurgency, ARM chips quickly moved on Intel's territory by spreading to tablets and laptops. Intel's latest black eye is being completely dumped by Apple, which, after building its own ARM design house for the iPhone and iPad, has announced plans to upscale its ARM chips to Mac laptops and desktops.\"\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/heads-roll-at-intel-after-7nm-delay/\n\n\"Laptops and desktops are the next great frontier for Apple's chip division. That division will help the company avoid the same fate that has befallen Android smartwatch manufacturers: letting some other company dictate your product lineup. Apple's plans to update the Mac have often been stymied by Intel's product roadmap, and Intel does not make chips that serve all of Apple's design priorities. The new CPU will be just one part of an Apple-designed system-on-a-chip that would also include (among other things) an Apple GPU and a desktop version of Apple's Neural Engine machine learning and AI processor found in the iPhone and iPad.\"\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/this-is-apples-roadmap-for-moving-the-first-macs-away-from-intel/\n\n\"Intel actually says that the issues with its current 7nm production means that production is trending a year behind its internal roadmap. For some reason, though, the company says that being a year behind schedule will still only result in that aforementioned six-month delay to market.

You can put money in there and buy stocks just like robinhood, plus you have access to international stocks if that matters to you, and it will be tax free when you turn 59.5. Plus, you get free withdrawals of your contribution amount anytime (you\u2019re only taxed on your gains for early withdrawals I believe). So there\u2019s not much of a downside.

I had major paper hands, and just couldn't resist checking the prices to see if I had lost a few dollars. \n\nI would say that most people would and should be investing as early as possible, reason being that you can put money in index funds and hold for the long term. Trading is a different matter, I would say that around the age of 15-16 is probably a good time to start. Start with a little bit, and play around with it. The reason being is that you're able to experiment and learn things about the market before actually committing larger amounts of money. \n\nAs for starting off, I would highly recommend watching youtube videos or a udemy course on investing basics, as well as looking at Investopedia. Those in combination with reading posts on specific reddit subs (r/stocks, r/finance, r/stockmarket, r/options) helped me get started. Reading reddit posts gets me more interested into trading. Stay away from WSB though, there's a lot more meme material there.\n\nIf you want to invest and not trade, then research basic market principles, how index funds/ETFs work, and research various ETFs. Generally I like to look at total market index funds, mid-large cap company funds, and emerging markets/fast growing markets such as Tech, EV, and Cannabis.\n\nIf you want to minimize risk, hold ETFs for the long term. Open a brokerage account through Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Schwab, etc and put a portion of your paycheck into it. I actually really like this short document that has an ETF trading strategy: [https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)\n\nTL;DR: Look at a basic investing course on Udemy or YouTube to learn basics of the market, and read about things on specific reddit subs. Invest and don't trade (investing tends to be holding for the long term while trading tends to be more short term). Invest in ETFs, and there are many different resources for finding which ones to invest in.",
