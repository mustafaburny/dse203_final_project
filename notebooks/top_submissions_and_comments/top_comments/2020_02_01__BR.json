They had a teaser with a C-130 dropping people and a gas ring and people are 100% sure (reasonably so) that this is a BR trailer. Combine that with the already high fan base of the new CoD game (myself included) and it  could make them some money.\n\nThat being said over 60% of what they earn is from mobile games so that's really where the money is. If there's news I don't know about a new Candy Crush game or something which is their bread and butter then maybe.\n\nI have no idea what this guy thinks is going to make it explode unless he has tunnel vision thinking the ~3 fully populated streamer servers on WoW classic are making them anything more than chump change.",
