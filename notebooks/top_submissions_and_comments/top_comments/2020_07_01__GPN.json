Visa needs issuers to put their brand on cards.\n\nChase threw a shit fit post CYBS acquisition as they were/are the largest Visa issuer and didn\u2019t want acquiring competition. CYBS was forced to sell its acquiring portfolio (sold to GPN which it was an ISO of prior to this). Then CYBS became a referral partner of GPN offering acquiring but on GPN paper and a hard cost that was high enough that Chase could forever undercut them on price if needed.\n\nCYBS spent 2011 - 2019 happily referring all acquiring to GPN. However, in the last year they started referring acquiring to Evo. At the end of the day, CYBS is primarily a gateway with value added services like fraud management and payment tokenization/hosted payment pages.",

I do feel they hay day for GPN is over as even CyberSource is moving away from them for acquiring and holding hands with Evo. Either are probably good bets for different reasons.\n\nI\u2019m biased and my username shows but I see PayPal getting a big revenue boost in the next two years by getting into the bitcoin game and selling it to its customers (look at the revenue square generates just from that with their cash app).\n\nI\u2019d consider buying some PayPal, some GPN and some Evo.

        "body": "I think you need to take a step back and really understand how payments work. The POS/hardware/software is the simple part of this and the least risky - it's not how they make their money, actually processors will just resell or lease terminals to merchants.\n\nVisa and Mastercard have SOME processing for very large merchants but they're generally *card networks* that allow for seamless interaction between the merchant's credit account and the customer's.\n\nMeanwhile, GPN, SQ, and Adyen are first and foremost *payment processors* and the way they make money is not through providing the software or the hardware, it's through being effectively a lender for merchants. Banks could do this but credit card processing is too risky for them so they generally don't.\n\nThink about how companies have something called \"remaining performance obligations\" where customers pay upfront and they receive services for a year. If the company shutters or disappears, the customers have not received their services and can get a refund or issue a charge back. Owing to how credit cards are structured, customers have up to **18 months after a service was performed/product was delivered** to chargeback. \n\nSo the merchant processor aka SQ or GPN take on that risk, and generally will need a portfolio that has a large layer of safe businesses and some riskier ones on top of that (where they make their money). *Banks* get their interchange fee and only in the case of a merchant processor default will take a loss. Hence, GPN can charge x% per transaction, so the merchants can get their money fast and be liquid while effectively taking a loan from GPN until that service period + 18 months is complete.\n\nPaypal does the same. It's not a software business, it's a software-enabled financial services business.",

Currently the hold backs are the 30k$/kg refining cost of silicon of the right purity, and the particle size.\n\nLook up HPQ silicon on the tsx-v if you want to read about it. They have signed NDAs for their battery tech, but they have the refining process using PUREVAP technology. Can refine to 99.99999% pure silicon and in the micron particle size for a fraction of the cost.\n\nIf their tech is proven, we could see 4000mile batteries with it. Lots of competition in this space tho, so who knows how it\u2019ll all flesh out.",
