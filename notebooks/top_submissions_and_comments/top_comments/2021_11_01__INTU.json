They have gone insanely far in the past few years and I still think they will continue to build out competitive products. \n\nQuickBooks, TurboTax and Credit Karma are very well designed and their cross-sell opportunities into other products are amazing. \n\nThey have been doing a lot of development on other areas like payroll and payment processing. And they recently acquired MailChimp. \n\nThey are essentially being the one stop shop for everything small business. \n\nYes, they are trading at a very high PE but they pretty much proved they can deliver over the years.",

        "body": "If it were me, GOOG, FB and ADBE\n\nSE - they increased 500% since pre-covid and lost 500mil last quarter. 170bn+ market cap. I got no problems with the growth, just the valuation and profit.\n\nSHOP - they increased over 200% since pre-covid and made 50mil op income last quarter. Over 200bn market cap. Again no problem with growth but valuation and profit. \n\nPeople call NVDA overvalued at over 800bn and they 'only' made 3bn last quarter.\n\nWell you'll find many supporters for SE and SHOP which are 1/4 of NVDA's size yet don't make a profit at all, I repeat - almost 200bn company that loses 500mil last quarter.\n\nPYPL growth was just 13% last quarter, for a company above 200bn and over 40PE. With competitors everywhere they turn.\n\nPLTR only grew 35%. You might think 35% is fine, except when you see they've more than doubled since IPO 1 year ago, for a paltry 35% growth. Not to mention they lose bucketloads of cash and their employees are happy to sell you their shares.\n\nSQ barely has any profits as well. Company is worth over 100bn. Revenue growth earlier in the year was inflated by bitcoin revenue (with associated costs just as much as revenue) so really isn't comparable growth. Only 27% growth last quarter.\n\nWhy FB, GOOG and ADBE are the safest picks and highest quality on the list?\n\nMaybe FB and GOOG have anti-trust issues.\n\nBut their financials are A-grade. The best financials relative to PE you can find on the US market.\n\nFB trading at 23PE for a company that grew revenue by 35%. Always buyback shares and virtually zero debt. \n\nGOOG had a staggering 41% growth and 65bn in revenues (HUGE)  and almost 19bn in profits, healthy balance sheet and also buying back shares. All for 28PE.\n\nADBE will announce their results next month. They are on the expensive side too, PE fluctuates in the 50s-60s. But it's one of the few highly profitable software companies that's growing. Their growth was just 22% but INTU results of higher growth has people hoping ADBE will also have higher growth. \n\nMarket probably thinks companies like SE, SHOP, SQ can turn on huge profits after their growth. I don't think it's that easy. GOOG and FB grew while being extremely profitable. TSLA doesn't spend a cent on marketing whereas these current companies need to spend 20%-50% of revenues on marketing.  Disgusting amounts to gain revenue. \n\nPeople are bored of GOOG and FB but they're extremely profitable and at the top for a reason. They grow at 20%+ consistently without having to aggressively spend to achieve it.",

        "body": "One strategy that I've been **experimenting** with, is daytrading and very short swing trading, in gigantic tech megacaps. (GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE, AMD, INTU, FB)\n\nFor example, I would take your $33,014, and I'd buy 100 shares of MSFT for $336.00 (ok, so technically 98 shares). Let it go up to $339.00, then sell it. $300 profit, pre tax. Rinse and repeat. Hopefully do two of these per day, maybe 3 if you get lucky.\n\nNow, there's two major risks with this strategy. You buy a dip, but it keeps dipping. In this case, you just convert from a daytrading/swing trading mindset, to a long-term \"I'm going to hold this stock for 10 years\" mindset. This is why I would only mess with my 7 Golden Tickers (GOOG, MSFT, FB, ADBE, AMD, NVDA &amp; INTU). I'm completely comfortable with bagholding any of those companies for several years. Especially GOOG and MSFT. In fact, I'd be perfectly comfortable having my ENTIRE net worth in GOOG or MSFT. \n\nRight now, half of my NW is in those two, so I've put my $$$ where my pie hole is.\n\nNow, the other worry, besides being stuck in a downtrending stock, is that you sell MSFT for $339, but it doesn't have another intraday dip, allowing you to get back in and repeat the process. Instead, you sell at $339 and it goes to $340, then $341, then $342, then closes the day at $345.\n\nNow what? Do you buy it again the next day anyways, but get less shares? Normally what I do, is look at the Golden 7 again. Usually at least one of the Golden 7 might be on a nice intraday dip. So, you gotta be flexible. If MSFT, GOOG, AMD, NVDA are all hitting ATH's, but ADOBE is down 3 percent for whatever reason, time to hop into ADBE. \n\nNow, what if all of my Golden 7 Tickers are all running away from me? Take the day off and go do something else. Don't look at my portfolio at all. Patience is a mofo virtue.\n\nAlso, you could potentially consider other stocks that happen to be dipping considerably, but the difference with these is that you need to set a tight stop loss, and be willing to cut. But, I've done this before while waiting for one of my Golden 7 to present a nice opportunity.\n\nAlso, the key to this strategy, is to hopefully have a lot of success early on, and make some nice profits, just playing the intraday gyrations of these megacaps. Because, let's say you're in NVDA, but the stock has corrected to the downside, and you're down 3k. If you did well early on with this strategy, maybe you can consider taking a 1.5k loss on it, just to get out of it ahead of schedule. So, you let it rally back to a 1.5k loss from a 3k loss and you jump out, sacrificing some of your earlier gains.\n\nI only do this, if one of my other 7 Golden Tickers happens to be cracking back right at that time, making it almost an irresistible move to make.\n\nYes, this strategy definitely has downsides, but it does mitigate risk quite a bit. I'm never fucking around with shit like DKNG, WISH, CLOV, PLTR and stuff of that ilk. I'm only messing around with the absolute cream of the crop. If the entire market tanks 50 percent, and I'm stuck in Google and Microsoft, gee.... I wonder how I will sleep at night? Like a fricken baby, that's how, lol.\n\nAlso, long-term investors will absolutely HATE a strategy like this, because they know deep down inside that they should probably be doing the same exact thing, but oh my God... the taxes, the taxes. Very comfortable excuse imo.\n\nWe all saw what Amazon did for about a year. It went basically nowhere for a full calendar year. Now imagine instead of holding AMZN for that full calendar year with it doing absolutely nothing, instead you were buying at $3100 and selling it at $3300. Over and over and over and over and over again.\n\nYou just take the money made, and you buy additional shares. Just keep putting the money back in, and getting more shares. All you're concerned with is growing the number shares. Everything else is noise.",

Im betting on corruption and that in the end giant corporations will run the government. Keep in mind if they made filing easier the IRS will lose money on error and late penalties as well. They are also insanely tech backwards. I went to defend a client for an audit and the auditor literally whipped out a calculator from his pocket to add up numbers. They don\u2019t accept email and run everything through fax or physical mail. Thousands of low paid agents literally open up contesting emails and process it by hand. They are dinosaurs and that isn\u2019t changing any time soon. \n\nEach state also runs their own tax filing systems and their systems do not talk well with the IRS. It\u2019s insanely common to be audited by the IRS but the state doesn\u2019t notice and vice versa because they don\u2019t share info with each other very well. What this means is not only does the IRS have to catch up, every single state has to catch up techwise as well. \n\nIntuit is also not H&amp;R Block. H&amp;R Block may go the way of the dodo bird but Intuit\u2019s future is in their tech and the ability to monetize their customer base in other products. \n\nFor instance they bought Credit Karma which is more than a credit check software. They get clients in with the lure of free credit scores and then push them to loans and credit cards, making money off loan referrals. They offer merchant processing and make fees off every transaction. They just bought Mailchip a business marketing tool. \n\nTheir lifeblood in the future isn\u2019t in tax returns and they know it. They pivoted very well and have reported annual growth rates every year for the past decade because they keep adding highly profitable complementary products. Their growth just doesn\u2019t stop. They are essentially a tech company posing as a tax company. The same way how McDonalds is really a real estate company posing as a fast food joint. \n\nI run a team of 100+ accountants and a couple dozen developers. And there is nothing in this space that comes close for the market segment they target (small businesses). Xero is the only thing giving quickbooks a run for their money.",

Just did that for the fifth time again today.  The last support guy I talked to sounded almost suicidal.

They are trading at an insanely rich valuation for a company that effectively doesn\u2019t make money and has been around for years.

They don\u2019t make squat off legal services. \n\nThey brought in their new CEO Dan who was a GM at Intuit, and effectively cleared out their old management, and replaced them with former Intuit execs. They plan on cross selling accounting services to their customers who are typically new small business owners. Accounting services is a natural complement services with far better margins (think of it as services offered by traditional mom and pop accounting firms and not H&amp;R Block or TurboTax level self service). \n\nI\u2019m waiting for an entry point as I think their value is too rich and they won\u2019t be making substantial profit for awhile.",

Like I\u2019m a tax accountant and I hate Intuit, and their products are terrible in terms of being a good accounting software. However, their products are marketed to people who don\u2019t know much, to make things easy, and they charge fees or offer subscriptions in such a way that people get into their products and don\u2019t feel the need to switch, even as they pay more and more. So I hate the company, but I can see why they do well.\n\nI can think of plenty of examples like that, where you see some shitty end of the company or product, and you could easily miss why it works and why it makes money.\n\nProbably much better to think about this kind of stuff at a distance. Like, sure, if you\u2019re going to put 80% of your portfolio into Apple, you should probably know what their phones are like, but I don\u2019t think you want to base a big investment decision on your personal experience as an Apple phone user, because there\u2019s just so much more to the company than just that narrow experience.",

Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term. I think that\u2019s a pretty massive difference.",

My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.",

Everybody that matters in the market knows what it is, and they all knew it was going to pass the house. Remember, it had strong support by both parties in the senate months ago when it was passed. People have mentioned buying related ETFs (I.e PAVE) and construction companies (like CAT) for that entire time for this reason. Basically, it\u2019s priced in.\n\n2. Besides allowing for news,  speculation and possibly improved forward guidance (all priced in imo) this bill isn\u2019t going to make these companies more valuable overnight. It will take a long time for them to get these projects/money, and even longer for them to report their financial improvements from this, which does have an impact on stock prices. Even then, this is probably priced in.\n\nI hesitate to say this is 100% priced in right now because there are probably retail traders buying in, but the term \u201csell the news\u201d exists for a reason. In general, retail traders tend to buy the top and sell at the bottom, and this event will (probably not) be an exception.",

And I don't mean the namby-pamby 20% capital gains tax, these are going to be paid as if they were earned income.\n\nSo to deal with that his choice is either to take out a huge loan for all of the tax value and the cost to exercise.\n\nOr sell some of his existing stock, pay the much smaller capital gains on it, and use the money freed up there to exercise the options and pay the income tax.\n\nBeyond those two likely options the only third option would be to not exercise the options and let them expire worthless.\n\nThis tweet is all about framing the decision for public perception. He's already made up his mind and run the numbers.",
