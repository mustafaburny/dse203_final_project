        "body": "Hi\n\nAs i am invested and did my DD and DCF on GEO:\n\nThere are 2 major risks:\n\nA) loss of contracts with us government agencies which could lead up to 50% drop in rev/op CF/profits\n\n-&gt; i did a sensitivity analysis and modeled out drops until - 50% overall after looking at all of their facilities\n-&gt; Conclusion: the margin of safety even in case of a partial loss of contracts is huge (IRR north of 20% for 10 y holding)\n\nB) refinancing risk: take a closer look at the payment schedule of GEOs debt. 2024 could be crucial as they are in need of hefty refinance by then. Problem is: some bank institutes don't want to finance them because of the bad press.\n\nMy take:\nA) offers a good margin of safety even if things go south. B) banks want one thing and that is make money. GEO offers strong CF and is likely to be able to repay debt and interest. I believe some institute is going to refinance them.\n\nI hope that helped. I wish you all the best and continue to do your own DD. I am interested in your opinion!\n\nBR,\nChris",

This means we have no edge in w.e analysis we have. those privy to this information before hand will have edge. If you are relying on this, your hope is that someone in the future sees the same value you see today.\n\nyou will find your dd has a tendency to be more right in a bull market, since everything is going up. \n\nIf you really want to confirm your DD and research ability, then you will have to find those come back stories in bull markets and have a high degree of success. You will also need to be able to identify when a stock will sell off.\n\nHowever, unless you are getting paid well and this is your sole occupation, its unlikely you will pick up on these, to the success that would confirm your ability.\n\nsome people will disagree with the above, but this is my observations after 15 years.\n\nYour best bet in being successful is focusing on risk management.\n\nYour overall portfolio should have an expected return and a plan for a drawdown. Within this portfolio you can have an allocation for riskier plays but a drawdown in these positions should not eclipse your expected annual return.\n\nThe real game is holding on to your winnings.",
