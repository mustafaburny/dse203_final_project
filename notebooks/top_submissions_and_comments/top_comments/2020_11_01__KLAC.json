I definitely wouldn't advise you to put all your eggs in one basket, but I do believe that AMD is a very good buy in the long-term.\n\nFundamentally, they have an absurdly phenomenal management team. Since Lisa Su's inception, the company has experienced tremendous growth and even managed to steal away Intel's lead architect. Although AMD has always has great products, Lisa Su has really managed to take it to the next level and make AMD nearly a household name at this point with the rise of customized computer building.\n\nI guess to answer your question better, if you're planning on holding this for 10+ years, I have no doubts that this stock will grow especially with its acquisition of Xilinx and incredible product line. These synergies match especially well and I don't see a way that Intel could possibly topple AMD as it previously has. The semiconductor industry has been seeing a growing prevalence, especially with its intertwining of AI (i.e. NVDIA).  \n\n\nEDIT: I know that might be a pretty ambiguous answer, but I've done a few analyses and reports on AMD, so if you have any other questions regarding their financials/future outlook, feel free to reach out!",

There's a **stiff** premium to be paid for acquiring a company that wasn't looking to be acquired. Many of those executives will lose their jobs, they need a golden parachute. Shareholders need to be compensated for their loss of control. It's **really** **fucking** **expensive**.\n\n&gt; analysts upgraded amd to $120... but then (after the deal) downgraded xlnx to $130. (ie: not ~200)\n\nAnalysts are a bunch of dum-dums. I don't care about their \"upgrades\" and \"downgrades\" Go look at Enron's \"grade\". Look at Tesla's \"grade\". It's all bullshit.\n\n &gt; the math does not add up. this is off by such an absurd margin. far beyond arbitrage.\n\nYeah, because this wasn't a hamburger at Wendy's and shouldn't be analyzed as if it were.\n\n&gt; you also omit amd going from 88 to 74 on the rumour/news, despite their best er in history and 2 other major catalysts.\n\nAcquiring a company isn't a short term cash grab, it's a long term synergistic value proposition. If you were in AMD for short term gains it made sense to exit. If you were in AMD long term, it's a reason to hold or increase your position. That played out exactly how I expected it would.",

        "body": "what boon4376 deleted:\n\n**Dr. Lisa Su Knows What's Up**\n\nThe market did not react well to AMD purchasing Xilinx. But Dr. Lisa Su knows exactly why this is a critical part of their roadmap over the next few years. They will die without it. Here's why.\n\n**x86 Is Dying**\n\nThe x86 architecture hit the top of its bell curve, and things are transitioning to ARM. ARM isn't just winning power-efficiency contests anymore, they're winning in performance per watt in many new high-end scenarios like the server market.\n\n* Apple is the most obvious Canary in the coal mine with the [M1 macs](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/) - with [ARM's IPC beating x86](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/axy8mo/arm_versus_x86_ipc_skylake_zen_n1_thunderx2/)\n* Amazon AWS [Graviton ARM based chips](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) - a huge cost savings for many types of servers\n* [NVIDIA acquiring ARM for $40 billion](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai)\n* Microsoft has been trying to make [Windows on ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/) happen for a long time, and now that Apple has done it, we'll probably see this accelerate since it's now posh to have an ARM processor. Microsoft has a problem where they need cheap laptops with good battery life. They can't do that with power-hungry cheap x86 chips, and laptop makers want to use smaller batteries. ARM is the solution.\n* The obvious ubiquity of ARM on mobile and power-restricted devices\n* The fact that there are many more companies innovating on ARM compared to only AMD / Intel driving x86 innovation.\n\n**The Future Transition To ARM**\n\nThis transition isn't happening for no reason. The economics of performance per watt drive this industry. Consumers want more battery life (phones, laptops, cars), enterprise wants cheaper to run cloud servers.\n\nAs ARM continues to become superior in raw power in more business cases, while X86 continues to see diminishing returns with each generation, the software market will inevitably start switching over to ARM. MacOS Big Sur is the #1 catalyst.\n\nCross-platform software development systems are going to make the software transition easy. Flutter and Electron are examples that [compile code to x86 and ARM native environments.](https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/faq#run-android)\n\nUnity has made a huge push for[ Game development on ARM.](https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/08/arm-partners-with-unity-to-make-3d-run-everywhere/)\n\n**AMD &amp; Xilinx**\n\nSo how do AMD and Xilinx come into this whole scenario? Xilinx already has an SoC portfolio for everything from [low-end cost-optimized ARM to high-end CPU + GPU systems.](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc.html) AMD will need to break into the ARM market, and Xilinx is their way of buying accelerated entry.\n\nTogether, Xilinx and AMD will combine their technology and proficiencies to produce high-end workstation, game console, automotive, and server-grade ARM chips.\n\nThis transition will further accelerate the pace that AMD is able to take marketshare from Intel as more software is built for ARM systems.\n\n**Intel**\n\nIntel really needs their x86 breakthrough to get to the market. Their [Alder Lake-S architecture is supposed to be the answer to ARM's power efficiency.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-first-10nm-desktop-cpus-land-in-second-half-of-2021) But the delays have put intel in a precarious position. Had these chips launched on-time - Apple may have avoided transitioning to their own ARM chips for desktop quite as soon ([it seems to have been their plan since Skylake however](https://www.pcmag.com/news/former-intel-engineer-explains-why-apple-switched-to-arm)). Intel has been on the defensive for a while, and these delays are what ARM needed to catch up and surpass in market share.\n\nNow that Alder Lake-S is delayed until the second half of 2021, it's giving ARM critical time to evolve and take more market. The more of the market that uses ARM, the more ARM innovation will continue.\n\n**AMD's Future Without Xilinx**\n\nIf AMD continues down a path of pure x86 architecture development, the rest of the market will leave them behind. NVIDIA will be soon getting into the high-end ARM desktop and server market. We know they need to for performance per watt competition - especially in the automotive ML space. We've already seen Apple and Amazon start transitioning.\n\n**Intel is like a stubborn child who will not change.**\n\nAMD can continue to optimize x86 down the popularity bell curve while gaining early entry and innovation in the ARM market - though they are still behind in experience and execution compared to nVidia, Apple, and Amazon, Xilinx is their accelerator to catch up.\n\n**AMD + Apple (Very Speculative)**\n\nAMD already has a long history with apple for providing graphics solutions. If AMD is able to start offering high-end ARM-based CPU solutions along with their dedicated high-end ARM-compatible graphics solutions, we may see Apple utilize AMD processors on their higher-end \"Pro\" lines of laptop and desktop systems. However, this is also a huge opportunity for nVidia.\n\nApple may be able to compete easily in the graphics space against Intel's integrated graphics solutions. But it remains to be seen if they are interested in entering the high-end GPU scene. This is a major opportunity for nVidia and AMD arm compatible solutions.\n\nWe will likely see the Apple M2 chip be compatible with an nVidia or AMD graphics solution by the end of 2022.\n\nedited:\n\nPositions:\n\nAMD 03/19/2021 100.00 C x3\n\nAMD 01/15/2021 100.00 C x2",

        "body": "&gt;When something like snap or zoom happens and you happen to be on the winning side of that ... it\u2019s luck.\n\nI've been doing this for a little longer than this year and nothing I've said doesn't apply to other years. M&amp;A plays and such are all the same every year with the same results and rewards and sometimes even greater ones.\n\nI called Zoom 3 months before it happened based entirely on the Corona Virus Pandemic and it's use in my workplace going up ridiculous amounts. It wasn't luck. In fact that's the problem here; Zoom was not luck. The uncertainty didn't lie in whether it was being used but instead by how much it would profit from it's use during the pandemic. Apparently everyone was blown away with massive increase in value because in this environment it really is just that useful. \n\nThe part I am trying to get across is that it isn't luck at all. At least not in this case. If something has a strong correlation with the SP500 for instance and that is tanking it is very unlikely that any news is going to outrun the beta on the stock so it isn't really as shocking as it might seem that earnings in the past week, even on things we already knew would go up from a comparative view, were still not producing strong calls or positive prices. They simply fell with the market as a whole at the time. The same had to be true of the things that fell with their earnings in Feb / Mar into April. \n\n&gt;It is a relatively new phenom with know real rhyme or reason behind it.\n\nThis is not new. You can go back to any bubble, any bust and any memetic behavior and see the same thing over and over. This is incredibly profitable hence all the sentiment concepts and scraping of forums and such; the data is profitable for certain. If it were new and no one knew what was happening there'd be no money in it.\n\n&gt;You could argue that currently,the possibility of newbie traders stumbling upon massive gains from meme stock culture is elevated .. Id argue that the probability is still low.\n\nYou don't \"stumble\" across companies you know. That's my point. No one \"stumbles across\" Snapchat. We all know what Snapchat is. You \"stumble across\" Regeneron. You \"stumble across\" Xilinx. You don't stumble across AMD.\n\n&gt;Is it possible to hit a 5k lotto ticket .. sure But in all probability it will be a while before you have a trade that successful.\n\nAgain this strongly depends on what your cost basis is. To get a trade that hits 5k from 2.5k is ... actually really common. Very. It was before this. It will be after. It even happens on just the stocks and not even the derivatives; a lot of people think that these market moves are rare but they aren't, and instead, they are heavily spaced out and complex to track so making 100% across 9 months in a year isn't what anyone is looking for but that is exactly how it tends to work out.\n\nI personally think that your first 20k is the hardest because it's easy to get the 1 that takes you to even 10k buy 20+ in one go is very rare so you do have to actually string together trades and that lowers the probability of success substantially. This is especially true because capital sensitivity worsens as you get wealthier; the same amount of money you need to achieve a return is not the absolute value of a cashflow anymore so when you worked at Wendy's (whose earnings are this week ;) ) your making 30k was huge but if you work at your own firm or a bank or something like that your making 30k is sometimes a pittance.\n\n&gt;I think it\u2019s dangerous to spread a narrative that suggests Snap like plays happen so consistently that all you have to do is be familiar with these types of cult companies to secure large profits.\n\nI cannot stress enough that this stuff happens all the time. It is so common in fact that there is no one talking about it. I mean the Fastly puts thing with a 392x value? *That* is rare. From 2 ~ 18 based on the contract within a year is not astronomically rare because remember it's all leverage so the bet itself doesn't move linearly like the base might presuming the basis isn't an option itself. Heh. Options on options are freaking crazy.",
