TPIC, BWEN.\n\nOffshore Wind.\n\nAdditionally:\n\nSilicon Lithography EUV transition: ASML, KLAC, LRCX\n\nBuilt In America - Likely the only meeting ground for a Republican Senate and Biden for upcoming fiscal spending. TPIC and BWEN share this narrative. I also hold INDS which fits into this, as well as COVID recovery which is another broad trend that I hold, if you'd call it a trend.\n\nLIDAR is another interesting sub-trend of autonomy. I honestly do not like discussing it on Reddit because it immediately dovetails into discussion of lvl 4/5 self driving autos (which is a small subset of LIDAR TAM) and Tesla (which as a ticker grossly overdiscussed and therefore not interesting), and then additionally the companies involved went public through SPAC and are have the typical absurd valuation and penny stock retail crowd. Rough all around. That said, worth reading the actual investor presentations and projections, and the Luminar investor day presentation is especially great with over an hour of technical Q&amp;A at the end. Due to the extreme volatility of SPACs, average in over a very long period to build a position and cut volatility exposure. We're talking build out a position over a year+. It is what it is.\n\nMaterials used in the green transition is almost a trend in and of itself. Of course everyone knows Lithium, but the numbers and projections behind copper and some other materials are quite interesting as well.",

And the first question people ask when they find out what I did in college is about the economy and stocks. And it\u2019s a dumb question and they don\u2019t even realize it. Like I spent years learning about scarcity and a bunch of basically applied calculus and statistics. \n\nUnless I work directly for a brokerage I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to make an informed decision any one way or the other, and even then it would only be a best estimate and one with enough of a likely chance to not be correct that it would be pretty irresponsible to give an opinion on it. \n\nI can fully do the math behind it sure, but the stock market has proven time and time again that it\u2019s irrational and not really predictable with any algorithm. There is a reason that economic theory even says throwing a dart at a chart of stocks and picking where it lands is just as likely to be accurate than if you picked it based on extensive amounts of DD and research. \n\nBut I just point people towards index\u2019s, tell them if they aren\u2019t retiring in the next 5 years don\u2019t be afraid or worried that the stock market drops every now and then etc etc. \n\ntl;dr Economists don\u2019t study the economy they study scarcity. I\u2019d be extremely skeptical of any economist claiming to know what the market will do or that they have figured out the stock market. We exist to do small scale data analysis, or to advise large scale economic moves aka monetary/fiscal policy, we aren\u2019t adept at guessing small movements within certain markets. And if we\u2019re in a spot where we can then we are also in a spot where the sec would have something to say if we profited off it.",

        "body": "&gt; IMO it really validates the risks related with EM investments and the risks that are attributed to investments in Chinese markets\n\nActually if you read the piece the exact opposite conclusion is reached: that with this move China actually **derisked** its economy and therefore arguably made it safer for investors. It was not a \"move on a whim by Xi because he got his sensitive feelings hurt by Jack Ma\" like so many Western publications argued. Like the piece says:\n\n&gt; [Regulators think that] there are many deficiencies of the current Chinese financial system, but that does not mean \u201cBigTech\u201d gets to do what it wants, even if we can acknowledge their contributions to society.  TL;DR: we like innovation, but let\u2019s not overhype the magic of \u201cbig data,\u201d and anyway, you\u2019re still operating in financial services, and so that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be regulated, like it or not.  That\u2019s because if we the regulators don\u2019t step in, and something goes wrong, who will pay the price?  Society will, the citizens will. Don\u2019t you guys remember the Great Financial Crisis of 2008?  A few parties won, yes, but all the rest of us? We lost.  We were all set back.  That\u2019s not happening again, not on our watch!\n\nWhen regulators think like that, I think that's a system worth investing into IMHO, because they think long-term and they think greater-good which ultimately leads to a stronger economy, not something to be scared by...\n\nThe only argument that can be made, I think, is that they acted too last-minute and that is scary in itself but it is also actually somewhat reassuring because they're not afraid to stop something as iconic as the world's largest IPO when they believe it can ultimately be detrimental to society. They didn't mind losing face and that is a positive sign for China.",

Then in this speech he called all the banks \"pawn shops\" for loans and basically made fun of the biggest govt backed banks (who he had sold shitty debt securities to). Essentially he offloaded a shit ton of liability from ANT's (like paypal/venmo in china) loans onto the chinese government aka the chinese people.  So now the govt has to deal with all that before it potentially explodes in their faces, and they have to teach jack ma a lesson because he essentially sold them bags of dogshit and then bragged about it publicly while laughing in their faces",

They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

        "body": "To add on: selling covered calls is a pretty easy way to make some extra money on non-meme stocks.\n\nBasically, you're selling your shares at strike+premium, e.g. if you sell a $10 call for 1.5, you're basically selling your shares for $11.50 each. You're solidly in the green as long as the share price stays below strike+premium. If it looks like it is going to blow past your strike, and you want to hold the shares, you can usually roll to a higher strike for a net credit by adding some time. Collecting the premium also gives you some downside protection if the stock starts to drop.\n\nA basic strategy that is very popular among wealthier people is to own shares and sell monthly/quarterly strangles. E.g. own 10k $MSFT shares and sell 100 calls at +15% and 100 puts at -15% each month. Basically, getting paid to buy the dip and renting out your shares for cash.\n\nYou can easily get 10-20% monthly returns holding shares on stable companies this way, but you'll sometimes miss out on the massive rallies, so it's not suited for anyone in this sub. You'll also get screwed in the event of a covid-type crash if you've done this on margin, but if you're holding shares, you'd be screwed short-term anyway.",

They have almost the same weighting so if either of them takes market share from the other, there will be practically no change in the overall value of the index. \n\nSimilarly with FAAMG. Despite their apparent differences, those companies compete with each other in many ways. For example Twitch (Amazon) versus Youtube livestreaming (Google). Or Amazon Web Services vs Google Cloud Platform vs Microsoft Azure. If one of these companies takes a fall, the others are likely to pick up their market share in some capacity.\n\nYour example only works if all these large companies are unseated over a short period of time by companies outside the S&amp;P 500.",

Facebook (the site) itself has been viewed quite negatively by the younger generation, and it might go the way of MySpace, if there\u2019s a newer and cooler social media platform in town. Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest is a success and can be big for them, but the VR market is still very niche. \n\nAmazon has a ton of upsides, especially during and even after COVID, where everything will move towards online, everyone already knew. Despite how big Amazon is, eCommerce is still only 16% of retail sale, so there\u2019s still room. Cloud is booming, and AWS is still king.\n\nI am the most bullish on MSFT. They have a good mix of the old stuff that have been steadily making them money for decades and are still here to stay (Windows, Office/365, .NET, SQL, Xbox) and the cool new stuff that has a lot of growth potential (Azure/Cloud, Surface, GamePass, Teams). On top of that, their recent acquisitions have been doing a lot better than the failed ones in the past. I think MSFT is very solid, and they are one killer product away from taking over Apple as the #1 company in term of market cap, again.",

Normally this would be their worst earnings of the console cycle, but the last one had forced store closures.  I'm thinking we see better numbers this quarter. And better than worst will be a surprise.\n\nThat said, I've been saying for months that I expect the stock to drop on EPS posting for Decembers ER, but I expect a huge rally during the call.  They will absolutely talk about console presales and interest.  That itself is pretty bullish.  They're sold out of preorders and will continue to be even after the next batch drops.\n\nThis will also be a great time to talk about other activities.  Is Cohen taking an active roll in the turnaround?  He is still invested, so this is still very feasible, and an official announcement that he is actively involved would be good for at least +2-3 bucks tacked onto the stock price.\n\nTalking about continued increase in website sales and how people are responding to the massive improvements is also a likely topic.  If they don't bring up the MSFT deal, there will absolutely be questions from investors about it.  If they start forward guidance again, we could see crazy movement on that as well.\n\n\nFinally, and rather amusingly, a lack of console supply is actually bullish for GME.  People start selling used consoles to gamestop starting the day they release.  Why?  I can't fathom a legitimate reason for this, but it happens.  Super demand and no supply means people will pay new console prices for used consoles.  There will be a massive profit margin on these for gamestop, and even better, when the console is an XBox, that console starts generating passive revenue for them as well.",

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

If you bought any of these at the lows you've done exceptionally. \n\n\"Surely that means they stand to take a hit by proxy if consumers have less money in their pockets due to job losses within other industries?\"\n\nThere's been countless discussions by companies that many aspects of the current crisis have forced further adoption of technology and pulled forward years of growth. Businesses are spending on tech. That's why you have SaaS companies up 100-200-300%+ YTD.\n\nSatya Nadella on Microsoft's quarterly call about a week ago: \n\n\"The way I think about the computing landscape going forward is if you sort of said at the highest of levels today as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is 5%. We think it will double in the next 10 years. And if anything, this pandemic perhaps has accelerated that doubling. And in that context, what\u2019s the large -- the most secular need, it\u2019s the need for distributed cloud infrastructure. It\u2019s both needed for modernizing existing applications you have, and so that\u2019s why -- by the way, 20% penetrated, so there\u2019s more 80% that needs to move. But more importantly, there\u2019s going to be new application starts which need infrastructure. And so, if you sort of add those up, I think that we\u2019re still in early innings. There will be between quarters, volatility, all of the points that Amy made even earlier. But, we think distributed cloud infrastructure is the most important layer. But, the way we\u2019ve approached it is not to just think of that layer in isolation but the data layer work we do composes, the AI layer composes and more importantly, our SaaS applications, whether business applications, Power Platform, Microsoft 365, all reinforce that same modern tech stack. So, I would still say that digitization in its -- this new tech stack is in its very infancy.\"\n\nIn the Spring, Nadella:  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months.\"\n\n\"consumers have less money in their pockets due to job losses within other industries?\"\n\nConsumer tech? Yes, unfortunately there are a lot of people who are not doing well. But there's still plenty of people who are doing well and who are buying the latest phone - people are streaming, they're constantly looking at the news with everything going on, etc. The phone is a staple at this point. Video games are doing exceptionally well. \n\nYou also had a complete trade off this year and there were some companies that lost out and some that benefited. Apparel lost. Travel lost. That money went into home furnishings and technology as people stayed home. I think technology spending is becoming more and more a priority with each passing year and this year accelerated that considerably, but there was certainly an aspect of people didn't spend on A and B so that money went to C and D.",

This year it hasn't that much. People are timid, but I largely think that is overplayed. Many companies reported great numbers for Q3. Whether the election is contested, biden wins, or trump wins, it doesn't really matter. The private sector is marching on. Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if people riot. Stimulus will pass whether its biden or trump. Even so, we know we have until next year to sort it all out. Im keeping some cash for buying opportunities, but I'm largely bullish.

Well they are most likely cash flow positive NOW and NO console cycle benefits have truly taken place yet.  \n\nGME have not yet generated revenue from monetizing their customer data or from the MSFT downstream digital revenue partnership.  They have only very recently began to generate revenue from PC hardware and online advertising.  \n\nGME is going to be generating a TON of cash within the next few months and they already look to be cash flow positive!\n\nLots to look forward to here in the coming months.",

        "body": "To add on: selling covered calls is a pretty easy way to make some extra money on non-meme stocks.\n\nBasically, you're selling your shares at strike+premium, e.g. if you sell a $10 call for 1.5, you're basically selling your shares for $11.50 each. You're solidly in the green as long as the share price stays below strike+premium. If it looks like it is going to blow past your strike, and you want to hold the shares, you can usually roll to a higher strike for a net credit by adding some time. Collecting the premium also gives you some downside protection if the stock starts to drop.\n\nA basic strategy that is very popular among wealthier people is to own shares and sell monthly/quarterly strangles. E.g. own 10k $MSFT shares and sell 100 calls at +15% and 100 puts at -15% each month. Basically, getting paid to buy the dip and renting out your shares for cash.\n\nYou can easily get 10-20% monthly returns holding shares on stable companies this way, but you'll sometimes miss out on the massive rallies, so it's not suited for anyone in this sub. You'll also get screwed in the event of a covid-type crash if you've done this on margin, but if you're holding shares, you'd be screwed short-term anyway.",

Currently at 0.13\n\nIf GME successfully grows their e-commerce business to \\~50% with same day delivery (currently being rolled out now), the products they sell could reasonably provide a 1x sales multiple. (Compare other e-commerce P/S - OSTK 1.2   CHWY 4.2)\n\n4 new revenue streams for GME will include: Monetization of customer data, digital downstream revenue from MSFT Xbox platform, online advertising revenue, and PC hardware sales. All 4 offer good margins.\n\nAll of these new revenue streams and e-commerce growth represents a very big change (almost 'tech' like) than that of the former business model of purely B&amp;M with mostly just gaming product inventory. The real big money to influence a major share price rise is in the customer data. If leveraged properly, GME has a true 'tech' side to their business model.\n\nGME looks to grow revenue YoY, estimating 6-7bn for 2021, and 8bn+ in 2022 with a P/S of 1, we are looking at a 8bn market cap in 2022. Share price of $120+\n\nYou could compare with BestBuy, which has a P/S of 0.8. Give GME the 0.8 P/S and they reach a market cap of 6.4bn (assuming 8bn yearly revenue in 2022). That's $99/share and an 800% increase from current market value.\n\nMost investors are not aware of what the company has to offer, hence why the reference Blockbuster so much. There is a reason we have seen larger stakes being taken by bigger players. Just last week we saw some more big boys jumping in. Wells Fargo, Jefferies, Hussman all taking positions. When GME shorts flip to longs (will happen eventually) they will drive up the share price.\n\nIn the next 2 years, if the street decides to view GME as a e-commerce/digital data business within the gaming/PC industry, valuations can run high and P/S multiples could run even higher.",

Despite their apparent differences, those companies compete with each other in many ways. For example Twitch (Amazon) versus Youtube livestreaming (Google). Or Amazon Web Services vs Google Cloud Platform vs Microsoft Azure. If one of these companies takes a fall, the others are likely to pick up their market share in some capacity.\n\nYour example only works if all these large companies are unseated over a short period of time by companies outside the S&amp;P 500.",

The pie is growing and will keep growing but that only means that even crappy companies can survive and even do modestly well.  Every major tech company is on top of this stuff and companies like MSFT and AMZN, which have such immense talent pools and extremely effective leadership, definitely \\*are not\\* conceding this business.  Nor, we can be sure, are the Chinese - and with 1.4 billion people we can be sure they have much talent yet to emerge.   \n\nSo, really, while the potential is always there, I wouldn't bet much that this company is that much different than the hundreds of other tech startups already out there and soon to emerge.  It might be, and that might be worth a small stake to see what happens.  But from the larger perspective I'd say the chances of it are modest at best - and certainly not worth much until it shows it's attracting customers.",

Why nobody mentions this is beyond me, arguably one of the most important high margin revenue streams GME can benefit from.\n\n**E-Commerce omnichannel business model** that offers same day delivery and is continually improving. This is the \"beat AMZN' part of the business model.\n\n**PC hardware sales** ($40bn/yr and growing TAM)\n\n**Online ad revenue.** From website + App\n\n**E-sports experiences**. Currently partnering with gaming pros and streaming on twitch. Will **build brand recognition**.\n\nMassive **reduction in SG&amp;A.**\n\n**SKU optimization**. Better inventory and inventory turnover.\n\n'Digital everything' is not as strong of a bear thesis as it was 2 years ago. Especially considering GME has the MSFT partnership to share digital revenue.\n\nGaming industry TAM is growing YoY.\n\nCompetent management team. Finally.\n\nBigger firms/institutions are taking a position in GME. So far as of end of Q3 we have had new or increased stakes from: Senvent, State Street, Russell, Wells Fargo, Hussman and finally Jefferies taking an sizeable position in Call options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a $700MM company. This is not the old GME where you simply buy and trade in videogames. It is very undervalued at current market price of $11\n\nI think GME has potential to be valued at $2-3bn valuation within 12 months ($32-47)\n\nWhen it finally appreciates in value after a few good quarterly earnings then there should be a slow squeeze. You have to be patient with this play. It will most likely take 6+ months until we see good Q4 and Q1 earnings to convince shorts to capitulate.",

They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

If you look at Big Commerce's or Lemonade's financials, they aren't great.  And some of the SPAC mergers are pretty suspect especially when compared to how much they run up around merger time.  \n\nI agree that there was more vaporware back in the late 90s, BUT, the fervor, the blind investing into companies without knowing anything about their financials, the double or triple digit gains within a single year.... remind you of any recent times?",

Normally this would be their worst earnings of the console cycle, but the last one had forced store closures.  I'm thinking we see better numbers this quarter. And better than worst will be a surprise.\n\nThat said, I've been saying for months that I expect the stock to drop on EPS posting for Decembers ER, but I expect a huge rally during the call.  They will absolutely talk about console presales and interest.  That itself is pretty bullish.  They're sold out of preorders and will continue to be even after the next batch drops.\n\nThis will also be a great time to talk about other activities.  Is Cohen taking an active roll in the turnaround?  He is still invested, so this is still very feasible, and an official announcement that he is actively involved would be good for at least +2-3 bucks tacked onto the stock price.\n\nTalking about continued increase in website sales and how people are responding to the massive improvements is also a likely topic.  If they don't bring up the MSFT deal, there will absolutely be questions from investors about it.  If they start forward guidance again, we could see crazy movement on that as well.\n\n\nFinally, and rather amusingly, a lack of console supply is actually bullish for GME.  People start selling used consoles to gamestop starting the day they release.  Why?  I can't fathom a legitimate reason for this, but it happens.  Super demand and no supply means people will pay new console prices for used consoles.  There will be a massive profit margin on these for gamestop, and even better, when the console is an XBox, that console starts generating passive revenue for them as well.",

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

Cardlytics, Roku, Trade Desk, etc. Yes, was difficult for a brief period in March and April but has recovered considerably. If you bought any of these at the lows you've done exceptionally. \n\n\"Surely that means they stand to take a hit by proxy if consumers have less money in their pockets due to job losses within other industries?\"\n\nThere's been countless discussions by companies that many aspects of the current crisis have forced further adoption of technology and pulled forward years of growth. Businesses are spending on tech. That's why you have SaaS companies up 100-200-300%+ YTD.\n\nSatya Nadella on Microsoft's quarterly call about a week ago: \n\n\"The way I think about the computing landscape going forward is if you sort of said at the highest of levels today as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is 5%. We think it will double in the next 10 years. And if anything, this pandemic perhaps has accelerated that doubling. And in that context, what\u2019s the large -- the most secular need, it\u2019s the need for distributed cloud infrastructure. It\u2019s both needed for modernizing existing applications you have, and so that\u2019s why -- by the way, 20% penetrated, so there\u2019s more 80% that needs to move. But more importantly, there\u2019s going to be new application starts which need infrastructure. And so, if you sort of add those up, I think that we\u2019re still in early innings. There will be between quarters, volatility, all of the points that Amy made even earlier. But, we think distributed cloud infrastructure is the most important layer. But, the way we\u2019ve approached it is not to just think of that layer in isolation but the data layer work we do composes, the AI layer composes and more importantly, our SaaS applications, whether business applications, Power Platform, Microsoft 365, all reinforce that same modern tech stack. So, I would still say that digitization in its -- this new tech stack is in its very infancy.\"\n\nIn the Spring, Nadella:  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months.\"\n\n\"consumers have less money in their pockets due to job losses within other industries?\"\n\nConsumer tech? Yes, unfortunately there are a lot of people who are not doing well. But there's still plenty of people who are doing well and who are buying the latest phone - people are streaming, they're constantly looking at the news with everything going on, etc. The phone is a staple at this point. Video games are doing exceptionally well. \n\nYou also had a complete trade off this year and there were some companies that lost out and some that benefited. Apparel lost. Travel lost. That money went into home furnishings and technology as people stayed home. I think technology spending is becoming more and more a priority with each passing year and this year accelerated that considerably, but there was certainly an aspect of people didn't spend on A and B so that money went to C and D.",

My baseless theory is this: its extraordinarily slim the violence is worse than what we have seen over the past 5 months. Even if there is peak unrest, how does that impact stonks? This year it hasn't that much. People are timid, but I largely think that is overplayed. Many companies reported great numbers for Q3. Whether the election is contested, biden wins, or trump wins, it doesn't really matter. The private sector is marching on. Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if people riot. Stimulus will pass whether its biden or trump. Even so, we know we have until next year to sort it all out. Im keeping some cash for buying opportunities, but I'm largely bullish. Don't let the media get your worked up into thinking this is the end times. It's not.",
