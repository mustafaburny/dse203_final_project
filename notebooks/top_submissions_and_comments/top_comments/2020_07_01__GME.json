Q4 mobile sales in 2018 were so disastrous it forced GME to sell its entire Tech Brands arm including its AT&amp;T authorized retail branch Spring Mobile. That was largely due to the decline in new iPhone sales.\n\nQ1-3 for Apple is usually heavily dependent on Tablet, Ipad, Macbook. There is still quite a bit of phone sales in Q1 but Q2 I had to focus bigly on business sales to make bank. That is the key. No way business sales for Iphones, Tablets, iMacs are big enough to offset iPhone losses.\n\nQ2 with a pandemic there weren't even authorized stores open. Retail spaces were all closed. Online sales are significant, but people will hold off buying a new phone if they can't get some \"tech guy\" to hold their fucking hand in setting up their fucking iCloud transfer. \n\nIf they beat earnings it wouldn't surprise me because apple is a behemoth still but be careful.",

I remember someone saying on here when I was negative on Gamestop in the teens, \"BUT LOOK AT THE DIVIDEND.\" It's like, but look at the business growing more irrelevant by the day, the stock price cratering and the dividend eventually being pulled. If a company has not invested in the business and emphasized dividends and buybacks, there's likely going to be a point where the dividend goes away because they have competition that have actually invested in maintaining relevance when it comes to the end customer. People say things on here like, \"the dividend is too good to be true!\" It's like...\"well, do you actually like/have a view on the business?\"\n\nPeople have this mentality that \"a yield is good therefore more yield is better, right?\" and people often wander into high-risk garbage or companies in decline. Plenty of people yield chased into mREITs and unfortunately in March and some people lost nearly everything: https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankrupt-in-just-two-weeksindividual-investors-get-burned-by-collapse-of-complex-securities-11591020059. There's nothing wrong with dividends, but yield chasing is not a good idea and people have elevated dividends into this sort of magic of income and protection (wasn't safe harbor in the March decline) and blah blah - there's plenty of risk in chasing yield, as one can certainly see in that WSJ article.",

And for me, the answer is that stock prices are an indication of future performance, NOT current performance. Not even the next six months performance. More like a year, or years from now. And if you look past the next console releases, GME doesn\u2019t seem to have a place in gaming. \n\nAfter people buy the new consoles later this year, they will buy all or most of their games online. There\u2019s not a big market for game resale when you don\u2019t own a hard copy. By the time we get to the next console releases, online shopping will be more common than it is now (and its already deadly for brick and mortar). We just won\u2019t be going to GME. Yeah they have other products, phones, whatever, but this is a company that has a very short term positive outlook (&lt;6 months) and a really really bad future outlook. \n\nI also have no experience with analysis but I\u2019m only interested in stocks I want to own.

As a result a security can perpetually spiral down down down. It\u2019s also why stocks like GME can have over 100% short interest. Normally when you short shares your broker lends them to you. Every now and then a broker might lend you shares that don\u2019t exist. As a result when the clearing firm accounts for settlement it results in a \u201cfailure to deliver,\u201d as no share was delivered in the transaction. You can find failure to deliver data at link number 4 [HERE](https://www.tradinganalysisresources.com/2020/05/free-references-and-resources.html?m=1). That demonstrates the failure to deliver threshold list.  That\u2019s the worst of the worst failure to deliver examples. Brokers usually have safety measures in place to prevent this. Many shady hedge funds do this on purpose. While the SEC will destroy a broker, they need reasonable suspicion to go after a hedge fund.

Even bankrupt companies don't always  go to zero (e.g Gamestop), shorting is not free so you can lose money even if they do go to zero, not to mention opportunity cost of the tied up capital, not to mention shams can and do raise money - e. g NKLA has indicated an intent to raise more and develop a product even if it currently has nothing, again meaning the future cash flows are not necessarily zero. The question was for OP,  who is clearly very knowledgeable about NKLA.",

        "body": "I'm emphasizing storage capacity, not the internet. Physical sales, for both offline and online content storage covers this issue. This follows back to my rationale that SSDs can't hold a large library of games, we just don't have the technology to store modern games currently due to the shear cost of SSD flash.\n\nI can't tell you if continuing with disks are a good thing (at a latency/user experience standpoint). But the point I'm trying to make here is that physical formats of games are still going to be present irregardless of internet speed due to storage limitations. Afterall, its clear that Sony made two PS5 models because they sure as hell know that 800 GB of capacity doesn't cut it for their biggest game spenders, which NEED physical media to handle the size of modern games.  Whether if that could drive sales at brick and mortar stores (not only GME) is up to debate.",

Or it doesn't, and the downside is limited due to the strength of the balance sheet and incoming cash-flows from the imminent console refresh.  \n\n\n$GME was the focus of my first Kitty Corner video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLlsPosngRnZ1OLfGPDLLC3a8k\\_rrwFNk6&amp;time\\_continue=2223&amp;v=GZTr1-Gp74U&amp;feature=emb\\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLlsPosngRnZ1OLfGPDLLC3a8k_rrwFNk6&amp;time_continue=2223&amp;v=GZTr1-Gp74U&amp;feature=emb_title)",
