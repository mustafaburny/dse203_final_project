        "body": "&gt; Here are some stocks that are in S&amp;P500 but you don't hear people talking about them. None of them are tech. If you look at their stock charts they are not volatile and all over the place. They are just in a steady uptrend for decades. POOL, NEE, DG, TJX, STE, ROP, CSGP, EXR, CTAS, TREX, RMD, PGR, BR, TFX, ROST\n\nIt's trivial to identify these companies in retrospect. But can you honestly say that you would have picked up this portfolio in the year 2000? And held this stuff until now? Some of these traded sideways for 10+ years. If you have proof that you actually bought all of these long ago and are super rich now because of it, I'll be impressed.\n\n&gt; Once you have a large portfolio, you will get to the point where it may not make sense to contribute any more as your daily account value fluctuates more than your entire monthly salary\n\nWhy would it not make sense to contribute anymore? What else are you going to do with that money?\n\n&gt; You can just buy the top 20 holdings in the S&amp;P500 and beat it every single year with less risk. You can beat it even more by just buying the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500. Since these are the largest holdings in the index, if those stocks sells off then so will the index.\n\nIs this really true? Maybe in the last 5-10 years because of the wild performance of FAANG. But if you extend this strategy back decades, you would have bought a lot of companies like IBM, Intel, Cisco, GE, GM, Sears, Yahoo and a shitload of oil companies that are in the toilet now. Depending on your allocation, it seems doubtful to me that over 30+ years, this actually beats the index.",

Just like with things like your career, education, etc. If you put effort into researching how money works, the stock market works, what return on equity means, projected EPS growth, net profit margin, and thinking outside the box of just index funds. You'll be amazed at how you can grow a portfolio quickly with less severe drawdowns than indices and also higher returns than indices. All while still being diversified. Over time you will see that the more stocks a fund has, the worse it performs.\nHere are some stocks that are in S&amp;P500 but you don't hear people talking about them. None of them are tech. If you look at their stock charts they are not volatile and all over the place. They are just in a steady uptrend for decades.\nPOOL, NEE, DG, TJX, STE, ROP, CSGP, EXR, CTAS, TREX, RMD, PGR, BR, TFX, ROST\n\nThis group of stocks have outperformed the S&amp;P500 almost every single year with a CAGR of over 20%. Now if you add tech stocks then it would be even higher. If you do some research on what these stocks have in common you will see that there are plenty more stocks just like them.\n\nIt is very hard to have a large portfolio built from index funds. Large meaning seven figure plus. Unless you are able to contribute tens of thousands of dollars a year, meaning that you are a very high earner. Once you have a large portfolio, you will get to the point where it may not make sense to contribute any more as your daily account value fluctuates more than your entire monthly salary. At another point your yearly returns will be worth more than your entire year's salary, all without having to go to work for it. In addition to that you will really see the power of compounding. The real money is in getting a large portfolio quickly in your youth, long term holdings, adding to your winners, cutting your losers, staying away from the dividend portfolio, ignoring the noise on Reddit and the news, and not getting in and out of stocks.\n\nAbout the average not beating the market, the average investor isn't dedicating the time to learn how things work and just hears you cannot beat the market/indices while accepting that. The vast majority of people commenting in the sub have small portfolios. When someone offers an alternative viewpoint, then they get downvoted and told INDEX funds only.\n\nYou can just buy the top 20 holdings in the S&amp;P500 and beat it every single year with less risk. You can beat it even more by just buying the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500. Since these are the largest holdings in the index, if those stocks sells off then so will the index.",
