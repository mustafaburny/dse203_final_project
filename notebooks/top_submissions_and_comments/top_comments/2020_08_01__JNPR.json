Yep, Sun Microsystems was trading at 10 times sales when it was at $60 and long term before and after it was a really good profitable company and a solid $3-5 stock.  BTW, if you take a look at how long it was at $60 (about a week), I had a friend that was an exec and sold his entire holdings (1 mm shares) at $60.   So there were people that made a lot of money in the Dot Com era but they were the ones that sold at the top.

Most of those internet hardware companies (it was a hardware bubble due to the change of date to 1/1/2000 more than an internet bubble) were mature, fabulously profitable and behomeths.   And still are profitable.  However if you bought CSCO or JNPR or many other of the big profitable companies in 99 you are still not breaking even.   CSCO was a high of $82, split adjusted $41, it is now $42 20.5 years later.   JNPR was a high of over $220 split adjusted and it is now $24.  MSFT regained its Mar/2000 high of $53 in July of 2016.  These were all huge companies with thousands of employees making great profits.\n\nThey simply let their valuations run too far forward.  CSCO has finally regained its $40/sh price twenty years later.  Juniper, likely will not get over $200/sh until 2090 or so.   I expect TSLA will be a lot like JNPR.  A very successful company that regains its $2000/sh price (split adjusted) in the year 3000.",
