        "body": "For LEAPs I generally like low-volatility stocks with an upcoming catalyst, especially if it's gotten crushed along with other companies and in a fairly less impacted industry. Some utilities, vendors in fairly closed, highly regulated industries (government, bank, or hospital vendors often good) are looking fantastic. Just picked up some $60 LEAPs for $0.50c (and a bunch of others on a spread) on a stock that's been in the $40-60 range for the past 2-3 years, is growing 20+% a year, likely to go to $80 once it picks back up and still be cheap, and is currently about $30. If this things hits $80 in the next 2 years that's a 50x+.\n\nOne I like that I noted in another thread was DXC where it's trading absurdly cheap vs fcf (&lt;2x...), good new CEO, buybacks and debt retirement could make this a $150 stock in a few years and the $30 2022 leaps today are ~$2.50 when stock was at $60 just a few months ago and $40 just before the drop but it's taken about a 50% hit in the past couple weeks. Might go super out of the money here too for dirt cheap and wait it out. \n\nWould be awesome to have a couple 50-100x in the mix :)",

        "body": "I believe in terms of investment, you might be better off with investing in stocks or forex. Hear me out.\n\nThere are some articles published in different parts of the world that have mentioned things like how people are getting scammed millions/ billions off a \u201cbuy gold\u201d scheme, where they get people to spend X amount of money on say 10kg of gold, and they are promised with a return of 10% per annum. For example, person A is promised this level of return, then person B (unrelatedly to A) joins in and is promised the same thing, and they decide to invest. B\u2019s money is then given to A, and A feels that he\u2019s being promised good stuff. Then C comes in, and the process repeats. When the creator of this crowdfunding/ pyramid scheme gets enough people, they disappear into thin air with all the money, just like avatar Aang.\n\nThe main reason why these people fall to such scams is because they don\u2019t understand the business model. Gold doesn\u2019t magically grow to create new gold and give you money. However, a restaurant business (for example) does. They set up shop, have customers, sell food for a price greater than cost price, and then they give out dividends to people who decide to invest in them (very much like blue chip stocks). Of course, as the business grows, they may decide to give out greater dividends or keep the profits to themselves for business expansions, upgrading Chef skills or hiring new chefs etc.\n\nSo to summarise, it\u2019s important to understand the business model of every single investment. If you don\u2019t understand it/ are not interested in it (eg bitcoin), then DON\u2019T invest in it. As for your gold coin example, I personally feel that it\u2019s very similar to buying gold and holding it for the Long term, and there\u2019s not going to be much change in the near future. Ultimately, the choice is yours, now with the coronavirus going on and about, it\u2019s a great opportunity to buy into blue chip stocks or undervalued stocks within the market.\n\nOne example of this would be how the virus is affecting all businesses, whereas in reality, it should really be affecting businesses that require a flow of people, for example restaurant businesses. IT companies such as windows for example, technically shouldn\u2019t be affected, because they sell windows license keys (and others for example. But let\u2019s just keep it within e-commerce businesses for simplicity). But they\u2019re still experiencing a drop in stock prices because there are computers (AI programmes) that buy/sell stocks for big companies when prices hit a certain upper/ lower limit.\n\nJust my two cents worth on this topic. And again, it\u2019s entirely up to you to decide. If you know how your investment is going to generate you cash flow, then go for it. I wish you all the best!!",
