        "body": "For LEAPs I generally like low-volatility stocks with an upcoming catalyst, especially if it's gotten crushed along with other companies and in a fairly less impacted industry. Some utilities, vendors in fairly closed, highly regulated industries (government, bank, or hospital vendors often good) are looking fantastic. Just picked up some $60 LEAPs for $0.50c (and a bunch of others on a spread) on a stock that's been in the $40-60 range for the past 2-3 years, is growing 20+% a year, likely to go to $80 once it picks back up and still be cheap, and is currently about $30. If this things hits $80 in the next 2 years that's a 50x+.\n\nOne I like that I noted in another thread was DXC where it's trading absurdly cheap vs fcf (&lt;2x...), good new CEO, buybacks and debt retirement could make this a $150 stock in a few years and the $30 2022 leaps today are ~$2.50 when stock was at $60 just a few months ago and $40 just before the drop but it's taken about a 50% hit in the past couple weeks. Might go super out of the money here too for dirt cheap and wait it out. \n\nWould be awesome to have a couple 50-100x in the mix :)",
