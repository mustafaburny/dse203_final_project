The SPY *IS NOT THE FUCKING MARKET!!!* The SPY is also *NOT THE FUCKING ECONOMY!!!* \n\nThis obsession with SPY Puts and \u2018Short the SPY\u2019 is beyond fucking stupid to the point that *actual* traders are laughing at you all. \n\nThink about it: in the US there are about 12M \u2018operating companies\u2019 (eg \u2018companies\u2019 as you think of them). Only about 6,000 companies are public and the *biggest* 500 (or so) compromise the SPY. \n\nAre you seeing where this is going yet? You all are shorting the 500 companies *that are best positioned to, not only survive this, but THRIVE in the post-corona economy.* They have the best capital access, the best size, the best market position....I can keep going. The companies that comprise the SPY are going to survive, particularly the top ~100 or so that comprise 80% of the SPY action.\n\nWhat the fuck are you retards thinking shorting those companies?? Why the fuck are you ***SHOCKED*** you are losing money? WSB: \u201cSee that ETF that is comprised of the companies best positioned to go up?I\u2019m betting my life savings on Puts.\u201d If one of my analysts came to me with that thesis, I\u2019d assume they had brain damage and fire them. \n\nThere are *obvious* shorts out there. I\u2019m not giving specific names but first off, get the fuck away from large caps and start thinking about S/Mid caps that service those 12M operating companies that are fucking hating it right now.\n\nYou people getting lit on SPY puts are getting *exactly* what you should have expected.",

I would have some small wins, sold many potential big wins too early, and lost my ass playing ERs.  Before this week I was down about 50k and was depositing 5k every week trying to get my tendies back. This last 5k I deposited on Monday was going to be my last hoorah before I hung the gloves up. I played DDOG ER, saw the lackluster AH and thought I was boned. Woke up the next day to some good gains and decided to go all in on SPY on 1DTE puts believing it was going to dump. Like the true degenerate that I am I wanted to get rich or lose it all. Moral of the story, sometimes stonks do go down. \n\nPositions:\n\nDDOG 5/15 70c (65 contracts)\n-Bought for $0.65 on 5/11\n-Sold for $2.30 on 5/12\n\nSPY 5/13 286p (422 contracts)\n-Bought for $0.29 on 5/12\n-Sold for $5.51 on 5/13",

Also, cancelling Netflix is super easy and can be done in a few clicks.

Say it was found out that Netflix was charging money to people who have been deceased for a long time. Relatives might not know the passwords to accounts etc. Or say Netlfix were found in breach of data protection laws by holding user data of dormant users. \n\nFinally, it's also some good PR. Some companies are known for making it really difficult to cancel. Netflix coming out saying that they will do it automatically if you don't use their service could be used as a selling point.",

I'll be going short term calls tomorrow for a quick scalp at open.\n\nPTON Calls: Same as above \\^ bounce back from the $40-41 level\n\nDKNG: FOMO if you want. This thing could pop to $40 or drop to $30. I won't be touching this until at least another week or so. Risky af but mad tendiez if you guess the right direction (calls/puts)\n\nCOTY: Same as above, but I expect this will hold better than DKNG since its already near rock bottom prices. Might throw a few thousand at it tomorrow in calls.\n\nSPY: i personally don't play SPY, but there is mad tendiez to be made if you get in calls at a dip (around the 295-297 range) or puts (around the 301-303 range).\n\nCCL, RCL, NCLH: Easy plays to go long on a dip, Beaten up cruise stocks that have been forming new bottoms. Easy 2x 3x bagger if you get in before a large move up in the premarket. They seem a bit overheated lately though so I would be careful of a pullback soon, in which case go short term puts.\n\nAAL, DAL, UAL, LUV, SAVE: Same as above\n\nAAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA: Tech saw a big hit today, might be a good spot to buy the dip. I'll be watching closely tomorrow if we continue to fall in tech at open, then I'm buying the dip for sure.\n\nBABA, TSM: GYNA stocks if you want i guess\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck making your parents money back you fucking autist.",

        "body": "*a forewarning I started typing, and went on a bit of a tangent, apologies*\n\nSo I only tested it briefly, but it had pretty good results. I ended up like going mad and just started adding a bunch of different features to the program (ie some balance sheet stripping, getting macro data from the fed, getting performance of various industries via ETFs, etc.). \n\nBut back to the question: it was a bit more of a trend analysis than a stock screener, I just didnt really know how to word it. So in theory, you could use any stock, and it would be able to detect up and down trends in momentum, before typical trend line analysis would (I'm not a huge fan of technical analysis, but admit there are some times where it can be helpful).\n\nSo when I back tested, I tried to use companies I have never traded (I only back tested 2015-2016 to try and get the most similar markets to today without me having too much forward looking bias, since didn't start paying attention to markets/trading until mid 2017). Further more, I was not exposed to price action even in the trading, as the charts I read were derived from a formula to calculate and chart momentum, so it was charts of the stocks relative momentum not stock price. After I completed the year of what dates were buys and what were sells, I went in and found the prices of those days (used closing price for both buying and selling prices).\n\nSo I used the SPX for broad market (even though, I clearly know that this has since gone higher), GDX (which, full disclosure I have briefly traded as a hedge before), and had a list of independent companies, but the only two I got through before going off on my tangent of coding were JNPR, and CERN.\n\nFor the SPX\nI was able to achieve a return of 15.73% through 6 trading \"trips\", while on the year it returned -0.73%.\n\nFor GDX\nI was able to achieve a whopping 121.52% over 6 trading \"trips\" compared to -20.10% year return\n\nFor JNPR\nI was able to achieve (another whopping) 115.32% over 8 trading trips, compared to 25.88% year return.\n\nFor CERN\nI was able to achieve a 76.34% return over 5 trading \"trips\", compared to a -27.16% return on the year.\n\nSo, things to take a way, it was pretty damn successful in the brief back tests I did. However, I noticed pretty quickly it benefits most from short term and intermediate swings in price, which the in the cases of GDX, JNPR, and CERN all were pretty volatile for that year, so the results I achieved from them, I'm expecting, are way above average. Actually the thing that sparked my tangent into other parts of the program was to try and weed out stocks that have high volatility, so i wouldnt have to go through them myself, issue is I didnt stop there. I'm pegging most results to be around that SPX result. Furthermore, this strictly tested against a yearly holding of those stocks, am planning to have someone go through with a regular trendline analysis or something with the same period to get a more accurate result as its performance against some basic analysis techniques.\n\nAs for the process I picked the companies, I used a random organizer to pick 25 S&amp;P companies (made sure they were included in the S&amp;P on the date my back test started) and ran with it. I threw in a few etfs (as shown GDX, but also have TLT, TLH, XLE, XLY, etc. Just havent gotten to them).\n\nEdit: Thanks for the interest in its progress!",

Identity access and authentication management + 2FA, workforce management, and endpoint detection and response for the remote endpoint. For the private network, network detection and response (likely through an mssp), and edge firewalls. Microsegmentation and microservices for the data center / servers, and... For the most part that's good.\n\nAnd as far as the push to edge computing is concerned, if we're still making terminals then it's probably marginal to just build the rest of the computer out and just do it how we have been. Then for any intensive applications use the compute resources on the private network like a render farm.\n\nAs far as who wins the VM play. VMware is expensive. 99% of IT departments don't have even half of what I just outlined above. And there's some really great alternatives that are better in many ways and much more affordable. Big switch networks(now Arista) for cloud fabrics / networking / public-hybrid cloud, Red Hat (now IBM) for open source virtualization, open stack, Fortinet for security, etc. etc \n\nI like VMware, but I just don't see them winning the cloud wars. In my opinion, it's going to be open source providers and enablers like Arista that will win, but even then there's a lot of traditional competitors that could run with it like Cisco, Nokia, Juniper, etc.\n\nBut they did have Velocloud which sold like gangbusters. Although, sdwan is going to move more towards the whitebox virtualized services route.",

        "body": "&gt; Possible risk factors mostly come from big IT spending being potentially put on hold due to companies having cash flow issues/supply chain issues delaying hardware production (as stated by other networking hardware markers) \u2013 biggest catalysts for a potential dump post ER. Equally could surprise to upside given all the coronavirus related catalysts and low expectations\n\n2 sides of this coin. \n\n1 side--- CapExpeniture is one of the first things cut (well, after corp travel and free coffee, but before eliminating yearly salary increases/ bonuses, and layoffs), especially IT related CapEx, which is a non-revenue generating business unit / group. Companies that were in the shitter pre-Covid wont have the cash/liquidity to spend. \n\nOther Side-- As many companies realize they can still function pretty well without people in the office, many will move to reduce their physical footprint, consolidate offices to a more \"regional\" model where you only go to office for important / customer facing meetings, maybe a project kickoff. To sustain this sort of environment, infrastructure needs to be beefed up to handle increased bandwidth, security, utilization, etc. Companies will save money by spending a little to beef up infrastructure etc compared to their current real estate spend. However, these sort of major upgrades are not a flip the switch / overnight type of implementation, and take time to do right. So companies may take 3-6 months to ramp up capacity, and move to a more remote workforce end of year and into next fiscal year while they exit lease contracts.\n\nA note on WebEx, btw, it is a subscription based service, every user (or individual who can \"host\" a meeting) is a subscription. I do expect  they made beaucoup bucks on this in March).\n\nOverall, very bullish on this industry long term (WSB long term, 6-12 months lol). But it is very competitive and there are multiple players. Cisco has a large market share but Juniper, Huawei, Dell, etc all play in this space and are very aggressive price-wise. \n\nMy position is 6/19 47.5c, will see how much it ramps into earnings, may dump pre-announce if I hit my targeted gain (see the other DD noted, it notoriously dumps post earnings). Longer term, I may buy shares at a lower entry price point.",
