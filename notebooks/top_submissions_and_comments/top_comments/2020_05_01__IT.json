Many of these fixed costs are ,well, fixed, so all that lost goes straight into their profits. \n\nThink about how the following sectors will be affected by 10-15% decrease in traffic: malls, restaurants, bars, airlines, automotive, hospitality, office space and all businesses around offices. \n\nExplicitly, airlines for example relies heavily on business travel to make a profit. Even with cheap oil prices, those business travelers are gone forever. I know a fair number of executives who vastly prefer teleconferencing - they get to stay at home with their family in their nice houses. Remember, these are people who are away from home 2 weeks/month. They fucking hate traveling. They will literally take a pay cut to not have to travel.

If JPM breaks out to $120 (20% upside), you are looking at 75% - 100% returns. If JPM returns to $130 range, you are looking in the 150% - 200% return range and JPM would still be $15 below its all time high. Lots of potential upside with manageable downside risk.

Full stop. I dont care if this company is going to cure cancer or if this guy lied and said it's going to cure cancer when all they've got is a new flavor of chewable vitamin, if that stock price goes up and I make a profit off of it, thats what I'm here for. Thats why the majority of us are okay with pumpers. Someone telling you when a stock is going to go up? Thats a fucking meal ticket, and for whatever reason a lot of people seem to be too good for that.",

Also, cancelling Netflix is super easy and can be done in a few clicks. Therefore, this will not be a huge loss in revenue. \n\nSecondly, it could be a clever strategy to avoid future problems (and maybe lawsuits) with inactive accounts. Say it was found out that Netflix was charging money to people who have been deceased for a long time. Relatives might not know the passwords to accounts etc. Or say Netlfix were found in breach of data protection laws by holding user data of dormant users. \n\nFinally, it's also some good PR. Some companies are known for making it really difficult to cancel. Netflix coming out saying that they will do it automatically if you don't use their service could be used as a selling point.",

They took a beating and am expecting a bounce back from the 132-133 level. I'll be going short term calls tomorrow for a quick scalp at open.\n\nPTON Calls: Same as above \\^ bounce back from the $40-41 level\n\nDKNG: FOMO if you want. This thing could pop to $40 or drop to $30. I won't be touching this until at least another week or so. Risky af but mad tendiez if you guess the right direction (calls/puts)\n\nCOTY: Same as above, but I expect this will hold better than DKNG since its already near rock bottom prices. Might throw a few thousand at it tomorrow in calls.\n\nSPY: i personally don't play SPY, but there is mad tendiez to be made if you get in calls at a dip (around the 295-297 range) or puts (around the 301-303 range).\n\nCCL, RCL, NCLH: Easy plays to go long on a dip, Beaten up cruise stocks that have been forming new bottoms. Easy 2x 3x bagger if you get in before a large move up in the premarket. They seem a bit overheated lately though so I would be careful of a pullback soon, in which case go short term puts.\n\nAAL, DAL, UAL, LUV, SAVE: Same as above\n\nAAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA: Tech saw a big hit today, might be a good spot to buy the dip. I'll be watching closely tomorrow if we continue to fall in tech at open, then I'm buying the dip for sure.\n\nBABA, TSM: GYNA stocks if you want i guess\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck making your parents money back you fucking autist.",

What do you do when Musk randomly tweets out his stocks too high and it loses 10% - who predicts that???!? You may win big but you will also lose big. 78% of day traders lose money over the long term which is probably very similar to gambling addicts. \n\nDCA stands for dollar cost averaging. Basically what it means is just buying small amounts of a stock at regular intervals. This allows you to on average get a good price for the stock. It's been shown that trying to time the bottom of the market is basically impossibly difficult so don't even try, you'll lose more money than you gain. So let's say you've got 1k to invest a month, just out that in every month. Don't save it all up waiting for the bottom of the market.\n\nBasically don't try and be a smart ass and just invest for the long term. The 200iq boys on wall street with their AI and trading algorithms don't consistently predict the market so what chance have you got? One of the keys to being smart is to realise when you're not that smart and plan accordingly. That's what dca does.\n\nHope that helps.",

My position right now is about half cash half tech stocks I want to use about 1/2 of that cash to swing trade mostly for fun and learning.\n\nI've made a few trades and learned a lot about options and some intro technicals like 3 line MA.

        "body": "&gt;Can you explain this? The US industry has been outsourced a lot, how is it industrially powerful?\n\nYes the US produces and licenses several of the most critical technologies around the world. Take semiconductors, the EDA semiconductor design market is controlled by primarily by two American companies Cadence and Synopsys. Without it chips couldn't even be designed. In semiconductor equipment manufacturing USA has KLA Tencor, AM and Lam which are essential to producing chips. This is just one example in the semiconductor industry and the US has several other companies producing high value content and products for the world.\n\nThe US only outsource the low value and admin stuff to developing countries to do as these products are of low Gross Margin or low cost contribution. This makes sense commercially since given future industry is driven by high value industries like high technology manufacturing and digital computing so naturally firms will focus more on . This is also one of the core reason why Trump and China hawks want to fight China as they seek to deny or slow China's ability to domestically produce high value goods such as semiconductors and supercomputers. \n\nIn fact US components are so important that you can even see their impact on companies like Huawei who has stated that it is hard to live without US components. This is why US is industrially powerful. Their products are critical to building modern day technologies and without it it is very hard to live without them.\n\n&gt;It's mostly services, but I don't see how one can say the US doesn't rely on imports with a straight face.\n\nYes but imports to the US are mainly low value products . Low value products have low cost contribution and the main Gross Profit is retained by the firm who outsources the production of the product. US doesn't really rely on imports in the sense that the US does not need to import any high tech products from anywhere as the US has the domestic capability to mass produce high tech goods efficiently.\n\nLook at China they rely on imports to survive. Without semiconductors the Chinese technology space will literally come to a grinding halt. This has been mentioned by Jack Ma before when he was in Japan where he referenced the US control over core technologies like semiconductor. This is why the US does not rely on imports since they are technologically self sufficient.",
