        "body": "That Cybersecurity stuff is going to get you really far. The Industrial Networks is fine but a network is a network, the only functional difference in Industrial machinery and systems is that they are running on low latency LAN's and there are a fuck ton of awful adapters and protocol translators everywhere and it makes everyone want to cry and die in a hole.  \n\n\nReally hone in on the Security stuff, I mean really get good at not just security a system but understanding the What, Why and How of each foundational component too.  \n\n\nAdopt a generalist / breadth approach to Networking. Consider AWS and Azure Network Specialist certifications, but also the Cisco and Juniper professional level certifications. Understand how a packet and a frame move around your network to the point where you become boring but fascinatingly passionate about it at parties.  \n\n\nWhen you get there, you will make entry level 6-figures at any company in Telecom, Software, Industrial, Biotech, Finance, whatever.   \n\n\nGood luck to you. Great choice on education, I hope this advice finds you well.",

        "body": "&gt; why someone would want to use Bitcoin as opposed to cash on PayPal?\n\nYou're asking the wrong question. The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase. Why can't we have it globally?",
