        "body": "heres what Im assuming you arent looking at.\n\n1) youre probably an average income earner. Meaning youre probably able to save around 25-30k/year. or roughly 2500/month.\n\n2) you are not just buying one leap contract at $2500. Youre likely buying 5-6. meaning its close to 10k. for 1.5 year bet, which is a max loss of around 6k/1.5 years. This means that you are potentially risking 30-40% of your money, which is about 6 months of time.\n\n3) considering you are new, you arent looking at hedging strategies and assuming that the market will go up.\n\n4) you havent identified a timeline for these leaps. If you intend to hold them until expiration, say for example aapl 122c for 25.00, apple needs to br at 147 at expiration to break even. If aapl is slow to do this then you will likely be losing money.",
