So they both are testing their innovations on top of manufacturing. I prefer AMAT (divedends) because it is cheaper than LRCX can buy more shares for me at least. And if you look at performance they both rise and fall in the same percentage. If you have an EFT they no doubt hold both. But besides watching the grass grow with EFT's I like a little side action for excitement. I prefer Jimmy Buffet (Margaritas) over Warren Buffet sometimes. LOL",

The way I see it in simple terms are, designers  ( patent holder etc) --&gt; materials ( AMAT) --&gt; machine that makes the chips ( ASML) --&gt; fabs ( TSMC, UMC - smaller version of tsm).  Just my guess.  ASML looks like its pretty much the monopoly and these companies will depend on them either way.  My guess is that as other countries try to get into the fab game ASML will benefit.",
