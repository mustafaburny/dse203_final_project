HPQ might be worthwhile looking at instead of HPE. \n\nDon\u2019t listen to the 100% broad ETF recommendations. You\u2019ll learn nothing from it. A bit in ETF\u2019s make sense in which case you could swap out some of the individual stocks. E.g. VOO rather than holding T, APPL, MSFT, NKE. ARKK rather than TSLA.\nIt\u2019ll de-risk it a little bit. Aside from that congrats, this is a great start.",
