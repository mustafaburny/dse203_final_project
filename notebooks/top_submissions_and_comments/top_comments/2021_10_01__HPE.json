A bit in ETF\u2019s make sense in which case you could swap out some of the individual stocks. E.g. VOO rather than holding T, APPL, MSFT, NKE.

All the talk and hype is about vehicle production and FSD but it's the batteries themselves that I'm seeing huge potential in. It's not just home solar and battery backup. They're also getting into grid backup. It's right there in the company mission statement: \"To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\"\n\nCars are just where they get started. The push to develop new battery technology, drive down costs and ramp up production of cells will have major ripple-effects of a world where massive energy storage is cheap and plentiful.\n\nVehicle production for Tesla in the future is going to look like book sales for Amazon. Google used to be just a search page. Apple used to just make computers. West coast tech companies tend to grow and develop far beyond their initial paths for profitability. So if you're looking for a reason why TSLA is still cheap there you go. Any comparisons to GM/Ford/VW/Toyota is like still comparing Amazon to Barnes and Noble or Apple to Hewlett-Packard.",

I don't even mean desktops.  I mean servers, which change over in terms of technology on an insane tempo compared to consumer devices.  Data centre operators are going to see the power savings with ARM and are going to drop Intel like a hot potato.   Apple's ability to ship the \\*same silicon\\* in iPad, Macbook air, and iMac format, with better performance, and no need for a fan... man, I don't know what else would put them on notice.     The same designs can be wrapped up on a Linux or Windows server already.  I can run an ARM instance at amazon today.  If this trend picks up steam, the server HALF of their business is going to get rekt. And did you notice that Windows is shipping ARM versions? I sure did.\n\nOr we could consider that Intel's leadership completely *blew it* when it comes to the various new semiconductor businesses that were invented in the last 2 decades, namely phones (ceded to Qualcomm and ARM), tablets (same), game consoles (ARM, AMD), cars (blackberry, microsoft), smart TVs (qualcomm).  They have a small IoT hobby business, but I would be real worried about Nvidia in this department, who are iterating fast with Jetson.\n\nI just looked at AMD's 5 year stock price chart compared to my previous favourite chart, Intuit, and holy cow, they have just completely kicked ass.\n\nTrue fact, Intel's 5 year performance is worse than Blackberry's.\n\ntldr; Intel = woof",
