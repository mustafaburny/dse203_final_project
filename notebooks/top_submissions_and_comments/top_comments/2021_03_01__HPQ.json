HITIF - yes, it's a weed stock, yes a bit degen, but everything in the company says otherwise, good balance sheet, solid management, rapid growth (even despite corona), Mexico just legalized marihuana, more countries will follow sooner or later, acquiring eshops, which is a good way to generate revenue on the side. Do your own DD and you will see why people keep spamming it so much. PT hold - 3-5 years or more  \n\n2. NNDM - personally as an engineer, great tech, 0 debt, 1.5 bil in cash ready for acquisitions and more R&amp;D, production ready machines by 2023 even though some of their customers use them for production already. ARK heavily invested. Policital situation: US is trying to be more independent of China, chip shortage, literally great fit for this company + they have military contracts and that's also a big plus. PT hold - 3 + years or more  \n\n3. PYRNF - industrials, plasma, a lot of military contracts, heavy insider ownership, have option to own 50% of HPQ or get part of their revenue, solid balance sheet. PT hold - 3+ years  \n\n4. To be diversified - one of the biopharmas, there are dozen of them, be very careful with them, I would go with one that is focusing on something that's not going away anytime soon such as diabetes or cancer. Look for solid management since most of these companies are not profitable. Honestly I like ATOS and SENS but would be more careful in this field. PT hold - indefinite   \n\n\nPS: not a financial advice, just my holdings and 2 cents on them.",

        "body": "[Their latest IR slide deck](https://www.pyrogenesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PyroGenesis-IR-Deck-12-03-2021.pdf) has some good info. \n\nThese guys have 4 main revenue streams. My two favorites are in iron ore pelletization, and additive manufacturing (3d printing).\n\nThe iron ore thing is looking very good. There's some compelling evidence that these guys could be pursuing contracts to replace diesel burners with plasma torches with the biggest players in iron. This could be worth billions.\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing is the part that's got ARK's PRNT fund investing. Using plasma these guys can turn wire feed into powders used in 3d printing. Google 'Plasma Atomization'. Apparently the quality of their powders is awesome, and they make it cheaper than others can do it.\n\nThere's still the Waste Treatment and Dross recovery aspects at play too.\n\nAnother potential revenue gainer for Pyrogenesis in the future is a spin out company called HPQ Silicon. They use Pyrogenesis tech to turn quartz into nano silicon. They're thinking they make silicon small and stable enough to be used in EV battery anodes. It's earlier days there, but if silicon could supplant graphite in the EV supply chain, specifically HPQ's silicon, that could be massive. So far all their tests are coming back super positive. Pyro owns a large stake in HPQ and gets royalties on future profits. Pyro also holds an option to convert the royalties into a 50% ownership. So if HPQ works out as well as they think it will, that alone would be huge.",

        "body": "I've been invested in this company from about 60 cents. I've been doing DD on them for about 2 years. I recently wrote a long detailed post on the Agoracom forum on the bull case for them.\n\nHere were my 25 key points to hold the stonk to infinity:\n\nSome key fundamental points:\n\nPYR has $0 debt\n\nPYR has 159.15 mil shares outstanding fully diluted of which 76.95mil are owned by Peter and strategic entities. Most sites put the float at 51 mil shares of which most of it is owned by retail. Interactive Brokers shows virtually no institutional holdings yet. If institutions begin to list this in ETFs when the NASDAQ uplist happens, if they are passive etfs that buy to maintain weight, they will buy at any price to maintain that weight as money comes into the fund.\n\nIt is almost impossible to make a target for the stock price based on torch sales because there are just to many variables to consider. Selling price, margin, P/E multiple to apply, repeat sales over time, service contracts that go with the sale. But no matter how you crunch your own numbers, JUST looking at the conservative estimate for torch sales and no other business lines. It already justifies a higher SP than we are at currently in my own opinion. I believe margins are healthy on torches. We don't know exactly what they are and Peter SHOULD keep those secret as much as he can for shareholders benefit.\n\nDROSRITE\n\nHPQ Nano royalties with option to own 50% of the subsidiary\n\nUS Military service contracts\n\nPurevap technology\n\nAdditive Manufacturing, 3D powders\n\nThey are flush with cash currently, reducing risk (not eliminating) of a raise and dilution\n\nThe CEO still owns roughly 50% of the company. (This was one of my initial reasons for investing in the company 2 years ago. I like companies with large CEO ownership. Just a personal preference)\n\nThe Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) is active and PYR can buyback its own shares and cancel them, (like they did before, then reissue at a higher price, netting cash in hand) adding value to shareholders via float concentration.\n\n$40 mil backlog of signed contracts.\n\nSome key technical points:\n\nIt's the same 5 minute chart pattern everyday since the $4 breakout. Strong buying at open, MACD crosses bearish but the stock holds the line, goes sideways, and breaks back out near end of day or the next day. This feels like accumulation to me but I do not have access to net house metrics anymore to research this theory.\n\nRSI's are overbought, but the underlying fundamentals, and social analysis justify that in my opinion.\n\nWe were above the Upper Bollinger Band on the daily but we maintain the 20ma on all timeframes anytime there is a pullback. Now that it has consolidated, its setup nicely for new all time high.\n\nShort interest, from what I have access to, has not changed much since the start of the new year and is a small percentage of the shares outstanding on TSX. I don't expect a short squeeze is possible here.\n\nAverage volume has been increasing by about 70-100% since Feb 1st. Most days volumes are above the avg 10d volume before noon. This is another reason I put less weight to RSI being overbought. RSI SHOULD be overbought if the stock is strong. It's called RELATIVE strength indicator for that reason.\n\nThere are no option contracts on the stock yet. If options become available it can change the dynamic of how the stock price plays out. It also allows Robinhood traders to leverage their smaller positions and invest with smaller capital in the company. Options also make the stock more attractive to longs who want to write covered calls (like me) at their target price and collect premiums on their holdings while they wait for their target to hit.\n\nSome key social points:\n\n10-20 videos released talking about PYR in the last 2 weels\n\n300,000+ cumulative views on those so far. More will see them over the next few weeks as well.\n\nTwitter mentions have risen significantly.\n\nSearches for the term 'pyrogenesis stock' are now at their highest levels in 12 months. (Source: Google trends)\n\nSome of the larger Youtube personalities could start to cover the stock. The audience reach can grow significantly yet still.\n\nThere are no institutional analysts covering the stock yet. This can grow audience awareness significantly still.\n\nThere are a lot of US brokers that do not allow customers to buy OTC stocks. When PYRNF uplists to PYR on the NASDAQ the flood gates open to buyers but the float stays the same and the Level 2 books remain thin. I personally believe that when the uplist happens there will be literally MILLIONS more people who can buy the stock and have no shares to sell. This massively impacts the supply and demand metrics.\n\nPoint number 7 cannot be overstated in my opinion as one of the largest social impacts on the stock.\n\nIn the past when I have sold stock in companies too early, my biggest mistake was not putting enough weight the social impact can have on a stocks price. I now add 50-100% to my target that is allocated to the additional effect the social media impact can have in the new market.\n\nIf my fundamental fair value analysis target is $1 on a stock for example, I add 0.50 - $1.00 more for the social impact on top of that to my target.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI have increased my personal target for the stock significantly over the last week after doing a deeper analysis from 3 points of view.\n\n\nCredit to u/dhodgin",

Spoiler alert, company is 0-revenue.\n\nI prefer exposure through PYR, which just announced that they doubled their manufacturing surface for a reason that has not yet been announced, is about to uplist on the NASDAQ and is set to release an anticipated +200% yearly earning report with positive EPS. You get exposed to that potentially disruptive HPQ technology, but invest in a company that's better established and operational. With this said, the forecast P/E (my math) should still be in the 30x, so somewhat high.\n\nDisclaimer: PYR bagholder, former HPQ stockholder.",
