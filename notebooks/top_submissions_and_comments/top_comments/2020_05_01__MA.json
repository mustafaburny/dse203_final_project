The biggest thing in the last 4 weeks that I noticed was how many questions are asked by people who seem to want to be told what to put their money on. Which is fine, I tend to make a list of what's on a lot of radars as well. But when it came to making purchases, I needed the \"why.\" But I saw many reply with a \"Okay, im in @ .85!\" just a minute later, no questions asked. Please, just take 20 minutes, hell even 5 minutes of your time to do some digging. Go to the company's website, see if they have anything coming up on the calendar. Something. It makes all the difference in the world to have a clue about what you're getting into and your chances of it moving for better or worse. I felt awful about quite a few people selling IZEA Thursday morning because they wanted to cut their losses, though I had been holding IZEA since the previous week EXACTLY for Thursday afternoon because that was on the calendar.\n\nI'm not trying to be someone who knows better than another, I just don't want to see any of you guys getting yourselves screwed. The stronger we get as a community, the stronger we get as a whole. So take some time to Google/YouTube a few things. MACD, VWAP, MA, Volume, anything you don't have a full grasp on. It'll just add to your ass kicking arsenal and bolster your stock decisions.\n\nLastly, sorry for being long winded, but DON'T STAY IN FOR SOMETHING BIGGER. If your % goes up, take it. Don't think about what it could have been, take what it IS and gtfo. Even a little gain is still money added to your earnings. I'd take small gains forever over gambling on what ifs.

        "body": "We have 3 main credit card processors in the US - Mastercard, Visa and American Express. Both Mastercard and Visa are similar in how much they charge the vendor per transaction. American Express charges more. \n\nAmerican Express (historically) was a \"charge\" card, not a \"credit\" card. Such a card theoretically had no balance limit (though they could ultimately deny you), but the whole balance was due every month. There was no interest charge, and it had a number of benefits for card holders - free plane tickets, no foreign transaction fees, etc. This made it very attractive to people who could afford to pay their entire balance every month. Therefore, it has a reputation as being for \"elites.\"\n\nHowever, this has changed over the years. Because of their charges to the vendor, many places don't accept American Express, and others (like Costco) made aggressive arrangements for transactions to become an exclusive provider. Benefits have been cut, especially the ones like free flights that made having a card so attractive. They have been losing more and more business to Visa and MC over the years.\n\nIn the context of this story, almost every vendor accepts Visa, while many do not accept Amex. Even places that don't accept Visa always accept a Visa debit card (which is tied to a bank account). Neiman Marcus' inventory is expensive, and it would really not be prudent to carry around an amount of cash that would be required for a shopping trip there. ATMs generally only let you take out about $300 per day. So in so many ways, what they were saying was \"if you aren't well-to-do enough to have an American Express card, we don't want your business.\"",

        "body": "We have 3 main credit card processors in the US - Mastercard, Visa and American Express. Both Mastercard and Visa are similar in how much they charge the vendor per transaction. American Express charges more. \n\nAmerican Express (historically) was a \"charge\" card, not a \"credit\" card. Such a card theoretically had no balance limit (though they could ultimately deny you), but the whole balance was due every month. There was no interest charge, and it had a number of benefits for card holders - free plane tickets, no foreign transaction fees, etc. This made it very attractive to people who could afford to pay their entire balance every month. Therefore, it has a reputation as being for \"elites.\"\n\nHowever, this has changed over the years. Because of their charges to the vendor, many places don't accept American Express, and others (like Costco) made aggressive arrangements for transactions to become an exclusive provider. Benefits have been cut, especially the ones like free flights that made having a card so attractive. They have been losing more and more business to Visa and MC over the years.\n\nIn the context of this story, almost every vendor accepts Visa, while many do not accept Amex. Even places that don't accept Visa always accept a Visa debit card (which is tied to a bank account). Neiman Marcus' inventory is expensive, and it would really not be prudent to carry around an amount of cash that would be required for a shopping trip there. ATMs generally only let you take out about $300 per day. So in so many ways, what they were saying was \"if you aren't well-to-do enough to have an American Express card, we don't want your business.\"",

How do you know when Visa is high relative to MasterCard? You run linear regression between V and MA using say, a 20 day window to create a \u201cspread\u201d that is a combination of V and MA.

Post-Market is also down, so buyers aren't really stepping in yet. I don't know. News wasn't great today, but I think people are just taking profit. It will probably bounce around the 25 day MA, ~282. If it breaks that tomorrow... The 50 MA is around 271, which would be the next likely bounce.\n\nThe market is weakening, and things look over bought. But so long as buyers are stepping up, the market can stay inflated. \n\nIf futures aren't down horribly in the morning, I'd look at buying calls if spy hits 283 for target about 287. We'll possibly get 2 green days out of this, so expiration 5/15 or 5/18, and unload before close. Maybe pickup a few puts early on around 270 with expiration in early June, JIC it does break the 25 day MA. Though, I think the ship might have sallied on that, given the price.\n\nThat would be my play on this.",

It explains why there's more open interest for strikes at denominations of ten than other strikes.\n\nI hear what the OP is saying and I somewhat agree to a certain extent. I've been speaking to people who try to explain historical data using TA, and it's accurate when they're talking about it but ask them to predict where the price is going to move tomorrow and they're wrong usually, based on the number of predictions they make.\n\nSo, they make a few assumptions, one has to be correct - and that's the rub, which assumption is the correct one?\n\nThat's incredibly difficult to tell. So it's where the OP loses a little steam. TA functions like a hypothesis in a science experiment. The variables are controlled by the people with the most money to shift prices. For the rest of us, we just have to scavenge (there's nothing wrong with that).\n\nI think it kind of ends up being a catch-22. If the stock price is above the 200 day moving average, the big fish say \"RIGHT, it's overbought, time to regress\" then they mass sell to the MA(or even further below). \n\nBut we use the moving average to validate that move because it's overbought. The reality is that it wasn't really overbought, it could go higher if it wanted, but \"they\" decided to hedge and pull it down, hence making you think the MA acts as a support and resistance line. When in fact it just trails what the stock price was.\n\nWow, that was longer than I thought.",

        "body": "&gt;Can you explain this? The US industry has been outsourced a lot, how is it industrially powerful?\n\nYes the US produces and licenses several of the most critical technologies around the world. Take semiconductors, the EDA semiconductor design market is controlled by primarily by two American companies Cadence and Synopsys. Without it chips couldn't even be designed. In semiconductor equipment manufacturing USA has KLA Tencor, AM and Lam which are essential to producing chips. This is just one example in the semiconductor industry and the US has several other companies producing high value content and products for the world.\n\nThe US only outsource the low value and admin stuff to developing countries to do as these products are of low Gross Margin or low cost contribution. This makes sense commercially since given future industry is driven by high value industries like high technology manufacturing and digital computing so naturally firms will focus more on . This is also one of the core reason why Trump and China hawks want to fight China as they seek to deny or slow China's ability to domestically produce high value goods such as semiconductors and supercomputers. \n\nIn fact US components are so important that you can even see their impact on companies like Huawei who has stated that it is hard to live without US components. This is why US is industrially powerful. Their products are critical to building modern day technologies and without it it is very hard to live without them.\n\n&gt;It's mostly services, but I don't see how one can say the US doesn't rely on imports with a straight face.\n\nYes but imports to the US are mainly low value products . Low value products have low cost contribution and the main Gross Profit is retained by the firm who outsources the production of the product. US doesn't really rely on imports in the sense that the US does not need to import any high tech products from anywhere as the US has the domestic capability to mass produce high tech goods efficiently.\n\nLook at China they rely on imports to survive. Without semiconductors the Chinese technology space will literally come to a grinding halt. This has been mentioned by Jack Ma before when he was in Japan where he referenced the US control over core technologies like semiconductor. This is why the US does not rely on imports since they are technologically self sufficient.",
