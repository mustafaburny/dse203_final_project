The biggest thing in the last 4 weeks that I noticed was how many questions are asked by people who seem to want to be told what to put their money on. Which is fine, I tend to make a list of what's on a lot of radars as well. But when it came to making purchases, I needed the \"why.\" But I saw many reply with a \"Okay, im in @ .85!\" just a minute later, no questions asked. Please, just take 20 minutes, hell even 5 minutes of your time to do some digging. Go to the company's website, see if they have anything coming up on the calendar. Something. It makes all the difference in the world to have a clue about what you're getting into and your chances of it moving for better or worse. I felt awful about quite a few people selling IZEA Thursday morning because they wanted to cut their losses, though I had been holding IZEA since the previous week EXACTLY for Thursday afternoon because that was on the calendar.\n\nI'm not trying to be someone who knows better than another, I just don't want to see any of you guys getting yourselves screwed. The stronger we get as a community, the stronger we get as a whole. So take some time to Google/YouTube a few things. MACD, VWAP, MA, Volume, anything you don't have a full grasp on. It'll just add to your ass kicking arsenal and bolster your stock decisions.\n\nLastly, sorry for being long winded, but DON'T STAY IN FOR SOMETHING BIGGER. If your % goes up, take it. Don't think about what it could have been, take what it IS and gtfo. Even a little gain is still money added to your earnings. I'd take small gains forever over gambling on what ifs.

        "body": "We have 3 main credit card processors in the US - Mastercard, Visa and American Express. Both Mastercard and Visa are similar in how much they charge the vendor per transaction. American Express charges more. \n\nAmerican Express (historically) was a \"charge\" card, not a \"credit\" card. Such a card theoretically had no balance limit (though they could ultimately deny you), but the whole balance was due every month. There was no interest charge, and it had a number of benefits for card holders - free plane tickets, no foreign transaction fees, etc. This made it very attractive to people who could afford to pay their entire balance every month. Therefore, it has a reputation as being for \"elites.\"\n\nHowever, this has changed over the years. Because of their charges to the vendor, many places don't accept American Express, and others (like Costco) made aggressive arrangements for transactions to become an exclusive provider. Benefits have been cut, especially the ones like free flights that made having a card so attractive. They have been losing more and more business to Visa and MC over the years.\n\nIn the context of this story, almost every vendor accepts Visa, while many do not accept Amex. Even places that don't accept Visa always accept a Visa debit card (which is tied to a bank account). Neiman Marcus' inventory is expensive, and it would really not be prudent to carry around an amount of cash that would be required for a shopping trip there. ATMs generally only let you take out about $300 per day. So in so many ways, what they were saying was \"if you aren't well-to-do enough to have an American Express card, we don't want your business.\"",

Post-Market is also down, so buyers aren't really stepping in yet. I don't know. News wasn't great today, but I think people are just taking profit. It will probably bounce around the 25 day MA, ~282. If it breaks that tomorrow... The 50 MA is around 271, which would be the next likely bounce.\n\nThe market is weakening, and things look over bought. But so long as buyers are stepping up, the market can stay inflated. \n\nIf futures aren't down horribly in the morning, I'd look at buying calls if spy hits 283 for target about 287. We'll possibly get 2 green days out of this, so expiration 5/15 or 5/18, and unload before close. Maybe pickup a few puts early on around 270 with expiration in early June, JIC it does break the 25 day MA. Though, I think the ship might have sallied on that, given the price.\n\nThat would be my play on this.",

You can view a bunch of different indicator overlays: MA, RSI, etc. The desktop app has a solid market screener. But, it takes time to learn what you like and put all that info to use. Honestly, I would just go with what you are comfortable with. Nothing wrong with RH. You do miss out on some extended hours trade availability. But if that doesn't bother you just go with what you like. I used RH for 2 years before moving to Webull about 2 months ago.",

If you look closer you can see that we have broken down out of this wedge which is extremely bearish. I believe that the end of day pump today was the last attempt to break back into the wedge channel, however we were unable to do so. I believe that a big dump is coming almost back to the 220 level.
