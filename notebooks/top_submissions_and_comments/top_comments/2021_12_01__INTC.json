So the idea that they are dead in the water or can't compete is plain wrong. \n\nTheir GPUs aren't looking too good right now but they are coming pretty soon. They can fill a gap in the GPU market for lower cost GPUs. \n\nI have a sizeable position in Intel and I have a smaller one in AMD. I will be looking at Intel's and AMD's server CPU and discrete GPU offerings next year to determine which position I will be expanding. Both look promising but Intel looks like it will offer a lot more value long term. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC you might want to open positions with all of them. Betting that the 4 of them will do well is probably a pretty safe bet. I would also look at MU, that's another position that I like right now.

This is likely symptomatic of a late-stage principal-agent problem -- something that can fester for long periods of time in well-to-do companies relying on past laurels. If it continues, capital will be leeched off shareholders via equity fund raising based on the possibly-never-fulfilled promise of regaining their past glory. At this stage, investors who have a accurate gauge of the shareholder orientated-ness of management &amp; key tech contributors will have an edge (i.e. confidence that they're buying an under-valued stock).",

You can't see it, but it's there.\n\nA company with no profits is highly valued only if investors believe it will become profitable in the future, after a period of product development, market share growth, whatever. In tech at least, this has been the norm for decades. You run on venture capital, then sometimes you IPO before you monetize. It doesn't mean stock price is independent of performance, but rather that the relevant performance hasn't happened yet. \n\nWhen a stock is valued higher than that of established companies, as you describe, it's because investors expect the new company someday to be more profitable than the mature company, whose growth is tangibly baked into its share price. This is the path of Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, Microsoft, and hundreds of other large, highly profitable companies, many of which are now themselves mature and even pay dividends. \n\nAmazon didn't turn a profit for quite a few years after going public. It wanted to gain market share, it explained that to its investors, and the model worked quite nicely. \n\nThis is why, for instance, the P/E of the average tech company is normally higher than that of companies in other sectors.

        "body": "Idk, I do here a lot of people talking about VZ. The problem I have with VZ though is that it has flat revenue growth and a lot of debt. However if your ok with it then its a really good buy.\n\nOther then that maybe CVS if you think they can keep up the earnings. Its trading at a pretty reasonable P/E and the company has been doing pretty well fundamentally.\n\nOverall I just really like INTC and LMT because both these companies make a lot of money and increase earnings every year but are trading at really low valuations. I also really like their futures. Intel is building factories and do a lot if AI stuff for companies. Lockheed Martin builds spacecraft and satellites for the US government, NASA, and Blue Origin. I see Space as playing a huge role in the future.",

A discrete GPU, a graphics card, requires fairly different architecture to be an effective competitor. Different architecture also means a different production process, so we'll see if Intel can manage to work out the kinks in that before producing their first GPU on the market.",

Like Luckin Coffee that shot up and then crash down.\n\nI personally believe there is no point and the extra crazy CCP factor is too much for me. Just see the ARM chip company that work in China. ARM doesn't produce chip they license their ISA, instruction set architecture. You can think of ISA as CPU language. AMD and Intel are mostly x86 (and extended 64 but ignore that for simplicity). \n\nAny company that wants to deal with China have to coop with a Chinese company. Arm did that with a company and that company went rogue apparently. ARM is basically locked out of that market and they got fuuuucked. ARM is own by softbank last I check. Softbank tried to sell it to Nvidia but I personally think they're fucking dumb. Just like the dumb wework investment.",
