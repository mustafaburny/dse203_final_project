        "body": "The difference between trading versus investing right in front of our eyes .\nThank you for the post because it shows you learned something . Slow down your trades and take a pause and regroup . Invest in undervalued with good growth and hang on or just go with an index ETF .it is boring letting your money grow on its own but its also much easier and generates much less transaction fees along with its easier to file your tax return each year .\nThat trading mentality takes a while to control but it can be done . \nI would rather hold smaller portions of 25 stocks then large portions of 3 stocks.\nI don't don't think about diversification in the same way others might . I use 5 stocks as a minimum per sector \nAmd Nvidia ON intc qrvo as an example for semi conductors.  Pick any sector and find your favorite 5 \nIt takes time to do this .\nI'm sorry though that after 15 years your still negative on your account. \nI'd wait until next year before investing in anything \nLet this market get extremely oversold and then  after your break and time to regroup and come up with a new longer term strategy use the next 3 years to implement that new strategy. \nTrading is about being disaplinned number 1 \nSwing trading longer term trades and disaplinned with wider parameters . \nLong term investing also disaplined and like swing trading wider parameters .\nAfter 15 years of trading I'll assume you grasp the basics. \nSo stick to daily weekly and monthly charts and learn to look at quarterly or even years charts .\nThe patterns are the same the entry and exit points are the same . The difference is how long it takes for the pattern to set up and develop and how long it takes before the move is complete. \nUse the next several months to take in your 15 years of experience and re design it on paper by writing it all down without even looking at a chart. \nThen just learn to wait and be bored .\nThe waiting is the hardest part ! \nGood luck no matter what choice you make",

Though not only Valdez  but dropping 70% in two years recently. Not only did I hold, I added a little more (although not much to be honest. Mostly done adding to Exxon). \n\nAlso just to clarify those companies I listed were for a reason. Everyone pretends like it\u2019s hard but I\u2019m showing you it\u2019s not. Pick any of the top ten companies in the country or world and you are likely to dominate the average. We have known for 50+ years that Exxon has its hands in government pockets. Easy pick. We\u2019ve known for 30 years that Microsoft would rule the PC world. You could have waited 20 years \u201cjust to make sure\u201d before increasing and you would destroy the S&amp;P. How about Walmart? Amazon? Apple? Disney? We always know that these companies control their sectors. You did not need to invest day one to make money. You just need to invest in good companies that make money consistently.",

        "body": "We are talking multiple years here if not decades. Companies like Exxon. a.) They are in a dying industry and have been unsuccessful in pivoting away from fossil fuels to alternative sources of revenue. b.) They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",

Using 5-year averages on earnings, or revenue only is dumb unless you think the company is going to regress on it's revenue.  \n\nAt one point they're averaging FCF for the last 5 years and comparing that to current market cap.  That just simply doesn't work when FCF today is nearly double what it was 5 years ago, and it's not only still growing - but it's still accelerating.  The fact that MSFT had 34B in free cash flow in 2016 is completely irrelevant to the stock's price today, where they have 56B in FCF.   \n\nThe way these guys are coming up with their valuations are as if MSFT isn't growing any more - it's more useful when looking at mature dividend companies, but it's not really a good way to value a company that is going to aggressively grow for the next 5-10 years.",
