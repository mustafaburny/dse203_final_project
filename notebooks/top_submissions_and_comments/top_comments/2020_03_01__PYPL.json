        "body": "Hi friend, I have a degree in finance. You have many many years in front of you. \n\nWhen you start investing, be a YOLO baller 90% of the time and be smart with money 10% of the time. You\u2019re young and have your whole fucking career ahead of you to make \u201csmart money\u201d and be \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d \n\nMake risky, stupid, dumb decisions while you are young. When you hit age 30 start switching to safer choices to invest in. \n\nIf you invest $200 nine times and lose it every time (-$1800), but then that final tenth time you have the same luck (and somewhat skill) as the guy you replied to, you would have $6,000 off of that one YOLO. $6000-$1800 = $4200 profit! \n\nRecommendation: Read in here and do the paper trading game in the sub, ask questions, then start YOLOing $100 every month or two on an idea you feel confident about. \n\nThis isn\u2019t gambling. This is educated guessing done with real research. Don\u2019t get emotional. Don\u2019t \u201cdouble down\u201d to make up for losses. When you fuck up and the first 4 YOLOs expire worthless figure out why it happened and what you should\u2019ve done differently. \n\nGet smart, stay hungry, and keep learning. Most importantly, never doubt your vibe. \n\nBonus tip: Set up a paypal and apply for a paypal cash card. Paypal Cash card will make your PayPal account like a checking account, and it\u2019s a checking account that you can deposit your money into that is hidden from your parents. Parents don\u2019t like seeing their kids yoloing money in Robinhood every couple months.",

Autism Speaks spends 10x as much\u201416%\u2014on fundraising. Although Autism Speaks has not prioritized services with a practical impact for families and individuals in its budget, its rates of executive pay are the highest in the autism world: some salaries exceed $500,000 a year.\n\n**Autism Speaks talks about us without us.**\n\nAutism Speaks has only 2 autistic people out of a total of 26 individuals on its Board of Directors. By contrast, 19 out of 26 board members represent major corporations, including current and former CEOs and senior executives of PayPal, Samsung, CBS, Goldman Sachs, White Castle, Viacom, American Express, FX Networks, Virgin Mobile, SiriusXM, and Sprint.\n\n**Autism Speaks\u2019 fundraising strategies promote fear, stigma, and prejudice against autistic people.**\n\nAutism Speaks uses its platform and advertising budget to portray autism and autistic people as mysterious and frightening. Their fundraising tactics increase stigma and create barriers to the inclusion of autistic people in our communities.",
