Autism Speaks spends 10x as much\u201416%\u2014on fundraising. Although Autism Speaks has not prioritized services with a practical impact for families and individuals in its budget, its rates of executive pay are the highest in the autism world: some salaries exceed $500,000 a year.\n\n**Autism Speaks talks about us without us.**\n\nAutism Speaks has only 2 autistic people out of a total of 26 individuals on its Board of Directors. By contrast, 19 out of 26 board members represent major corporations, including current and former CEOs and senior executives of PayPal, Samsung, CBS, Goldman Sachs, White Castle, Viacom, American Express, FX Networks, Virgin Mobile, SiriusXM, and Sprint.\n\n**Autism Speaks\u2019 fundraising strategies promote fear, stigma, and prejudice against autistic people.**\n\nAutism Speaks uses its platform and advertising budget to portray autism and autistic people as mysterious and frightening. Their fundraising tactics increase stigma and create barriers to the inclusion of autistic people in our communities.",

        "body": "If you are trying to learn more about investing in companies then I definitely think that you should be picking individual stocks! If not, then an ETF as some others have recommended would be fine.\n\nBut a stock I recommend is **PayPal**. It has an overall strong balance sheet in regards to assets-liabilities, their overall net income y/y increased by 26.2% (income statement) and they are actively utilizing cash flow for further acquisitions and investments which proved to be successful in 2019.\n\nOther than the numbers (which are excellent if you look at their financial statements) I am very excited about their investments and acquisitions.\n\nPayPal is the financial version of Facebook (but smaller). The parent company is not super cool and/or flashy but the revenue and bottom line net income is strong and its acquisitions are excellent.\n\nVenmo processed over $29 billion in the fourth quarter alone which is a 56% y/y increase and its user base is consistently growing; it is not profitable yet, but the amount of growth that it has seen is great and is allowing PayPal to scale as it integrates its users; they have also landed deals with some companies in regards to using Venmo for purchases at stores. The fact that its functionality stems from it being a digital wallet is very innovative and convenient and is able to be utilized on a daily basis; this is excellent for retaining users (mostly young people are using it but now even older people are beginning to do so as well).\n\nThey also acquired Honey which is a means for PayPal to further acquire more users and to make them more relevant on a day-to-day basis as it is with Venmo; they saved users over $1 billion over the year and will see more users that can be integrated into Paypal's business model as time goes on (relatively new investment).\n\nAcquiring a 70% stake in GoPay (a Chinese payment processing company) was monumental for the company as discussed in their earnings call. China processes trillions of dollars in transactions in online payments and PayPal is now the **FIRST** American company in China to provide online payment services!\n\nMany people wonder about Plaid and how it will affect PayPal regarding competition, but PayPal has a stake in Plaid and is working with Visa to figure out ways to best utilize it; if their competition wins, so does PayPal.\n\nOverall, PayPal has plenty of room for growth; their goal is to be relevant on a day-to-day basis and retain users and this will likely play out well for them EVEN when regarding a slow-down as we transition further away from cash. (Paypal revised guidance during the CV outbreak and slashed **only 1 percentage point of original estimates!!)**\n\nThe price has come down a lot and is looking more and more attractive.Best of luck!",

VISA $125, Ma $175, Orcl $35. That\u2019s if the sell off continues and it seems as though it will.

        "body": "&gt; Why is it unacceptable to take grant money / tax incentives?\n\nBecause he has a habit of overpromising and underdelivering. We should not be incentivizing people with way more money than they could ever spend in a lifetime to deliver broken shit in exchange for money coming out of the public purse, especially when said money would otherwise go to real public works projects.\n\nAs for tax incentives, that's whole other discussion which is independent of Elon himself.\n\n&gt;He's kind of a maverick. That kind of guy tends to ruffle the feathers of the orthodox.\n\nThen he can keep doing that with things like PayPal where the risk to the public doesn't come in the form of a self-guided flying bomb that can easily flatten 3 city blocks if something goes wrong. If he's gonna take money from the public purse he needs to be held to some bloody standards beyond the fawning praise that Reddit showers on this guy.\n\n&gt;Your first paragraph is opinion, your second is about how you don't think he has good ideas, and the last one is rumors and hearsay.\n\nI work with launch vehicles for my day job. This isn't me spitballing, I've seen this kind of disregard for established standards first hand and heard it directly from people close to the actual problem. I've also been following the crew dragon explosion since it happened.\n\nAs for the whole bit about the hyperloop, if you don't believe me, just read the analysis by the damn experts who picked this harebrained idea apart. Hell, the youtuber Thunderf00t did a very thorough takedown of the technical issues if you want to hear it from a guy with a PhD. And again, I want to emphasize he is effectively sucking the oxygen out of the room when it comes to solving real issues, which prolongs how long the problems last.\n\nAnd I haven't even gotten into how he treats his workers.\n\n&gt;I suspect that when public opinion went against the guy, you went along for the ride and you're not even sure why.\n\nGuess again sugar. I remember when he was harassing independent engineers with lawsuit threats when they threatened to go public with evidence that his company was lying to the government. That was a decade ago.\n\n&gt;Would you say that you're anti-capitalist?\n\nBingo!",
