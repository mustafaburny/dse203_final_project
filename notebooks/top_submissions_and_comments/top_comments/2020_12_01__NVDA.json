I dont buy every stock that they recommend but most of the stocks in my portfolio I received from them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I got in super early in TSLA at split adjusted price of $6 lol because it was mentioned by Motley Fools\n\nAMZN, MELI, FB, NFLX, NVDA, etc. If you had invested in some of the companies they have put in their newsletter when it first came out, you would be very wealthy lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt really sounds like you made a quick judgement, or an assumption with very few data to back it up. There are not enough followers of Motley Fools to be able to move the needle that much in my opinion. While I do notice a lot of the stocks that they recommend tend to be up by the time they announced it, but this can be because the stocks they recommend have more up days than  down days on average.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt could also possibly be that they have several picks ready and release the ones that are green that day to possibly look better? There are many reasons this could be. Your small sample of data is too small to conclude on, I hope you dont use this type of analysis to choose stocks.",

The price of the June 18 QQQ call is ~ $5.70 which buttresses your point even more. \n\nAnd you can see this from their IV: QQQJ has an IV of 28% while QQQ has an IV of 21%. So yes, all things being equal, QQQ is cheaper than QQQJ.\n\nAll that said, I am still balls deep in QQQJ calls because I believe over the next year, it will outperform QQQ for the reason OP stated: it has many more beaten down companies than QQQ. The big boys in QQQ have all recovered for the most part. Another crucial point is that QQQJ has more non-tech companies so if there is a rotation out of tech, it will suffer less than QQQ.\n\nI'm very bullish about this etf. I saw a WSJ article where someone did a historic backtest from 2016 or 2017 and QQQJ outperformed QQQ even with the insane run of the big boys MSFT, AAPL, NVDA &amp; ADBE during that period.",

They are not going out of business.\n\nThey were only 2% away from being profitable this quarter while covid hurt their business.  They have a high density of stores that cost money to lease. They are shutting 1000 stores. So instead of 20 in a city they will have 5 to 10 best performing stores.  If nothing else changes they will be profitable from the reduction in lease expense alone. The stock is back to where it was 8 trading days ago the day before Thanksgiving.\n\nOther things are changing. If you plan on being successful in investing you need to do a little more research and understand why people that have earned a million dollars are investing in GME.  Not everyone wants to throw their money in a meme stock and hope they don't get burned. \n\n I actually view this as a pretty low risk play.  I have $70k in it.  I was up $27k at close today.  My guess is I will be even again tomorrow.  I did sell all my Dec calls today before close so have already booked profit.\n\nI have money in AMD, Fsly $100k in (which shot up today), PLTR $89k in (which shot up yesterday), Adbe, Nvda, Logi, Splk etc.  You can make money in almost any stock with patience and understanding trends. I am up 90% since June 1st.  Max reward with minimum risk.\n\n15% down is a correction.

So may not see huge growth and if lockdowns subside soon? Gaming will likely slowdown and all gaming stocks will be headed down. Still I believe it will hit $45 by Jan. and level off around $38-40. Still upside even if growth is not much. This is just my take. Please research yourself though.",

        "body": "Full Bloomberg article (ya boy has a terminal):\n\n(Bloomberg) --Microsoft Corp. is working on in-house processor designs for use in server computers that run the company\u2019s cloud services, adding to an industrywide effort to reduce reliance on Intel Corp.\u2019s chip technology.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest software maker is using Arm Ltd. designs to produce a processor that will be used in its data centers, according to people familiar with the plans. It\u2019s also exploring using another chip that would power some of its Surface line of personal computers. The people asked not to be identified discussing private initiatives.\n\nThe move is a major commitment by Microsoft to supplying itself with the most important piece of the hardware it uses. Cloud-computing rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. are already well down the road with similar efforts. They\u2019ve argued their chips are better suited to some of their needs, bringing cost and performance advantages over off-the-shelf silicon primarily provided by Intel.\nMicrosoft\u2019s efforts are more likely to result in a server chip than one for its Surface devices, though the latter is possible, said one of the people. The company\u2019s chip design unit reports to Jason Zander, head of the Azure cloud business, rather than Panos Panay, who oversees Surface products. Representatives of Microsoft and Arm declined to comment.\n\nMicrosoft has stepped up hiring of processor engineers in recent years, recruiting in the backyard of chipmakers such as Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Nvidia Corp. and among those cut adrift when Qualcomm Inc. abandoned its server chip efforts.\n\nIntel\u2019s Xeon range of server chips currently power most of the machinery at the heart of the internet and corporate networks, generating the company\u2019s most profitable source of revenue. It still has about 90% of this market, despite recent gains by AMD. Some Xeon models cost as much as a compact car.\n\nCustomers such as Microsoft have increasingly turned to alternative solutions to make sense of the mountain of data that cloud computing and smartphones generate. The adoption of artificial intelligence to automate that process has sparked a flood of new chip designs. The biggest concern for owners of the giant data centers behind services like Office 365 has become the cost of providing electricity to their growing hardware footprint. Arm-based chips are often more energy efficient.\n\nIf Microsoft pushes forward with its own chip for PCs it will be following Apple Inc., which is moving its entire Mac line away from Intel processors. While neither Apple nor Microsoft devices own large chunks of the PC market, their offerings are positioned as premium products with slicker designs and more advanced capabilities. When announcing its first new Macs based on the M1 chip, Apple touted the performance boost compared to standard PCs.\n\nMicrosoft currently uses Arm-based chips from Qualcomm in some of its Surface PCs. It ported Windows to work on these types of chips, which have typically been used in smartphones. Apple also uses Arm technology in its processors. Other Surface models use Intel chips.",
