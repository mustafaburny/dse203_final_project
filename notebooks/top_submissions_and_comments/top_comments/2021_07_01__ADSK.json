It may also be a good play with more technical folks doing gig-work on the side as well.  I'm an engineer that recently started doing work on the side and I know there are lot of people my age doing the same thing.  AutoDesk is a safe bet but there are newer software applications for technical marketing and such that will be higher growth.",
