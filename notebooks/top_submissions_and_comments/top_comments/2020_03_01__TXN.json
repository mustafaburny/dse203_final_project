Anywhere below S&amp;P 2300 starts to present some really good long-term buying opportunities.\n\nBottoming is a process, and markets typically never bottom on days like today or last Thursday/Friday.\n\nBut a lot of crucial things happened in the past 24 hours: the Fed threw the whole recession fighting toolkit at the wall and Trump finally appears to have publicly acknowledged the real scope of the problem along with basically saying that we're in one of the worst case scenarios with this coronavirus slowdown/shutdown probably extending all the way to July/August.\n\nMarkets price in events based on expectations, and now we're getting to the point where the horror show that April/May will bring on the coronavirus front is really beginning to get priced into expectations.\n\nSo that's why I think it's starting to become likely that we find a bottom before April.  Of course, after that I'm skeptical of any sort of V-shaped recovery (we might get a mini-V 200+ point gain off a downside overshoot to S&amp;P 2000-2100) but I expect a lot of choppiness and sidewards movement that will benefit theta/cash gang until late May.",

        "author": "Starcraftduder",
        "body": "I'd like to add on to your post with something I posted on another thread:\n\nA month ago I posted a thread making the argument that the global economy would enter a serious downturn unless two things happened: 1) a treatment for the new coronavirus was developed immediately 2) a vaccine is developed by the next flu season\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1fm6y/the_world_economy_will_enter_a_serious_downturn/\n\nThe reasoning hinged on whether the characteristics of the virus was dangerous enough to change the behavior of economic actors. We've had past scares like H1N1 or ebola that didn't have any major impact. But my it seemed clear that the characteristics of this new virus was disruptive and dangerous enough to seriously affect the behavior of economic actors and thus negatively impact the economy as a whole. Here's some highlights of what was discussed:\n\n&gt;This is why I said for nCoV to \"blow over\", an affordable treatment needs to be developed pretty much right now. Think about it, who would unnecessarily risk a trip to the movies or take a vacation with the risk of a catching HIGHLY infectious disease that spreads in many ways and spreads asymptomatically and can outright KILL you at up to a 25% probability without hospitalization?\n\n&gt;**Affordable and effective treatment SOON and vaccines before the next flu seasons are crucial to avoiding lasting economic decline**\n\n&gt;But why would there be economic decline? Well, because people will change their behavior as long as the threat of the virus remains. Let's look at what industries will be affected:\n\n- All tourism industry related businesses in Asia will take a huge hit. I'm talking about airlines, hotels, tours, restaurants, tourist destinations, markets, etc.\n\n- Reports already show that business declined by as much as 80% in some tourism driven markets in Thailand. Overall air traffic in China has shrunk from over 17,000 daily flights to 5,000. Hotels, cruises, flights are getting canceled left and right.\n\n- **Many businesses that run on tight margins and those with complex supply chains and a Just-in-Time manufacturing strategy will be seriously hit by this and may even have to file for bankruptcy.** Let's take something like restaurants into consideration. The ones who specialize in deliveries may actually thrive in this market but most restaurants that depend on foot traffic or has high markups and depend on ambience to attract customers will suffer or shutter. They have to keep paying expensive rent and other overhead costs while customers may take months to slowly return. \n\n- **Expect a lot of businesses to start massive layoffs.** Vulnerable Asian airlines will be first. Many airlines like China Airline are already halting recruiting new flight attendants. Others like Cathay Pacific which has negative operating cash flow are asking their crew to take up to month long unpaid leave. They are canceling up to 50% of their flights stretching into at least march. How can they possibly remove the threat of this virus if no treatment/vaccine has been developed? The reason they are shutting down flights will therefore persist, and they will suffer a prolonged period of diminished business.\n\n- **America and the West will also feel the reverberations of China's hard fall.** The ways that the West's economy is tied to China's is too much to even try to list. But just understand that the biggest growth of profit over the last 20 years for many of the largest companies have come from China's consumer class. If that consumer class is not buying stuff, stocks will tank. Companies that spent the last 10 years using cheap debt to finance growth may go into bankruptcy when they are faced from such a drastic and sudden dip in their business. Expect all the weak poorly run businesses to get shaken up and many of them failing in the coming months. \n\n- There will be a feedback loop. There are many industries we can FOR SURE predict big problems for in 2020. We are guaranteed to see layoffs in airlines (especially Asian airlines) in the coming months. Set a reminder on this comment if you don't believe. I can even name you specific companies that will probably go bankrupt.\n\n- **Layoffs will compound upon itself. When airlines, hotels, restaurants, malls, etc are firing workers, the workers won't have money to spend on buying things. This means other businesses may suffer enough to also start firing some workers. Businesses in 2020 overall are so overleveraged that a large percentage of them are not going to be able to handle even a few months of lower business.** They simply can't pay all the expenses and the debt obligation.\n\n&gt;So if my logic and assumptions are correct, we are looking at an inescapable catastrophe for the Asian tourism industry at the very least. Just in Time manufacturing keep about 2 weeks worth of parts. Most businesses already adjusted their supplies to account for the normal Chinese New Year shutdown. We are now coming up on the limits of most JIT supplies. So expect some pretty bad news to be coming out this week and especially by later this month. I'm seeing pretty big dips in the stock market by April. Probably -15% by April and up to -35% by the end of the year. This will be our \"dip\".\n\nAfter I posted this thread, the market (American) went on to make record breaking all time highs. I believe a few things are responsible for this:\n\n- Capital flight from Asia\n\n- Monetary actions from China and other nations\n\n- Poor modeling of previous \"health scares\" including the much talked about \"V-shaped recovery\"\n\n- Use of lagging indicators. There is still news coming out of \"positive economic news\" like ones regarding unemployment.\n\n- Downplay of the virus by governments and international health organization WHO\n\n- Pure ignorance (this was the \"it's just the flu\" period)\n\nAfter a month, we've come to find out some more information about the virus. Some are bad but there are some good news as well.\n\n**Let's start with the good news:**\n\n- Various currently available drugs like Chloroquine have shown efficacy in treating infected patients. Don't expect peer reviewed studies anytime soon, this is just based on what was observed in China where health officials tried throwing all types of drugs at it until they noticed Chloroquine seems to work.\n\n- [Speculation] Heat and humidity may play a part in slowing the spread of the virus: see Singapore, India where they have tested a significant number of patients. Singapore is especially transparent and aggressive in finding cases. If they can contain this as a travel hub, then they may have a roadmap for our own containment once the weather warms. Other coronaviruses also slowed in heat\n\n- [Speculation] Diet may play a part in the spread of the virus. Indian diet rich in Curcumin/Turmeric may have an advantage in either fighting infection or dealing with the symptoms of infection. Hundreds of Indian students were evacuated from the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak and not a single one was infected after quarantine and testing.\n\n- Let's all hope the weather can give the Northern Hemisphere some much needed help in combating this virus (stay out of the Southern Hemisphere)\n\n**Now some bad news:**\n\n- [Controversial] The virus may have mutated at least once. The newer strain is more aggressive. This was a fear that was talked about in the thread from a month ago:\n\n&gt;RNA viruses like nCoV mutates extremely quickly. This means potential resistance or immunization from catching nCoV once may be lost if the virus mutates enough. This also means that there may never be permanent immunization. Any vaccine developed for it may only be effective for a portion of the mutations. And each flu season may bring many different strains of this virus that will be unaffected by developed vaccines. In other words, nCoV may be here to stay, much like other flu viruses.\n\n- It is being reported that it is possible to catch both strains at once (Chinese Journal National Science Review)\n\n- [Speculation] Guangdong reports up to 13% of patients tested positive for virus again weeks after \"recovering\". There are many possible explanations for this, some are benign but there have been several reports from health officials in various parts of China that they're seeing reinfection. Some viruses, the ones that target and manipulate the immune system response, cause more damage the second/third+ time of infection. Some diseases use our antibodies to cause more damage. \n\n- Patients who \"recovered\" from the virus including the recent man in his 30's die after recovery. There is lasting lunge damage in some patients. This means worse lunge function and injuries that allow for opportunistic infections.\n\n- WHO saying around 20% of infected cases require hospitalization. These patients have pneumonia and will drown in lunge liquid if they don't get on ventilators or as a worst case scenario ECMO machines. There are 300 ECMO machines in America. \n\n- Very little has been done to contain virus spread in America. Up to a few days ago, only 500 have been tested compared to tens of thousands in South Korea, a nation a fraction the size/wealth of us. For over a month since China shut its country down, we didn't even have a working test kit. The earlier one was defective.\n\n**Will things get better or worse?**\n\n- For America, things will get much worse before it gets better.",

        "body": "- This is not like the previous financial crises. With financial crises, we didn't have overrun healthcare systems, quarantines, and persistent danger of dangerous infectious disease to worry about. The economic impact will be dragged out because of the nature of this virus.\n\n- The biggest danger is that this virus mutates into more strains. This makes vaccination far less effective. If this virus retains its deadliness and persists as a seasonal flu, then we are looking at a potentially permanent shift in human behavior. Entire industries will stop existing because large gatherings of people is too dangerous to continue. This is a heavy dose of speculation but it is also founded in very real possibilities. This virus has a massive evolutionary advantage in that it can spread asymptomatically for up to weeks. This means unlike far \"deadlier\" coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, this virus can continue killing at the same rate without risking burning itself out. SARS and MERS showed symptoms too quickly and killed too much and destroyed its own transmission opportunities by killing or incapacitating the host. This virus has decoupled transmission from keeping the host alive or at least relatively well.\n\n- Imagine what industries are no longer possible if the seasonal flu puts 10-20% of infected people in the hospital. That's the very real potential if this virus mutates into more strains.\n\n**Further thoughts**\n\nI am running out of time writing this so I will give some direct bullet point thoughts on how things will develop. Please try to think about this pandemic critically and organically. **Do not use models from previous recessions because this is fundamentally different from financial crises.** Misapplying models is what led to the \"v-shaped recovery\" consensus that was briefly reached last month. This virus and its mutation has the potential to have lasting fundamental changes on economic actor behavior.\n\nStream of consciousness below:\n\n- As stated last month, massive layoffs and bankruptcies in the Airline industry will occur.\n\n- Many airlines will be bailed out, but equity holders will likely get wiped out\n\n- Biggest problem with airlines is they leveraged to meet booming demand, billions upon billions spent on airplanes that are generating zero revenue while grounded. Airlines lose money maintaining servicing and storing grounded planes. Cathay has half its fleet on the ground.\n\n- Casinos are the hidden big losers industry. They will lose far more than they have already lost. Casinos don't do well in recessions and will do especially poorly because of the virus. They will be trading for pennies on the dollars. They have similar problems as airlines: leverage to meet booming demand, huge overhead and debt service once the casinos stop generating revenue. Unlike grounded planes, at least casinos will get SOME kind of money out of their property. Not enough to cover expenses and debt but it's better than literally nothing.\n\n- Oil industries will be heavily impacted.\n\n- Different breakeven points for different oil extraction operations.\n\n- The most expensive North American oil extraction stops being profitable below $50\n\n- If oil prices hit $30, expect any type of fracking operations to pretty much stop.\n\n- All the towns/cities/local governments depending on this industry for tax revenue is in big trouble. And so are their municipal bonds.\n\n- States or even the federal government may need to bail out the industry.\n\n- States may need to bail out local governments.\n\n- If you are in Texas, New Mexico, OK or anywhere with oil related industry, get prepared for the local economic impact of laid off workers and less spending\n\n- The virus retains high infectiousness in the 50's to low 60's temperature. Check your local forecast to see when the weather gets hotter than that. Spread will likely slow past those temperatures.\n\n- Japan may be pushed into a massive economic crisis. They have the most unbelievable government debt levels of large developed economies. The triple hit of canceled Olympics, lack of tourism, and local recession may finally pop their debt bubble.\n\n- Keep eyes on Singapore for hope of containing virus\n\n- The more hosts this virus has, the more likely it mutates\n\n- Almost all economic data are lagging, don't use lagging data to affirm that things are better than they currently or will be in the future. Conversely, once an inflection point is hit, don't look at lagging economic data to be pessimistic about the future.\n\n- News from China are leading sources of data. News from Europe/Americas are lagging. See what happened in China to predict what will happen in the West (my original post and prediction came from following what happened in China)\n\n- Huge supply shock in some sectors = extreme inflation. There's plenty of opportunity here if you can gather the correct information.\n\n- Huge demand shock = distorted spending on alternatives. Can't go to the movies/concerts? Pay for games and home entertainment\n\n- Private jail industry will likely be devastated. This virus has shown to spread like wildfire among confined populations (Chinese jails and Korean psych ward). Almost 100% of patients were infected in Korean psych ward. The private jail industry will need a bailout.\n\n- Switch from big ticket luxury items to small luxuries. Entrepreneurs get ready to pivot to small luxuries.\n\n- Assuming threat of virus is gone, expect economic transition period of 3 years before we enter boom economy. Adjust the industries you invest in accordingly.\n\n- A lot of companies will go bankrupt or get bailed out. The bailouts come in many forms. Some type of loan payment freeze for entire industries (like tourism) is possible. Freeze on tax collection from businesses is likely. Helicopter money into consumer hands. Or outright bailouts like what we saw with some companies in 2008.\n\n- Most vulnerable and overleveraged companies will go under first.\n\n- Not the type of market to \"buy the dip\" because even financially secure companies may get wiped out in some industries.\n\n- Mass unemployment/underemployment. If you are in the most vulnerable businesses (tourism/travel), try to transition right now if you can. Have a plan to not have a job by May\n\n- The CFR is likely lower than reported. WHO has CFR at above 3%. But many countries like America are not testing to find everyone with virus. So the CFR is exaggerated from an unrepresentative sample. CFR may be well below 1%, but if enough are infected, the medical system will be overwhelmed and the CFR will quickly rise to the ~20% (those who require hospitalization to survive from severe/critical symptoms).\n\n- Governments should seek to reinforce vital functions (food supply, utilities, medical service)\n\n- Governments should seek to have comprehensive stimulus policies in place (US should seek high return investments like infrastructure)\n\n- Central Banks are in big trouble. If banks are afraid to raise rates during a supposed \"booming\" economy, what will they do now? \n\n- Negative effective rates equates to a massive wealth transfer\n\n- Real negative rates is an even bigger wealth transfer\n\n- Timing the market may be tricky because of central bank and government actors. But the direction is negative.\n\nIf I can leave with one last thought on this virus, it is the fact that **this virus is 100% capable of creating a new paradigm, a new normal, in human civilization.** \n\nThe mutations of this virus is key. This virus is uniquely positioned in mutating in ways that will fundamentally change human civilization. It can spread asymptomatically for up to weeks. That's our biggest problem. If it retains this characteristic, then there will be MUCH LESS evolutionary selection pressure for more benign strains of the virus. Remember that with viruses like MERS and SARS, they defeat themselves by showing symptoms too quickly and killing too much. They prevent themselves from being spread. But with this new virus, they can be as dangerous and deadly as they wish to evolve/mutate into, as long as they continue to be asymptomatic while infectious, their deadliness won't play a big factor in their persistence. They can still spread easily.\n\nRemember that of the two strains of this virus published in the Chinese Journal, the NEWER strain is the more aggressive one. Viruses can mutate into deadlier strains just as they can more benign ones. Unlike other diseases, there's no big natural selection pressure for the more benign version of this virus.\n\nIn this new paradigm, entire industries will not exist, and how we function currently may fundamentally shift. Imagine a persistent danger every flu season of being hospitalized 20% of the time by an incredibly stealthy and infectious disease. How will that change how we work, travel, learn in schools, etc?",

        "body": "**Highlights from Bill Ackman\u2019s meltdown on CNBC today**: \u201cI\u2019m an optimist, but beginning in late January I was getting increasingly bearish. I woke up with a nightmare. And my nightmare was, you had this virus, that replicates and infects incredibly rapidly. Each person infects 2.5 people, each of whom infect 2.5 people. 1 becomes 2 becomes 4 becomes 16 becomes 256 becomes 55,000... And when China shutdown Wuhan, they told people \u201812 hours from now we\u2019re gonna shutdown Wuhan.\u2019 Well what happened? 5 million people left Wuhan. 5 million people dispersed around China. 5 million people dispersed around the world.... The laws of probability tell me this thing is going to be everywhere. Everyone, 50% of the world is going to get infected. It\u2019s just a matter of time...  \n\n\u201cUntil a vaccine is manufactured, distributed and injected, we will go through a depression-era period in the country. Millions of people will die around the globe. As many as a million Americans are gonna die... I think it\u2018s a very high probability millions of Americans have the virus. On February 27th I told the firm that we\u2019re going to work from home. We have a small firm, we\u2019ve got 50 people... we\u2019ve been working from home for weeks and we\u2019ve got 2 people that are likely to have the corona virus based on their symptoms... that\u2019s 4% of our company and taking aggressive measures. It\u2019s incredibly widespread...  \n\n\u201cWhat happened in Chinatown is a microcosm... this is a model for the country. Hilton is the canary in the coal mine. This is an incredibly well-capitalized, amazing, dominant, global company that actually doesn\u2019t own many hotels. It just collects royalties. Down from like $120 to $50. It\u2019s going to $0 along with every other hotel company. Every hotel is going to be shutdown in the country. Every one... I\u2019m a major shareholder. If we allow this to continue... every hotel company in the world is done. No business can survive a period of 18 months without revenue. And that\u2019s what happens if you operate the way we\u2019re operating now...  \n\n\u201cThe only answer for the world is to shut the world for 30 days. It\u2019s so simple, its happening slowly on a rolling basis. You look at how South Korea and Singapore have handled this, but you need a global effort where every country at the same time says \u2018for the next 30 days its basically spend time with your family.\u2019... In a month, we\u2019re done with this - the country survives, the economy survives. If we do this just incrementally over time, until there\u2019s a vaccine, we\u2019re done. What will happen is, the hotel industry and the restaurant industry will go bankrupt first. Boeing is on the brink, will not survive without a government bailout. So look at airline industry, auto industry, restaurant industry, hotel industry - capitalism doesn\u2019t work in an 18-month shutdown. Capitalism can work in a 30-day shutdown. We gotta do the 30-day shutdown. And if the president has to bring out the National Guard to keep people in their homes, which I don\u2019t think he will need to do, he should do it.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FItEjc6VtuU",

Osterholm is a public health scientist and a biosecurity and infectious disease expert in the United States. Joe Rogan had him on his episode for his podcast and they discussed coronavirus. Osterholm is saying this is going to be 6-12 month issue that impacts older people and those with underlying health issues such as obesity. He predicted/studied this type of scenario playing out, how it would impact supply chain and wrote about it in his book. He doesn't believe its bio-weaponized and discredits other myths of using saunas, probiotics, etc to fight it. Osterholm also states that washing your hands and not touching your face hasn't been captured as affective prevention but that White House officials and public want something to be able to do. Furthermore, he mentioned that saying that the risk is low is a false assertion. Still going through the video but it's very informative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit 2: \"this could require 48 million hospitalizations 96 million cases actually occurring over 480 thousand deaths that can occur over the next three to seven months with this situation so this is not one that to take lightly\"",

It's gotten hammered with the rest of gold, and is at a very good entry point right now.\n\nSTX-- it'll benefit from the exponential growth of data over the next decade, and has a better balance sheet than WDC. MU is approaching an attractive price point with the same bull thesis (data growth).\n\nNUE-- well run US steel company, reasonable balance sheet, great long-term track record for management, dividends, etc. It's cyclical, and we may have a ways to go before the bottom, but we're probably closer to the bottom of its cycle than we are to the top.\n\nHCC-- also in steel, it's a metallurgical coal company, which means it's much hated. Been following it for a while. The management seems solid, and it's at a deep discount.\n\nI'm also looking at STMP and BKNG.",
