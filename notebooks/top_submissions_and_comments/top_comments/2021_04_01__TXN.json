That time learning was completely wasted using such ancient tech ^and ^copious ^drinking \n\n\nAlso calls on Texas Instruments they're already **+20%** YTD because of their fucking shitty old monopoly, yep ti-84 still the standard.",

LRCX, AVGO, INTC, TXN, ADI, SOXX, and MU are near all time highs.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the demand for chips is through the roof amd will remain high. Every industry thats booming needs them. The shortage is a positive thing for us. Demand is high. We dont want a glut. We want to operate at a slight shortage. That said, we will need perfect numbers to start the next leg up or a breather to let things cool off.

Look at shit in your house, think about what's going on in your life, what you need and use FREQUENTLY then open a position in the market. For me: I'm a functioning alcoholic so I bought DEO, I watch stuff on Disney plus every day so I have disney, I buy food at Costco, hardware at HD, use cashapp so Square, got a honeywell thermostat so HON. Just right there I have exposure in entertainment, consumer goods, home building, fintech/crypto, industrials simply from looking at stuff in my house. Do that yourself and you'll be absolutely fine. \n\nOn the other hand take a look at reddit hype stocks. You care about space exploration I'm sure but who do you know is actively participating? (SPCE) Would you be caught dead paying 60 bucks a month for streaming garbage? (FUBO) You or any friends going to buy a Chinese electric car you haven't heard of pre investing knowledge? (NIO) Literally why would you ever care about TSM when Intel and Texas instruments have their name on everything? Half the damn population doesn't believe global warming exists even in the current administration why would you throw your money at ICLN?\n\nAll that shit is completely speculative and maybe you make money on it eventually but you literally have no clue you ever will and the casual -10% is fucking frightening.

It's all that's required to run a node.  That's what ethernodes.org is showing. \n\nAn \"archive\" node is one where the entire chain history has been indexed for quick access to cumulative info (e.g. \"what was the last txn made by account Y between blocks Y and Z?\").  \n\nAny \"full\" node can be turned into an \"archive\" node, it doesn't require any extra information, just storage space for the expanded data.
