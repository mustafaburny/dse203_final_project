Yesterday all but the Dow Industrials were positive and the S&amp;P and Nasdaq closed at new record highs..\n\nIt should be a busy day with plenty of earnings to move things along. As I write this, UPS just came in with a beat on earnings and revenues. That\u2019s another good sign for the economy. During market hours we\u2019ll hear from 3M, Hasbro, JetBlue, Starbucks, Wynn Resorts, and others. After the close it will be Google/Alphabet, AMD, Microsoft, Texas Instruments, and Visa. Many others as well but those are the ones that have my attention.\n\nWe also have the start of the Fed meetings today, but shouldn\u2019t be hearing very much from that until tomorrow.\n\nStocks have been quietly \u2018melting up\u2019 for awhile. That may accelerate. Commodities are cranking along, with copper, wheat, corn, soybeans, and coffee at or near multi-year highs. The \u2018soft commodities\u2019 (wheat, corn, soybeans) are particularly frothy. Check out the charts if you have a chance.\n\nUntil the inflation narrative takes hold and forces the Fed to start tapering it should still be all systems go for risk assets.

Every industry thats booming needs them. The shortage is a positive thing for us. Demand is high. We dont want a glut. We want to operate at a slight shortage. That said, we will need perfect numbers to start the next leg up or a breather to let things cool off.

Their reasoning was to use the money for R&amp;D, fair, but I also see it as a a strategic move, putting buy backs on hold means when Biden hands them a big check, there is less scrutiny on the situation. I dont think Biden and his administration want to be associated with handing cash to big businesses that blatantly use it for buy backs and executive salaries, something that happened during Trump, and the Dem's were vocal about the issue.\n\nI think INTC will grow into a boeing-like situation. Public company, sells product all over the world, but its a national asset that is crucial for national defense. INTC is the only top of the line chip designer and fab the US has, someone like Texas Instruments does have a US fab, but is far less important, fabs less advanced chips and is smaller.",

Just right there I have exposure in entertainment, consumer goods, home building, fintech/crypto, industrials simply from looking at stuff in my house. Do that yourself and you'll be absolutely fine. \n\nOn the other hand take a look at reddit hype stocks. You care about space exploration I'm sure but who do you know is actively participating?

Half the damn population doesn't believe global warming exists even in the current administration why would you throw your money at ICLN?\n\nAll that shit is completely speculative and maybe you make money on it eventually but you literally have no clue you ever will and the casual -10% is fucking frightening.

There is now a semis shortage and Texas Instruments is one of the few people who have inventory. People like auto manufacturers are desperate to get semis which gives Texas decent pricing power, plus they can take volume market share because others have less inventory.

A cursory glance, their price is up \\~17% in less than a month, it seems really overpriced.  But, I did skim an [article](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1397671/texas-instruments-a-fab-stock-to-buy-on-dips) claiming they are about to build a 300 mm fab which is 40% less expensive then their competitors 200 mm ones.  It also says that they're focused on automotive, industrial and power management.\n\nGiven the demand in those areas and govt' funding from Biden's infrastructure bill, it's not a bad bet just an expensive one.",

        "body": "I'm sorry, but that's just not just a little off, it's completely wrong. \n\nConflating the phrases \"full\" and \"archive\" together like they mean the same thing is dishonest.\n\nLet me link to the official documentation: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/\n\nA \"full node\" contains the entire blockchain history.  It's all that's required to run a node.  That's what ethernodes.org is showing. \n\nAn \"archive\" node is one where the entire chain history has been indexed for quick access to cumulative info (e.g. \"what was the last txn made by account Y between blocks Y and Z?\").  \n\nAny \"full\" node can be turned into an \"archive\" node, it doesn't require any extra information, just storage space for the expanded data.  It's the equivalent of turning on indexes in an sql database.\n\n---\n\nPretending no one can calculate Ethereum's supply is incredibly silly.  This has been lobbed across twitter for so long, with people then pretending it's impossible, despite any evidence to the contrary.  One guy got so fed up he made this script -- https://github.com/lastmjs/eth-total-supply -- which provides exact instructions to calculate it *yourself* if you don't want to trust charting sites like etherscan.",

I adore all the degenerates here. I like the positions or ban requirement. Wsb was my intro to options. It told me about the jpow brrrr and the v-shaped recovery last year. I learned that TA is the best way to sound smart but be actually retarded. Wsb showed me that dividends and boomer stocks was for nerds. And it taught me how to lose money really fast and that I should always inverse myself. But in The last 3 months I\u2019ve literally learned 5x what I knew from the past 3 years. Gme is the most interesting story of the year. This megathread was going to eventually and naturally be replaced as apes learn new plays and the gme story unfolds. It doesn\u2019t make sense to make an executive unilateral decision to kill the thread and it just makes mods look sus af. Killing the thread only feeds the conspiracy/cultish mindset. Just like all the CNBC/motley fool/S3/etc... FUD proved to me that gme was a real threat. MODS: get a grip and use this growth as an opportunity to integrate a lot of beautiful minds so that we can collectively share the best ideas and the best gains and losses. Why shoot yourselves in the foot?",
