Its the start of my investing so I am mostly looking for long term, retirement.  Dont need this money in near future. No debts. I don\u2019t know why I never really started investing my extra funds But with recent news of market due to virus I was thinking I could start.  Especially since I\u2019m thinking longer term... better to just start and get into it ASAP. Using E*trade\n\nSo most would go in an ETF while spending 30-40% in stocks, With the 8k. Thoughts? \n\nI was thinking for an ETF to go for - VTI\n\nHow many stocks would you recommend I going for.  2-4? \n\nStocks I've looked into and am thinking to invest in would be:\n* MFST\n* TER\n* ISRG\n* WM\n* CMCSA\n* COST\n* LVMH\n* BABA\n\nAny suggestions and advice would be great. Is now really fine time to enter? Should I spend the 8k over time instead of all at once?\nThank you",
