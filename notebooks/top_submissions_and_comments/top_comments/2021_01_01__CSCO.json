Their market cap is less than this years revenue, and their last quarter was profitable. Share price of 6 something when it should be at least double. It\u2019s uplisting to the TSE is set for February 17th and I would recommend hopping onboard this choo choo train before it hits double digits. Institutional ownership sits at a mere 3.8%. Insiders have bought ~950K shares in the past 12 months and own ~12.3%. They haven\u2019t sold a single share and the biggest holder is the CEO at 8.13%. The company has made something like 17 acquisitions in North America since October 2017 and have plans to expand into Europe in the future. If you need any more convincing, go look at the list of their platinum sponsors for next weeks #ConvergeConnect21 conference.. You might recognize some of the companies: IBM, Redhat, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Dell, VMware, AWS, PureStorage, Cisco, and Snowflake. Lenovo and PaloAlto are two of the gold sponsors. Hewlett-Packard and Intel are two of the silver sponsors. This is a Constellation Software-like company in the making- MASSIVE. Their latest bought financing closed today fully subscribed for a mere 80+ million dollars. Guess what they plan to do with it that money- M&amp;A. Did I forget to mention that they are very likely to break a billion in revenue this year? Oh yeah and they\u2019re still on the venture exchange! \n\nTLDR: CTS.V - strong buy before Q4 earnings (don\u2019t know when they are), or at least before uplisting to TSE in mid Feb. Thank you.",

        "body": "I'm pleasantly surprised to see the growing attention Nokia is receiving. I didn't expect it to hit r/wallstreetbets this soon. When I speculate for large returns, I try to find companies like this that have high value risk/reward. \n\nPositions,\n1. 200x 19 Feb 2021 $6C\n2. 200x 21 Jan 2022 $4C\n\nSo, why is NOK an interesting risk/reward play? I'll list a few reasons in general terms, unless specifics are requested.\n\n1. *Recent sentiment shift*:  Nokia has shown improved quarterly earnings, and secured several major 5G deployments. As a result, we're seeing more news, publications and analysis that reflect a bullish outlook.\n\n2. *Undervaluation*: Nokia trades at a lower forward earnings compared to its competitors, such as Erickson and Cisco. While Erickson has risen over 35% during 2020, Nokia has remained flat. I believe this will soon change as Nokia gains recognition for its recent growth and partnerships. \n\n3. *Partnerships*: Quite recently, Nokia announced new and expanded partnerships with Google, for cloud-native network functions, T-Mobile, for a five year 5G network rollout, DTAC for 5G services throughout Thailand, a sole supplier deal for Taiwan Mobile's 5G network, and over [60 additional deals](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/01/09/nokia-highlights-momentum-with-63-commercial-5g-deals/) with companies such as AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, Vodafone, Softbank, and others. \n\n4. *Leadership*: Appointed less than a year ago, Nokia is now operating under Pekka Lundmark, who serves as president and CEO. The old and rotten days of Rajeev Suri are over. One of the main reasons they appointed Lundmark was to drive shareholder value. \n\n5. *Early Stage*: While sentiment is growing and new deals are being minted, Nokia has yet to reemerge into the top tier investment news cycle. This is important because it's an indicator that you're entering into a position before hype is occurring. \n\n6. *Premium Cost/Secure Floor*: The premium cost for options, including LEAPS is cheap enough to make this worth a risk/reward play. While you could doubt the growth potential, Nokia operates a strong and growing business that provides a secure floor for share price. Thus, I don't have any concern of my options dumping due to a large drop in the underlying. You will pay around an 8% premium/share ratio for options, which is obviously higher than your bluechip stocks, which are around 4-5%, but this is because the value proposition is so high. \n\nWhy do I have leaps and monthlies? The leaps are self-explanatory. The monthlies are so cheap, that I'm willing to front the cost incase Nokia gains traction sooner than later, which it appears to be doing. \n\nTL:DR; NOK 200x 19 Feb 2021 $6C \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

And this is one of the greatest companies of all time, one of the few success stories out of dozens of failures.\n\nAlso, even though Amazon is seen as a winner in the long-run, it was down from its 2000 high of $1000 to a price of $8 in 2001! EIGHT dollars! 92 percent drop. Even though Amazon recovered 10 years later, is anyone going to be able to stomach a 92% drop? I doubt it. Way better to get out now, and look to buy at a reasonable level, even if you think the stock is a winner in 15 years. Obviously it's impossible to be smart enough to buy at the trough at $8, but at least get out now, and buy after a 50% drawdown or something similar.\n\nWhenever people say that Microsoft and Amazon worked out in the end, that's classic survivorship bias. Even solid companies like Cisco aren't anywhere near their 2000 levels today, and of course other companies like [PETS.com](https://PETS.com) which people thought were great, went to zero.

I would say my only remaining question, which I'm not sure we can actually properly answer with the available data, is whether or not all this capital flowing into railroad investments during the 19th century would have yielded investors with returns. Capital can flow into a sector without ever being returned to shareholders and I think this could have been the case with something like the early days of railroads. The capital would have been used to develop new technology and build infrastructure and many of these companies would have been leveraged and in a environment with high competition. As you mention, we know that some of them paid dividends, but would that actually offset the cost of other railroads going out of business and their stock going to zero?\n\nI remembered this podcast that I listened to recently that talks about investing in technological revolutions and they mention the railroad mania as an example. Part of the idea is that some companies will come out of these tech revolutions and winners and some will come out as losers, but it's often very hard to predict who. You can think of the tech bubble in 2000 as an example, almost everyone thought Cisco would be huge, but they still haven't reached their previous high from 2000. On the other hand, no one would have predicted Amazon, a book seller would be what it is today. In the same way, if you'd invested in Kansas City Southern 100 years ago you'd be very happy, but if you'd invested in The Ann Arbor Railroad you would have lost everything.\n\nHere is a link to the podcast if you are interested. They also go into some of the theories, based on the efficient market hypothesis, that try to explain the returns that typically come out of these tech revolutions: https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/123",

Intel is the other one I can think of. Then there's some like microsoft that are clearly much higher than their peak in 2000, but the return from the peak then to now would still give a fairly low yearly compounded return.\n\nBut that was largely driven by a bubble in the market/sector. Good companies had their valuations inflated and terrible companies were able to raise money to get started before burning out a couple years later. \n\nWe're certainly not in a general automotive bubble right now, if anything the valuations of most other large automakers appear somewhat depressed. Maybe we're in an \"EV bubble\", but Tesla is basically the entire investable market?\n\nIs there another situation where a single stock had a bubble where it was driven up purely on expectations of higher prices in the future, and then crashed?\n\nPersonally, I don't really agree with this BofA note, the ability to raise capital is great, but it's pointless if you don't have useful things to spend it on, or can't spend it efficiently. Tesla seems to be in a somewhat unusual situation where even though they're building and ramping up factories very quickly, they're limited mostly by how many factories they can build at the same time? That's a problem that can be helped a bit by capital raises, but they've probably already hit the point of diminishing returns for throwing money at construction projects to get more of them done, faster.",

Don't take it wrong, I agree with you to some degree, but I feel like it's a one sided list, while it would be worth to consider the differences to the dotcom bubble too, since many companies are backed up fundamentally a lot more than that time.\n\nTesla is a pretty complex topic. While I don't agree that they can't potentially be the new paradigm and disrupt several different industries at once, valuation still matters. The best example is Cisco. During the dotcom bubble, the sentiment was that the internet is the future, and any company associated with it can be a huge winner. Cisco, as basically an infrastructure building/supply chain company of the next big thing was a sure bet also.\n\n* Did the internet became the future? In a way, yes!\n* Was Cisco a good company? It was and it's still solid today.\n* Did these factors justify the huge valuation during that period? **Hell no!**\n\nEvery time I argue about Tesla being overvalued, fans say \"bUt It'S dA fUtuReE!!!4!\". Yes, it very well might be, but it still can be overvalued now as an investment...duh.\n\nI was just wondering today how interesting it is that we see potential bubbles forming in both the stock market and \"commodities\" like crypto (you listed these as if they were one market, but IMO they are very different assets).

She is 60 doesn\u2019t have any debt has other passive income (rentals), cure t holding are random funds her employer had with mass mutual they will be liquidated into cash and put into a traditional Roth. Risk tolerance I would say a 5 out of 10 (10 being very risky).\n\nMy thoughts where to select a handful of dividend stocks for 50-60% i like names such as jnj, mmm, xom, T, pg, Abbv, csco, ibm (trying to stick with dividend champion companies that are reasonably priced now..) etc and then the remaining 20% would be in a couple vanguard bond funds and remaining 20% in a vanguard s&amp;p fund. \n\nAny inout would be great this isn\u2019t her complete retirement fund it is a small portion and 1 of 3 of her retirement accounts. \n\nThanks,",

Salesforce is very popular though, but mostly as a CRM platform. The others focus more on what is called BPM or process automation.\n\nSeems that Mendix, Appian, Bettyblocks and Microsoft are more focused on commercial markets and offer simpler and cheaper solutions (I believe Bettyblocks is actually no-code). Which is smart because there are a lot of potential customers in that market that don't use low code platforms yet. So I do see future in it, but the question is which companies are going to become the market leaders.",

        "body": "Ok, let's talk about Tesla.\n\nFor the record, I do not own any Tesla stock, nor do I own a Tesla car, nor do I plan to own either in the foreseeable future. (I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",

Usually my individual stocks way outperform my index funds or mutual funds but I don\u2019t have time to research for hours and hours.  My investments have always been owned longer than a year, most closer to 5+ years or almost the entire duration.  My main holdings over the 2010-2019 (pre-COVID) period were Microsoft ($28 cost basis), Disney ($46 cost basis), Nike ($55) and Xylem ($50).  I got \u2018lucky\u2019 and dumped Disney when Iger stepped down in February out of nowhere at $135.  I never bought back in and I should have. I did have some duds such as IBM and GE over that time that dragged me down, but I can\u2019t complain.  This year I did well but I traded more than usual and lost my cost basis for everything out of panic selling.  The trades I made were Zillow ($78-115), Starbucks ($78-103), Penn ($3-15), NIO ($3-16) and some losses like Slack and CARA.  Now I have only my 401K and a bit of sector ETF (I love ARKK).  \n\nHindsight, I screwed up and should have just held all my positions but I just kept jumping around to catch waves.  I didn\u2019t realize they were never going to stop! Haha. Now I\u2019m looking at everything thinking \u201cthey have to correct\u201d and I\u2019m not sure they will.
