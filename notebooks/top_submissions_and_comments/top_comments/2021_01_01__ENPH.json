        "body": "I wouldn't say the market itself is in a bubble but certain sectors are. Big ones right off the bat are the Energy/EV sector (TSLA, ENPH, PLUG, NIO, etc.), the Genomics sector (EDIT, CRSPR, FATE, PACB), some tech/cloud (APPS, SE, FVRR), and some miscellaneous stocks (PENN!!!, RICK, CELH) etc. Genomics and EV specifically because they are supposedly the future. No doubt they are but that's what everyone was saying about the internet back in 1999, 2000, and it really took about 10 years for those stocks that crashed but survived to *really* get going (MSFT, ADBE, AMZN, PCLN, etc.), some haven't even recovered still, such as Cisco and MicroStrategy.\n\nDo keep in mind that the DOW has risen 12k+ points in just 10 months and some bubbles have already popped or on the decline (think NKLA or ZM).\n\nWhen you say \"everyone\", do you mean people on this subreddit or people in your daily life? I've noticed on these forums people are a bit more cognizant of what's going on, so they know that a lot of these valuations don't make sense but in the outside world, I know and have heard of plenty of people buying stocks on Robinhood because \"BuY tHe DiP!!\" is constantly blasted on social media and through word of mouth. For example, I know someone who bought US Foods on Robinhood for no particular reason. \n\nThese stocks go down once:\n\nA. Fed decides to increase interest rates\n\nB. Black Swan Event, which is possible given the state of affairs at this point in time.",

You could probably put it in NNDM and make some good money. GSAT is a great high risk high reward play. BNGO doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down anytime soon. It doesn\u2019t have to be BB or GME. PayPal earnings are coming up as well and they might blow the lid off. Lots of plays out there. AMD seems to have hit its bottom so you could buy a 95 or 100 dollar call a few months out. Make big \ud83d\udcb4 there. JKS is a great solar company that still seems to be at its bottom where other solar stocks like SEDG and ENPH have made their runs. JKS should be popping very soon. ALAC is a solar spac that will probably take off this year. 10k is a lot of money man. Don\u2019t waste it.",

Always remember wealth isn't built overnight, it's accumulated over years. It all depends on your risk tolerance, if you can stomach volatility and the money you have in the market is money you could live without, then I would consider this distribution as very aggressive and high risk/high reward.\n\nThat being said, if I were you as a (seemingly) newer investors I'd set a great foundation and build on that over time. ETF's like VTI, or SPY (or VOO) *should* be the foundation of your portfolio and account for a decent portion of your invested cash. If you want to go slightly more aggressive than those but still safe QQQ is a good choice. ETF's are a great way to diversify and are generally safer than individual stocks.\n\nIf I were you your shoes my portfolio would look more like this:\n\n30-60% VTI/VOO/QQQ (Hold forever)\n\n20-30% Speculative ETF's like ICLN/ARKK/TAN/QCLN\n\n10-20% Individual stocks like PLTR or Emerging market ETF's\n\nWith ETF's you gain exposure to companies you currently hold like Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, and Enphase with less risk. (I wouldn't worry about holding Apple as much as some of the others). Like I said, it's entirely up to you and your risk tolerance. A lot of people think they have the stomach to watch their portfolio or position drop 10-20-30%(+) and hold strong, but generally newer investors can't stomach it and panick sell when it's too late and they're in the red.",
