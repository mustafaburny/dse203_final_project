Recently they have touted ADAS as a focus area.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, but very expensive niche software programs like Ansys exist because specialist engineers require that capability.\n\nTheir SW requires very expensive HW to run as well- we are talking about multi processor, multiple core Xeons, TBs of RAM etc. requires lots of maintenance as well.\n\nA better play for them would be to move the SW to the cloud and host it on supercomputer instances. Even with super duper servers, some of my Ansys simulations take days to run, and we could reduce our design time considerably if we have access to supercomputers.\n\nJust my $0.02 (as a user/procurer of their SW), they are growing but it\u2019s not a spreadsheet like Excel or Gsuite that can make billions unless they rationalize their offering by offering supercomputing as a service, as that will open up their addressable market to smaller engineering companies.",

Together with the automation features of the 3dexperience platform, it is a much more powerful tool than Ansys workbench in structural analysis. Fluid simulations are a different story (PM me if you want to know more, don't know if anyone cares for more details).\n\nLong story short: I wouldn't invest in ANSYS based on my experiences as an engineer. However, I haven't looked at any other numbers/fundamentals. Those may tell a different story.",

That's by design - they're niche software and they only exist to extract huge amounts of money from tiny user bases, and the added features over time seem more about breaking compatibility with old versions than moving the product forward and improving productivity.\n\nBig software trends that engineering/scientific has been late to adopt even though they stand the most to gain:\n\n-shift from single threaded to multithreaded optimization (workstations now can have up to 256 threads, not 4)\n\n-massively parallel processing for tasks that support it, completing tasks in a fraction of the time as CPU computing\n\n-API to allow integrating functionality into 3rd party apps or integrated systems, locally or remotely\n\n-Support for virtual environments and virtual desktops (already old tech now) which lead to cloud deployments with scalable performance for huge, distributed teams, and more recently to the insane supercomputer-class instances available from some of the big cloud vendors that allow institutions to completely bypass the hardware acquisition and IT infrastructure process, and solve problems that might take days or weeks on a workstation in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe best thing that could happen I think would be if some of these legacy scientific companies could get acquired by actually competent software/infrastructure companies with vision like Nvidia or Microsoft, and they get dragged into the 21st century. As is, none of those dinosaurs are going to be the Nvidia of 2030 because they're still trying to be the Microsoft of 2002.
