        "body": "No surprise here. US - China divide will only increase and tech war will intensify further. I think good way to exploit it might be to invest in US domestic manufacturers. With that in mind I have positions in GM, Intel and similar companies that have US plants. This is also contrarian play as these and other similar companies are hated at the moment and are cheap. Well not so cheap now but we're cheap when I was entering long positions. Another good angle is to invest in US defense contractors. Defence budgets will only go up and those companies actually treat shareholders very well. Just today while my tech equities were killed, GD (have long position) announced 8% dividend increase. Nice. For anyone interested in this I highly recommend Ray Dalio's latest articles on world powers.",

Since each price represents crowd consensus at the moment of transaction, trad- ers are betting on the future opinion and mood of the crowd. The crowd keeps swinging from hope to fear and from indifference to optimism or pessimism. Most people don\u2019t follow their own trading plans because they get swept up in the crowd\u2019s feelings and actions.\n&gt;People change when they join crowds.They become more credulous and impul- sive, anxiously search for a leader, and react to emotions instead of using their intel- lect. An individual who becomes involved in a group becomes less capable of think- ing for himself.\n&gt;Group members may catch a few trends, but they get killed when trends reverse. Successful traders are independent thinkers.\n\n&gt;Many traders are puzzled why markets reverse immediately after they dump their losing position.This happens because crowd members are gripped by the same fear\u2014 and everybody dumps at the same time. Once the selling fit has ended, the market has nowhere to go but up. Optimism returns to the marketplace, and the crowd forgets fear, grows greedy, and goes on a new buying binge.\n\n&gt;Crowds are primitive, and your trading strategies should be simple.You don\u2019t have to be a rocket scientist to design a winning trading method. If the trade goes against you\u2014cut your losses and run. Never argue with the crowd\u2014simply use your judgment to decide when to join and when to leave.\n\n&gt;**Compare this to what happens to a man after a fall. If he falls down a few steps, he may dust himself off and run up again. But if he falls out of a second-story window, he\u2019s not going to run anytime soon; he needs time to recover. Prices seldom rally immediately hard after a bad decline.**\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________",

Also Intel stock before AMD crushed them was \\~$65 the stock is now \\~$65. That's a big WHAT IF for the morons playing Intel and selling AMD, I see no up side potential on the Intel side while AMD is down 20% from highs.  \n\n\nSo imma blow your mind ... what if AMD keeps their foot on the pedal and Intel never catches up? To me that's just as likely except prices are right for buying AMD right now. AMD makes up \\~3% of the datacenter market, with their Zen 3 datacenter CPU coming out next week and TSMC investing 30 billion in production and building a fab in the US, it's still Intel's market share to lose and AMD's to win.

Mods please tell me why automod hates me?\n\n First of all, \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nSecond of all, I like the stock. Yes the stock. Not hating on those side hussies they just don't get me.\n\nThirdly of all, I have some interesting intel, some serious questions, and I would like to hear some serious explanations if this ever makes it out of the great filter.\n\n1. The simple question first. I keep reading a lot of talk about available shares to cover short positions and all kinds of fancy maths to show all kinds of fancy scenarios. The problem I can't seem to get around is that there are millions of shares trading hands every fucking day, so what in the fuck are you talking about? If I were short 100,000 shares and I would like to close that position can't I just click the buy to close button and fuck off? Why the hell do I give a shit if these shares are real or synthetic or counterfeit or made out of construction paper? I just click the button and my position is closed. Why would this be any different for a hedge fund with a short position? Seriously though, I don't know the answer and I have not seen an answer so please somebody fill the gap here.\n2. Holy fucking put options. I happened to take a peek at the option statistics today and there is some serious insanity that I can't come up with a reasonable explanation for. Hopefully one of you smooth brains has some logic that can be applied.\n\n(There was a pic here of 646,379 puts)\n\nguh\n\nHoly fuckin puts batman\n\nSo.... thats a lot of puts. 646,379 to be exact (EDIT: plus another 300,000 today). The last time I saw that was the day before the stock took a huge dump a couple weeks ago. It was well planned and well executed. So I got more curious and decided to check out what exactly they are buying and/or selling so I can pucker the butthole.\n\n(There was a pic here of hundreds of thousands of 1,2,3 strike worthless puts being bought)\n\nholy smokes batman\n\nAre you yanking my dick right now? Yes those are $1 strike puts.\n\nWTF chuck. This page goes on like this forever. Yes, those are literally **hundreds of thousands** of puts, 500 per order, expiring in 6 fucking weeks, ranging from $1 strike price to $5 strike price. Is this a joke? Altogether my rough math is showing approximately 400,000 puts under $5 strike.\n\nMy first instinct was OH somebody is SELLING these puts to collect a massive premium payday when they expire worthless and this is BULLISH AF. But a few steps later I back tracked on that relief when the thought occurred to me that there is still somebody on the other side of every one of those trades who is buying them up 500 at a time every few minutes like candy. ?????. Confused emoji. Seriously, what the fuck is going on here.\n\n1. Is $THETA gang just collecting their tendy premiums and taking advantage of high IV?\n2. Is the stock about to file bankruptcy, liquidate, and move out of country all in less than 6 weeks?\n3. Is this a reverse gamma squeeze play to drive the price down and force shorting?\n4. Maybe I am a cat?\n5. Is there a different game of chess happening here I am completely missing?\n\nLike I said, I don't have any logical answers here but I am hoping you guys are able to detectify this a bit and make this make sense to me because I don't know what's going on here, but I do know that some kind of pretty serious fuckery is about to take place if it hasn't already.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.

The newest Ryzen chips are incredible, in terms of price to performance, and their newest set of graphics cards, while suffering from the same shortage as their only real competition, nVidia, have on par performance specs for 25% less. I've been an Intel/nVidia user since I built my first PC years ago, but in the last few generations of chips and cards, I've always recommended AMD products to my friends looking to build PCs. In fact, if you look on the logicalincrements website, which is a very popular resource for speccing out a new PC, each and every recommended CPU is AMD. They were small, and overlooked in the past, but they are dominating as of late.\n\nLooking at the prices of the stocks, AMD is still less than 1/3 the market cap of NVDA, despite the fact that NVDA only makes GPUs, while AMD makes both CPUs and GPUs. If you look at Intel, they have 2.5x the market cap of AMD, and they only make CPUs.\n\nWith the way AMD's chips have been performing, and the fact that they are outperforming on both isles of the PC gaming industry, I think they'll end up doing very well.

They may be slightly undervalued now due to people cashing out during this mining craze in preparation for the inevitable flood of used cards coming back into the market and killing revenue, but they're still floating around the right price looking at TSMC's capacity and AMD's forward projections. AMD themselves are looking at 2025 before they grow past their current value. If you're just talking memes I guess they have room to grow but I think sentiment has been turning against them due to absurd GPU prices.\n\nSaying amd is the most innovative graphics card company is just plain crazy. They caught up to nvidia in raster performance thanks to completely dropping their compute architecture in favor of raster performance, yet they're only about nvidia level of performance even after losing significant efficiency in compute. Meanwhile you've got nvidia slapping on RT/Tensor with every gpu, codeveloping PAM4 memory and somehow managing to still provide similar raster. Catching up to your competitor by stripping utility is not innovative.\n\nIf anything AMD is being carried by its innovative CPU designs pushing chiplets years before intel while intel is praying 3dstacking closes the gap. Their GPU division however just constantly struggles and has yet to ship a competitive instinct GPU. They've basically given up on competing with nvidia in enterprise and instead are taking intel's scientific compute market with high FP64 gpus. It's led to some big supercomputer wins but overall their GPU division hasn't pushed the envelope since the 290x. Honestly I'm surprised that cray believes they will ship Frontier on schedule since AMD's instinct GPUs barely even exist, but they said they're on schedule so maybe AMD's gpu division has bigger improvements on the horizon for 5nm.",

If a turnaround is effectuated, it has the potential to 3x in order to trade in line with its peers. At 12 times earnings and a 2%+ dividend, the stock is cheap, so the downside risk is minimal. INTC's legacy PC-centric business is growing, but it doesn't trade like it (the market just assumes that PCs are a dead growth category). And you get the faster-growing data center, self-driving MobilEye, and all the Intel VC businesses. MobilEye is particularly exciting. As a standalone business, I believe it would trade at something like a $25 billion market cap in this market - maybe higher.",

But I do some firmware engineering and I'm really thinking the Xilinx tech is going to be integrated to speed up i/o on new datacenter offerings that will come out in a few years. Normally I only care about technicals, but this one I really think is going to do well in the 2-5 year range. I don't hear any analysts saying that they're buying Xilinx to use the tech, everybody seems to think they're just doing it defensively because Intel bought Altera.\ud83d\udc7c",

So, we could assume the same was happening with other brokers. At the same time, I know that at least TDA isn't allowing short selling of GME at all (was on the phone with them the other day, and the guy told me they haven't allowed it since the end of January).\n\nStill, the price has not only held, but risen pretty significantly today. I'm having a hard time seeing the downside to continuing to hold, I just don't think it's a wise thing to sell at this point. The gamma squeeze seems like it'll happen, the short squeeze is likely too. And even if it's not, the company is pivoting and may become a big player in the years to come. All those things are why I will keep holding.\n\nAt the same time, if you haven't covered your initial investment, please do so. I sold off enough at the end of January to pay off almost $50k of CC debt and to have a bit leftover to provide for me and my kids. Now I'm playing with house money, so it's easier for me to weather the dips.\n\nI'm holding 307 shares @ \\~$70 per share. I also have a 17 calls for different dates.",

The best time to buy GME was 2 months ago, the second best time is NOW.\n3. Buy shares, not options. Invest only the money you can afford to lose.\n4. Don't fall for FUD. Any account can be a shill/bot, even the ones created before January. They are PAYING users to spread fear and enroll you to post negative comments/posts.\n5. GME has been and will always be the only play. Anything else is a distraction to limit the impact GME can have. (Yes, even RKT). Never will the planets align this perfectly again to trigger the biggest short squeeze of your lifetime.\n6. The most important point : Don't sell. Supply and demand : you have something they want, we all do. So YOU set the price you want. And the price can actually go up to infinity. This is going to be the biggest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen, don't ruin it being a paper hand and selling low.\n7. Hold. Hold. Hold. Selling at 1k is trolling. They want you to sell at 1k, that's why they keep spamming comments saying they put stop limits at 1k. 1k is lowball. 1k could just be a gamma squeeze. 10k is lowball.\n8. As stated by u/Polihanna, the squeeze will last multiple days. Don't be afraid that it lasts a few seconds and you'll miss it. You won't. \n9. Don't day-trade GME. It's extremely volatile, and you actually help them by selling shares that they can buy for cheap. You delay the squeeze and reduce its impact if you day-trade.\n10. THIS IS NOT A GAME OF GREED.

The main reason was because I was too busy with work and family to spend time investing. It grew a lot because I was in some very good names.  I got more involved because I had rolled over a 401k to an IRA and needed to re-deploy.  There were too many good companies available really cheap so after I had invested the IRA I moved on to my Roth.  But since then I have invested into a more diversified but still very tech heavy portfolio.  I sold the Panasonic &amp; TSM first, then the QQQ, finally sold my last MSFT a couple months ago.  \n\nLately, I have been going with a much more active strategy holding usually 6-18 months.  I still have the first position I got into from Panasonic proceeds, $TEAM (I got in at $52.87/share).  \n\nMy advice would be don't get emotional about selling a position you have held for a really long time if you find a better opportunity.  I also think that the walking away for a long time was a good move for me because being this active takes a lot of time doing research and tracking the news.  It would have detracted from my career path and family to do it between 2018-2016 and my portfolio size wasn't large enough to make the extra returns worthwhile.",

Their valuation was $25B, and you need to pay a premium in order to acquire a company.  And the play wasn't a result of trying to get Slack's revenue or profit.  Microsoft has been pushing Dynamics *hard* as part of the O365 licensing model.  That's a direct competitor to SFDC.  And MSFT's message that their sales org is pushing is \"We hit all of your software needs with one license.\"  The biggest driver of upsales on O365 are Dynamics and Teams.  Bundling CRM and UCaaS is a gamechanger, and has been wildly successful for them.\n\nSFDC needed to be able to compete with that bundling.  So they bought the biggest competitor to Teams.  And they'll bundle it with SFDC licenses.\n\nTableau is a similar purchase.  BI is a huge play right now, and *also* a feature that MSFT is bundling with O365.  Adding Tableau into the fold allows SFDC to directly compete with MSFT on that front, too.\n\nThese aren't cookie jar acquisitions, they're competitive expansion via acquisition.",

No matter what position is taken (short or long) it is very difficult to accurately enter a trade, hit the target before hitting stop loss. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI day trade - not very successful - just enough success to cover my losses :P \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe problem with doing the \"opposite\", with the strategy I use, is this : \n1. The stocks I pick for day trading are large caps - e.g. - Apple, MSFT etc.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2. If you consider an up trending day, then the obvious position to take is a long position for the day.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3. On a typical day, a stock price is range bound - for example between $100-$101. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4. Typically, I would start building a long position when the price is near $100.2 and set a stop loss at $99.6 and target at $101. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n5. Probabilistically, the long position on a large cap on a up trending day, is correct.  The problem really occurs when the price momentarily  (spike) drops to 99.6 and hits the stop loss (kills the trade).\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n6. Later in the day, of course the stock moves back to the target price. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n7. It takes a long time to enter trades correctly and avoid stop loss. The basics of trading really do work over time - e.g. - always take positions with the trend (of the stock and the index). Always enter high probability trades (as per whatever trade indicators you use).  \n&amp;nbsp;",

Had you been accumulating Microsoft over the years since 2004, you'd be doing pretty well today.  I think the special dividend is meant to show that they value the shareholders and payback that growth.  They want to be considered a fintech company though (a growth company) and not a value stock, so I would imagine they will resist issuing more dividends in the near term.  That doesn't mean 10 years from now they wont.  This is the kind of stock you hold on to (IMO) and don't worry about \"thinking it will dump\".  As I've described the price will take at least a 5% loss (probably more) after March 9th when people sell after the div payment.  What they don't realize is by doing that they are actually losing money. Yes they got the dividend but they also took the share price decrease and the additional decrease from the other sellers, which in the example above, would be more than the $1,100 you get issued (i.e. a net negative investment). You can short term play it if you like but your profits are only going to be in what the stock price rises between now and the div payment.  If you plan to sell directly after March 9, just know you are probably losing money.  You would need to hold after the 9th until the stock price rises a bit (hopefully).  OR you can just continue to hold a great stock, which to me is the better move.",
