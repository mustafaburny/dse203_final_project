Although the potential to turn around by focusing on the experience (such as combination movie theater and restuarant) can save them from bankruptcy, it's still looking at a downsize as they become increasingly less relevant in today's streaming age. I wouldn't count them out, I just like to wait until a solid plan is in motion.\n\nGamestop has a much similar story, but they've taken this year running in turning their company around by increasing their focus on online sales and competing with Amazon. They've also expanded their item selection with new merchandise and peripherals. A much higher potential for growth with far less risk than AMC at the moment.\n\nAlthough I've played both, I've remained heavily invested in GME not because of the lack of AMC news but because of GME's news.",

I was convinced to not sell when it hit $20. Then it went up to $70 and was again convinced to not sell. Maybe I'm dumb, or maybe I just want to see where this goes. But let's be honest, AMC and the other meme stocks wouldn't be here if it wasn't for GME. AMC is tied to GME thanks to the short hedge funds. No one knows anything, it's all speculation, but if one does squeeze, so will the other because the HF's cant handle those losses. There are no fundamentals, it's all a damn HF game. That is literally all this play is, a game. So you're either in and you embrace the shit out of it (me) or you're out and loathe what this has become for investing (my finance friends).",

        "body": "Dear brothers and sisters,\n\n  \nWe have been in a tug of war with the hedgies for the past months. We had a technical breakout (NOT SQUEEZE) to $28.5. They pushed us down like a rock. It has been painfull. It has been frustrating with all the times they have pushed us from $10 to $8 in the span of 1/2 days. It has been frustrating with so much fake news, FUD or that a great company is being looked at as a joke or \"pump and dump\".\n\n  \nThe haters were wrong. They did not do their due dilligence, because if they did they would find out that:\n\n  \nFailiure to deliver shares was as high as 19M in July. This equals to 15% of the float. FAILED to deliver. Compare this to AMC and GME at their peak, and we would beat them with 3M and 6M FTD. We are at 19M! THIS IS INSANE!\n\n  \nShorts are NECK DEEP in this. Company is valued at over $3B. Short volume in dollars is at over $1.2B. Imagine that! Only other company I can remember that hedgies tried to kill this hard is Tesla. I was there in 2020 and it changed my life! Now $Clov will change all OUR lives! No wonder they have tried to kill momentum so many times!\n\n  \nBy doing these ladder attacks and always pushing us down, hedgies are banking on making us frustrated, tired and make us panic sell. What they don\u00b4t realize is that we apes have evolved. We have social platforms on Reddit, Discord and we share information with eachother. Shorts stand for about 50% of the daily volume - and don\u00b4t get fooled, they will come hard at us today as well!\n\n  \nBut we will FIGHT back. We will prevail! This is a great fucking company that will disrupt the dinosaur health care industry. Company reported over $400M in revenue, 140% increase year over year, membership is at over six digits and $Clov is growing like a beast! The Clover assistant will bring over $1B in. THIS IS INSANE. \n\nHow is company valued only $3B? Easy, because market value doesn\u00b4t reflect the reality. If shorts were out of the picture, we\u00b4d be hovering around $25-35, but because of them, the sky is the limit.\n\n  \nMy dear brothers, my dear sisters. Fuck the corrupt system. Fuck SEC and all other institutions. Fuck the 1% that always cover for each other and make life miserable to the rest of us. Don\u00b4t we deserve freedom!? Don\u00b4t we deserve to live a life where we can actually live instead of just surviving? Don\u00b4t we deserve the chance to make our own future!?\n\n  \nWe will accept this no more. No longer shall corrupt hedgies be able to bankrupt great companies. No longer shall corrupt hedgies steal money from us. No longer shall they rule us by fear. FUCK FEAR. FUCK PAIN. It limits us. The system is built to limit us, to make us sheeps, to not let us reach our potential.\n\n  \nClover Health is a company that will change lives. It will help a lot of humans. It will revolutionize the health care industry, and remember; this is only the beginning. Today, we got the catalyst we needed. The volume premarket and after hours has been insane. Today is going to be a fight, but we WILL WIN.\n\n  \nDon\u00b4t sell this stock for peanuts. It\u00b4s worth FAR more. If we look at the options for this week, if we surpass $10 and we can go as high up as $50. Should you sell? FUCK NO. Wait for MOASS. The squeeze will bring us to several hundred dollars! The fundamentals will take us to $100 in a year alone.\n\n  \nBrothers. TODAY IS OUR DAY. Far too long have they put fear and pain into us, but today - we fight back! Pain and fear is temporary, it might last for a minute, an hour, a day or even a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take it\u00b4s place. If I quit however, it will last forever.\n\n  \nLETS FUCKING GO CLOV FAMILY!",

I know a part of it was GME &amp; AMC.\n\n\nAll in all, these mistakes have taught me a lot about the market, and i\u2019m glad i\u2019m learning these lessons at such a young age at 20 instead of playing with money I absolutely need. Just loaded up 35k this week and going to play very conservative , then after I lose majority of it, i\u2019ll be hitting the blackjack tables to make it back like the degenerate that I am! \n\nThank you WSB!\ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf7e",
