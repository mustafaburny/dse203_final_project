So I think he's still the CEO. He apparently has a large personality -- like a lot of strong executives -- and has been involved in lots of litigation -- ditto, including the case with the CTO and several others. Successful, visionary entrepreneur -- building and selling smaller companies (sold one to Dow Chemical for a few hundred milliion before Microvast).

        "body": "Let's talk about technical analysis first.\n\nLet's take a book by Bob Volman using the 5 min spider futures, to explain price action.\n\nAl Brooks is \"the\" man when it comes to charts and price action, but he can really be obtuse at times, and he is a far better analyst then writer. Volman does a great job of syntehising that knowledge in his book (has a similar book on forex scalping, with similar principles, but get the new one).\n\nSee, 99 percent of all litrature in this field is useless. People are looking for a way to hard code conditions, and automate entries and exits, and chill on the patio. Or somehow put four magical lines on the screen and intrepet price correctly in a different fashion.\n\nForget forward looking indicators (the only forward indicator that works, is the option price on the underlying ie IV). The only indicator that matters in price action TA is the PRICE itself. \n\nNow along with looking at support and resistance, you want to look back for clusters. The left side of your screen is a footprint as to where the price has been. It shows you clearly where the price had a hard time pushing through or had to turn right back, or got stuck there indefinitely (from now's perspective) ie a cluster.\n\nThese clusters (or support, resistance, round numbers), present to you opportunities daily. In both sideways and trending markets. Without going into details, understand something. \n\nA cluster is where there will be opposing orders lying in wait. If price shot through resistance at 500, went on to 512, and dropped right back to 500, a lot of shorts will cover (who shorted at 500, hoping resistance holds (mean reversion). And a lot of longs will rejoin who missed the ride earlier (which will have a subset of shorters who reverse their position also), and some guys who took profit at higher levels re-entering. This causes double (at least double, if not triple) pressure. There are many variations to this theme and twists (all explained), but the gist is this itself, a cluster of orders and candles is a place to search for double pressure situations and enter when a certain entry condition (breaks the last candle high etc) gets triggered (you can actually place a trigger).\n\nDuring a day (or any period), the market is mostly fifty fifty to go up or down. But there will be times, when it is 60 40 one way. For a variety of reasons. Don't look at the reasons, look at the price, and watch for orders colliding and then resetting in unision towards a common direction.\n\nThere is a lot that goes into this. That's why trading is hard. No robot can do it still, and it will be a long time before we get there (HFT is not that). Trading, especially price analysis, is art. Even if you read the tape (ladder), there is art involved. Not hard and fast rules. What looks like resistance to you, might not meet my criteria, but having said that, S/R levels (major ones and round numbers) on the daily and hourly, are fairly easy to spot, and this is exactly why you don't need anything more then support and resistance zones (try not to draw a line, take your trade when you break through the zone). DO NOT complicate it.\n\nIt is complicated enough, psychologically and money management and trade management wise, the entries and exits are just part of the game. But you know that already. Matter of fact, what you learn after years and years is that, your biggest enemy is you. You are the one who stands in the way of yourself, by (fucking) complicating it when it goes wrong. Which it will. It takes supreme testicular fortitude to stick with a system and way of analysis, after that very method has saddled you with five straight losers. And the majority can't take that pressure. I know I couldn't and might still not be able too. Pushed hard enough, everyone breaks. There is a saying. The market can stay irrational much longer then you can stay solvent.\n\nThe above mentioned book will set you straight technical analysis wise.\n\nHaving said all the above, I read Volman about 8 years ago, and have changed my outlook a lot on trading in general. I found that (being a cs major and math oriented myself, a long time ago), I was more suited to quantative strategies. Then I found options, very recently. I mean I always knew them forever, but I didn't really know them, you understand.\n\nNow, when I look at an underlying, I analyse the option chain first. The various delta ranges, and one std two std ranges from IV, historical volatilty etc etc. And only THEN open the price chart, it helps to find the range the MARKET is EXPECTING, and you literally have billions of dollars of analysis behinds this, HELPING YOU. Read those capital words again.\n\nI am still reading and answering the problems (get the solution manual to confirm your answers) on Hull, the last third portion. But I have concurrently, started extending my option education. Better late then never, so I am only slightly ahead of you, maybe behind, lol.\n\nBut I wanted to mention this, because I trade everyday and I primarily use Volman and Brooks to understand charts. Being a physics, math, cs, chemistry person, I always thought there was a little bit of Wu going on here. But read the book, he goes thru many charts, bar by bar, and try to understand his logic vis a vis price action and WHY do you think it happens. It's worth it. \n\nYour second answer on Machine Learning is much more involved. I enjoy writing  when someone actually listens, not necessarily agree, but listen, read and make up their on mind. So I'll be back. See you.",
