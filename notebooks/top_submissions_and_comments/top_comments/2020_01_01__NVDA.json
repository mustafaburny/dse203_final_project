        "body": "tech is actually not one basket. The term \"tech\" is very misleading as we are at just the beginning of a way of doing business using \"tech\". Each tech company actually operates in a different industry for example, Apple is in consumer products, Amazon is in retail and cloud computing, Facebook is in Social Media and Advertising, Google is in Advertising, Netflix is in Content Media and Media Distribution, Microsoft is in work productivity software and cloud computing, Nvidia is in semiconductors, Uber in transportation, and the list goes on.\n\nEventually there will be new categories and there will be a reshuffle of the companies into the new categories. This has already started a couple of years ago and will continue to do so until basically all of the old companies that used to be in those categories are forgotten like old railroad companies and the new categories will be based of the new technology. Currently everything is grouped up in tech. If you think tech is just one basket then you will miss the boat as you will be trying to diversify too much and invest in old companies which the tech companies are about to turn obsolete. Sure some old companies will survive, but history has shown that companies come and go like empires.",

In total, 125 million XB1 and PS5 were sold in the last 7 years. On average thats 17.9 million Xbox/PS. Thats a lot of money for AMD. When the XSX and PS5 get sold, more are about to be sold. Along with the fact that (I dont know the ticker for nerds), PC nerds buy AMD and NVDA instead of INTC because they know that AMD is better. Theres apparently 1.2 billion PC gamers, lets say 10% of them have the money and knowledge to build their own PCs and dont just buy a RZR laptop or a normal laptop that they can play some games on. Thats another 120 millions AMD/INTC buyers there. Lets say 40% of them buy AMD instead of INTC - thats 48 million people buying it. From what Ive seen, my friends buy a new CPU every 2 to 3 years so thats 16 million a year on average using conservative figures. \n\nSo currently 17 + 16 = 33 million users on average of AMD. \n\n\nNow lets talk about AMD encroaching into the data centre market. Cloud computing becomes more and more important everyday and who wants expensive shitty stuff made by immigrants only hired to fill a bullshit diversity quota so the CEO can watch his wife get pounded by Jamal, the Nigerian with no qualifications, to fulfil his interracial cuck fetishes? Jamal used to work at a mine before for INTC before they decided to use 'conflict free resources' to look good and all that did was raise unemployment and crime in low income areas in the Congo so INTC not wanting to create a massive epidemic of poverty, decided to hire people like Jamal and his entire family. People want the pure stuff made of pure merit, not vaginas and melanin so AMD wins that market too.",

Now three years later, I think they are in a much better position to deliver and take their growth a lot further. That is why I am buying and accumulating shares these days, which I am planning on holding till I retire or find something with better potential for growth.\n\nPlease do your own due diligence before investing, and/or giving investing advice to family members and friends.

I am seeing increasing number of desktop systems offering AMD chips.   For a while there, that was practically unseen in the retail market.\n\nAMD also has their own graphics card, which Intel cannot compete with.   Graphic cards have value beyond gaming:  crypto functions like crypto coin, AI, and VR (which has applications way beyond just gaming).  Nvidia is winning the GPU battle but AMD is making gains in this area again.   It remains to be seen where AMD lands in this space.\n\nI think AMD has growth ahead of themselves.  AMD is ideally positioned in the desktop CPU market with room to grow.  If they can continue with their gains the graphics card space, they will have even more headway.\n\nWhen it comes to closing a position, that's a personal decision.  I usually opt to take my gains and not allow myself to get into FOMO situation.\n\n  \n(edited for comment below)",

Rome already get much better traction and qualified much faster than Naples, Milan likely coming mid year and it will qualify fast too\n* new 7nm Zen 2 with 8 cores Renoir-APU and better memory controller (huge power savings, clockspeed gains, IPC gains, better dealing with bandwith bottleneck) are expected tomorrow/very early this year (increased cadence compared to last years), while Intel has capacity and node issues. Intel tries to cut iGPU for desktop to regain capacity, but they samewhat forfeit marketshare with this call. OEMs have to use discret graphics, which they hate for Budget PCs (additional cost, additional power supply...). a refresh with better graphics can be expected ready for holiday season (van Gogh)\n* overall better economy forecast and china deal, so likely higher demand, Intel cannot supply processors, so AMD will even more\n* AMD ordered a **huge** amount of TSMCs wafer capacity, so they made a call\n* there is still the possibility of Apple using Zen for MacBooks and Macs, it's only clear that they drop Intel this year. Apple may use it's own chips, but that's quite a barrier (x86 -&gt; ARM) and they use AMD GPUs\n* Nvidia has yield issues, probably their line up is delayed a few months",

One loss can wipe out many weeks of wins.\n\nFor choosing stocks, I tend to go for stocks that are slightly volatile (so that your premium for selling will be high), but not so volatile as to be crazy unpredictable and dangerous.  Usually I aim for stocks with 20-30% implied volatility (on robinhood, click on one of the near the money options and see what the implied volatility is).  I have recently had a lot of luck with tech stocks, especially AAPL.  MSFT, NVDA, and NFLX have also been good to me recently.\n\nYour chances of making money will depend on how far out of the money your spread is.  When you sell an option on robinhood you can see the \"chance of profit\".  I generally try to stay in the 85% or even 90% area.  The farther out of the money you go the less premium you collect, but the greater the chances that the stock doesn't move against you.  I generally aim to collect premium of 3-6% of whatever I'm putting at risk.  So if I were putting $1000 at risk, I would want to collect $30-60 in premium.  (You can see here why the wins are small and the occasional loss can be big.)  If you are less risk averse than me you could go for smaller chance of profit but collect bigger premiums.\n\nThe width of your spread will determine your max loss.  I generally do $10 spreads ($1000 max loss).  I think of this as the amount that I'm investing.  If you want to \"invest\" more, it usually is better to make a wider spread rather than opening more contracts.  The wider your spread is, the more you can lose, but the farther the stock has to fall for you to experience max loss.  If you have 10 $1 spreads, or 1 $10 spread, your max loss is the same, but the stock has to fall a lot more in the latter case for you to experience max loss.\n\nThere are a lot of strategies for picking expiration date.  A popular one is to choose a date a month+ out, and then close it as soon as it has hit your profit target. This has the advantage that you can usually exit the trade without too much loss if you see it going against you.  I have currently just been selling high chance of profit spreads on weeklies and holding them until expiration. This is a bit more risky but has been more profitable so far.",

        "body": "&gt; I\u2019m thinking 10+ years out and I\u2019m hoping someone can answer is if quantum, nano, and micro tech will be a reality. AMD thinks so. \n\nThe next 10 years of actual volume shipped products will be silicon. It takes over 10 billion dollars to build a fab so you can watch the runway fairly far out. Right now is the transition to EUV, then will be the move to GAA chip architectures, and then some sort of 3D stacking. By 2030 we'll be reaching the end of what multi-patterned EUV can do. Things will slowly grind down due to exponentially rising costs. The final few nodes before silicon is truly maxed out are in contention mostly because of extreme cost.\n\n\nSure, the next true paradigm like graphene chips will eventually come to mass market, and maybe as soon as 2030 (likely closer to 2035), but it's honestly beyond any current investment thesis as far as the current players are concerned. It's more a question in the realm of the foundry companies and the fringes of their roadmaps.\n\nIf you're thinking 10 years out as far as chip designers are concerned, you should be looking at the clear direction that NVIDIA and Intel are taking. I'm actually slightly bearish on AMD on a decade+ time frame because they're currently a smaller company, and the competition is pouring massive amounts of money into the next step in the computing war right at this moment. All I can say is that it's telling that Intel hired the guy who designed the AMD Zen architecture and has him working on an architecture designed to head off NVIDIA in the datacenter, not AMD in x86. I do think that style of computing will supersede traditional CPUs in many areas of the market. ML processing will continue to grow in importance, especially as markets like self-driving cars grow from niche to truly staggering markets in size and revenue. Only the deep R&amp;D labs really know what the next arena will look like, but there will be a time when AMD once again has to slug it out against some killer competition in new areas like ML processing.\n\nx86 has a long road of profit, and if AMD takes that market they will grow very, very big in the next decade, but it's important to realize that Intel is a 250 billion dollar company and is already pouring near infinite resources into the next gen tech where they feel they can win. Obviously that's not x86 though, so AMD is guaranteed to get very fat in the medium term.\n\nNone of that effects my investment decisions now though. Once NVIDIA starts taking increasingly large datacenter revenue, or Intel's next gen stuff starts to take form, that's when actual decisions can be made. There are probably plays to make in smaller companies doing R&amp;D, IP holders, little players in the supply chain of the future, etc, but for ex. Intel's 3D stacking tech in 2031 probably won't effect the share price for the near to medium term.",
