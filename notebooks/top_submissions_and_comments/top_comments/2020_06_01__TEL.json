Personally, I think the fight for data rights ended before we knew it was even happening and companies like Palantir just vacuum that shit up and sell it while we continue to give it away for free.

I\u2019ve seen it lower on a few. \n\nI was told it did used to be $200 - $300. \n\nI know you asked if there was any strategy. \n\nThese are my thoughts:\n\n1) Rates are low. Honestly, rates are so low, it\u2019s warped people\u2019s perception. From what I understand, in the 20th century, in the 80\u2019s, rates could hit 20%. \n\nInflation is 2%. 30 year fixed rate mortgages are 3% ~. If someone keeps renting, their rent will keep going up and when they leave, they own nothing. They paid someone else\u2019s mortgage. In Every time I left an apartments, they always found something to bill you for. So, I wasn\u2019t even living there and I had to pay them!\n\n2) When it\u2019s in the house, you can\u2019t access it. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of calls of people that want to re finance and take cash out or get a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). I like to tel customers to think of their home like a savings account. But, 1) we\u2019re not offering those right now and 2) It\u2019s a 2nd mortgage. It\u2019s not quick. I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve spent it some other way but still. \n\n3) Going back to renting, around me, and this may be region specific, a one bedroom is $1000 / month. I\u2019d rather pay $100 / month for PMI knowing every month I\u2019m building up equity then pay $1000 / month and build up nothing. And if you want you a house, you\u2019re still saving up for that too. \n\nThe way I see it, the house doesn\u2019t know how it\u2019s being paid for and it doesn\u2019t care. A customer is always welcome to pay extra towards the principal so this could come across as rude but if someone wants to pay the house off quickly, that\u2019s up to them. Work a second job, move up in your field, win the lottery, again, the house does not care and we don\u2019t have any early pay off penalties or restrictions.",

You can get some great medical strains prerolled, and there\u2019s so much weed grown in the West Bank (weed from the Gush is \ud83d\udc4d) it\u2019s not even funny. \n\nAlmost everyone uses Telegram to have weed delivered to your front door in Tel Aviv. Was at a religious wedding in 2017 outside Tel Aviv, and a bunch of young people were standing there smoking weed 20 feet from a bunch of national border and municipality police (who were also at the wedding) smoking cigarettes.\n\nThe only downside to weed in Israel is that it\u2019s all primarily flower, there\u2019s very little in the way of extracts or edibles unless you\u2019re doing it yourself. But that should hopefully change if the bill passes all 3 readings in the Knesset.",

Boss would tell me \"Hey, we predicted 10/10 stocks accurately in this month for the small-cap sector, please post a summary.\"\n\nHowever they never showed me the predictive algorithm nor an inaccurate prediction. I believe they fail more than they'd like. \n\nAlso, it always got me thinking that if you have the holy grail why would you share/sell it?",
