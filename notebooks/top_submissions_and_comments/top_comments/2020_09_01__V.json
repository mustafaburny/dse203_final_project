        "body": "Article:\n\nA new ETF offering 4-per-cent retirement income is going to be big\n\nRob CarrickPersonal Finance Columnist\n\nPublished 6 hours ago Updated September 15, 2020 \n\nYou can tell an investment product is going to be a hit when you instantly see a huge and hungry market for it.\n\nThe new Vanguard Retirement Income ETF Portfolio, which makes its debut on Wednesday, is designed to pay predictable amounts of monthly income to retirees. To underscore this purpose, the ticker symbol is VRIF. V is for Vanguard and RIF is a play on registered retirement income fund, which is where people have all, most or some of their retirement savings.\n\nA big question with RRIFs, and it\u2019s more pressing than ever, is what do you stick in your account to generate income to live on in retirement? We have an aging population of investors who are going to be saddled with low interest rates for a long time. Dividend-paying stocks are going to be essential, but how do you pick the ones that will provide reliable income rather than grief to investors?\n\nVRIF attacks the problem by bundling eight Vanguard equity and bond funds (the stocks-bonds mix is 50-50) into a single package designed to pay monthly income targeting a real-world 4-per-cent yield. \u201cThat is what clients will get in their pocket, or bank account,\u201d said Scott Johnston, head of product for the Americas at Vanguard.\n\nDividends and interest income will account for about 60 cents per $1 of income, with capital gains providing the other 40 cents. Basically, Vanguard will strategically sell holdings that have risen in price to top up dividends and interest. This approach highlights the fact that this is an ETF designed for generating income, not for growing your money.\n\nYou could build and manage a portfolio of individual ETFs or stocks and bonds to accomplish the same total-return approach of VRIF, but some exacting work is required to ensure you get the income you need.\n\nVanguard does it all for you in a cost-effective way. The management expense ratio for VRIF is projected to be 0.31 or 0.32 per cent \u2013 that\u2019s not the cheapest fee in ETF-land, but it\u2019s a fair value. The cost of the eight underlying funds is included in the published MER, as is the practice with fund-of-fund ETFs. One additional cost is the brokerage commission to buy and sell an ETF or stock.\n\nAt a time when the investment industry is prying up every rock in sight to find new ways to generate bond-beating income, the components of VRIF come across as basic or even bland. In a 50-50 mix of stocks and bonds, the fund holds Canadian, U.S. and international stocks (including a minuscule 1 per cent weighting in emerging markets), plus bonds.\n\nThere are no preferred share, high yield bond or emerging market bond funds, or use of a covered call strategy, where financial instruments called derivatives are used to augment income. Mr. Johnston said these securities can add risk to a portfolio as well as higher levels of income. \u201cWhat we have with VRIF is a simple, broadly diversified portfolio \u2013 that is it.\u201d\n\nVRIF is the latest iteration of one of the most popular types of ETFs \u2013 the balanced ETF, also known as asset allocation ETFs. Since Vanguard introduced the category in January, 2018, it has attracted $4.5-billion from DIY investors and advisers who understand that low-cost, index-tracking investments are a prime way to build long-term wealth.\n\nAn additional benefit of VRIF is tax efficiency in non-registered accounts. Only 50 per cent of a capital gain is taxable, and dividends benefit from the dividend tax credit.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly exotic about VRIF\u2019s total return approach to generating a payout targeting 4 per cent, but it does raise the question of what happens when there aren\u2019t enough capital gains to augment dividends and bond interest. Vanguard says it would use a return of capital in such situations, which it expects to do (in other than negligible amounts) roughly one in every 10 years.\n\nReturn of capital in non-registered accounts can be an annoyance to investors and a sign that a fund\u2019s holdings are unable to deliver the promised level of income. A return of capital is an amount above and beyond the usual kinds of income from bond interest, dividends and capital gains. A return of capital is not taxed when you receive it, but it reduces the cost of an investment and thus increases your capital gain when you sell.\n\nVRIF, like many equity ETFs, may also use trace amounts of return of capital to ensure that identical amounts of income can be paid every month. This is necessary because dividend stocks pay quarterly and bonds pay semi-annually.\n\nIf you\u2019re a retiree managing investments to produce income, ask yourself this: How have you found the challenges of the past year, and how confident are you that you can navigate the next 12 months? If you\u2019d like help, it\u2019s now at hand. Expect competing products shortly.",

Who fucking cares about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, \"all time highs\", \"all time lows\" or wherever the fuck we are on the \"graph\". You should not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, you should not care at all. Volatility should not mean anything to you since you should be a super long-term investor.\n\n 2. You cannot predict the future and you cannot time the market. \"Time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies. Therefore, you should invest as much as you can every time you get paid while while balancing a decent quality of life (whatever that means to you). Basically, don't try to pull off some \"smart shit\" by pulling out your money because you think the markets will crash and then put your money back into the market after it crashes to capitalize on that hypothetical situation in your little head. Turn off your brain and keep your money in the markets because again, \"time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies.\n\n 3. You should consider investing in an \"index exchange traded fund\" or \"index-ETF\" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index-ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors who pick stocks will under perform an index-ETF over the long-term.\n\n 4. Don\u2019t day trade. Don't try to \"get rich quick\". Don't try to \"buy low, sell high\". Don't buy shit/garbage. Don't buy \"meme stocks\". Don't worry about \"missing out\". Build wealth slowly over time as this is a long-term game and not a short-term or medium-term game.\n\n 5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity because everything goes on sale which includes high-quality companies and index-ETFs; and therefore, you get to buy more stuff at a discount. Do not fear these times, embrace them instead because these are the times which can actually accelerate you towards your financial goals quicker.\n\n 6. Again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics/elections, wars, recessions, poverty, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). You should have an unshakable discipline in buying index-ETFs or purchasing well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until you retire or die.\n\n 7. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is \"different\" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, long-term minded investor who just doesn't give two fucks about volatility). \n\nKeep it simple. Keep yourself disciplined. Keep hustling. Keep your money. Good luck with personal finance and investing! =)",

Such an  instrument is the turbo encabulator.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Now basically the only new principle  involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion  of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interaction of  magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The original machine had a base plate  of pre-famulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing  in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with  the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic  marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side  fumbling was effectively prevented.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The main winding was of the normal  lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the  stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible  tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the \u201cup\u201d end of the  grammeters.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The turbo-encabulator has now reached  a high level of development, and it\u2019s being successfully used in the  operation of novertrunnions. Moreover, whenever a forescent skor motion  is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn  reciprocation dingle arm, to reduce sinusoidal repleneration.\u201d*",

Theres no fundamental you can point to that says PTON is overvalued other than \"$28b is a lot for a exercise bike\" which is boomer DD. $1b doesnt mean jack shit anymore\n\nCoupled along with the fact that it actually decreased its ad spending to 0 for the last quarter &amp; decreased the price of its main seller last week. Along with that they introduced refurbished bikes to further lower the entry cost. Their digital app paid subscriptions are at an all time high &amp; not only that, number of workouts per paid user is at an all time high. People are not only buying these things, but using them and theyre realizing the growth is in subscriptions, not hardware sales. Theres a lot to be optimistic about with peloton and definitely deserves to be priced as a growth company. If you're looking for P/Es and P/S then stick to REITs.",

If you watch the headline you can see Buffet is shifting his portfolio.

Jeff Bezos isnt running those knock of Amazons. Pick Amazon if you like amazon. In lomg term portfolio management you need to care about your companies leadership. Im day trading you dont even need to care about what ticker tag you are trading. \nAmazon. Nuff said. \n\nI would take a 50/50 split of AMD, and Nvidia right now to cover semiconductors. \n(Your already heavy tech or id do full positions in both)\n\nIf you do a consumer defense stock, id do walmart. They are pishing thier ecommerce and puttting thier leadership equity into that direction. I think they see Amazon and know what needs to happen to survive if a new commerce age comes. Great Amazon pairing to, as if one drops the other may get an increase due to thier respective market share. \n\nIf you are not going to manage yoyr portfolio a few times a week I wouldnt get any more in depth than that. \n\nSplit picks into secotrs and you account will take sharp downswing less often. More important to keep your money than to make alot. If you cannot keep what you make you will only borrow it mistakenly thinking you had ownership.",

To grow into that market cap they will have to earn a couple billion per quarter in the next year or two. And this is for a video conferencing company lol. What are the barriers to entry to making a video conferencing app? Zero. \n\nJust for reference, visa earns $10b annually, coke $9b, McDonald\u2019s $6b, Disney $9b. Investors buying Zoom today  are gambling idiots lol.\n\nAlso, Tesla skyrockets on splitting the shares lol. Lots of speculation today. I think we will have a tech bust sometime next year.
