        "body": "Article:\n\nA new ETF offering 4-per-cent retirement income is going to be big\n\nRob CarrickPersonal Finance Columnist\n\nPublished 6 hours ago Updated September 15, 2020 \n\nYou can tell an investment product is going to be a hit when you instantly see a huge and hungry market for it.\n\nThe new Vanguard Retirement Income ETF Portfolio, which makes its debut on Wednesday, is designed to pay predictable amounts of monthly income to retirees. To underscore this purpose, the ticker symbol is VRIF. V is for Vanguard and RIF is a play on registered retirement income fund, which is where people have all, most or some of their retirement savings.\n\nA big question with RRIFs, and it\u2019s more pressing than ever, is what do you stick in your account to generate income to live on in retirement? We have an aging population of investors who are going to be saddled with low interest rates for a long time. Dividend-paying stocks are going to be essential, but how do you pick the ones that will provide reliable income rather than grief to investors?\n\nVRIF attacks the problem by bundling eight Vanguard equity and bond funds (the stocks-bonds mix is 50-50) into a single package designed to pay monthly income targeting a real-world 4-per-cent yield. \u201cThat is what clients will get in their pocket, or bank account,\u201d said Scott Johnston, head of product for the Americas at Vanguard.\n\nDividends and interest income will account for about 60 cents per $1 of income, with capital gains providing the other 40 cents. Basically, Vanguard will strategically sell holdings that have risen in price to top up dividends and interest. This approach highlights the fact that this is an ETF designed for generating income, not for growing your money.\n\nYou could build and manage a portfolio of individual ETFs or stocks and bonds to accomplish the same total-return approach of VRIF, but some exacting work is required to ensure you get the income you need.\n\nVanguard does it all for you in a cost-effective way. The management expense ratio for VRIF is projected to be 0.31 or 0.32 per cent \u2013 that\u2019s not the cheapest fee in ETF-land, but it\u2019s a fair value. The cost of the eight underlying funds is included in the published MER, as is the practice with fund-of-fund ETFs. One additional cost is the brokerage commission to buy and sell an ETF or stock.\n\nAt a time when the investment industry is prying up every rock in sight to find new ways to generate bond-beating income, the components of VRIF come across as basic or even bland. In a 50-50 mix of stocks and bonds, the fund holds Canadian, U.S. and international stocks (including a minuscule 1 per cent weighting in emerging markets), plus bonds.\n\nThere are no preferred share, high yield bond or emerging market bond funds, or use of a covered call strategy, where financial instruments called derivatives are used to augment income. Mr. Johnston said these securities can add risk to a portfolio as well as higher levels of income. \u201cWhat we have with VRIF is a simple, broadly diversified portfolio \u2013 that is it.\u201d\n\nVRIF is the latest iteration of one of the most popular types of ETFs \u2013 the balanced ETF, also known as asset allocation ETFs. Since Vanguard introduced the category in January, 2018, it has attracted $4.5-billion from DIY investors and advisers who understand that low-cost, index-tracking investments are a prime way to build long-term wealth.\n\nAn additional benefit of VRIF is tax efficiency in non-registered accounts. Only 50 per cent of a capital gain is taxable, and dividends benefit from the dividend tax credit.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly exotic about VRIF\u2019s total return approach to generating a payout targeting 4 per cent, but it does raise the question of what happens when there aren\u2019t enough capital gains to augment dividends and bond interest. Vanguard says it would use a return of capital in such situations, which it expects to do (in other than negligible amounts) roughly one in every 10 years.\n\nReturn of capital in non-registered accounts can be an annoyance to investors and a sign that a fund\u2019s holdings are unable to deliver the promised level of income. A return of capital is an amount above and beyond the usual kinds of income from bond interest, dividends and capital gains. A return of capital is not taxed when you receive it, but it reduces the cost of an investment and thus increases your capital gain when you sell.\n\nVRIF, like many equity ETFs, may also use trace amounts of return of capital to ensure that identical amounts of income can be paid every month. This is necessary because dividend stocks pay quarterly and bonds pay semi-annually.\n\nIf you\u2019re a retiree managing investments to produce income, ask yourself this: How have you found the challenges of the past year, and how confident are you that you can navigate the next 12 months? If you\u2019d like help, it\u2019s now at hand. Expect competing products shortly.",

Consider making some placements spread out to different sectors, finacial should be in there for example. I have been taking position in BAC for banking\nAnd either Visa or Paypal for another pairing with BAC. \nBAC has been really cleaning up thier books and setting up for long term sucess precovid, post covid, you have buffet giving it attention amd some $. If you watch the headline you can see Buffet is shifting his portfolio. I dont always like his picks honestly. 50/50 at best but BAC will be a great risk to reward ratio on placing money in a longer term asset(aka Buffets M.O.) specifically in the financial sector. Paypal could deflate most but could also inflate in price most in my opinion. \n\nConsumer. Get one at least. Every suggests the \"this\" version of amazon. Stick with Amazon. Jeff Bezos isnt running those knock of Amazons. Pick Amazon if you like amazon. In lomg term portfolio management you need to care about your companies leadership. Im day trading you dont even need to care about what ticker tag you are trading. \nAmazon. Nuff said. \n\nI would take a 50/50 split of AMD, and Nvidia right now to cover semiconductors. \n(Your already heavy tech or id do full positions in both)\n\nIf you do a consumer defense stock, id do walmart. They are pishing thier ecommerce and puttting thier leadership equity into that direction. I think they see Amazon and know what needs to happen to survive if a new commerce age comes. Great Amazon pairing to, as if one drops the other may get an increase due to thier respective market share. \n\nIf you are not going to manage yoyr portfolio a few times a week I wouldnt get any more in depth than that. \n\nSplit picks into secotrs and you account will take sharp downswing less often. More important to keep your money than to make alot. If you cannot keep what you make you will only borrow it mistakenly thinking you had ownership.",

What are the barriers to entry to making a video conferencing app? Zero. \n\nJust for reference, visa earns $10b annually, coke $9b, McDonald\u2019s $6b, Disney $9b.

They stand to gain the most of anyone on earth.   \n\n\nSuddenly if you want their datacenter grade GPUS (they limit industry use GPUS and APUS) you have to use ARM as they only make drivers for ARM for those GPU.\n\n  \nThen suddenly, just maybe, they plan to stop supporting x86\\_64 completely, and develop something not unlike risc-v with the previous ARM team behind it. They now have a proprietary chip with none of the backwards compatability slow downs that come with Intel based chips. (they hold backwards compatible registers going back to the 1970s, taking up valuable die space).   \n\n\nSuddenly RISC might be able to leverage it's benefits to become CRISC-V with that kind of backing, and since RISC is always clock cycle fast, x86 will literally die when CRISC-V comes (multiple RISC executions per clock cycle, a complex reduced instruction set computer).   \n\n\nThat's it.
