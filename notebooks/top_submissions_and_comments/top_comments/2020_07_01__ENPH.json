        "body": "It is hard to tell what tech stocks and the NASDAQ will do but a bit of history is worth studying.\n\nIn 2000 Cisco was the giant of the internet and the internet was the giant of tech stocks. Every employee at Cisco was rich because they all got stock options (yes, including the janitors in those days) and the stock price had climbed from $10 in 98 to $33 in 99 and $79/sh in 2000. They did then sell and still do sell routers that were the backbone of the internet and CSCO was everyone's tech darling. I can't tell you how many Cisco employees had told me in spring of 2000 that they were not going to diversify until CSCO hit $100/sh. In Sept of 2001, their share price had dropped to $12/share. They still were the backbone of the internet but the internet and tech were no longer the darling of the Market. In Feb of 2009 they were at $14/sh and are today at $48/sh. So they today as an ongoing company still doing what it did and with a strong balance sheet are trading at roughly 2/3rds the price they were 20 years ago. That is what can happen to a really good tech company.\n\nBTW, CSCO is not the only one. Intel was at $74.88 in the fall of 2000 and is at $60/sh now and was running around in the $20's for most of the past 20 years. Still a great tech company doing great things.   And yes Intel employees also got rich on options.  I met with a Intel employee, a janitor, single, living in a trailer that was about to exercise $3 mm in net in the money INTC options and needed help with estate planning.   Those were the days.  A short edit:  In 2000 the estate tax began with only $675,000 of assets at death and it started just below 50% and quickly grew to 55%.   So you didn't need to be very wealthy to need estate tax planning.\n\nMicrosoft, one of today's tech darlings, was $50/sh in early 2000. It wandered around $25/share for 15 years until it again hit $50/sh in fall of 2015, fifteen long years later. The last 5 years have been good for it but will it stay at $200/sh?",

And simply comparing it to 2000 without reference is ignoring it.  Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel were top 10 companies and weren't the single product late 90's product that you focus on.  Cisco still lost 90% of it's value, and still isn't back up there.  Microsoft still took 16 years to recover it's lost market cap.  \n\nHow am I throwing a tantrum.  It's a fact that the only time that valuation compared to trailing earnings was higher was the dot com bubble, and near right before great depression, the only time that market cap was higher as a percentage of GDP was dot com bubble.  There's tons of comparables that suggest this market is overvalued, and absolutely 0 that it's undervalued compared to history.",

        "body": "MSFT has growth potential due to its diversification across tech sub-sectors. It is also safe for this reason, whereas single-service companies are less so. I don\u2019t think you can put it in the same box as Cisco or Intel, hardware companies focused on providing a single service. \n\nMSFT has greater market share in the broader tech sector than either of those companies because it has expanded vertically (across sub sectors, for example gaming, office software, web services, laptops/hardware) instead of trying to expand horizontally (within its own sub sector) and has plans to continue to do so via its cloud services. I personally do not know who will \u201cwin\u201d the cloud web services sub sector but I know that MSFT won\u2019t lose purely due to its advantage in existing office software (MS Office integrates well with devices like Azure and Sharepoint making it more appealing to companies exploring the cloud).\n\nI love your take regarding the cyclical nature of those speculator dollars, but I think MSFT should be compared to AAPL, AMZN, and GOOG instead of CSCO and Intel. Maybe Shopify is a better comp for CSCO and Intel?",

We'll have a more in depth DD post dropping soon, but for now I'll address your partnership comment.\n\nThose companies are listed on the \"Partners\" page of the OSS site and you cannot use the logo of or claim to be a partner of a major tech company without permission. Source, I worked for a start up and we were doing food safety tech through a company that served Google campus so we tried to put the Google logo on our site under partners and we got a serious slap on the wrist.\n\nNow to address the concerns about whether or not they are a partner or just compatible with their technology - yes, they are partners. Specifically using the HPC server technology, which is high performance computing, that is listed on that partners page in the small blurb. This would typically be some type of server rack with the PCIe backbone to have multiple processors or GPUs to do high performance computing of some variety for those companies listed such as Apple, Intel, etc. It may be crunching numbers for Apple Maps or maybe just for how many times the restrooms were cleaned across the Apple campus. We don't know. We just know they use the OSS HPC products at a large enough scale that they have approval to put them on the partners page.\n\nI hope that helps clear things up.

        "body": "TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both.",

        "body": "This is what I did: I started with YouTube to learn exactly what 5G is, how it works differently compared to 4G and how absolutely life changing 5G will be compared to 4G. We\u2019re talking self driving cars, delivery drones, and doctors in New York performing surgery on soldiers in Afghanistan in a tent. \n\nFrom there you have the companies that make the actually radio transmission device like Nokia and Ericsson (both very reasonably priced). Those devices have to go somewhere so you put them on a tower owned by AMT and CCI (crown castle, not carnival cruise line). Those companies make money renting the towers to the service providers. Then you have the companies that make the chips that go into those devices, the chips that go into cell phones, drones and the internet of things (NVDA, INTC, MRVL, QCOM, etc.). Then there are the companies that make the devices we buy to connect us to 5G (Apple, amazon, google, Tesla). Finally there are the service providers like Verizon att and t mobile that connect our devices to the 5G network. \n\nI suggest starting at YouTube. There are videos that explain what each company does and their role in the 5G network.\n\nHowever, I wanted ALL of the companies with not a lot of money so I went after the 5G ETF (ticker: FIVG).",

Workstations don't care about clock speed, they want multi core throughput.\n\n&gt;The only thing AMD has is slightly cheaper prices and a lot of cores that are usually unused, though in some specialties those cores are very useful.\n\nagain I have both AMD and Intel comps, the AMD wins hands down with price per performance on everything but gaming higher clock speed and I could still overclock if I absolutely needed more but most games do not care about CPUs its GPU bottle-necked.\n\n&gt;i5 9600K outperforms Ryzen 7 3700X and is cheaper than Ryzen 7 3700X\n\nonly in single core speed, in multi core processes the 3700X has 2 more cores and twice the threads it would dominate the i5 9600K. A better comparison in the cheaper benchmarks is a 3600X anyways as it has the same 6 cores but more threads at roughly the same clock speed and similar price as a i5 9600K. Making it a better choice than the i5 9600K in everything but gaming and in gaming both CPUs would perform just fine.",

        "body": "Lets take this one bite at a time. Please understand this isn't a personal rant of Intel hate or AMD love, just my informed opinion about the companies as investments. \n\nClock speed - Yep. Intel still holds *single core* performance crown, at the cost of incredibly high power draw and all for maybe 5% improvement. Multi-Core AMD still leads and offers more value per $ overall. \n\nMarket Share - Depends on your sources and regions so I won't nitpick on specifically \"who has more % of market share\" but rather, who has momentum and is gaining vs. losing market share. AMD is gaining consistently regardless of data source. \n\nSecurity Flaws - Threat to both, Intel has just had more bad press lately. No telling when these flaws get picked up in the media or how much they will effect. However, the CTS Labs scandal from 2018 shouldn't be ignored. An intel funded \"security\" company based in Israel announces AMD vulnerabilities publicly without contacting AMD (industry standard to give notice so they can fix). Vulnerabilities were practically nothing (diversion from Spectre and Meltdown) and company has faded into the background without answering any questions, deleting their webpage \"[AMDFlaws.com](https://AMDFlaws.com)\"\n\nMarketing Deception - \n\n* 2018 Computex Industrial Chiller incident to distract from Threadripper\n* Principled Technologies funded study, using an Intel funded benchmark, that pitted the i9-9900K  against a 2700X that deliberately had half its cores disabled\n* Threadripper losing to an i5 in same Intel funded benchmark\n* 2019 MDS vulnerability appears, Intel bribes researchers to downplay severity\n* \"Real World Performance\" campaign the moment benchmarks started showing AMD consistently in the lead, trying to devalue long standing benchmark validity. \n* \"Financial Horsepower\" $3 BILLION set aside to persuade anyone considering AMD to stick with Intel.\n* \"Real World Performance\" caught deliberately hiding disclosures, which exist because Intel was previously caught in anti-consumer deceptive practices in 2009. \n* Plethora of vaporware product announcements with rigged benchmarks, but since the product was never released we can't independently test. \n\nAnti-Competitive Practices - See $3Billion bullet above. And dont' recall what their latest margins on CPUs were, but AMD margins are increasing and Intel has been price cutting. Again, momentum in AMDs favor. \n\nNvidia Market Leader - Team Green has long been the GPU market leader and it isn't debatable, but as AMD (hopefully) and Intel both become more competitive Nvidia may be forced to cut into their margin to stay on top. Sources vary again, but typically they sit at about 70% market share +/-. \n\nMy comparison to Ford/Tesla = Intel/Nvidia remains. Intel has the capability/cash to turn the ship around but I'm not buying until I see a defined culture shift there.",

We had just had the internet millenial clock challenge so everybody and been spending a lot on hardware.  And the market simply projected that growth forward for years.   It didn't happen.  Are we making the same mistake now with services and the Cloud?  There has to be a point where, like hardware, the services are mature and the crazy growth comes back to single digits.

Workstations don't care about clock speed, they  want multi core throughput. \n\nWhat is your technical knowledge? I doubt any average software uses more than 6 cores. Not only that, but multi-cores becomes very ineffecient the more cores you have.\n\nAlso games don't use 1 or 2 cores, games really do use all the cores usually, just at a certain point it doesn't make a difference anymore because of a lot of technical difficulties. And most of modern games barely use the CPU for anything, so the FPS differences between 9600K and 3700X will be almost none except for very CPU-intensive games. \n\nYou should watch this : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5-3MMoA\\_A0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5-3MMoA_A0)\n\n&gt;again I have both AMD and Intel comps, the AMD wins hands down with  price per performance on everything but gaming higher clock speed and I  could still overclock if I absolutely needed more but most games do not  care about CPUs its GPU bottle-necked. \n\nHow did you test that? Sounds like some bullshit you made up with no objective data. As I said before, most programs don't use multiple cores effeciently as they simply can't.\n\nThe only thing a 3700X, which is much more expensive than the 9600k, would beat the 9600K in, would be either specific software utilizing multiple cores to compute independent lines of code or a lot of active programs being ran at once. \n\n&gt;only in single core speed, in multi core processes the 3700X has 2 more  cores and twice the threads it would dominate the i5 9600K. A better  comparison in the cheaper benchmarks is a 3600X anyways as it has the  same 6 cores but more threads at roughly the same clock speed and  similar price as a i5 9600K. Making it a better choice than the i5 9600K  in everything but gaming and in gaming both CPUs would perform just  fine. \n\nSame answer as above. \n\nAnd no, a 9600K should be compared to a 3700X, the 3600X is no match at all. The 9600K outperforms the 3600X even on the 8-core test, lmao. Showing how threads aren't that useful. \n\n**Here are the specific and objective numbers that are relevant :**\n\n3700X is \\~42% more expensive than the 9600K, 170 euros vs 240 euros.\n\nThese are the performance scores, 9600K on the left and 3700X on the right. Non-OC :\n\nMemory speed : 93,3 vs 79\n\nSingle-core : 136 vs 136\n\nTwo-core : 271 vs 269\n\nFour-core : 532 vs 516\n\nEight-core : 761 vs 928\n\nSixty-four core : 905 vs 1499\n\nOC :\n\nMemory speed : 97,4 vs 89,2\n\nSingle-core : 155 vs 141\n\nTwo-core : 308 vs 281\n\nFour-core : 616 vs 548\n\nEight-core : 899 vs 1025\n\nSixty-four core : 768 vs 1418\n\nSource : [https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-9600K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4031vs4043](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-9600K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4031vs4043)\n\nAs you can see, objectively, there's no reason to ever buy the much more expensive 3700X over the 9600K unless you specifically require a very high core count.  Also note that in benchmarks the conditions for multi-core are ideal with minimum memory usage and no overlapping calculations. In real world software, there will always be a lot of memory storage and reading between CPU's, which will make the multi-cores less effective. \n\nIn games that like multi-core CPU's like CS:GO the 9600K still outperforms the 3700X by 20% in fps, this mostly likely caused by the memory latency of the 3700X. \n\nI'm not saying Intel is much better, I'm saying Intel's performance is king, while AMD's price per performance is king.\n\nI believe the Ryzen 5 3600 is the most valuable processor right now. As you can see, many AMD's on the list :\n\n[https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu\\_value\\_available.html](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_value_available.html)",

The only thing that saved them was the iPod and some help from Microsoft and Intel.  They are going to lose the smartphone wars too. Android is over 80% of global market, it's open, it's cheaper, and will eventually beat out apple. It will take a very very long time. And apple  has plenty of other niches, but they no longer have Jobs, or a viable halo product to keep there massive growth for a couple decades. I'm not saying they are a bad buy, but you asked for reasons why not. They are no longer a growth company. They are just maximizing existing product life and patents and software etc. But they don't have the opportunity for massive growth like other smaller companies. They have failed before, they still can't get TV done correctly, they are under 20% market share in their walled garden, and they charge premium prices, what could go wrong?",

Zen 3 moving to 7 nm to 7 nm EuV is a relatively big step that should bring 10% performance, they're talking another +15% in architecture so it could solidify AMD at the top. AMD keep saying Q3, I have no idea how they will pull that off, that's like now. \n\nZen 4 will be total market dominance in CPU (if not from Zen 3), Huawei got banned from TSMC and AMD joinked their reserved wafers on 5 nm. The smartphone guys usually launch on the new node in like March, AMD will probably need longer, but not that much longer. There's another 7-10% performance or 15% power reduction at 5 nm and I think Intel is targeting their first 10 nm desktop processors Q4 2021 on 10 nm++ (no joke, that's their name). \n\nAMD's advantage fighting TSMC's 5nm vs Intel's 14 nm++++ for most of 2021 will absolutely crush Intel.",
