Nuclear is not something the United States, Japan, UK, Germany, or the rest of the 1st world countries want to go because of the waste and environmental impact.  China and India are the two majors that would need to commit to nuclear, and if they do, dollars to doughnuts they are not gonna use mines located in the US.  Another thing to consider, is that if people start to move out of the cities and people dense areas to more sparsely populated areas what is gonna prevent them to stay complete off the grid if it's possible with today's tech.  The pitifalls of the past in using renewable energy as the primary source to power a home has always been the conversion and storage part of the equation,  not the acquisition of it.   On the inverter side, companies like SEDG and ENPH have held onto their gains and continue to show robust sales in both the US and Europe.  Tesla's power wall has been gaining momentum and is leading the way in batteries.  Tesla is not just a car company, it's a renewable energy infrastructure play that in years to come will drive the new IoT in the future.  Add Musk's satellite internet drive and there is broad brush stroke of the next market cycle.",

It keeps a trading range. AMD is another one. You can find a ton of stocks that bounce between trading ranges. \n\nBut you can also play them off unusual activity or around before expected news. \n\nAZN had around a 6% day yesterday. My options went up 176% since I got in a few days earlier before the IV spike. \n\nGot be careful with them tho and only trade with a certain position of your portfolio. I try to keep 10% or lower.
