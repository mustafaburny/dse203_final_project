        "body": "I also have this TERRIBLE FOMO. But there are lots of stocks that fall in this. First off, take a huge deep breath because in the end this is \"all money\". I know money can make life easier but your FOMO is just about how you're perceiving your world having changed if you invested in TSLA.\n\nNext, sit down and reflect on the past. Think about how much you would have invested back in April given your mind set. Seriously, think about the realities of the situation. Stock market had crashed, COVID was raging, economic collapse was a real aura in the air. If you look at just the stock price and think about \"if I just yolo'd my life savings in to TSLA then, I could retire now!\", there are infinite stocks you could have done this with.\n\nAlso, you stated you had a legitimate reason not to buy TSLA in April. Big question: What has changed between then and now? Do you all of a sudden like Elon as a CEO? Are you just sad you missed out on gains? Take this a big learning experience. Write down your behaviour and strategies, and refer to this self-created documentation before you make any moves in the future. Take emotion out of the game, and tweak your strategy/document as you learn more.\n\nWhen TSLA hit $1000 in June, that's when I finally had the conviction to say: \"Fuck it, I'm getting in\". I put 10% of my portfolio into TSLA and made a strategy for myself:\n\n1. I would hold TSLA long term so price fluctuations wouldn't scare me.\n\n2. I did research and fundamentally believed that TSLA could go to $2000 within 3 years based on their upcoming product lines (ie. insurance product, power plant, batter augments, robo-taxi, etc).\n\n3. I created a buying strategy that I would buy whenever the price dropped a certain amount, or if it crossed certain resistance levels. I also realized TSLA moves on momentum, so I would buy immediately the morning of any news release. That included earnings, stock split, battery day, etc. And that strategy has worked really well for me.\n\nUsing these rules of order, I stopped trying to buy into TSLA with emotion and rather focused on fundamentals and market forces.\n\nIf I was getting into TSLA today, I would use the following strategies:\n\n1. I would only go in with a small amount, no more than 5% of my account out of fear of over valuation.\n\n2. If I had funds to go in with 100 shares, I would buy 100 shares and immediately buy near term puts to hedge against a heavy downswing. So you could buy 100 shares at $640 and then buy $600 Jan 15 puts to hedge against a heavy downsize. That would bring you peace of mind against an \"overvaluation\".\n\nAfter that, you could decide to sell covered calls to bring down your cost average if TSLA stabilizes, or just let it ride if it keeps running.\n\n\nBe very aware that TSLA as a company is surging right now mainly because of supply/demand economics. All fundamentals went out the window after TSLA announced the split and the stock surged 100% since then.\n\nAlso, be aware that LOTS of stocks in the past few years have gone up 500%. You didn't just miss out on TSLA, here is a list of companies:\n\n1. AMZN\n\n2. MSFT\n\n3. AAPL\n\n4. PAYC\n\n5. OKTA\n\n6. AMD (which is actually up 50x...)\n\n7. NVDA\n\n8. SHOP\n\n9. APPS\n\n10. CLSK\n\n11. ROKU\n\n12. SQ\n\nDo you have FOMO at not buying AAPL in 2016? Or APPS when it was $5?\n\nSo again, if you play this game there are an infinite number of companies you could have bought that would have made you ultra rich in the past 5 years.",
