Amazon and Walmart have been kind of duds this year as high P/E stocks, while GM and Goldman Sachs have been low P/E All-Stars.\n\nStock | Price increase past year | P/E ratio\n:--|--:|--:\nAmazon | +2.8% | 60.4\nGoldman Sachs | +99.7% | 7.6\nWalmart | +2.8% | 41.9\nGM | +66.0% | 5.7\n\nP/E cannot be relied upon in isolation to pick good/bad buys. GM is a good example of the complication of P/E. Almost all of GM's business is internal combustion engine cars, so its P/E is using its legacy business as a base in the calculation, but all of the optimism around GM is about everything else they are doing besides internal combustion engine cars. GM itself thinks their legacy business will disappear in 10-15 years, so its P/E is nonsensical when looking forward. Their \"true\" future P/E is going to be based on earnings from non-internal combustion engine cars, and those earnings are essentially zero right now. In other words, their true forward looking P/E is much higher than 5.7. They are a future high P/E stock disguised as a current low P/E stock, but the future high P/E is going to be driven by earnings declines.\n\nIn terms of finding value, there is usually a story why a company's P/E is low. You have to find the story and see if you are okay with it. Maybe it's something like Intel where consumer sentiment is so negative due to their rivals' recent tech advantages, but the deeper you look, the more you see competitive advantages that Intel will be able to maintain and leverage going forward to build its stock price back up. Or maybe it's a low P/E like Altria because no one wants to own tobacco stocks.",

I believe that they contract with foundries like TSMC to have their chips produced. I could be wrong on that though.\n\nBut, I don't see anything NVIDIA produces as likely to find their way into school bus air conditioning, or any other place where pedestrian basic chips perform perfectly adequately.\n\nThat would be like purchasing a Ferrari station wagon because you needed a car to get groceries with. Expensive, and not the niche that NVIDIA or Ferrari want to play in.\n\nIn the areas where their chips are going to be in demand, the competition is fierce from AMD, Intel, and many other chip designers that play in that space.

This is no go and it may turn around a bit on buybacks, financial engineering they have a ton of money but it's not on the back of technology.  \n\nAny non boomer working in cloud computing/semi field can tell you INTC is not where you want to put your money.

I do an 80/20 split with 80% going into an ETF portfolio that's anchored by VOO but leans small cap value with exposure into developing and emerging markets and some long term bonds.  I just dump into that every paycheck and rearrange once a quarter to keep my ratios about the same.  The other 20% goes into individual stock picks.  Really, I think of individual stocks, my biggest one is Intel, and it's only 1% of my entire portfolio.  I want to test this out for a few years and maybe slowly shift the balance if I feel like I'm getting the hang of it.  I believe the market is overvalued right now, but I believe, in general, in the idea that the market is where you should invest your money.  I'm still going 25 or so years until retirement so I got time to really dig into some of the companies I'd like to when a correction happens.\n\nI also run a magic formula investor portfolio with about $600.00, just to compare how it looks with next year, have about $350.00 invested in crypto, and an account for daytrades and options plays that I do not feed but only use the money that are in them.

The actual hubspot solution is better than salesforces. The thing salesforce did well was create a platform out of their CRM, their actual tech is pretty lame built on APEX code and Oracle databases, their secrete sauce is the ability for other companies to monetize within their platform through building apps that solve problem, it further entrenches the reliance of that particular company and saleforce.com",

By paying dividends, it significantly lowers their ability of reinvest in their business and is in fact a sign of low growth/stalwart - companies like ORCL and CSCO face little growth and has no plans on growing, which is why it would rather pay it out to share holders. Not my favorite style, since the business cannot compound their earnings.",
