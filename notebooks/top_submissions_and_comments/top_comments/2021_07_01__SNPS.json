Also, retail fear could lead to a significant selloff, whether or not it's really warranted. The American and global economies are also fairly heavily dependent on production in foreign markets, which covid could adversely affect, even if America doesn't see a spike in cases, which it already seems to be seeing.\n\nEveryone keeps saying how the markets are irrational, saying it'll keep going up, but they forget that it can work both ways. Investors can and have panic sold en masse based solely on fear rather than fundamentals.\n\nLots of other concerning indicators right now, but there are always concerns at any given time throughout history. An article about GOOGL facing potentially bearish headwinds due to anti-trust probes published in 2011 is practically verbatim the same as an article posted two weeks ago.\n\nTL;DR: Deaths from covid and Delta might not be up, but that is hardly the only factor here.

Smart people making policy decisions and being the ones to direct 40% of the resources in society would lead to MORE resources for all. Smart people would have a higher percentage of wealth and at a higher rate of acquisition, but also, there would be more resources for everyone else, AND there would be more resources in total. \n\nYes, we live in a world of cause and effect. Society is an illusion of contractual obligations but the fundamental force is violence. Ever action is just a probabilistic equilibrium of various forces.  \n\nWhy would anyone give up any control? What interest is there in abandoning power? \n\nThose who abandon power will probabilistically at some point let go of too much and cease to have power. This you disappear. The only ones who are left, are those tho don\u2019t let go. Once you have power, you do everything to keep and maintain and generate more. (Even if you happen to be a mentally ill stupid parasite) why? Because the challenge to your power could be an illusion that the environment is more intelligent than you are, and that challenge might be not true, and just an illusion. Probabilistically, it\u2019s best to avoid loss of power. That\u2019s how you keep the power. \n\nI see what you mean. It\u2019s all game theory (rational choice theory) \n\nIt\u2019s all about cost-benefit analysis for option determination and application of mathematical analysis for strategic interaction in a competitive environments. \n\nwith competitive situations where the outcome of a participant's choice of action depends critically on the actions of other participants. \n\nBut no. I would not do the same. Eternal intelligence must be equated with eternal power.  That is the equilibrium. Everything else is just worthy of sacrifice. \n\nEventually, a bad decision will cause a loss of power. And these bad decisions are more likely with a lack of intelligence. But with eternal intelligence in a place of power (control over environment), these events are infinitely less likely than before. \n\nMental illness and power being together is an inefficiency in the system. And any friction or resistance to intelligence carries eternal harm. Of course this goes into ontology and epistemology. (Study of being and study of knowledge) \n\nBasically, people are localized (since a persons awareness and thoughts aren\u2019t everywhere at once) - I.e. disabling one persons neurons doesn\u2019t effect another ones consciousness. \n\nEssentially we are discussing Individualized, Localized, Sentient, sapient, conscious, autonomous(self-ruled) units. These units impart changes into the environment, or vice versa. \n\nAre all units the same? \n\nI would say no. Fundamentally, conscious choices define a \u201cconsciousness\u201d and not all choices are capable of being made by every consciousness. \n\nAnd taking this into account, some \u201cconsciousness\u201d will contribute tonight the inefficiency or a system more than other consciousness. \n\nAnd because of that, this warrants any applied judgement as valid, since a judgement is simply a recognition of an in efficiency that should not be there and only contributes to eternal harm. \n\nConsciousness tries to avoid eternal suffering, harm, and death. And there are conscious forces out there  that are eternally more aligned with inefficiencies. \n\nSo while rationally it might not be wise to ever \u201clet go\u201d of power and control over an environment, such actions so reveal the alignment to fundamental inefficiency. And such inefficiencies carry an eternal cost to existence. A cost that some existence would rather not pay. And thus, the legitimacy of a judgement is created.",

I think the human species needs to collectively invest in things that improve the world, not the contrary. To discern what improves the world is no small feat, and this substantially limits diversity in my portfolio, but I think it is worthwhile.\n\nThe most difficult aspect in making a utilitarian moral calculation is wrapping one's head around Game Theory, making an informed decision, and sticking with it despite potentially tremendous pressure to yield. This also means understanding Kant's Categorical Imperative:\n\n&gt;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\n\nOnce that's understood, the question is much more simple. Which maxims, when applied universally, will probably produce the most good? To answer that, I research ecology, biology, and anthropology for a sense of what has occurred, then I study contemporary issues (from macro to micro) in order to infer what is presently erroneous/detrimental, what functions, what is likely, and what is ideal.\n\nAt this point, I avoid doing anything within reason that (in my approximation) produces too many detrimental latent dysfunctions in exchange for (what amounts to) a meager reward. If the disparity between what's intended to benefit the world -- \"the world,\" defined as an ideal abstraction, an apparatus which best secures the fate of healthy organisms through the organic virtues of diversity, abundance, and equilibrium -- and what inadvertently causes the world harm is irreconcilable, I avoid the (in)activity.\n\nTL;DR\nYes, I avoid certain stocks on strictly moral grounds.",

Most trading is done by machines and is basically not emotional. \n\nBig capital moves the market and a large portion of that capital is other peoples money and can also be highly leveraged (margin, etc.).\n\nSo the funds with other peoples money claim risk levels to their investors that they tolerate and are obligated to maintain, or they have high leverage that creates more risk on bigger moves. So when risk gets created, they are compelled to sell off to de-risk even if the price they are selling is undervalued or low. \n\nThis creates abnormally large dips in prices in the short term since a lot of money is adjusting at the same time. It is a buy opportunity for retail who doesn't care and have same obligations.",
