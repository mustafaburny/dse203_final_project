        "body": "Would you be able to help me understand these numbers a bit better? You're saying 1.5 - 2.5% per week, assuming selling weeklies. I actually just started a wheel this week and used CSCO, selling a put about $0.50 OTM a week ago, expiring today for $0.63. Being new to this I screwed up and didn't buy to close with premiums at 0.08 on Wed and ended up buying to close today for 0.30 to avoid assignment. While I would've been fine with assignment I had made another mistake on Tues and doubled my exposure with even higher strike puts - I let that lot get assigned.\n\nMy point being, best case the stock didn't drop like 5% in the last two days and the contracts expired worthless and I'm up 1.5%. Safe play would've been to take 87% profits on Wed, good for 1.32% on the week. Was this just a crap week or am I making a fundamental mistake beyond not locking in profits?",

But I still love my WSB memes.\n\n\\- It's clearly overvalued, even a fully retarded understanding of FA will show you that.Even after the recent drop it's valued at around 40x REVENUES (LOL), not EARNINGS. Other tech stocks have nowhere near these valuations. FB has a revenue multiple of around 8. Difference is FB and other stocks actually have a decent chunk of revenue converted ( and will continue to be converted to revenue) to EARNINGS. ZM has almost ZERO prospects of converting even a fraction of this revenue into earnings due to :\n\n\\- Bigger,better competition with massive amounts of capital to invest compared to ZOOM. Google, MSFT, FB, CISCO, ADOBE. Do you really think that if there was that much money to be made in the videoconferencing sector ZM will even have any significant market share a short time from now?  What kind of earnings or margin do you see be made on this small market share, if any? These companies have just cloned what worked for Zoom and offered it for free through their existing interlinked platforms. Offered a similar ( and eventually better) product for FREE, not a great investment thesis for ZM longer term. Video conferencing is NOT a high tech, heavily patented sector, it's essentially freeware longer term. The software development is basic and we wouldn't even be talking about Zoom if it wasn't for beer aids. \n\n\\- Beer aids has peaked, at least fear of it has. People will start going back to offices around the world soon, no long term thesis for zoom's current price. One of the first things struggling businesses and companies cut during downturns is non-essential IT expenses, so like I said, even if you think a recession/possibly depression is likely (I do) you would cut zoom use across the company and move to a free platform.\n\n\\-ZM was clearly a meme stock bought buy poor , first time normies or mum and dad investors that was happily dumped on them shortly after the IPO. Fuck me, to get and idea of the average investor just remember that ZOOM ticker mooned because investors didn't even bother to check the right ticker for this pile of shit and bought the wrong company. ZOOM trading was even suspended lol. Being a med-long investor on ZM is like flying a booking a spaceflight where everyone on the vessel including the flight crew tell you BEFOREHAND that they are mongoloids but you still buy a ticket anyway. \n\n\\- Security issues, zoombombing, shit load of existing tech companies exploiting the shit out of these stuff ups as they ramp up their own products. The power google,FB and others have using their advertising budget and other media platforms to promote their own product shouldn't be underestimated - just look at the propaganda that been put out by big tech the last few days.\n\n\\- Friday was just a tiny dead cat bounce with people taking profits and/or some market makers covering their spreads on expiration, the drop was anticipated but happened a bit quicker than many were expecting imo. That's my retards opinion on the open interest and the put/call ratio activity anyway. There where a shit load of calls on this and still are that are now way OTM and will expiry useless over the next couple of weeks and have already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- How many more reasons do you need? This is WSB, Elon bipolar rant over. Iv'e been short on this dumpster fire since the 7% below the top, mostly unbalanced butterflys and backspreads and I even gone full retard at points and just bought straight puts occasionally. They have been printing but to be honest I feel a bit sorry for the mum and dad investors who bought this cos they saw their kids using the app - they are not stupid, probably smarter than me most of them- but they have been handed this pile of shit by CNBC and analysts who work for the same banks that made fees on the IPO and selling on the spike.",
