        "body": "Whats weird is that they dropped this information on the Friday after thanksgiving, then crashed the market. Then on monday all was well, and suddenly \"scared\" again on Tuesday? THAT makes less sense than any of it. What we all took a day off and didnt worry about it then remembered it exists on Tuesday?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is money makers and institutions suppressing the market to buy at lows, they've been doing it ALL FREAKING YEAR. Any bit of news on that shows a hint of negativity about oil, energy, infrastructure/construction, COVID, fucking \"chip shortages\" that never really happened, and all other forms of bullshit have caused catastrophic and disproportional drops in the market, led by growth stocks being trashed. The \"all time highs\" are being propped up by giants in the market, and everything else has been trading sideways since April/May, with little spurts of an up and down that confuse everyone.\n\nThe reason we know this is fuckery is that retail sentiment hasnt changed- no one in retail gives a shit about any of those factors and knows they are FUD, unfortunately we don't control the market  AT ALL so we are just watching them do what they want to shake us out.\n\nThe GME squeeze started as a \"fuck you\" the hedge funds- it had an opposite effect: they realized they could come into Reddit, post whatever they want, spread bullshit, and tank stocks whenever they wanted. And my theory is that it's revenge for what retail did with both GME and AMC. We're seeing a strong reaction by market makers and institutions that do most of their trading in dark pools after or before normal hours of trading which have basically rendered retail unable to react fast enough. \n\nIt's sick but honestly, what did we expect? They have the money, the control, and the agencies in their pocket that will never prosecute or legislate. We never had a chance.",

My guess is that while that stuff gets amplified by the internet because it\u2019s more sensational, the vast majority of the money in the markets is institutional and so outside of a few notable exceptions (GME, AMC, Rivian as you mentioned), the retail sentiments and trends that get written about feel really pervasive even if the overall market impact is fairly negligible. \n\nI see this with Bitcoin all the time - almost every day there is a headline about BTC in either the WSJ or Businessweek but the BTC market cap is pretty negligible compared to the broader financial markets, it just gets a lot of publicity because of its relative novelty and volatility.",

My guess is that while that stuff gets amplified by the internet because it\u2019s more sensational, the vast majority of the money in the markets is institutional and so outside of a few notable exceptions (GME, AMC, Rivian as you mentioned), the retail sentiments and trends that get written about feel really pervasive even if the overall market impact is fairly negligible. \n\nI see this with Bitcoin all the time - almost every day there is a headline about BTC in either the WSJ or Businessweek but the BTC market cap is pretty negligible compared to the broader financial markets, it just gets a lot of publicity because of its relative novelty and volatility.",

I have experienced great success with such lead-ins as, \"Does this banana look firm to you?\" Or, \"In your opinion, should I purchase red grapes or Thompson seedless?\" This line always works to break the ice. \"Will you smell this avocado?\" Anyway, yesterday on my regular cruise at Whole Foods stalking grounds I overheard a conversation between two fine specimens well below cougar status. \"My idiot husband plowed every cent into AMC stock, and now we can't pay the mortgage. He says MOASS. I say YOURASS.\" Yes, this gal might well become a future prospect after her divorce is finalized, but I really don't like to date women under the age of 40, because there is simply no meeting of the minds. Nonetheless, I find that these young damsels are magnetically attracted to me, and I sometimes must fight my urges. At the moment, apes have bigger problems than my own.",

My guess is that while that stuff gets amplified by the internet because it\u2019s more sensational, the vast majority of the money in the markets is institutional and so outside of a few notable exceptions (GME, AMC, Rivian as you mentioned), the retail sentiments and trends that get written about feel really pervasive even if the overall market impact is fairly negligible. \n\nI see this with Bitcoin all the time - almost every day there is a headline about BTC in either the WSJ or Businessweek but the BTC market cap is pretty negligible compared to the broader financial markets, it just gets a lot of publicity because of its relative novelty and volatility.",

Also loaded on what was a speculative position last year with higher conviction now - bought quite a few CRSP at what I believe to be the bottom at the 78 range - currently avg at 102+-.{Not even mentioning my stupid PLTR,BB position - gambles going wrong atm, believing in the hype and the reason I bought hasnt changed still hence why i havent sold}\r  \n\r  \nAlthough I have sizeable losses here these positions have elevated my positions amazingly.\r  \n\r  \nHolding a sizeable position with xxx% returns on AMD and NIO and very bullish on SE - recently added to my position at 280\r  \n\r  \nbought into the AMC hype with a 14 avg and sold of 80% at around the 60 mark\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSquare shouldve been scalped and rebought 205-280 range and back is ridiculous but oh well\r  \n\r  \nsold JD into strenght to buy into my weaker positions - had a big position before. still bullish but seeing more upside elsewhere atm.\r  \n\r  \nI dont have any us mega caps- I know winners stay winners usually but I am looking for hopefully bigger returns albeith I run risk of big losses, clearly, as well - such as sizeble position in a clinical trial biotech AGTC - currently at a big loss aswell but that was expected.

I generally cruise the produce section in search of wealthy and lonely cougars, and it is best if they are divorced, but that is not an absolute requirement. I have experienced great success with such lead-ins as, \"Does this banana look firm to you?\" Or, \"In your opinion, should I purchase red grapes or Thompson seedless?\" This line always works to break the ice. \"Will you smell this avocado?\" Anyway, yesterday on my regular cruise at Whole Foods stalking grounds I overheard a conversation between two fine specimens well below cougar status. \"My idiot husband plowed every cent into AMC stock, and now we can't pay the mortgage. He says MOASS. I say YOURASS.\" Yes, this gal might well become a future prospect after her divorce is finalized, but I really don't like to date women under the age of 40, because there is simply no meeting of the minds. Nonetheless, I find that these young damsels are magnetically attracted to me, and I sometimes must fight my urges. At the moment, apes have bigger problems than my own.",

I generally cruise the produce section in search of wealthy and lonely cougars, and it is best if they are divorced, but that is not an absolute requirement. I have experienced great success with such lead-ins as, \"Does this banana look firm to you?\" Or, \"In your opinion, should I purchase red grapes or Thompson seedless?\" This line always works to break the ice. \"Will you smell this avocado?\" Anyway, yesterday on my regular cruise at Whole Foods stalking grounds I overheard a conversation between two fine specimens well below cougar status. \"My idiot husband plowed every cent into AMC stock, and now we can't pay the mortgage. He says MOASS. I say YOURASS.\" Yes, this gal might well become a future prospect after her divorce is finalized, but I really don't like to date women under the age of 40, because there is simply no meeting of the minds. Nonetheless, I find that these young damsels are magnetically attracted to me, and I sometimes must fight my urges. At the moment, apes have bigger problems than my own.",

THAT makes less sense than any of it. What we all took a day off and didnt worry about it then remembered it exists on Tuesday?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is money makers and institutions suppressing the market to buy at lows, they've been doing it ALL FREAKING YEAR. Any bit of news on that shows a hint of negativity about oil, energy, infrastructure/construction, COVID, fucking \"chip shortages\" that never really happened, and all other forms of bullshit have caused catastrophic and disproportional drops in the market, led by growth stocks being trashed. The \"all time highs\" are being propped up by giants in the market, and everything else has been trading sideways since April/May, with little spurts of an up and down that confuse everyone.\n\nThe reason we know this is fuckery is that retail sentiment hasnt changed- no one in retail gives a shit about any of those factors and knows they are FUD, unfortunately we don't control the market  AT ALL so we are just watching them do what they want to shake us out.\n\nThe GME squeeze started as a \"fuck you\" the hedge funds- it had an opposite effect: they realized they could come into Reddit, post whatever they want, spread bullshit, and tank stocks whenever they wanted. And my theory is that it's revenge for what retail did with both GME and AMC. We're seeing a strong reaction by market makers and institutions that do most of their trading in dark pools after or before normal hours of trading which have basically rendered retail unable to react fast enough. \n\nIt's sick but honestly, what did we expect? They have the money, the control, and the agencies in their pocket that will never prosecute or legislate. We never had a chance.",

My guess is that while that stuff gets amplified by the internet because it\u2019s more sensational, the vast majority of the money in the markets is institutional and so outside of a few notable exceptions (GME, AMC, Rivian as you mentioned), the retail sentiments and trends that get written about feel really pervasive even if the overall market impact is fairly negligible. \n\nI see this with Bitcoin all the time - almost every day there is a headline about BTC in either the WSJ or Businessweek but the BTC market cap is pretty negligible compared to the broader financial markets, it just gets a lot of publicity because of its relative novelty and volatility.",
