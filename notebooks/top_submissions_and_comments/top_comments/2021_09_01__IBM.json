Here is some food for the discussion:\n\n* SPY is made up of about a dozen different sectors, with different weightings: 24.19% tech, 13.82% healthcare, 13.55% financial services, 11.18% communication services, 9.04% industrials, 7.17% consumer defensive, 10.99% consumer cyclical, 2.86% utilities, and 2.52% real estate. They have tickers like XLK, XLV, XLY, XLC etc.  Look up the rest.  In other words, if tech and healthcare are doing good, that's 37% of SPY.  If Tech (XLK), Healthcare (XLV), and Financials (XLF) are doing good, that's 50% of SPY and it's basically impossible to crash the S&amp;P500.  \n* Over the last few weeks, most of these sectors have been flat or starting to break down, but Tech and Healthcare and Financials were doing fine.  \n* Healthcare, XLV, has dropped to its 50 day MVA. \n* Within the SP500, the top 10 weighted stonks are: Apple Inc., Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook Class A, Google Class A, Google Class C, Tesla, NVIDIA, Berkshire, and JP Morgan. These make up 28%!  The Big Tech companies make up 20%.  That's why SPY has kept booming; because these big companies are making tons of cash.  As long as these guys are in an uptrend, most likely SPY will be.  \n* Most of these guys are sitting on huge piles of cash, and none have broken down severely.  \n* Before the 1987 crash, like 5 of the top 10 companies had already nosedived.  IBM, Ford, Exxon, General Electric, etc.  In comparison, Apple, MSFT, Amazon, FB, and Google are either flat, in clear uptrends, and/or are sitting on cash.  \n* Agree with you that we could see a correction, but not full bear market mode yet.  To enter full bear mode we would need:\n   * Amazon to run out of Chinese junk to sell\n   * JP Morgan to have Chinese contagion effect\n   * NVIDIA, Apple, and Tesla to be constrained by chips\n   * Buffet to pass away and BRK to drop\n   * Something bad to happen to FB and Google . . . government regulation?

Anyone who buys and sells this company at this 22-26 range and thinks they're Gordon gecko are fucking morons.\n\nScalability has been proven time and time again much much more bullish than bearish. Amazon and IBM partnerships as well as others, they can deploy Foundry completely remotely without having any on-site engineers for products like Foundry for builders and many other versions. Their margins would look significantly better if they hadn't just gone on an absolute hiring tear by the way. They've dramatically increased hiring sales employees this year as they ramp up distribution which guess what? They're using the SBC to ensure this massive hiring they're doing is focused on the long term and is way better for shareholders than simply paying them in cash. Maybe if you had any idea what the company is actually doing you'd see right away that these bear cases are missing the entire point of how they're growing the company. Maybe if you'd actually listened to any of the last 3 earnings calls you'd realize everything you're saying makes no sense. \n\nBut you're intellectually dishonest and just want attention so you don't care about any of that \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\n\nThey're absurdly financially healthy and you truly don't understand business Financials if you think they're not. You're saying you don't like the multiple that the share trades at and acting like that relates to the financial prospects of the company itself. \n\nSbc is massively overhyped toward the bearish constantly taken out of context or misused to present a misleading case. It's not out of comparison with other growth or tech companies. So you either just hate growth companies or you aren't really valid for shitting on palantir.",

It's been a few years since I did a deep dive,  but hardware was only about 25% of their revenue from what I remember.   Most of the revenue comes from licensing. \n\nThis is why Apple took them to court.   Every cell phone maker HAS to buy a license from QCOM since they own most of the IP for the modems, from 3G through 5G, cell phones don't work without QCOM IP.  \n\nNow QCOM doesn't sell individual licensing for modems,  it's just one license that includes the modems and the processors and everything else and it's expensive.   Once you buy the licensing,  the QCOM components are cheaper than the competition since they have small margins (after all,  they already made a bunch of money on the license).\n\nApple tried to play hardball and quit using QCOM,  but when IBM couldn't make a 5G modem,  they capitulated and signed a multi year contract with QCOM. \n\nStill lots of growth opportunities since all the IoT stuff is going to have modems and those modems are going to buy licensing from QCOM. \n\nI still own 100 shares at a negative cost basis (I had 250 shares at a low $60s basis and sold 150 shares above $130).",

And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nIt is my view that the FSD tech would be more of an open space. Most of these companies will start using third party companies, akin to how PC manufacturers used Windows from Microsoft instead of creating their own OS. Initially some will try their hand at the market with their own bespoke solution(like the wild west days of 80's when we had commodores and sinclair spectrums). However after some time their will be a standardization(IBM PC). \n\nAt best I can see Tesla becoming like the Macintoshes:  \nTesla: Proprietary full self driving system:: Macintoshes : Proprietary OSes\n\n\\&gt;If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.  \nTesla is boasting about FSD(which is between a very good cruise and a poor self driver). The key difference between waymo and tesla is that tesla is heavily reliant on an AI based system, whereas waymo(which does use AI) is heavily dependent on Geolocation and real time data.\n\n\\]&gt;The thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nRun away from any person who says that leads are insurmountable. Just look at Intel. Went from being a market leader to being overtaken by near bankrupt competitors(See: AMD)",

Just like 20 years ago people said \"IBM will soon kill these new wannabes like Google and Amazon, you can't beat experience\". And compared to how traditional car companies feel about innovation, IBM looks like a superstar in comparison.\n\nIf you've got 10 years head start in R&amp;D on a new technology and you're still researching at a rapid pace (plus you have most of the talent and experience in the field already working for you or wanting to), you get to stay ahead. And even to catch up, the legacy automakers who are used to spending 2% on R&amp;D while giving most of the profits back to shareholders will have say they are cutting dividends for a decade, which is not going to go down well. Since Tesla aren't just going to \"stop\" R&amp;D, by the time they catch up to Tesla today, Tesla will have moved on to the next big thing.\n\nThis is not even considering the vertical integration Tesla has going for it. No one else comes close to the super charger network (building infrastructure is hugely expensive and time consuming, more money the legacy automakers have to take away from dividends). Then there's the battery production supply chain, Tesla literally owns the mines. And there's the solar power and powerwall and VPP that you'd want to really take advantage of going electric.\n\nIt took 10 years to get all that going and it's still a long way from being done. You can't replicate that in 3 years by throwing money at it. Engineering is hard... poaching the talent you need away from big tech to come help you beat Tesla is hard... building charging infrastructure is expensive... so many \"things\" need to be done to build a complex system that most people don't think about. To most people it's like \"Hey, can't you just take the engine out of a car, stick some motors and batteries in there and you're good to go, right? Ford will be ruling EVs in 3 years\".",

        "body": "Thank you! This is the most thoughtful response I've seen so far. My feelings exactly. The too big to grow argument never holds water. Growth has more to do with sector and industry than market cap. I actually think the PE is pretty reasonable, but I look a few years into the future. I'm a bit surprised by people referring to fake Chinese sellers as a problem. I don't see it and it doesn't even compare to eBay. eBay has been infiltrated with spam, accounts taken hostage, etc. for a very long time and it's doing fine.\n\nI think anti-trust is a serious threat to the price, but I'm not sure regulatory action would be successful. If it is, I think the 3-5 horizon might not be good, but I'd be more optimistic long-term (5+ years).\n\nI rarely try to evaluate anything beyond 3-5 years though. Technology changes far too rapidly. 5-10 years from now, it might be blockchain companies leading the charge, IBM might make a huge comeback with quantum computing (I think they're leading that area currently). Point being, who knows beyond 2026.\n\nI'm optimistic about Jassy, but certainly understand the nervousness. Ultimately, I think Bezos stepping away took some heat off the regulatory pressure. Time will tell if things like increasing wages to $18/hour will be enough to fend off regulatory action. \n\nI was thinking about putting another lump sum in QQQM, but I'm inclined to put it in Amazon instead. I expect it to perform better over the next few years.",

Their executives literally have explicitly stated that they can deploy Foundry fully remotely and don't require remote engineers to distribute their product to medium or small size clients in the last month they have outright stated this. Things like releasing announcements of Palantir foundry for builders or \"startups\" is excellent proof of this.\n\nTheir partnerships with Amazon and IBM are literally just ways of Foundry on apollo AI framework being sold by those companies packaged together with other products to sell to other companies. That's 100% scaleable and it's why their commercial clients are increasing quarter to quarter domestically and internationally. \n\nThey have distribution channels doing their work for them and are objectively not a consultancy company in Foundry. They have shown ample evidence that Foundry works out if the box just fine for enough medium and small size clients to be scalable and I think soon we will see proof of this even for large clients. \n\nThere's zero evidence that will have to slow down and as their TAM hears their brand and learns about their product. There's zero evidence that they are facing problems with scalability. However there has been consistent evidence all year that they have entirely solved it or they have continually gone far in the right direction. They increased expenses because of hiring and releasing Foundry for free during palantir unlock at the beginning of the year but their margins would've already improved if they weren't so focused on growth.",
