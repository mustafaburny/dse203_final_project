        "body": "You're absolutely right---actually you made one minor mistake you're comparing the June 18 QQQJ call to the June 30 QQQ call. The price of the June 18 QQQ call is ~ $5.70 which buttresses your point even more. \n\nAnd you can see this from their IV: QQQJ has an IV of 28% while QQQ has an IV of 21%. So yes, all things being equal, QQQ is cheaper than QQQJ.\n\nAll that said, I am still balls deep in QQQJ calls because I believe over the next year, it will outperform QQQ for the reason OP stated: it has many more beaten down companies than QQQ. The big boys in QQQ have all recovered for the most part. Another crucial point is that QQQJ has more non-tech companies so if there is a rotation out of tech, it will suffer less than QQQ.\n\nI'm very bullish about this etf. I saw a WSJ article where someone did a historic backtest from 2016 or 2017 and QQQJ outperformed QQQ even with the insane run of the big boys MSFT, AAPL, NVDA &amp; ADBE during that period.",

        "body": "There are a surprising number of short sighted people on reddit.  Gme is an under valued company.  They are not going bankrupt.  They are not going out of business.\n\nThey were only 2% away from being profitable this quarter while covid hurt their business.  They have a high density of stores that cost money to lease. They are shutting 1000 stores. So instead of 20 in a city they will have 5 to 10 best performing stores.  If nothing else changes they will be profitable from the reduction in lease expense alone. The stock is back to where it was 8 trading days ago the day before Thanksgiving.\n\nOther things are changing. If you plan on being successful in investing you need to do a little more research and understand why people that have earned a million dollars are investing in GME.  Not everyone wants to throw their money in a meme stock and hope they don't get burned. \n\n I actually view this as a pretty low risk play.  I have $70k in it.  I was up $27k at close today.  My guess is I will be even again tomorrow.  I did sell all my Dec calls today before close so have already booked profit.\n\nI have money in AMD, Fsly $100k in (which shot up today), PLTR $89k in (which shot up yesterday), Adbe, Nvda, Logi, Splk etc.  You can make money in almost any stock with patience and understanding trends. I am up 90% since June 1st.  Max reward with minimum risk.\n\n15% down is a correction.  All the meme stocks have dropped that much in a day or two for no reason - Nio, Zm, Pltr, etc and gone back up in a week or two.",

        "body": "The big successful retailers like HD, WMT, TGT, LOW, DG have been showing great earnings as a whole, but the stocks stay flat (except LOW which tanked).  So I think COST doesn't have much upside from here.  BUT might payoff on the downside IF earnings fail to surpass expectation.  So, for a lottery play, maybe something like a 355/350 put spread could pay off considering how cheap the options are at that level and getting a nice payout.\n\nThe Less successful retailers have been getting big boosts like SNR, TCS, BBBY, JWN, DLTR all because people expected the worst and they weren't so bad.  So GME?!?!  LOL.  This trend, plus all the shorting involved in the stock may actually present some huge upside / limited downside because all the shorters will have to buy back to cover.\n\nLULU - I'd love to bet against this one, but if you look at Nike earnings last Q, they did surprisingly really well.  I'm not sure I want to take a risk here.\n\nDon't expect any surprises with ADBE or AVGO and you can probably sell Iron Condors and make good money from either of those\n\nSHORT COUPA! lol.  We'll see, but there's nothing magical about this company.  It's a tool business use to track how much they spend with third parties.  It works alright and it's better than the IBM tool by miles, but I doubt they can keep up with earnings estimates.\n\nShort CHWY too just because it has run too high.\n\nTLDR: Cheap puts on COST, long shares of GME since options are too expensive, Sell Iron Condor on ADBE and AVGO, Short COUP and CHWY since options too expensive.",

This is a good startup with a very specific and focused problem to solve.\nThe even more enticing prospect to me are the consumer electronics applications. IPhone 12 now added lidar to improve photo depth. That's just the beginning of usage for these. With a simple cost effective chip these could start showing up a lot of places.\nWhat isn't clear to me is how they are protecting this tech and preventing others from replicating unless it's strictly cost advantage of being first.\n\nTake a look through the investor pitch from Aeva.

In order for a share to trade, there has to be a buyer and a seller. If there's low volume, that tells you that not as many buyers are interested.\n\nWhen buyers aren't interested, the price has to come down to attract buyers. \n\nThere's more supply than demand, so the price goes down. \n\nEveryday, in the morning, GME spikes. The first house of the day is classically the most volatile time in the market. So more people are interested in buying in the morning, because that's when spikes happen most often. \n\nThe rest of the day, buyers accumulate shares near support instead of chasing pops - which is why GME tends to hold key levels throughout the day. Then, they sell into the morning spike the next day - and smart short sellers take advantage of it. \n\nSmart shorts aren't sitting around selling GME all day because there's no fucking volume and it's not volatile enough. Pro longs know that without shorts, there's no risk of a short squeeze - which is how you get monster runs.\n\nSo, yeah. Volume goes down, price goes down.",

I apologize nonetheless- it was wrong to suggest on my part and I should take your word with some faith since you seem to be dealing in good faith yourself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that said, you're not wrong bro. Qualified is important for sure. I don't think anyone wants to force hands at recruiting unqualified individuals. Qualified, but underrepresented is the aim. Not a usurping of the corporate meritocracy. I think that's both fair, and important. If you disagree with the premise entirely, that's fair too. I just wanted to clarify that conceptually, the idea isnt unqualified folks getting hand held and led into leadership roles, but rather qualified folks who otherwise would not be selected (for whatever reason) being selected instead (but qualified lol).",

Straight up like 3,000 calories 100 grams of fiber, ate it in like 25 minutes in 1 sitting. 6 hours later my insides were being torn apart and I had the longest fart I've ever been able to muster. Imagine for a second you thought you had to shit, and you take a deep breath, and you push, and it's just a pure fart for your entire breath, after about 15 seconds you're trying not to laugh but you're in complete disbelief that you're still farting, 20 seconds, 25 seconds. Air still coming out your butt hole, you have to take a SECOND fucking breath to finish the fart off.. You didn't even have to shit..\n\nAnyways, TSLA to the moon",
