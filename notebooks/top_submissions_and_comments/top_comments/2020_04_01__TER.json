Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

The next thing you could look into is the tankers but you'll see there's no real correlation with the oil price. \n\nYou can either look at the big companies with decent fundamentals (Chevron, Exxon) or since you're EU based you can look at some of the ishares ETF's available on the XETRA exchange. They have a slightly higher TER than broader ETF's but they're probably your best bet on oil right now (drilling &amp; production) and there is enough liquidity and no contango risk.

I  don't really aim for retirement money, I want to enjoy  it while I have  the energy for it (late 40s in the latest I imagine)\n\nMy   original plan was to invest a larger sum over the next few months,  then  continue investing around 150\u20ac / month, I could do more but I'm   planning on building a house in the next few years, so I have to   calculate paying my mortgage, too. I'm strictly looking into ETFs, and   Degiro is not available in my country.\n\nOkay, so here are my options:\n\n1. Robo   advisor, the one I'm looking at charges 1,2% p.a. (+TER of the ETFs   that's on average 0,2%), and they also charge 1,2% per transactions up   to 1000\u20ac (no fees above this limit). To avoid at least this fee I could   invest 1000\u20ac every 6 months, but I'm not sure if the frequency is   satisfactory) Their most aggressive portfolio (100:0 stocks:bonds)   consist of 20% emerging markets, 20% big EU corporations, 40% big US   corporations, the rest is in smaller corporations. **Pros:** automatic rebalancing, set it and forget it **Cons:** huge fees after acculumating some money, they only buy stocks every 2-3 weeks, could potentially miss out on some deals\n2. DIY   through Lynx broker. They charge 5-6\u20ac per transaction, no annual fees.   To minimize these fees I could do 500\u20ac every three months (5-6\u20ac  meaning  around 1% fee), and invest in a low amount of ETFs, or maybe  just a  single one (for example Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF) **Pros:** more control, lower fees **Cons:** more work, less diversification, not sure I could beat the robo-advisor even counting the fees in\n\nWhat do you think?",

And TerrAscend has nowhere close to as much sales as any of these companies.\n\nAt least TER got the Canopy loan and has the deep pockets of Jason Wild to fall back on, but the idea that this is an efficient company right now is just dead wrong. Personally I wouldn't touch any cannabis company with a bad balance sheet and bad margins.",

        "body": "With long term investing you I always see three distinct crowds.\n\nOne is the smart people. They invest in single big companies or growing industries. Maybe they sell once before the crash and hop right back in once they feel like its stable again. Buying some AMZN, MSFT or GOOGL or selling CC on AAPL. The kind of investing that makes you money while ignoring most of the day to day stuff on wall street.   \n\nThen you have the fear boomers. Who are proud if they lose 20% on a big SPY drop, because holding through a recession makes you sensible and wise, not poorer. Pretty anthing that isnt \"buying more SPY\" is discouraged here. Buying AMZN is bad because \"there is no guarantee AMZN will even exist in 5 years\" or \"investing in companies is way too risky\".   \n\nThen you have the giga boomers. They think investing is gambling and just trust their bank to invest in \"secure funds\" with a return of 0,5% every year and a meager 6% TER. The mere act of investing is like burning money for them and the only real currencies are gold, silver, property and bullets.",
