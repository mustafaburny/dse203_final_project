        "body": "I appreciate the thought and effort that went into this write-up, however, you've done quite a bit of due diligence to ultimately pick 80% of the **FAANG** stocks (Facebook ($FB), Amazon ($AMZN), Apple ($AAPL), Netflix ($NFLX); and Alphabet ($GOOG) with Netflix being the one you did not pick in your list of six companies.\n\nEach of the FAANG stocks trades on the Nasdaq exchange and is included in the S&amp;P 500 Index. Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

Futures have contango so you'll always suffer from that. The next thing you could look into is the tankers but you'll see there's no real correlation with the oil price. \n\nYou can either look at the big companies with decent fundamentals (Chevron, Exxon) or since you're EU based you can look at some of the ishares ETF's available on the XETRA exchange. They have a slightly higher TER than broader ETF's but they're probably your best bet on oil right now (drilling &amp; production) and there is enough liquidity and no contango risk. I'm currently on the sidelines but I might dip into one of these ETF's at some point.",

The reason is, I've lost money with strong conviction guiding my ays and lost money while inversing my true beliefs and believing reality doesn't apply to markets. I'd rather lose money while holding to my convictions. Most of the time this haplens. Regardless of the fact that the market does lag behind the reality of macro forces. If I flipped to calls and lost big I would feel like a fucking idiot. So my puts expire, I lose money, I go cash. Or they print tendies. Only time will tell.",

The kind of investing that makes you money while ignoring most of the day to day stuff on wall street.   \n\nThen you have the fear boomers. Who are proud if they lose 20% on a big SPY drop, because holding through a recession makes you sensible and wise, not poorer. Pretty anthing that isnt \"buying more SPY\" is discouraged here. Buying AMZN is bad because \"there is no guarantee AMZN will even exist in 5 years\" or \"investing in companies is way too risky\".   \n\nThen you have the giga boomers.

And in the case of Teradyne based on every technical factor out there, we are looking at a GRAND SLAM HOME RUN.",
