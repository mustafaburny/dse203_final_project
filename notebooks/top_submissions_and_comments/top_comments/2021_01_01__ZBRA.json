For instance, if I can buy two ITM options that have 5 dollars each of extrinsic value, I want to offset a total of 10 dollars - I'll try to sell 1 option with 10 dollars of extrinsic value. The net result is I didn't have to pay for any extrinsic value out of my own pocket.\n\nSometimes there isn't a perfect zebra with exactly 100 delta and 0 extrinsic value, but you can usually get somewhat close.",

It's a type of spread, so you do have to be approved for trading spreads. It's buying a debit spread (which is buying one long option and selling one short option), but purchasing one extra long option.\n\nhttps://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/options-workshop/episodes/the-zero-extrinsic-back-ratio-zebra-08-13-2018",
