        "body": "Yep, ITM and as far out as you can go. Probably the best way to do LEAPs. Acts a lot more like stock than an option that will decay away to nothing.\n\nFor even less exposure to theta, take a look at a ZEBRA (Zero Extrinsic Back RAtio spread). You buy two 70 delta options and sell a 40 delta option to offset the extrinsic value in the 70 delta options. You wind up with 100 delta and basically no exposure to time decay. Might take a little more capital than some ITM LEAPs, though.",

        "body": "&gt; How do you calculate this for yourself to put together a ZEBRA?\n\nI didn't really answer this in my other message - I review the different strike prices and for each option I look to see how much of its value is extrinsic, and use that in my consideration as well as the delta. For instance, if I can buy two ITM options that have 5 dollars each of extrinsic value, I want to offset a total of 10 dollars - I'll try to sell 1 option with 10 dollars of extrinsic value. The net result is I didn't have to pay for any extrinsic value out of my own pocket.\n\nSometimes there isn't a perfect zebra with exactly 100 delta and 0 extrinsic value, but you can usually get somewhat close.",

It's a type of spread, so you do have to be approved for trading spreads. It's buying a debit spread (which is buying one long option and selling one short option), but purchasing one extra long option.\n\nhttps://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/options-workshop/episodes/the-zero-extrinsic-back-ratio-zebra-08-13-2018",

You buy a call sell a put, lots of info out there on this/variants. I know TastyTrade is all about a version called ZEBRA if you follow them.\n\nOptions do expose you to more possible risks but when targeting growth with limited funds the  upside of a smart play will more than likely yield a better return than just shares, with the obvious drawback that if the market moves against you you may be stuck",
