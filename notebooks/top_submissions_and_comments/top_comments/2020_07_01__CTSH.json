        "body": "It's a rental provider network that charges significantly higher contract rates than the rates insurers negotiate themselves, so they're primarily utilized for a couple of reasons. Insurers are expanding into new states and have to meet the regulatory requirements in regards to volume X type of providers available in their network to be able to sell a product there (1 year contract with the rental network aka temporary approach, and then the insurer builds it's own network at better contracted rated and doesn't renew the multiplan rental contract, or 3 year contract with multiplan as touted in the investor slide deck, but the insurer still builds out its own network and just reduces volume of claims sent to muliplan due to a 3 year agreement to reduce the amount paid to providers in regions where they have better contracted rates than multiplan).\n\nThe other instance they're utilized by insurers is when certain  provider bad actors (predominantly in anesthesiology and ER) refuse to join the insurer's network with a negotiated payment rate, consolidate with other anesthesiologist groups to be the only game in town, and then leverage their competitive positioning to just charge billed charges (whatever they want to due to no contract) understanding that either the insurer or the patient will have to pay depending on the state law. Many states have legally put the onus on the insurers (particularly if it is a HMO plan) where the insurer must hold the patient harmless and eat costs above what the insurer would typically pay to a contracted provider. So Multiplan may come in with this PPO network that does not provide the balance billing protections to patients like HMO plans do and provides cost assurance to the insurers by bringing the anesthesiolist/ER/etc into the insurer's network through their rental network products. Why would these provider bad actors contract with multiplan or other rental networks? Easy - rental networks will pay  exorbitantly high contract rates to the provider which is still lower cost to the insurer than whatever the provider group decided to bill the insurer when there is no contract, and this provides \"savings\" to the insurer. This then causes insurers costs to go up which raises premiums for the state's constituents, and becomes a health insurer pain point, patient pain point, and provider pain point for the providers that aren't trying to rip off patients. So now many states have passed anti balance regulation, some states have legislation in process, and legislation has been proposed/is being worked on at the federal level as well. This type of regulation sets an established payment rate between insurers and providers that are out of network (haven't contracted with the insurer) that is still pretty generous, but nothing close to the exorbitant amount rental network will charge to earn that fat margin or what those provider bad actors charge without a contract, and the regulation will stipulate that the providers must accept that as payment in full and cannot bill the patients for a \"remaining balance\".\n\nSummary: Insurers using a rental network are fundamentally less price competitive to those building their own network because they are paying for the multiplan's margin and a larger margin the provider earns as well...so contracts established with multiplan/\\*insert other rental network\\* are typically temporary in length or standard in length but insurers are incentivized to send less claims volume to them so less $ made for multiplan and more $ saved for the insurer. Multiplan says it adds value in the commercial space  (employer groups and obamacare), but thats because medicaid and medicare have set payment rates due to the government being the payor and not accepting getting ripped off by significantly higher payment rates than what the government establishes. Anti balance billing regulation eliminates the need for a rental network which is one of the main value props a rental provider network brings.\n\nThen there is also the changing regulatory landscape. If traditional Medicare for all passes, multiplan is basically useless as it's single payer and every provider is now in network being paid on a the medicare fee schedule that adjusts for geographical variations in cost of living, type of service provided, and any other adjustments such as they might try to incentivize more med students to go into primary care due to the shortage etc. Biden's version of Medicare for all doesn't eliminate private/public commercial insurers as you have an option, but it causes large shifts into the marketplace/obamacare products FROM the employer market, so insurers have membership shifts from a higher margin program to a lower margin program, and I would expect Multiplan to have less room to take a middleman margin. But bidens plan also creates a public option which allows for keeping the industry/ jobs (would likely still shrink), but the insurers are now competing against the public option and have to be more cost cognizant. I don't see in this scenario any insurrers really trying to use a rental network and pay multiples of what the public option would pay for the same service at the same location. \n\nTLDR; BAAAAD DATA CCXX, BAAD DATA - Also this is my opinion but also backed up by publicly available data, legislation, comments submitted during public comment periods on healthcare regulations, state agency positions, and knowing many doctors.",

Voo, VTI, VT. if you dont have enough to buy whole shares of those robin hood offers fractional shares but I have never gone that route so I honestly don't know how good of a thing they are. Other then that do a lot of research. Read a lot. Dont buy and think your going to sell again any time soon. Ive only been actually investing for about 2 years. In that time I have only sold 1 position because I no longer liked the investment long term. Everything else i have bought with the intent to hold for 10+ years baring something extremely unforeseen. I buy a lot of blue chips and companies im somewhat familiar with as well. I work in tech so I own cisco, palo alto, fortinet, netapp because I work with there products a lot. But i probably only own about 30 individual companies and over 50% of my portfolio is in those index funds i mentioned earlier. Is this winning advice, I have no idea but its been working for me.",

        "body": "Akamai Technologies stock is trading higher Thursday after Cowen analyst Colby Synesael raised his rating on the content-delivery network company to Outperform from Market Perform, while upping his target price to $150 from $107.\n\nSynesael is basically making the observation (which I made in an April Tech Trader column) that Akamai shares (ticker: AKAM) have not participated in the huge rally in internet infrastructure plays amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The analyst says there is now a \"meaningful disconnect\" between Akamai and other security and CDN stocks, despite its larger scale, higher profitability and \" still solid growth.\" He sees Akamai as an \"attractive way\" to play long-term trends like cloud security and edge computing.\n\nSynesael points out that the stock looks cheap relative to both security plays like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) and to other content- delivery networks, such as Cloudflare (NET), Fastly (FSLY), and Limelight Networks (LLNW). He argues that Covid-19 has served as a catalyst to Akamai's security and CDN businesses.\n\n\"We believe Covid-19 has resulted in increased demand for both its enterprise and internet security product offerings given the increase in the number of attacks across organizations and the internet,\" Synesael writes. \"We believe Akamai's security business is an underappreciated component of its long- term growth opportunity and that as it becomes a larger portion of total revenue more investors are likely to start valuing it on its [sum of the parts] which we believe will result in a significant re-rating of the stock.\"\n\nThe analyst notes that there have been investor concerns about the company losing market share to peers like Fastly, but asserts that \"the growth of competitors is more a function of an expanding opportunity for CDN providers rather than share stealing from Akamai.\"\n\nAkamai shares were up 7%, at $113.78, in recent trading, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9%. The stock is up about 32% year to date, which is impressive growth -- except when compared with Cloudflare, which has more than doubled, and Fastly, which has more than quadrupled",
