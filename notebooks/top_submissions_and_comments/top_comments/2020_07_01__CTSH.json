        "body": "\"Wow. These are great insights. Thank you so much! \"\n\nNo problem.\n\n\" I just thought that all ETFs helped mitigate most risk, but that\u2019s not always the case.\"\n\nNope. There are very few actively managed funds that really do attempt to sidestep downturns to some degree and fewer that have a decent track record doing it. One is little-known mutual fund Provident Trust (PROVX, https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2018/12/provident-trust-strategy-fund-provx/, \"Investors remember that this period includes the 2007-09 financial crisis. What they may not know is that in 2008, the fund lost 21.0% compared to the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 37.0% decline. That ranked the fund in the 1st percentile.\n\nWhile paralyzed investors and central banks struggled, the fund held between 61% in cash and fixed income instruments at the end of \u201908 and 70% at the market bottom in March \u201909. That positioning dramatically reduced the fund\u2019s losses compared to the market, while giving it ample \u201cdry powder\u201d for the gains that followed. During Provident\u2019s tenure as portfolio manager to September 30, 2018, PROVX gained +389% cumulatively with a 79.8% average month-end allocation to equities vs. +348% for the always fully invested S&amp;P 500.\")\n\nSo that's an example of a fund where managers will start to move to the sideline if they think it's prudent to do so. Not entirely - you're still going to lose some money - just probably not as much as the market in a downturn. \n\nIf it's a bad year most funds are going to have a bad year and the letter will be basically, \"Hey, sorry it was a bad year.\"\n\nStock index funds are going to go down in a downturn whatever the index does.\n\n\"I remember seeing a video interview of this analyst on Robinhood who said that the tech bubble right now is bigger than the dot com bubble was in the 2000s.\"\n\nI don't think this is the dot com bubble again. I do think that after the bottom in March, you saw a widening of the gap between the performance of the market and the performance of certain growth themes that were either less impacted by this or benefited from it. E-commerce, digital payments, cloud, software, telehealth and the \"stay at home\" names (Peloton, Netflix, etc.) Even the \"buy a home online\" names, as things like Zillow finally started to seem to have a sustained gain for once as people are now apparently comfortable buying houses virtually. People basically ran towards what they thought benefited today and I think what many people thought the future is going to look like post-crisis. I think what's been very frustrating on this sub this year has been this focus on the negative, when I think a compelling topic really is, what are the themes post-crisis that will be big? How does the world change in the next 3-5 years? **I think what's done extraordinarily well this year is in part due to the result of people asking themselves that question and investing accordingly.** The ARKW and ARKF have themes listed on the main pages for those funds and you look at those themes and those have absolutely been the places to be this year.\n\nIn the short-term, I have a hard time believing that the correct answer to concerning statistics will continue to be \"just buy more growth (Zoom, etc) stocks.\" At some point that will either stop working and broad market pullback or there will be a solution to this crisis and when that happens you're going to see a considerable rotation out of the Ark-style growth stocks and into impacted names that have lagged, but I think that is going to be buying opportunity for growth. \n\nYou've saw this sort of \"tale of two markets\" again on Thursday and Friday of last week: Thursday the Dow was down 300 but growth stocks were ramping. There was the Gilead news on Friday and the Dow was up 300 but many of the growth stocks were down.\n\nMuch of my own portfolio is similarly aggressive growth to Ark or Scottish Mortgage and I would not be surprised if at some point in the near-term much of my portfolio lost 20% in a hurry. The problem is when: I thought there was going to be a pullback in May - didn't happen. I have a long-term view on what I own so I may trim a little here, add a little there at times but happy not doing much of anything for long stretches. Additionally, I'm not a major market timer or do I have any desire to be. But after a really fantastic first half of the year, I really don't think that I'm going to have a repeat of that kind of performance in the back half of the year and I'm sitting here fully expecting a considerable pullback. If I manage to get through the second half of the year without a considerable pullback in my portfolio, I will be 1) stunned and 2) have to question whether this time is actually somehow different. I've said recently that I did a lot in March and April and then have since gone back to doing not much and am happy with long stretches of doing little-to-nothing. I'm okay with investing in aggressive growth stocks, but where I'm increasingly cautious is where/how much I add to things. \n\nBut, long story short, I think there are compelling long-term growth themes and growth may continue up for a while, but it is overextended and a considerable correction at some point in the relatively near-term would be so not surprising that it would be pretty remarkable imo if it didn't happen. Broadly, if you're not risk tolerant (and there's nothing wrong with that), then the ARK funds would not be something I'd recommend (great when things are fantastic for growth, going to be rough when it's not - they've had an amazing year, but people have to be cognizant of things capable of having those kinds of gains in that short a time period are also capable of going the wrong direction just as swiftly, if not swifter) or at the most would be a *tiny* bit to have exposure to some themes long-term - but I'd be particularly cautious about where you bought them.",

This is likely more a function of personality that's not directly tied to greed but results in a nonaction that is then perceived as cruelty. You choosing to donate is an active choice. Not giving away your earnings is the default state, a state of nonaction, because in such a state the subject is assumed to be incognizant of any particular demand. The same way you aren't cruel for not having donated to a particular starving child yesterday -- that is a default state of nonaction. Now your brain has become cognizant of the concept of starving children. Reading this, you may or may not choose to donate respondingly. Does not donating make you cruel? Perhaps, perhaps not.

If shares go down, investor keeps dividends and tries again in August.\n\nJust out of curiosity, how did you know the investor is holding $150 mil in shares?

Already now you won't deal with AWS without dedicated 2-3 specialised cloud engineers with certifications. Hundred of services, a lot of of them duplicate each other (just try to google how to enable logging &amp; monitoring in AWS).

[Jet.com](https://Jet.com) was a thing.\n\nOracle, Azure, Google all have AWS competitors.\n\nNFLX, Disney+, et al for video streaming.\n\nAmazon isn't getting big via acquisitions of its competitors, either.  There's no antitrust discussion like there would be if ATT tried to buy Verizon, for example.\n\nI think AMZN is safe from any kind of antitrust lawsuit.

If a company is very difficult to replace their business with, then that is a moat.

Are consumers becoming almost forced to use their business because they are so widely accepted? If so, this is a moat.\n\nCost Advantages (Non scale and Scale) - Does the company have access to tech that makes production cheaper or the cheapest available? Is there scale so massive competition can\u2019t move in? Are they able to keep their prices low through other means? If so, this is a moat.\n\nHope this helps!",

On the other hand Amazon, Apple etc reinvented themselves significantly since 2000 and are the biggest players along with Microsoft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo blindly following even Oracle of Omaha is not a great idea. He avoided most tech firms and invested in oil/energy/banks. Not exactly ideal approach in past 2 decades.

I didn\u2019t look into the details, just assuming the sentence \u201cDelta takes $3B charge on buyouts\u201d to be true, so here goes. \n\nA \u201ccharge\u201d is basically when a company knows they\u2019re going to spend some money, so they set it aside now.  Taking that \u201ccash off the books\u201d if that makes sense.  \n\nThis is done to basically take a big, calculated, financial hit now rather than dragging down earnings for years to come. \n\nThey will be spending this money for years to come, for sure, but on the \u201cbooks\u201d the money is already \u201cspent\u201d so it won\u2019t impact \u201cearnings\u201d... it just impacts \u201ccash\u201d. \n\nYou really need to get some accounting knowledge under your belt to wrap year head around it. While you\u2019re at it, try to understand \u201cdeferred revenue\u201d.  Many pros can\u2019t wrap their head around that shit, but that\u2019s the bottom line at Microsoft, google, Oracle, Intel, etc. \n\nGoing back to Delta, they have union contracts with the grandma flight attendants.  (Gilfs?  Some... maybe...I know one i\u2019d certainly bang, but that\u2019s another subreddit)  in any case, they can\u2019t just fire their GILF ass. So, they have to lay them off with some sort of retirement package per the union contract. \n\nSo the GILFs will get paid out over time and it\u2019ll be a huge suck on cash flow. But Delta is taking a \u201ccharge\u201d now on that future cash flow so that when the world recovers, and people are flying again, those costs won\u2019t detract from \u201creported earnings\u201d even though they\u2019ll actually still be losing money hand over fist.",

        "body": "I'm not per se. I hold all of ARKW/F/G/K with heavier weighting toward K. The reasoning for this is I feel as though K has a lot of room to really explode as it is really speculative. Thats similar to WCLD and SKYY, in my opinion. I'm going to do a lot of writing about the subject but the TLDR is: buy them all. They're all uniquely positioned and have very different holdings. The ARK funds are huge spec plays that I really believe in, while WCLD/SKYY/CLOU are all cloud computing ETFs with really diversified holdings I also believe in. \n\nARKW is the next gen internet ARK fund which sounds really speculative but it really just holds Tesla, Square, FB, Roku &amp; Splunk, among others. Compared to WCLD which holds NET, FSLY, SHOP, TWLO, COUP, ZM, DDOG, etc. If you just compare the two holdings and let SHOP &amp; TESLA both cancel each other out (huge run ups the last few months) - I consider NET, FSLY (huge boom recently), TWLO, COUP, ZM (Obviously huge boom), DDOG, COUP, Etcetera to have WAY more room to grow than Roku, Square (which I consider overvalued personally), Zillow, pinterest, etcetera. Basically, WCLD is just much more future-focused, in my opinion. NET, FSLY, DDOG and TWLO alone are going to be monsters. \n\nCLOU, on the other hand, I consider much closer to ARKW in growth potential. Their holdings to me are largely slow &amp; steady, whereas WCLD has potential to absolutely jet. \n\nI personally really like SKYY as well. Its basically a mini QQQ it has a TON of bluechips. BABA, AMZN, MSFT, SHOP, ORCL, &amp; GOOGL - not to mention FSLY. If you want slow and steady, hold for years - I think this is your play. \n\nNow comparing the three, SKYY has a 0.6% E/R, while CLOU is 0.68%, and WCLD is 0.45%. The ARK funds are all around 0.75% E/R which is significantly higher than WCLD. So again it comes down to your belief in the individual holdings of each ETF. I have all 3 and I weight WCLD and SKYY higher than CLOU because I believe in their holdings more. \n\nThe ARK funds are all very very different. I know each pretty much all holds 10% TSLA but beyond that they're much more specific sector ETFs, and I think worthwhile to hold all of them. ARKW is the next gen internet, while G is genomic revolution (heavy biotech spec plays and like 97% of its holding are in 'Healthcare'). Where this differs from traditional biotech plays, is that it is banking on genomic healthcare as the wave of the future - and I agree. In a similar sense, the ARKQ is the same but for robotics and autonomous tech. If you look at why TSLA is so booming compared to other EVs, one of the main reasons is their huge advancements in autonomous vehicles. Especially in the wake of Covid, we can easily chart point A to B of autonomous tech and robotics taking over as the future of retail. AMZN is pushing hard on that front, which should tell you just about everything you need to know about ARKQ's value. ARKF is the fintech etf, basically banking on online retail and money management. Obviously they hold SQ, but they also hold APPL, PDD (huge runner, imo), MELI (gigantic), TCEHY (huge), and PYPL. Again, under the \"new normal\" its very easy to see the value of fintech. There's a reason ARKF, ARKQ, and ARKG have all run up massively since the covid dip. \n\nThen there's ARKK which is their 'innovation' fund. Its heavily diversified - much more than the others, and sort of is a 'best of' their other funds. If you have to pick one ETF I would recommend this one. \n\nNow all that is to say: ARKW is okay but maybe consider these other options instead. Of the listed ETFs I would rank it second to last just above CLOU.",
