        "body": "Lol not sure why my post about CRSR was closed, but I'll write my take here.\n\nNot really hype or pump at all. Imagine if the PS5 AND Xbox were currently selling as just console only (like no controllers, power plug wires, hdmi, storage). PS5 would still be out of stock, and people would still be buying the controllers, power plugs, etc from name brand companies that make them. They would buy them even without the PS5 console with the belief and preparation that they will buy it eventually and they mind as well since the prices are bit lower for the holiday sale season.\n\nI'm in that work space. So here's the rub. There is a huge demand for pc building. If you've seen AMD's rise that's proof enough of the demand. AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel similar space of building the most valuable parts of the computer, the video card (GPU) and the computer processer (CPU). They are the PS5 consoles in the PC world. **They do not sell the other parts of the PC**. That's where Corsair comes in. \n\nCorsair is pretty unique in the PC world in their variety in parts. Their competitors are usually only specialist in certain parts. For example PC builders will be familiar with G.Skill, but they only make RAM. Cooler Master, but they only make PC cases and cooling units (I'm not including the power supplies because I think they are shit). Kingston also makes a variety of PC parts and is the closest variety part making competitor (Also they are like the cheaper brand of these parts and you get what you pay for). All three of these are private companies so no real data on their sales, but they should also be profiting right now as well. In addition Corsair also is probably only second to Logitech with computer peripherals. These include things like mouse, keyboard, headset, etc. With such variety of products and a brand known for quality it isn't surprising that CRSR is still on the rise.\n\nI use AMD, NVIDA, and even Intel as my indicator of how well CRSR is doing. AMD goes up, means their sales are still going up, meaning people need the complimentary parts, meaning CRSR goes up. I'm not sure where they will end up stabilizing at. I bought a bunch at their IPO, and I don't think it will stop at 40. Logitech is around 80 and they only sell the peripherals. Grant they have a bigger market cap, but they have also been publicly trading for more than 20 years. Corsair is in no way inferior to Logitech. I only use them since they are really the only other publicly trading company that partly share a space with CRSR. \n\nThis is the second stock (AMD is first) that I have been excited to own since I actually know a lot about the products and the company. To me who works in tech and an avid PC building enthusiast, I view Corsair as a top brand as I would Nike in its respected field of athletic apparel and sneakers.",

I can't read \"And now, it\u2019s just a matter of time before the performance of ARM-based chips continues its march upmarket into Intel\u2019s last refuge: the server business\" without immediately thinking that he has no idea of the very long and tumultuous history of big iron server ARM. Apple's lighting core is not going to be in the datacenter/server space. Ever. That's not how Apple works. They keep their vertically integrated tech as a competitive advantage and as a way to gate in innovation from other players that literally don't have the capability to copy it without playing \"follow the leader\", the cadence of which works to Apple's advantage.\n\nIf ARM stays independent then ARM is not breaking into servers any time soon. If NVIDIA gets ARM then it is highly likely that ARM will be in servers, but that's just the progression of the trend that's already happening with stream processing eating x86 market share. NVIDIA will not be slotting in ARM chips into chip sockets currently owned by Xeon and Threadripper, they have a very different vision for the datacenter and server space that involves deep vertical integration and dominant performance to justify it. Thus their purchase of Mellanox as a means to that end.\n\nIntel is not screwed because of Apple (we've known about Apple ARM for many months now), it still comes down to AMD getting into the datacenter, server, and laptop space - areas where Intel has built it's behemoth size off of parts that they sell for thousands of dollars. Margins will be crushed, and Intel has insanely huge capex requirements due to running its own fabs. If Intel continues to have fab problems and has to execute an inevitably expensive transition to fabless while their margins are getting crushed, it's going to be another inflection point where investors are going to bail. That would probably be the buy-in time for a knife catcher, but I'd never buy it now. Their quarterly reports are so poor right now that every report has a serious risk of huge investment losses. Intel lied to investors for years about the severity of their fab problems, and Swan gets 0 leeway from investors. I remember how awful his first call was, how he was trying to blame China and how outright pissed the analysts were at his bullshit and how huge the resulting selloff was afterwards. It's really an important point that Intel has lost the trust of their investors, including institutions. These bad flow trends aren't going to reverse unless Intel perhaps kills it for a couple of quarters back to back, and that's not at all likely given the competitive landscape.",

The institutional investments however tell  use that NIO won't go the same way as them as the former were really  hobbyist options free for alls during economic upheaval as COVID-19  awareness spread in March... despite international news &amp; all  economic news concerning themselves with it back in early January.  Things like NIO are something you should always have a liquid 'pocket'  around for free investment imo. When I approach stuff like this I like  to invest 1-3k &amp; just let it go. Allocate like 5% or less of your  actual portfolio to stuff like this because if it runs it runs big  that's great. Nobody wants to get rich slow. Remember that. Nobody wants  to get rich slow. It's easy, it's ridiculously easy if you'd do what I  told you earlier &amp; follow something as simple as Buffet's dip policy  &amp; chase 0.5-2% gaps intraday all day.

It didn\u2019t.\n\nThe week before my birthday is when the bottom hit. \n\nIf I would have bought a week before my birthday, and just held I could have made so much fucking money. September fucked me real hard too.\n\n\nLesson of the story.\n\n** it\u2019s worth it to be patient to buy low and just hang on for dear life**. I sold way to early, and kept fetching for the bottom for too long... which is why I went from $4k - $135k - $75k instead of becoming a millionaire through probably the easiest time in human history to do so.\n\nNow I\u2019m looking forward to TSLA NIO PLUG AMD and various other companies to do well.",

        "body": "Really depends on their ability to scale their architecture. It's very obvious the current architecture borrows heavily from iPhone/iPad SOCs which can be seen from the limited connectivity (see low number of Thunderbolt ports on Macbook Pro 13 and the Mini).\n\nIf they can sort out higher core-count architecture (which is the stupidly hard part... interconnect, cache coherency protocol, etc) and also bring their I/O up to speed with what we are seeing from AMD then it has legs.\n\nHowever I do feel like the next generation of big desktops from Apple are still going to be x86. They might be AMD instead of Intel but they won't be ARM likely for another 2 years or so unless Apple has been really hard at work for atleast 4-5 years on this high core count architecture stuff.\n\nThough that out of the way the key important metric here is that they were able to deliver more efficient and faster cores.\n\nMy inuition tells me this is mostly down to these being ground-up AArch64 designs. For those unfamiliar with the history of 64bit architecture of x86-64 suffice to say it's a big fucking hack and really inefficient in it's usage of single byte instructions and has other idiosyncrasies that result in the processors needing massive \"frontends\" as we call them which convert instructions into microcode which is what the processor actually executes.\nAArch64 is -not- an extension of the original ARM ISA but rather a completely new one which is more modern and makes best use of the single byte instruction space (single byte in instructions are preferably both for binary size and for optimising frontend for most common cases).\n\nSo future is bright but I wouldn't underestimate just how fucking hard it is to get this stuff right. Apple has done well thus far but without the likes of Jim Keller or another chip savant it will be difficult to come out with a highly scalable design that can beat the modern Ryzen designs with their chiplets, interconnect and decades of experience in these bigger/faster high TDP chips.",
