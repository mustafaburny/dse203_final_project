I definitely wouldn't advise you to put all your eggs in one basket, but I do believe that AMD is a very good buy in the long-term.\n\nFundamentally, they have an absurdly phenomenal management team. Since Lisa Su's inception, the company has experienced tremendous growth and even managed to steal away Intel's lead architect. Although AMD has always has great products, Lisa Su has really managed to take it to the next level and make AMD nearly a household name at this point with the rise of customized computer building.\n\nI guess to answer your question better, if you're planning on holding this for 10+ years, I have no doubts that this stock will grow especially with its acquisition of Xilinx and incredible product line. These synergies match especially well and I don't see a way that Intel could possibly topple AMD as it previously has. The semiconductor industry has been seeing a growing prevalence, especially with its intertwining of AI (i.e. NVDIA).  \n\n\nEDIT: I know that might be a pretty ambiguous answer, but I've done a few analyses and reports on AMD, so if you have any other questions regarding their financials/future outlook, feel free to reach out!",

I'm good at the most important parts of investing (evaluating companies), but bad at a lot of the nuances, so there are a lot of tools I don't even know how to use effectively. \n\nQQQ looks very good I might get some when I want to stop monitoring the stock market like a mad man.\n\nIncoming rant on why AMD is good (it will go into the specifics of why AMD is going to be very competitive in the GPU and CPU markets). This will get fairly technical, but I tried to keep it understandable just in case you aren't as nerdy as me lol. There is a lot of info though, but I feel like I made it less frantic. I'll understand if you don't read it all or still choose not to invest in AMD, talking about tech is a hobby of mine.\n\nI could go on for a very long time why AMD is a really good play SPOILER ALERT: I'm about to :). [I mean really all you need to know is that Intel is very far behind (at least the consumer thinks that, but in reality Intel is still even with AMD, but barely)]. In June 2018 AMD had 8% of the consumer CPU market and by November 2019 they had 20% and by the end of Q3 2020 they had 37.3%. They are carving a massive hole in the market. AMD's new GPUs combat NVidias [at least that's what their marketing says, but AMD's marketing has been very good since Lisa Su became the CEO/COO, she is an actual electrical engineer and has been essential in bringing AMD back from the brink of bankruptcy in 2017 (AMD was expected to go bankrupt in 2018 if they didn't release something)]. \n\nI know it can be difficult to trust some random person on the internet, so you should look at the news. All tech news indicates that AMD is going to be doing very well this quarter and it seems like NVidia knows this as well, since they coincidentally delayed their 3070 GPUs 2 weeks ahead, so that it was literally the day before AMD's Big Navi announcement. Intel won't have a response to AMD's 5000 series (which is releasing this month) until early 2021 and those CPUs will be practically equal (probably slightly better) to the 5000 series, but probably cost more. The crux of Intel's problem is Intel's aging 14nm process, AMD is using TSMC's 7nm process (and is designing its next CPUs around TSMC's 5nm process). The difference between the 14nm process and the 7nm process is transistor density TSMC has a transistor density of 90 MT/mm\u00b2 (million transistors per square millimeter) while Intel's is much worse (no exact figures because Intel doesn't share that). The reason we can tell it's worse is because Intel's CPUs run much hotter than AMD's, yet have similar performance (people don't gravitate to Intel due to Intel's poor pricing) which means that Intel is having to push more power through the CPU to reach comparable speeds (which produces the extra heat). \n\nBack to GPUs, the 3090 (1500 USD) is NVidia's top-end flagship ridiculously priced card (NVidia and most other tech companies have one usually you pay double the price of the product below it while only gaining a negligible 15% performance boost) and the 6900XT (1000 USD) costs 500 less while delivering the same performance (when I say the same I mean in some games/workloads the 3090 wins and in others the 6900XT and it's always by a negligible margin). The 3080 is the reasonable 700 USD GPU (it's actually a very good value, especially when compared to NVidia's last gen pricing) but AMD has an answer to that too, and it's the 6800XT which also has very similar performance and costs 50 USD less, and I haven't even gotten to the best part: NVidia completely sold out of all of their GPUs within minutes and do not have ANY in stock rn and a lot of gamers want these new GPUs since they are such a massive leap forward, to put it in perspective the 3080 costs 100 USD less than the 2080 ti as of rn (the 2080 ti was the most expensive card from NVidia's last lineup) and has 33% more performance, gamers will buy whatever is available, plus NVidia had a shitty launch for a great product (they sold a lot of cards to scalpers and allowed them to buy multiple cards because they didn't add recaptcha or anything like that and their supply was already limited due to their choice to use faster (and lower yield) GDDR6X memory over just normal GDDR6 (AMD uses regular GDDR6, but they make up the performance by using TSMC's 7nm which is much denser than Samsung's 8nm the names of processes are not really indicative of transistor density), so people are angry). The cards that most people will buy are lower down the stack, but time and time again it has became evident that even if someone will ultimately buy a mid-tier GPU if the company that makes the mid-tier GPU isn't competitive on the high-end then they will purchase the mid-level GPU from the company that is competitive on the high-end (this hurt AMD bad last gen with GPUs) so that is why I won't go over the mid-low end as much (it is worth noting that AMD does have much better GPUs on the mid-low end)",

It will always be around of course, but anyone that doesn't think ARM is going to keep getting a larger and larger bite of the pie isn't paying attention. Apple will give everyone permission to target software for ARM architecture and we'll soon see a second attempt from Microsoft. Again, we'll always have applications for Intel, but it won't be nearly as dominant. Intel's production woes over the past half decade are well documented, and it's clear that they are about as well run as Boeing these days. The problem for Intel is that they face much more fierce competition than Boeing. Intel will survive of course, but they'll be a shell of their former self, and they'll have fumbled their flagship products and missed the boat on the areas of the industry that are sure to see rapid growth. I understand that people want to target value, but Intel is priced the way they are for good reason. If you're looking for value in Intel then I have some IBM stock to sell you as well.",

        "body": "No you're right this is all hand waving and speculation. What I believe is that Intel isn't leading in servers and they aren't leading in mobile. Like it or not, that's where the growth is. Intel has a solid business, but where they have traditionally dominated (pc) has recently been opened up to some serious competition on two fronts. They're complacent. They've never had competition before. \n\nSure their business is solid but in truth they really aren't worth much more than their dividend. There's a place in every portfolio for dividends, but personally I don't look to the tech sector for dividends. Things move too quickly and you don't have the same kind of stranglehold on markets as you do in other industries. If I want dividends I'm looking at financials or REITs or energy. But hey, that's a personal preference.\n\nIntel is a fine company, but there's so many slam dunks in tech right now that why would you lock up some of your capital in INTC?",

        "body": "Nvidia is a safe investment in the long run (they might go down a bit this month though due to AMD, but overall Nvidia has went up consistently over the past 5 years and has shown no signs of deviating significantly from that), Microsoft is safe, Tesla is too scary for me personally. I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

Before I list out the portfolio I am considering, please see my answers to the relevant information questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How old are you? **23**\n* Are you employed/making income? How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

        "body": "Nvidia is a safe investment in the long run (they might go down a bit this month though due to AMD, but overall Nvidia has went up consistently over the past 5 years and has shown no signs of deviating significantly from that), Microsoft is safe, Tesla is too scary for me personally. I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out.

People are limiting exposure to the market as a whole and just waiting to get back in the stock and don\u2019t want to get fucked by the election and corona news, but decided now wasn\u2019t the time. When it is the time, the trend will reverse hard. Apple was down 6% after a good earnings report and amazon was 5.5%.",

So many of the mom and pop shop venues are probably going to close due to $0 cash flow this year. As long as LYV can make it out alive until restrictions are lifted... the only competitor in there way will be pretty much AEG and they can continue its pre-COVID momentum.

A lot of people might look at its current yield of 0.70% and think it would be a terrible dividend stock to own because they yield is so low. But when you look at the actual dividend amounts things start to become a lot more clear.\n\nIn 2009, Visa paid a dividend of $0.10 a share. In 2019 they paid a dividend of $1.00 a share. Visa's stock price was around $20 in 2009, so if we use that as our cost basis, the current dividend yield we'd be receiving from shares purchased in 2009 would be 5% (known as yield on cost). So basically even though Visa currently yields 0.70% to anyone buying today, that doesn't mean everyone holding shares is making 0.70% on their investment. \n\nThis is one of the reasons Warren Buffet has been so successful over the years. For example, his cost basis on Coca Cola is $3.25 per share, and the stock currently pays a dividend of $1.64 per share. This means Buffet's yield on cost is over 50%. He invested $1.3B in KO back in the late 80s and early 90s, and will now collect $654 million in income from the stock this year alone.",

It could also be that Europe and China no longer want to rely on a dirty fuel that's mainly produced by unstable and despotic regimes.... All while the US is being left behind, while supporting a dying industry.  If Biden wins, start investing in Hydrogen businesses...

See the earnings call for IDXX, revenue growth and vet visits are actually positive this year because despite the restrictions... people still care about their pets and more people WFH = more first time pet owners\n\nLYV: What I learned is that most people don't care about social distancing and are ok with packing a venue to watch concerts and sports again. So many of the mom and pop shop venues are probably going to close due to $0 cash flow this year. As long as LYV can make it out alive until restrictions are lifted... the only competitor in there way will be pretty much AEG and they can continue its pre-COVID momentum. Warning... the stock hasn't dropped a lot for a company that is in a cash crunch and has +95% revenue decrease, which surprises me. E\nWhat won't surprise me if the stock drops to $20 - $45 and I'll be a buyer.\n\nV and MA: Should also accelerate growth once a vaccine is available and transactions are lifted. They should recover a big chunk of their spending volume and cross-border fees, but I think business travel is permanently impaired. Right now I'm a V holder, but I like PYPL a bit more as my favorite fintech.",
