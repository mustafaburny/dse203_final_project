        "body": "Couple of things to be cognizant of:\n\n* Make sure you've got your terminology straight.  Most people -- especially on this sub -- conflate Financial Advisor and Investment Manager.  They are not the same; investment management is just one facet of the much larger area of financial advice.\n * If you're young and don't have a great deal of money to manage, you probably don't need either one.  Investment management isn't really required when your near-term goal is \"save as much money as possible\".\n * If you also need some tax planning and advice, risk management, insurance planning and advice, estate planning and advice, and so forth, then yes, look for a financial advisor with \"CFP\" or \"ChFC\" after their name.\n* As you talk to potential advisors, keep in mind that *they are also interviewing you* to see if you'll be a good fit for their practice and style, will cause more problems than you're worth, and so forth.\n\nBut bottom line, it comes down to finding someone you are comfortable with.",

        "body": "Fed rates will remain unchanged. The big news will be in the language they use concerning repo assistance and balance sheet growth. I predict they're going to gradually stop doing any, and that the stock market will just have to deal with that. This is based on Kaplan's comments to the WSJ on the 15th. \"Many market participants believe that growth in the Fed balance sheet is supportive of higher valuations and risk assets. I'm sympathetic to that concern. I think it's wise to acknowledge it and be cognizant of that concern as we think about our next actions.\"\n\n\"The Fed balance sheet is not free and growing thr balance sheet has costs. It would be healthy to get to a point where, certainly, we don't need to do these daily and term operations.\"",

Vapes were banned in Quebec specifically to stave off market penetration by other legal players (since HEXO / Molson aren't doing much on that front, might as well let the existing domestic black market make their money). \n\nAnd lest we forget, Sebastien et. al have already made a fortune on the backs of retail (and of course, non-Quebecois) money in typical Quebecois fashion.",

Listen buddy, nowhere in his insightful post did he say support/resistance and indicators are the be all and end all. Charts should be a tool in your tool box along with fundamentals to make you as profitable as possible.\n\nYou're correct about one thing, major developments can break support/resistances but like I said, charts aren't the only thing in your tool box. And TA never claims to be right 100% of the time, it's used to determine where people in the market MAY or MAY NOT sell off. Use your fundamentals and indicators to determine which side you want to take and set a stop loss to protect your capital. I bet you're a loser in the market, right?",
