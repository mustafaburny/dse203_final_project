If you're correct that investment X (let's not use TSLA, but just an abstract investment) is a bubble, or otherwise overpriced.  How do you calculate the moment that it crashes?  How do you know that it doesn't crash 30 seconds after you buy your shares?  Answer: you probably don't know.\n\nSo you have $5,000 sitting around.  You put $4,000+ into a safe investment, and you put less than $1,000 into a high-risk speculation.  The speculation crashes and you lose 50% of your money.  Hopefully you can survive that.\n\nOR you take out debt and appropriate your 401k to chase that speculative bubble, and see your life savings disappear in a few hours time.  Maybe you have a harder time surviving that.\n\nAnd remember, you don't need crazy risk to do well in the stock market.  TSLA has been great, but an investment in an S&amp;P500 index fund was not bad at all for 2019.",

Most people -- especially on this sub -- conflate Financial Advisor and Investment Manager.  They are not the same; investment management is just one facet of the much larger area of financial advice.\n * If you're young and don't have a great deal of money to manage, you probably don't need either one.  Investment management isn't really required when your near-term goal is \"save as much money as possible\".\n * If you also need some tax planning and advice, risk management, insurance planning and advice, estate planning and advice, and so forth, then yes, look for a financial advisor with \"CFP\" or \"ChFC\" after their name.\n* As you talk to potential advisors, keep in mind that *they are also interviewing you* to see if you'll be a good fit for their practice and style, will cause more problems than you're worth, and so forth.\n\nBut bottom line, it comes down to finding someone you are comfortable with.",

I predict they're going to gradually stop doing any, and that the stock market will just have to deal with that.

I'm sympathetic to that concern. I think it's wise to acknowledge it and be cognizant of that concern as we think about our next actions.\"\n\n\"The Fed balance sheet is not free and growing thr balance sheet has costs. It would be healthy to get to a point where, certainly, we don't need to do these daily and term operations.\"",

Listen buddy, nowhere in his insightful post did he say support/resistance and indicators are the be all and end all. Charts should be a tool in your tool box along with fundamentals to make you as profitable as possible.\n\nYou're correct about one thing, major developments can break support/resistances but like I said, charts aren't the only thing in your tool box. And TA never claims to be right 100% of the time, it's used to determine where people in the market MAY or MAY NOT sell off. Use your fundamentals and indicators to determine which side you want to take and set a stop loss to protect your capital. I bet you're a loser in the market, right?",
