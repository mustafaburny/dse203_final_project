        "body": "Im a SOXL bull. Here's my take. NVDA at some point will take a breather. AMD has room to run but is not a big part of SOXL. TSM has room to run. LRCX, AVGO, INTC, TXN, ADI, SOXX, and MU are near all time highs.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the demand for chips is through the roof amd will remain high. Every industry thats booming needs them. The shortage is a positive thing for us. Demand is high. We dont want a glut. We want to operate at a slight shortage. That said, we will need perfect numbers to start the next leg up or a breather to let things cool off. Ive been hoarding shares on the dips and am selling covered calls and cash secured puts and then putting the money towards more shares.",

Their high-profile customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. I see this is an indication that they will be around for quite a while. Also since the pandemic, they have been steadily and consistently increasing in price.",
