        "body": "I agree with all your points. In terms of business similarity (not at all investing prospect similarities) I think of tech companies as:\n\n- chip/components/data center hardware: NVDA, AMD, INTC, QCOM, TXN\n- fabrication: TSM (I don't follow anything else sorry)\n- PaaS: MSFT, AMZN, IBM/RedHat, GOOG (trying aggressively)\n- SaaS/Software: MSFT, GOOG, ORCL, IBM/RedHat, ADEB, FB, AMZN\n- Consumer Electronics: AAPL\n- Ads: GOOG, FB\n\nobviously there are many other companies that I don't follow, and the categorization isn't 100% clean either. AAPL's services (music, icloud, etc) are forms of SaaS. FB is technically ads, but they are also a complete marketing SaaS especially globally where many businesses rely 100% on FB for their entire online presence. Ads also depends on your reach. Both GOOG and MSFT have consumer electronics, but I don't use that to drive investment. I won't be surprised if GOOG or MSFT cancel a major line of their hardware any time.\n\nThere are many other consumer electronics companies but nothing as fully integrated as AAPL in that area, including MSFT and GOOG.\n\nRedHat is active in the datacenter space and probably why IBM acquired them. IBM is more of a global tech projects coordinator, and manages a lot of banks infrastructures, but are feeling the pressure from other PaaS providers. I don't have any investments in it though. \n\nTech companies always have their toes in many businesses because of the nature of software. I can't think of one with more toes than MSFT (maybe GOOG second), which could be unfocused waste depending on their management. It certainly feel like it was for MSFT for most of the 2000s.\n\nTo answer OP's question though, I think any of these companies are probably fine with equal chances, though you will introduce yourself to company specific short term volatility. Who knows when a random bad news for AAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, etc might hit affecting the stock price in the short term. Balancing (depending on the amount) or using an etf like others mentioned is a good idea, though I don't think any of your picks will be bad in the long run either.",

I still have like 200 shares of F what I purchased back in 2009 so I do make some shit picks too.  \nOther shit picks of mine have been  IBM (I thought they could rebuild big iron using linux but now they have finally bought red hat may be a long term play), T (Don't know why I thought they would be a good investment 5 years ago, I think I saw them as the anti-Wallmart)",

Nokia was also seen as a fortress and fell in a couple years. FB replaced MySpace which replaced Friendster. You can't always buy your upcoming competitor either (some won't sell, others might be stopped by the regulator)\n\n3. They could become less relevant. Cisco, Oracle or IBM are still around but are now no longer as mighty. Cisco still sells plenty of gear but never recovered its stock heigh 2 decades ago. \n\n4. Regulatory intervention. FB has been in the crosshair for a while thanks to its \"money at all cost\" mentality. Amazon and Google are getting attention too.

All the buzz about AI and machine learning on supercomputers currently is nothing more than a fancy algorithm (maybe not even that fancy) which takes huge amount of time and resources for self learning. Google\u2019s AlphaGo AI played insane number of games with itself before it managed to beat Ke Jie in human vs machine.

Here is a 15-year chart of BRK.B vs S&amp;P500TR (untaxed dividends included):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/gd1ogo/brkb_vs_sp500_with_dividends_very_similar/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nThe airline loss for Berkshire was less than $3.5 billion. To put that in persepective, Berkshire had **operating earnings of almost $2 billion PER MONTH** in Q1 of 2020\n\nAnd quoting Bryant24 on SeekingAlpha:\n\n\"People always bring up IBM, he bought that in 2011 so it wasn't all that recent. It didn't work out as well as he'd hoped but he still made a little money on it. Also I give him credit because he got out in the $160's after he saw they were not doing as well in the cloud as he had expected. The stock has traded down in the lower $100's for the last couple of years so he at least made a good decision to get out.\"\n\n\"He bought his position in Heinz in 2012 and the deal with Kraft was done in 2015, so again not all that recent. He's also made money on KHC through it's dividend, I think the share price is about at the Berkshire cost basis. He had some KHC preferred shares that paid a really high coupon for several years. So he's returned well over 5% per year on his KHC investments and it's actually preforming pretty well right now. Again, not a great investment so far, but far from the disaster people make it out to be. It has been a disaster for those that bought it at 90.\"\n\n\"The airlines were actual losers but he was up a decent amount on them and then we had a pandemic. So perhaps he shouldn't have bought them, but things happen and the loss from the airline investment was tiny and immaterial in the scale of Berkshire. My point to all of this is people go out of their way to bring up Buffet's disappointing trades even nearly 10 years later and they way overstate the losses. Most are not educated on the trades and just repeat how big of a disaster IBM was when it was 9 years ago and not really a disaster.\"",

It became a dinosaur with the emergence of personal computers. But while many dinosaurs have been dead for years, IBM is still alive because -- IMO -- it has done one thing right: IBM Research.   IBM Research is what has kept IBM alive, staying with the youngsters.  \n\nGuess what. The current giants have learned from this. They all have invested heavily in research.  Most interestingly is Google. Most of their products are \"betas\", which are experimental research projects that are deployed to the public.\n\nAnother thing the giants have learned is that they need to be very flexible and adaptive to rising trends.   Microsoft raised because of the dominant of software, which by the way was the dead sentence for hardware giants.   But this dominant almost killed Microsoft, turning it into a dinosaur, when software became a commodity and not a specialty product.  Demanding customers to pay for each version of Windows and Word was no longer the right thing to do, Microsoft adapted to a model the sells software as a service.  And they have survived. They have also excelled due to Microsoft Research. This has allowed them to stay at the forefront.\n\nGoogle, Apple and FaceBook will be the dominating players in the near future because -- IMO -- data, data about people, and the interconnection of people have become more important than anything else.\n\nIt is very possible that data will become cheap in some sense, a commodity.  Although data has become more open, certain types of data can be very expensive to collect.  So I think Google and FaceBook will continue to have a promising future.\n\nApple is in a very interesting situation. It doesn't sell a product.   Other cellphone companies sell utilities. But Apple sells the experience of people connecting to people. It's like FaceBook in some way.  People inherent want to connect to other people. This is a lasting value. As long as Apple excels at this, it will be around for a long time.",

AMD Zen 3 is probably going to come out right ask Intel get their 10nm desktop/server chips going.\n\nRegarding TSMCs 5nm (or 7nm EVU, however you want to call it), they've been working with Apple to use it on the next iPhone since January. That tech is pretty much confirmed and good to go, unlike anything on Intel's side.\n\n&gt;AMD\u2019s margin is a lot smaller than Intel and contrary to people\u2019s belief that Intel is discounting to be competitive with AMD, their financial and especially their gross margin does not reflect that.\n\nAMD's margins are HUGE now, since they've moved everything to 7nm chiplet with a 12nm I/O die. They have a product stack that utilizes every single \"waste\" product to maximize production yield. They don't have to manufacture these huge dies with a bunch of cores anymore, since everything is based around dual, 4-core CCXs. All TSMC does is make tons of the same chip.\n\nActual yields are AMD at around 70% and Intel at around 35% (for their server stuff), and obviously not good enough to use on their consumer products.",

Instead of simply looking at the number and assuming intel is like a whole gen behind. They\u2019re not. These numbers are marketing, there isn\u2019t some convention for how these things are measured and there is no governing body that enforces it, it\u2019s up to the manufacturer how they measure it. In this case Intel\u2019s 10nm is roughly equivalent to and/tsmc 7nm. Intel is still behind in the actual roll out to the consumer, but the gap is not as wide as what you would assume. \n\nIntel also has advantages in how they manufacture their chips, and they should be able to squeeze more performance out of their chips over time than what and/tsmc will be able to do.\n\nI would not recommend shorting a technology company without doing proper research into their technology.",

I think this is a risky move as Intel are working on a new big/little architecture which *could* push them forward without significant process shrink. This is similar to many ARM processors and hasn't been implemented yet with x86. Impossible to say what the impact of this could be, in the datacenter - probably nil. On desktop and mobile x86, potentially big. Depends on how well they pull it off and how well / quickly Windows can make use of the change (assuming the scheduler has to be adapted for this).\n\nAMD is leading Intel on price and performance it virtually every segment now. With the 4000 series on mobile, that lead isn't apparent yet as OEMs are very cautious regarding a switch to AMD chipsets (and the substantial investment / R&amp;D required for new platforms) after decades of success with Intel. I have seen entrenched purchasing habits pushing Intel servers over better priced, better performing AMD EPYC systems for the past few years now (much to my frustration). I have no doubt this will change with time, however both mobile and datacenter are still Intel's market's to lose as of today. \n\nIn the next 1-2 years, if Intel pulls off the new big/little architecture they could get a performance and efficiency boost versus AMD's chiplet design. Whether or not that is enough to beat AMD after 5nm at TSMC is anyone's guess. So the outlook is very murky in the mid to long term. In the short term, entrenched (stupid) buying habits for enterprise customers and cautious adoption from mobile OEM's buys Intel time to get it's products competitive again before AMD swallows too much market share.",

The layoffs were part of a re-org, and weren't most/all of them contractors spread across different contracting firms as they moved most of their contracting to a single firm?\n\n&gt;I'll be honest in saying that I'm probably somewhat biased here in that I don't trust business CEOs to know how to run a tech company properly\n\nYeah, I'm an engineer too, and a lot of engineers think this way. I think it's mostly nonsense. The skills required for management are more often than not absent in an engineer. I see it all of the time; engineer does well as an individual contributor, wants to move up, gets a lead/director/whatever role, fails spectacularly.\n\nThey're just very different skill sets. I've seen MBA types fail too during my career, but I'm not convinced being technically inclined gives you much of an advantage in operations and capital allocations. You can be good at both, but it's rare. Writing someone off just because they came from a CFO background is just lazy. Do you have any specific issues with his track record, or is it just a tech bias?\n\nI see you also posted this: https://www.eetimes.com/intels-2020-forecast-is-grim/\n\nThat's a very interesting use of the word \"grim\". Revenue up, EPS up, margin down. Did you listen to the conference? Margins will be down because they intend to implement a new manufacturing process. Margins _always_ go down in the near term when you replace a process that has had years of optimization baked in.\n\nJudging from your other posts, you're a massive AMD fan. That's fine, they have been kicking ass for some time. They still make far less money than Intel, trade at a ridiculous multiple, and Intel's growth doesn't seem to be slowing down.\n\nYour analysis seems very lazy to me.",

And if that's the case shorting it now may lead nowhere.\n\nWe're not talking about NVDA with a P/E of 60+ or AMD with a P/E of 100+. Those are priced for perfection. We're talking about a company that had a great lead for a long time and is now selling at 11 times earnings. Sure, the earnings may drop, but will the price drop accordingly? Or will it just adjust to a slightly higher P/E? Look at JNJ, for instance, it has a P/E of 23 right now.\n\nI think we all agree that Intel is not going to disappear (as a company). Their prices will have to come down given their current position with respect to competitors, but they will adjust and survive. And if the price drops some 20 or 30% (which would give you a decent gain if you're shorting it) it just starts making sense to buy it for the dividend and the low P/E for a decent blue chip.\n\nSo, I'm by no means telling you you shouldn't short it.

Intel could always pay TSMC to manufacture their high end chips, too, and eat the same expense. They don't do it because they'd rather lose a few points of market share than slash gross profits.\n\nHaving vertically integrated fabs keeps costs low and gives Intel another way to win if they execute on technology development. But they'll spin off the fabs long before the company goes under, just like AMD did 10 years ago.",

There's nothing in the near term that would force a collapse or downsizing of that business. People got burned hard on Tesla even with the looming possibility of bankruptcy, which doesn't exist here.\n\nManufacturing their own products is the only way forward for them. Intel has been the #1 or #2 semiconductor manufacturer since 1995, no other company could handle that demand and they've generally been rewarded with a very high gross margin relative to competitors. Their biggest risk moving forward is having to adjust their margins down to meet competitors which is a quick adjustment to make and isn't going to collapse a business.\n\n**tl;dr - If you think they're set for a decline for this reason I would just avoid investing in them, but going short is maybe one of the dumbest things I've read today and I regularly surf WSB.**",

Some of their execs and employees are AMD shareholders and that incentivizes them to hold back their own tech, refine the 14nm products and profit from their competitor.

They give each other breathing space so that they can play each side of the table.\n\nNvidia and AMD do much the same thing in the GPU space. They are careful to segment the pricing and performance of their products and not release them at the same time.
