You\u2019re welcome \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4417169-ase-technology-vs-amkor-an-analysis-on-worlds-leading-osats\n\n\u201cStrategic Alliance between ASE and TSMC\nASE is based in Taiwan, one of the leading centers for outsourced semiconductor and electronics manufacturing in the world. Its close geographical proximity allows the company to benefit from strong manufacturing activity. It has maintained a strategic alliance with TSMC since 1997, the largest dedicated foundry with a market share of 56% of the foundry market revenues. The alliance has made ASE the preferred provider of packaging and testing services for TSMC clients. This allows ASE to benefit by leveraging TSMC's clients of leading companies including Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, Nvidia (NVDA), MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTKF), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as clients who account for nearly half of ASE's revenues. Apple, Qualcomm and MediaTek are major players in the smartphone processor market and are developing 5G chipsets that require advanced packaging capabilities which ASE can provide. Given the long-standing relationship between TSMC and ASE, we expect the alliance between both companies to continue as it enables them to provide a total semiconductor manufacturing solution and the close geographic advantage between both market leaders. This means that ASE should be able to continue counting on TSMC's clients of leading chipmakers.\u201d",

        "body": " TL:DR - looking for feedback on a simple hi return stock screen and thoughts on how to rank results.\n\nEarly 60's, simple, diversified, buy and hold retirement portfolio approach my whole life. Looking at working probably another 5-10 years and starting to get a lot more active in my portfolio. Nothing crazy and I'm fundamentally a conservative+ investor, but I do not subscribe to moving 100% into ultra safe right before retirement. Portfolio size is low 7 figure for reference.\n\nOver the past few months I subscribed to a couple of authors on Seeking Alpha and have tried out a few strategies with minimal exposure and have a good idea of how to use some of the approaches in my portfolio. I want to develop my own screens because at least on Seeking Alpha, the authors I've found charge a small monthly fee for their updates. It's nothing huge, and for me at least has been worth seeing their approaches, but nothing I want to pay for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm going to put together a dividend screen/strategy and a \"better than cash\" parking lot strategy. Pretty basic and straightforward. I also just got started on putting together a screen to identify a more hi growth strategy - thought being on a monthly basis invest in the top 4 stocks that fall out of the screen. Would love some feedback on the screen (I'm stock knowledgeable, but certainly not an expert). When looking at the screen and giving feedback keep in mind my objective: not looking for the perfect approach or for mega returns, I'm an 80/20 kinda guy so looking for a decent, simple to execute strategy to reliably give back a growth-class return. (And using the Fidelity screener as that's where my portfolio is).\n\nScreen as it stand currently:\n\n* Tagging Energy, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Industrials sectors\n* Market cap down to Medium (as defined by Fidelity: 6-33B)\n* 13 week price performance down to 13%\n* 3 yr annualized Beta of 1.1 and up (conflicted on whether this really helps the screen)\n* Very Bullish or Bullish analyst recommendations (Summary score from StarMine)\n* Forward EPS 3-5 yrs high to very high (16.5% and up)\n* EPS growth Projected year versus last year high to very high (40% and up)\n\nAs an example, running that screen today resulted in a list of 7 stocks (sorry not allowed to link image or would give you a shot of the fundamentals):\n\n1. AMAT - Applied materials\n2. FANG - Diamondback Energy\n3. EOG - EOG Resources\n4. NXPI - NXP SemiConductor\n5. KKR - KKR &amp; Co\n6. LRCX - LAM Research Corp\n7. MU - Micron Technology\n\nSo the thought would be to run this first day of every month and put a set amount in the top 4 stocks in the filter. I would guess some stocks might stay in for months, some might rotate in and out quickly.\n\nMy question is basically around how to rank. So do I just pick a screening metric (or some other metric) and do a simple rank on that metric to determine top 4, or do I create a formula to weight and aggregate multiple metrics into an overall score and rank on that?\n\nSorry for the long post - thank you to those who stuck with it and are willing to share your thoughts.",
