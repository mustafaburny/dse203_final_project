Companies that carry reasonable d/a ratios and increase operating cash flows over the long haul. \n\nPlus, I\u2019ve followed them for so many years and have done so much analysis that you know when it\u2019s time to buy or sale.  \n\nAs for what price I think they are worth, I use a discount dividend model (DDM) and cash flow analysis to determine their intrinsic value and put a 20% deviation, up and down. If the price falls below my threshold, I buy. If it is over, I sell. Anywhere in between, I hold. Biggest thing is staying true to your numbers and not let the media influence your decisions.  I\u2019m more of a contrarian.  If the media is boasting about a particular equity, more than likely any profitability is dried up. That\u2019s my two cents.",

        "body": "So, here\u2019s a thought. One strategy that people use to defend a losing position is to sell the opposite, turning a put spread into an iron condor or an iron butterfly to mitigate the loss.\n\nLast Friday I sold a 277.50/275 put spread on INTU expiring this past Friday. My thought was that they would have good earnings because it\u2019s tax season and they\u2019re buying Credit Karma. Which they did, but I couldn\u2019t buy back the spread right away on Tuesday so I decided to let it expire. Unfortunately the stock went down with the rest of the market for the rest of the week.\n\nSo, what I did was I sold the 277.50/280 call spread to mitigate my loss. Instead of going max loss on the trade, I lost $77. I made $132 on the call side and was able to eventually buy back the put side on Friday morning when volatility was high, preventing max loss.\n\nInstead of doubling down on a losing trade by doing the same thing, I defended my position by taking the opposite trade. I didn\u2019t make a profit, but I didn\u2019t blow up my account, either.",
