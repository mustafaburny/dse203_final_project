Turns out he meant Pfizer. \n\nNow he\u2019s threatening to kick me out of the house because he got blasted by Fiserv post earnings dump and thought he was holding Pfizer calls for the past two weeks. How do I get his 35k back? The fiserv calls expired last week and I told him yesterday. He was like \u201cWHAT THE FUCK IS FISERV I SAID PFIZER\u201d \n\nHe is legit throwing shit at me right now.",

Here\u2019s some that I\u2019ve been reading up on to buy big and stay long on\u2026 (I\u2019m not a pro or anything so I\u2019m not saying these picks are 100%, and *constructive* criticism is welcome.)\n\n(SOFI) -  Pretty sure everyone knows sofi\u2026 One of my fav fintech stocks that is still very young and is growing very nicely. Seem to be making all the right moves.\n\n(NMTR) - Making worlds first celiac disease drug and also developing a drug for covid treatment. It\u2019s a spec, but imagine this potential.\n\n(DKNG) &amp; (PENN) - Rapidly growing. Will continue to have an expanding TAM as states legalize online gambling &amp; betting. Canada just passed some laws too. Both companies made some recent acquisitions to continue growth and expansion. They have their eyes set on going a lot further than where they are.\n\n(DIS) - Disney is a powerhouse. Their streaming business has been growing and parks will just continue to generate as we move past covid. Streaming, movies, theme parks, cruise lines, merchandise\u2026 they have their hands in everything. I think disney\u2019s streaming service is going to be a monster.\n\n(KBWY) - It\u2019s basically a REIT etf. It\u2019s got a high dividend yield. It\u2019s still not fully recovered from pre-pandemic levels. I believe real estate will continue to recover. I\u2019d just keep this forever and keep buying into it over time and let the DRIP grow it too.\n\n(Z) - Zillow got a lot of attention with the housing boom and is taking advantage of it. Apparently they\u2019ve been buying up a TON of real estate. I think that\u2019s a genius idea to streamline real estate transactions. High P/E currently but I think as their new plans unfold that will rapidly make a lot more sense.\n\n(FISV) - Love what they\u2019re doing in the fintech space. They\u2019ve been making a lot of acquisitions to expand their reach and I think they have a good plan to keep making their mark\u2026 BUT\u2026 not yet. I think their P/E is something like 70-80 so I\u2019d wait for a pullback on this one before starting a position.\n\n$SOFI $NMTR $DKNG $PENN $DIS $KBWY $Z\n\nShare your ideas or tell me what you think about these ones.\n\nGood luck everyone.",

Maybe by STNE or a US based mega sponsor that wants to expand south of the border and into gambling.\n\nThe card associations like VISA and MC are a completely different beast, related but separate.. \n\nPaysafe is a payment processor, so a big player is Square which had operating margins of 4% last quarter.  Another is FISERV operating margin of 7% last quarter.  The payment processors have low margins but make crap tons of $$$ because of their large scale.\n\nVisa is great, a card association but definitely NOT a payment processor.\n\nNice try though... good luck to you",

I think the large float is intentional due to the profile of a fintech that already does $100 billion in transactional volume and controls enough market share to be so readily accumulated by institutions. \n\nRegarding competition, see section on MOAT. They clearly differentiate themselves from competitors in iGaming, eCash, multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise and risk management.\n\nDebt is currently high but they just had their debt rating upgraded, successfully refinanced all of it at much lower rates and are on track to expand margins and cash flow to reduce leverage. As I posted:\n\n&gt;\"The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.",

It's not just about building the software, is much, _much_ more than that. I don't think there's _so many_ of these companies either - AFTPY, AFRM, Klarna, and technically PYPL are the major ones I'm aware of. Acquiring a company can be incredibly cheaper with a higher probability of success in regards to entering the market you're trying to get into.  \nMaybe they overpaid, but strangely enough the market didn't respond in that way and it'll take awhile to actually say for sure anyway",

That school also feels that Venmo is a juggernaut so the existence of competition doesn't bother them.\n\nI've had a small position and my thesis was a bit of each, but I held through earnings with the intent to sell if it popped.  That didn't happen so I had to make a new plan.  I still intend to sell, but now I'm looking to do so into strength when people realize the earnings sell off was a bit much.

I personally do plan to buy the PYPL dip--but not yet. I think it has further to go, especially after the guidance given doesn't predict any revenue growth for the next quarter.",

He said that the only focus on the company was fighting companies like Qualcomm. This was obvious with their push of things like Atom. They didn't care about HPC because they didn't see any competition in it. Almost all of the money and research was poured elsewhere because everybody went to them for HPC anyway. Once Ryzen was released, which had obvious buy signals about it at the time, they still didn't give a shit, because first gen wasn't as good as Intels established product. \n\nThen it got better.\n\nThen it got even better.\n\nThen it got even better.\n\nAnd at that point it was too late, because Intel had focused all of it's energy trying to make atom processors and things of the like nobody wanted, they could no longer trivially keep up in HPC.",
