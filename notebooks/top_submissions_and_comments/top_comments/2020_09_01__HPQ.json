In an interview with the CEO of HPQ he blatantly wouldn't/couldn't pronounce Elon Musk properly. Is he not allowed to say his name cause of an NDA or is it just cause he's French Canadian and has an accent?",

One of these companies is rumored to be Vale.\n\nPyrogenesis is hosting a special AGM on battery day.\n\nThere's more.\n\nDaddy Musk has mentioned that both nanotubes and high grade silicon are essential for his batteries.\n\nPyrogenesis has a stake in a company called HPQ Silicon Resources ($URAGF, HPQ.v on the tsxv). They paid about 50% more than the current SP for their stake so you know there's probably at least a 50% upside here.\n\nWhat does HPQ do? Manufacture high grade silicon products. Oh and they PRed an NDA about talks with an advanced material developer about energy storage applications in June. \n\nYou do the math, I was on the GIGA train at 0.70 CAD and got off when we broke 1.50 over the past week or so. My battery day play is all HPQ and PYR.\n\nThose of you that have read this far are likely googling charts now and wondering why PYR shit the bed recently. It was due to an analyst on BNN taking a call regarding PYR and giving a false response to the question. There's more on stockhouse about this if you can sift through all the garbage.",

HPQ Silicon is a Montreal-based technology company that is developing new proprietary low-cost processes that can produce the metallurgical grade high purity silicon that battery manufacturers are looking for in one step and then transform that Silicon into spherical silicon powders.\n\nThe first process, called the PUREVAP\u2122 Quartz Reduction Reactor (QRR) Project, has successfully produced, transformed, and purified quartz into high purity silicon metal (4N+ Si) in one step. In the second process, the PUREVAP\u2122 Nano Silicon Reactor (NSiR) would enable the low-cost transformation of melted silicon into spherical nanopowders and nanowires. These spherical silicon metal nanopowders will allow the manufacturing of high-performance lithium-ion batteries using silicon metal anodes.\n\n\u201cOur technology can simplify and standardize the process used to convert quartz into silicon and then convert Silicon into nano-sized particles,\u201d says Bernard Tourillon, HPQ Silicon\u2019s CEO. \u201cBy doing this affordably, the market potential of silicon anode batteries and the products which could potentially utilize them could be vastly expanded.\u201d\"",

        "body": "Pretty much everyone will list off some of the household names in big tech, like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, ADBE, GOOGL, etc. All of these are industry leaders with solid financials, so they\u2019re probably a safe bet for long-term growth. Though they may be overvalued right now (pretty much everything is). \n\nOther than those, within tech I tend to like semiconductors. I figure that cloud computing, AI, AR/VR, self-driving cars, fintech, bitcoin mining, smart phones and computers, etc. are just going to become a bigger and bigger part of the economy. And computer chips (CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, those chips in your credit card, etc.) are at the heart of all of these technologies. It\u2019s pretty clear that technological progress here isn\u2019t slowing, and demand for chips is just going to continue to grow. If you want to go with individual companies, NVDA, AMD, TSM, AMAT, MU, LRCX are all at the forefront right now, and have solid balance sheets. If you don\u2019t want to put all your money on one horse, a non-diversified, semiconductor-focused ETF like SMH or SOXX will give you exposure here while mitigating some of the risk. \n\nGreen/clean energy is a promising market, but it\u2019s a really young industry so there\u2019s a lot of risk in trying to pick a winner. TSLA is ahead of the pack for now, but it\u2019ll have competitors nipping at it\u2019s heals soon enough, and the stock is currently way overvalued. There are also other sectors of this market that TSLA hasn\u2019t tapped into, and could see massive growth in the next 5-15 years as we begin to wean off of fossil fuels. Again, a focused ETF like PBW or QCLN is a good way to mitigate risk and broaden exposure without having to pick a single winner. That said, this sector may be overvalued right now because oil/gas have taken a big hit during COVID and green energy isn\u2019t quite ready for prime time. In other words, oil/gas are currently cheap and will probably rebound a bit Post-COVID, so you could make money with fossil fuels, but I\u2019d stay out of them long-term and bet on clean energy/vehicles instead. \n\nI also like biotech and genomic medicine. TMO is a blue chip that basically has a monopoly and is a go-to for all biological research. Pretty safe bet on a well run company that\u2019ll be around for years. LZAGY, RHHBY, and TECH are similar, but tend to have their hands in more clinical trials and drug development, mainly with small molecules and other \u2018classic\u2019 treatment methods. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good ETF in this sector, but I haven\u2019t really looked as it\u2019s my field. CRISPR, gene therapy, etc. are all starting to show promise in the clinic, but is a really nascent industry. MRNA and BNTX are probably overvalued right now due to COVID speculation, but if they can get their delivery mechanisms to work (and they\u2019re showing promise), they\u2019ll basically revolutionize medicine. Again, if you don\u2019t want to bet on a single horse, ARKG is a good ETF for genomic medicine. TNX is a very young company that\u2019s showing a lot of promise for sequencing technology, so high risk but potentially very high reward. \n\nOther than that, it\u2019s always a good idea to put money into \u2018boring\u2019 non-risky, non-tech stocks. COST, WMT will probably be good picks during the coming economic crisis, and may actually be able to compete with AMZN if they shore up their online interface. V and MC are solid standbys (can\u2019t go wrong with credit cards). Also probably a safe bet to go with health insurance companies. SPY is also a broadly diversified ETF (basically the tracks the S&amp;P) that will be a safe bet long-term.\n\nMy suggestion would be to pick industries you think will grow long-term, and select a few stocks or an ETF within them. Set up a rather diversified portfolio so you aren\u2019t overexposed on any one front (I\u2019ve lost more than the market with this last slump, for instance, since I\u2019m overexposed in tech; I could probably use more \u2018boring\u2019 stocks like WMT). One or two shares apiece from 50 promising companies is a much safer bet than 500 shares in one or two very promising companies. Keep each at a smallish percentage of your total (I get really uncomfortable if a single stock goes above 10% of my total, even if it began as 1%, so I sell to bring it back down and use the profit to diversify). Generally speaking, the riskier the industry/company is, the lower percentage of your total it should be. \n\nHope this helps!",

Wanted to get LRCX yesterday at 338 but missed it and didn't want to pay the extra 5-8% now look! Down 341, and see what's in store tomorrow, more fear or greed. If it's fear I'm sitting with my cards in hand and looking what I need to add. Hell, I was holding flat this morning until 10am. No need to sell especially just to try and save some change to buy in lower.",

        "body": "Ah yes all the classic comments about the \u201ctech bubble\u201d and how everything is overvalued. Guess what... \u201ctech\u201d is literally a part of our daily lives now. \n\nIn the dotcom times it was all about lofty valuation on the possibility that tech would be the next big sector. Turns out many years later to actually be true and everyone is pissed off that they were wrong about doubting it. \n\nNow Apple, and Microsoft are literally at the top of the S&amp;P500 yet some people still cannot accept them because of P/E valuations and it\u2019s logical but I think its hilarious how contradictory some of the statements can be. \n\nThese people talk about how its impossible to time the market or that past performance doesn\u2019t indicate future performance yet there is one thing they are certain of. A tech bubble because of the tech bubble that happened 20 years ago. How can everyone be so certain these companies are overvalued when the sector has lead the market for the last 10 years. Maybe tech will fall back or maybe it will continue to outperform for another 10 years. We just don\u2019t know. What\u2019s certain is tech is not what it was 20 years ago and it will be interesting to see how it grows going forward. Those who say techs outperformance isn\u2019t relevant just want to rationalize their bearish stance on tech IMO.  \n\nAll this said the tech sector is  broad and there are fairly valued solid companies out there with good balance sheets. TSM(P/E 27.4) and LRCX(P/E 20.9) are some I am interested in.",
