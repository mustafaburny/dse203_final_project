Here's the rub: as low as a 35% reduction in global emissions results in an immediate (this year) 0.5-1c global average temperature rise due to loss of global dimming/aerosol masking effect. What do you think happens when industry and transpo is disrupted severely by the virus? A massive reduction in emissions.\n\nMost people have no idea about this bit. We're fucked this year duder, this is the catalyst for global collapse (not this year, but in the very near future), though most don't see it yet (partly due to the fact that most people don't understand indirect consequences like the above).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context, the decadal global avg temp rise from 1951-2012 was 0.12c. DECADAL. We may be seeing 0.5-1c THIS YEAR. I'm sure you can decipher the general ramifications here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the 2nd rub: World leaders literally cannot be unaware of this conundrum. It's beyond the realm of reason that this isn't acutely understood by the people running show. If laymen with too much time on their hands can use studies and scientific projection/discussion on this to come to the right conclusions, then their intel has already detailed this to them, and they understand collectively what's happening here.

The best they had was low to medium performance options for both markets. This has been their position with respect of Intel and nVidia for a long time. Now their CPUs are king and their GPUs are competitive, even lacking a flagship as powerful as the 2080 or 2080ti. \n\nThey have rapidly transitioned from a sustained underdog position to a real tooth and nail competitor. If we assume that this trend will continue does it not stand to reason that their share price should also continue to perform as they seize a greater market share?\n\nThis of course says nothing about server and console hardware, which im less familiar with but i hear they're doing well in those sectors as well.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

Surge capacity in disasters is crushing, and numbers far beyond a bad flu season Saturday.  Pray you catch it soon while your nurses have still had sleep.\n2. The collapse of the retail, non-internet economy.  No way people are going out in public in two weeks.  Forget all big events of any kind by the end of this week.\n3. Right now as I read stories, production resumes in affected areas in China, the questions become deep: who drives the product? (no drivers)  To where? (can I even get to the port which might be shipping and to where?)  To do what with it? (no one will be where this arrives to make this into anything)  To sell to who??? (who in the world is buying non essentials over the next month, and forget luxury items).\n4. The psychological toll of increasing death and infection numbers in the millions.  I always feared the most insane scenario of us eventually hitting numbers past SARS.  We already did, and this is just beginning.  If Hhundreds of thousands of cases are showing up throughout the world this week \\*\\* then thisis the sign above all you need to splash iceberg-tier water on your face\\*\\* as those numbers instantly turn into utter global catastrophe.\n5. Even if the outbreak is mystically somehow only half-terrible, we are looking dead square at severe political instability, borders closing, emergency service personnel getting quarantined (e.g. the firefighters case that just occurred is very telling).\n\nPeople attempt to compare this to market over-excitement and numbers issues causing past corrections.  Lol.  Denial.  This is not the mis-pricing of some housing bundles. Think of the trivial stuff that caused past recessions.  Possibly depressions.  Numbers and money games.\n\nThis is a bit more akin to a meteor being present in the sky, clearly heading at our face, and NASA saying 'it is nothing to worry about since \"it is not that big, just the size of 2-3 texas, and it is getting smaller, and we have the best meteor absorbing atmosphere.  I think ever.  Meteors hit us all the time.\"\n\nIf the world started a stunning, A-game global response to this tomorrow, there would be a real reason for hope.  There would be light at the end of a \\*very\\* inconvenient tunnel.  But few, if any, countries are prepared to act with the swift lockdown and mega-scale construction China achieved.  They had people standing outside of each apartment complex and on every block enforcing travel and quarantine.   Areas without party-enforcement mechanisms were paying hard-cash to neighbors to report on each other.  That is what it takes to beat this.\n\nIn summary, take the few data points we have and get the balls to draw a line through them.  It plummets straight down.  So, enjoy profiting off the market fall this week.  (Monday could rally, but the market is a dead-crimson-black by open on Tuesday about 8 days from now)\n\nSpend every dollar (or at least 40%) that you make tomorrow on Tuesday and Wednesday on useful material items.  Immediately.  If you can get them.  As money being worth something will be the larger issue.\n\nI dare you to have the balls to read every single post on r/Coronavirus for the next two hours until the on-the-ground reality sets in.  There is no end in sight.\n\nIt has not even begun.",

Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day.

Get it done in federal - disability money garnished at 25% for 10 years, then debt forgiven and IRS taxes the forgiven amount. Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle.

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",

Buffett invests on very long timelines, using historical trends and ratios as a guide, whereas many investors look at more recent information, and only start investing at the point where recent history shows good returns. I'd say when recent history shows poor returns but long term history shows good, and the particular company you're looking to invest in has some kind of difficult to emulate competitive advantage (be it financial, operational, market, or some combination thereof) then go and invest. Otherwise, keep your money on the sidelines (and let it pile up) whilst you observe the market/industries/companies and wait for a great opportunity to buy. This is what the Oracle does, I think.",

        "body": "Great question. \n\nCompanies have been developing a new model for delivery of their services. Traditional IT is considered on-prem or on premise technologies. That can range from servers to applications. Technology vendors have been developing \u201ccloud\u201d technology for years and have been pushing this to market. However, because true cloud or \u201cpublic cloud\u201d is hosted in a vendors data center people are skeptical of using vendors because they don\u2019t control everything. This means all the responsibility is on the vendors to secure everything. \n\nSince cloud is the new way of deploying IT solutions and people are starting to accept the model more governments want in on the benefits of cloud. \n\nBut since the government won\u2019t be in full control of the cloud (see Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Oracle gov data centers) they need a way to ensure security, deployment, and capabilities are met. This is called fedramp. There are multiple levels in getting certified for usage from the government.",

        "body": "I would disagree. That's only because if you start (and continue) to invest because you somehow believe \"I should start investing\" or \"I should be consistently investing\" (what brokers would have you believe, to ensure their survival) rather than \"I have found a good investment\" then you will always invest an inopportune moments. Buffett invests on very long timelines, using historical trends and ratios as a guide, whereas many investors look at more recent information, and only start investing at the point where recent history shows good returns. I'd say when recent history shows poor returns but long term history shows good, and the particular company you're looking to invest in has some kind of difficult to emulate competitive advantage (be it financial, operational, market, or some combination thereof) then go and invest. Otherwise, keep your money on the sidelines (and let it pile up) whilst you observe the market/industries/companies and wait for a great opportunity to buy. This is what the Oracle does, I think.",

That can range from servers to applications. Technology vendors have been developing \u201ccloud\u201d technology for years and have been pushing this to market. However, because true cloud or \u201cpublic cloud\u201d is hosted in a vendors data center people are skeptical of using vendors because they don\u2019t control everything. This means all the responsibility is on the vendors to secure everything. \n\nSince cloud is the new way of deploying IT solutions and people are starting to accept the model more governments want in on the benefits of cloud. \n\nBut since the government won\u2019t be in full control of the cloud (see Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Oracle gov data centers) they need a way to ensure security, deployment, and capabilities are met. This is called fedramp. There are multiple levels in getting certified for usage from the government.",

        "body": "I would disagree. That's only because if you start (and continue) to invest because you somehow believe \"I should start investing\" or \"I should be consistently investing\" (what brokers would have you believe, to ensure their survival) rather than \"I have found a good investment\" then you will always invest an inopportune moments. Buffett invests on very long timelines, using historical trends and ratios as a guide, whereas many investors look at more recent information, and only start investing at the point where recent history shows good returns. I'd say when recent history shows poor returns but long term history shows good, and the particular company you're looking to invest in has some kind of difficult to emulate competitive advantage (be it financial, operational, market, or some combination thereof) then go and invest. Otherwise, keep your money on the sidelines (and let it pile up) whilst you observe the market/industries/companies and wait for a great opportunity to buy. This is what the Oracle does, I think.",

That can range from servers to applications. Technology vendors have been developing \u201ccloud\u201d technology for years and have been pushing this to market. However, because true cloud or \u201cpublic cloud\u201d is hosted in a vendors data center people are skeptical of using vendors because they don\u2019t control everything. This means all the responsibility is on the vendors to secure everything. \n\nSince cloud is the new way of deploying IT solutions and people are starting to accept the model more governments want in on the benefits of cloud. \n\nBut since the government won\u2019t be in full control of the cloud (see Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Oracle gov data centers) they need a way to ensure security, deployment, and capabilities are met. This is called fedramp. There are multiple levels in getting certified for usage from the government.",

(I bought it after I heard the president talk about buying some of the cheap oil in the market and filling up our coffers)\n\n12 Big Lots Jan 15 2021 20 at $1.45 \n\n5 XOM Oct 16th 2020 45 at $4.67. (May hold on to this one longer term as I believe we will see a bounce in oil in the coming months)\n\nHeavily considering buying July Puts on the SPY at the $200 range and Apple at the $225 range as well. \n\nMy positions are fluid and are aimed, generally speaking and specifically on the PUT side, to give me downside protection on the nearly $600,000 I have in long positions. \n\nNervous times, generally speaking, but, with a longer term horizon, likely 12 months, in mind, I believe we have MANY moats that will pull us out of this thing quicker and more robustly than we have seen in the previous bear markets--- lower oil prices, VERY low interest rates, a pro business FED and US GOVT AND, potentially most importantly, PENT up demand that will be fully unleased with a ripe garden of money, loans and oil that are there for the taking!\n\nWhile I lose about $30,000, give or take, per 2,000 point down day, I also add to positions for the long term, specifically, in Google, Amazon, Facebook, CVS, Cisco, QCOM, Pfizer and SWKS. \n\nI wish everyone the best of luck and will say, generally speaking, be greedy when others are fearful. \n\nI believe we are DAMN close to having a recession AND a corona virus effect fully priced into the market, outside of Apple, which I believe has significantly more downside.",

They also have a track record of producing the best revolutionary modems and chipsets out there, so I'm betting it'll happen again.

I haven't done full DD on those small cap picks yet. \n\nAlso the safe and boring bet is AMT, CCI or SBAC. \n\nNon american bets would be Ericson or Nokia, but rumor is it that Nokia will lose the transmission race. \n\nSafe bets are also on VZ or T.

Are people, even with the corona virus, going to stop paying their cell phone bill / using their cell phone (Verizon)? Is 5G, which from everything I\u2019ve read, is going to be transformative, going to stop because of corona virus (Qualcomm / Skyworks)? I think the answers are simple, and, frankly, I\u2019m an investor, so these are special opportunities!\n\nAdditionally, no one ever picks the bottom correctly so start buying down. Long term, with these companies, you will be more than glad that you did.\n\nIf your concerned about the short term, I would recommend, like I am doing, buying the stock (at a price you like) and buy a put against it. If it goes up, great. If it goes down, which is likely in the short term, you profit without selling / losing your shares.\n\nKeep some cash on the sideline too, but always keep the long term horizon in view. There are ways to make money on a downturn AND ways to minimize the loss!\n\nGood luck!",

When it hits that number, or close to it, by some calls on solid stocks. Similarly, yesterday, my brothers and I were buying puts when it hit the highs. The market has a ways to go until stabilization and I believe that April earnings are going to give clarity on the matter. I would stay away from travel / leisure stocks. Names like: qcom, swks, aapl, sbux, nke, fl, VOO, SPY are the easiest ways to buy puts and buy calls. Really, it comes down to doing a little bit of homework, following bond rates --- when the 10 year rolls below 1% that means folks are rolling money out of the market and into bonds and vice versa. Also, give yourself some time on the puts or calls. Good luck",

I'll take the dividend re-investment at these low prices (On the ones paying dividends, of course), continue to add to my positions on decent dips, and look back in, very likely, 12 months and be looking at all time highs again. \n\nIt was a story I told my brothers yesterday, on an anecdotal level, of course, but one that I do believe applies to many Americans:\n\nI had to run to CVS to get a prescription for my daughter yesterday, while I was waiting in line, I used my apple iPhone, on my Verizon cell phone, to call my wife to make sure we didn't need anything else. All the while, I went on Facebook to see what late / great breaking news there would be. When I finally got to the cashier, I used my American express credit card to buy the goods. On the way out, I happened to see some Cherry Vanilla Coke, of which I bought, and then left. \n\nMy point is that, if the common investor, like myself, can take a step back, specifically at these market prices, we really are getting unreal buys for the long term with companies that are well capitalized, well used and well positioned, when the corona virus goes away, to succeed in the future. \n\nBTW: I would order off of Amazon, but we all know they are focused on the medical / essential side of things. \n\nWorking under the presumption that the government is going to bail out the American worker, I think now may be the greatest investment opportunity we have had in a while for stock pickers. \n\nGood luck everyone!",

Do you retrench earnings back 10%, 20%, 30%, again, specifically related to these companies. Personally, based on what I have seen in the past, I believe it's more reasonable, than not, to assume those specific companies will likely see a decrease to the tune of 10% in earnings, given that they are, essentially, vital to the normal routine lives of a majority of the people, not only in this country, but across the world. So, using Google as an example, they had FY earnings of, about, $50 EPS in 2019. Their high was about $1525. Assume, for the sake of the argument that their EPS declines to the tune of 10%, or $5 EPS, making their prospective 2020 total $45. Using a fair multiple, of say 22X, that puts fair value of that stock at: $990 --- would you buy google at $990, or do you think there is further downside? The exercise can go on for the likes of CVS, where folks are going to get their scripts filled, one way or the other, and FB, where, I could argue, the more people are at home, the more people are using it and Instagram. Again, it's a numbers game. This is how I value stocks and, at least for myself, value how I will buy the stocks OR how I will buy puts / buy calls against and for them.",

        "body": "I'll give you two more pieces of information to chew on:\n\n1) All of the numbers I presented to you are from trades I am making weekly, or on an ongoing basis. Two trades I made this week might be worth looking at. On Tuesday, 3/24 I sold covered calls on JPM &amp; SWKS (I own both stocks).\n\nJPM (200 shares) - I sold the 3/27 Call at $93 for $0.72 and made $139 (plus or minus a few pennies for commissions). We closed today (Fri) at $91.13. I got to keep both my stock, and my option premium.\n\nSWKS (200 shares) - I sold the 3/27 Call at $90 for $0.74 and made $145 (plus or minus a few pennies for commissions). We closed today at $87.09. I got to keep both my stock, and my option premium.\n\nI think a fair number of people would look at that and say \"wow, you're a genius. You got to keep your stock AND you made $285 in 3 trading days, and you will get to do it again on Monday.\" And while I did get to keep my $285 and my stock, I looked at both of these trades as pretty close to abject failures....and here's why:  On Tuesday, I was expecting Wed/Thur/Fri to be either neutral, or down days based on the prior few trading sessions. Thursday surprised me by being a fairly strong up day and by the end of the day, I was out of the money on both of these trades. I was incredibly lucky that the market was down today. Had the market stayed neutral (or gone up) I would have lost both of my stocks. I would have generated a taxable event on both of these stocks, and because both of these stocks pay dividends, I would have lost about $270 worth of dividends. This, potentially for me, was a disastrous trade. I got DAMN lucky, and sometimes it's ok if you have just a little bit of luck on your side, but it is ALWAYS better to not need it. The question I ask myself is did I REALLY need to make $285? Could I have \"settled\" for $200? Or $185? Or $100? And the answer is that I could have easily settled for less option premium and less risk that I would have my stock called away. I kind of got cocky and stretched my own trading rules and nearly paid the price. When I do this next week, when I start asking myself questions about my risk/reward, I will likely answer those questions quite differently, and accept slightly less option premium for more comfort that I won't get my options exercised.\n\n2) All of the numbers that I gave you before, regarding my trades really include just my normal option trading strategies on stocks that I hold in my portfolio.....but once in a while, I like to jump out there and have a little bit of fun with what I call a \"FUN\" trade. On 3/24 Boeing was on a bit of a bounce from their low of about $90. Being down from $349 to $90, I see value in BA as long as I'm comfortable that they are not going out of business. So again, on Tuesday with BA at around $120, I jumped out there and sold 4/17 $110 PUTS for $16.00/share. I expected some form of stimulus package from the U.S. Gov't and upside to come. I was fully prepared to own BA at $110 (actually at $94 because I've already received $16 on my PUTS), and I still am if BA should  drop below $110. Well, within 24 hours, the Boeing CEO made a statement that they really don't need the $60 Billion dollars that they wanted entirely for free as long as the Gov't was planning to take an equity stake in the company.....and within two trading sessions, BA was at $180/share on its way to the moon. Now I was prepared to own Boeing at $94 and still will be if it drops below $110 on 4/17.  I could have stepped out there and bought a couple of hundred shares and made quite a bit of money, but that's not my game. I'm prepared to \"settle\" for what I considered a REALLY safe 24 day bet, and if I don't own BA, I can settle for my $1,600/contract. If BA is above $110 but below where it is today, I can potentially lower my cost basis even more by selling another put, or if BA is already past the moon and on its way up to mars, I can happily wave goodbye knowing I already squeezed what I wanted out of it with little to no risk. I use this as an entrance strategy, and truthfully I believe I will own BA before this is all over with and I believe I will own it for less than $90/share.\n\nI will post a snapshot of the trades I made above under my profile and will delete them within 24 hours just so you know I'm not blowing smoke up your ass.\n\nEveryone gets to select their own trading / investing strategy and mine happens to be a very conservative strategy using the most aggressive tools in the industry (options). LOL When I tell people that I trade options and it's \"conservative\", they have a really difficult time getting their heads wrapped around that. I also have friends that believe a 90% success rate with their trades is acceptable so when I say my goal is 100%, again they have a really difficult time with that conceptually. Nobody should ever set their goal to be a loser if you are not...but we all get to select a risk/reward strategy that works best for us.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!",
