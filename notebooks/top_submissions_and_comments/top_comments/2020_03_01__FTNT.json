You often miss out on the gains and only get assigned when the news is significantly worse than you anticipated.

But to be honest, at the time I was prepared for assignment but wasn't really looking forward to it, especially BA.",

Cisco for example, requires you to license anyconnect per user. You need to have the correct number of licenses.\n2. VPN requires hardware encryption and most companies have just remote workers connecting via VPN not the majority of workers.\n\nPalo Alto has something called prisma access that allows companies to use cloud based VPN. Both Palo Alto and Fortinet can run in cloud to expand the VPN capacity.\n\nJust my 2 cents.",
