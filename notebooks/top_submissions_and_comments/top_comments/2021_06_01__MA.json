However those were days when Alibaba was barely making any money compared to present time. Unless there's a political upheaval, it's almost impossible to lose money from a fundamental business perspective given time.

You still got manufactur your goods and those capacity are all in China if you want to be competitive (vendors). Also most of Alibaba business are domestic.\n\nThe downside risk is limited to political uncertainty. Politics are lots of posture for very long and little action.\n\nEdit: Jack Ma not involved with Alibaba much anymore, he steps down as both CEO and Chairman.",
