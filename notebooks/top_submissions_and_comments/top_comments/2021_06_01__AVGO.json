But if anything comes up before then, I can take out money with no penalties and do what I need to do, maybe a down payment on a house one day.\n\nIf there's one thing I wish I did more, was take some risks for high returns. But I don't think now is the time for that. I hate holding a stock with no dividend and just watching it bounce around so I go with dividend payers. \n\nMy positions are: SWKS, LMT, AAPL, CSCO, QCOM, KLIC, INTC, KMI.

        "body": "&gt; Cause their phones failed, they\u2019ve moved onto cyber security and their stock hasn\u2019t adjusted to that change yet.\n\nGonna get downvoted for this because I am going against the hive.... As someone in the cybersecurity field and tracks that space, there is nothing to reflect. BB bought up a mediocre antivirus tool (Cylance) busted their butts to get it on the same playing field as other EDR products (endpoint detection and response, think AV software amped up and without all the false positives) but they are still bottom of the pack (review the Gartner quadrant [here](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/11/gartner-names-microsoft-a-leader-in-the-2021-endpoint-protection-platforms-magic-quadrant/)).\n\n&gt; Similar companies in the industry are priced around $40-60 mark but I think they have a lot more potential imo. \n\nEDR vendors that be competitors to Black Berry are as follows:  \n\n* CrowdStrike - $216\n* SentinelOne - Private Company\n* Microsoft Defender - $245\n* VMware Carbon Black - $159\n* Broadcom Symantec ATP - $23\n* Malwarebytes - Private Company\n* Cisco AMP - $54\n\nWhoever you are listening too on BlackBerry and \"cybersecurity\" needs to do some basic research. The Cylance product (and the functions it brings) they bought is basically dead and has zero room for growth. That is 1/3 of their entire offering. Other services and capabilities by BlackBerry aren't used by large firms any more. Companies like FireEye, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, etc have better IR and forensic services.",

        "body": "Utter nonsense.  If stocks and TA worked so perfectly like that then you may as well buy options straight up and make much more than that, but as everyone with any experience whatsoever knows, they do not work like that.  Up one day, down the next, especially in recent months.  Then to suggest that AVGO is such a candidate defies basic TA.  Serious resistance at 485-490, and every time it hit that it fell hard.  If the general market is weaker, it's likely to get hit sooner.  You can sense the hesitancy in the stock movement the past week.  The trade will still likely succeed, as is the case with any OTM Credit Put Spreads, but the much larger downside isn't worth the limited gain IMO... or at least it's not the easy money you think it is.",
