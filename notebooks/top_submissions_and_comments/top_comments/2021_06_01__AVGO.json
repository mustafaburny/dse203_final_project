Gradually I invested and additional $4K to companies like Microsoft, Google, Nike, Adobe, Boeing, Airbus, Broadcom, T-Mobile, Fedex etc. and a couple of ETFs (SPYD and SPYG). \n\nThis is not an investment advice.

I don't make a whole lot of money so it's a perfect set up for me. I max it out, buy some solid names at good prices and try to hold them.\n\nThe plan is obviously retirement. But if anything comes up before then, I can take out money with no penalties and do what I need to do, maybe a down payment on a house one day.\n\nIf there's one thing I wish I did more, was take some risks for high returns. But I don't think now is the time for that. I hate holding a stock with no dividend and just watching it bounce around so I go with dividend payers. \n\nMy positions are: SWKS, LMT, AAPL, CSCO, QCOM, KLIC, INTC, KMI. A bit tech heavy but I know they will be relevant for years to come.\n\nI also have a problem buying a stock \"early\" and selling it before it really takes off.

As someone in the cybersecurity field and tracks that space, there is nothing to reflect. BB bought up a mediocre antivirus tool (Cylance) busted their butts to get it on the same playing field as other EDR products (endpoint detection and response, think AV software amped up and without all the false positives) but they are still bottom of the pack (review the Gartner quadrant [here](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/11/gartner-names-microsoft-a-leader-in-the-2021-endpoint-protection-platforms-magic-quadrant/)).\n\n&gt; Similar companies in the industry are priced around $40-60 mark but I think they have a lot more potential imo. \n\nEDR vendors that be competitors to Black Berry are as follows:  \n\n* CrowdStrike - $216\n* SentinelOne - Private Company\n* Microsoft Defender - $245\n* VMware Carbon Black - $159\n* Broadcom Symantec ATP - $23\n* Malwarebytes - Private Company\n* Cisco AMP - $54\n\nWhoever you are listening too on BlackBerry and \"cybersecurity\" needs to do some basic research. The Cylance product (and the functions it brings) they bought is basically dead and has zero room for growth. That is 1/3 of their entire offering. Other services and capabilities by BlackBerry aren't used by large firms any more. Companies like FireEye, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, etc have better IR and forensic services.",

If the general market is weaker, it's likely to get hit sooner.  You can sense the hesitancy in the stock movement the past week.

If you do any broad based index fund investing then you are undoubtedly invested in tobacco and alcohol companies.  Tobacco is linked to the 5 leading causes of death in America (likely same in Canada).  Alcohol is related to 50% of all fatal car accidents in America (likely same in Canada).  If you wear sneakers or any type of clothing you would be surprised what type of at best adult and at worst child sweat shops they are made from in third-third world companies. If you like green energy you would be surprised at how much oil is needed to make green energy products.\n\nTrust me NO ONE really can stand on a pedestal in this day in age.  Just matters what you accept and what you choose to not be cognizant of in your daily life.  Running a google search itself consumes energy (carbon footprint).  I doubt you are outside planting trees to make up for it.    \n\nBTW, sticking to this discussion.  How many water wells has Disney (part owner) and Nat Geo dug or paid for in Namibia vs. RECAF?  RECAF cares about making money, but as far as I know they have done more for the Namibian people then Nat Geo does/has despite the latter making millions of their story to sell articles. \n\nThe problem with the green folks is they are ALWAYS hypocritical.  How did those journalist get to Namibia to do the article?  They flew.  Did they plant trees or pay for conversion of methane gases in landfills to make their flights carbon neutral?  Nope.  \n\nJust keep in mind the old adage if you point one finger at someone there are 3 pointing right back at you.",
