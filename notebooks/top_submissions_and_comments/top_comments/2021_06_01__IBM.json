        "body": "Copying and pasting from an earlier conversation I had today:\n\nNvidia has a few CMP HX partner models preparing to launch - these are the mining specific cards. They have no display output which means they can't be used for gaming. Nvidia is also revising ALL current 30 series (except 3090 I believe) to a LHR (light hash rate) version which is a physical difference in the silicon. They are doing this to nerf ETH mining performance on their 30 series cards at the hardware level.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's CMP HX mining cards make no economic sense to mine on since they are way less power efficient, and have no resale value since they can't be used for gaming. However, if Nvidia completely locks down ETH hash rate on the 30 series, they can increase their TAM by preventing miners from cannibalizing their gaming sales. So far, the CMP HX cards look like they are built on 10 series architecture so they will be able to be produced cheaper and in parallel to 30 series.\n\nLastly, the ARM deal seems to be moving along. Qualcomm has voiced concerns and said they are ready to invest in ARM as a partner if the Nvidia deal falls through. Nvidia says it has 3 other silicon manufacturers who support the Nvidia deal but details aren't known yet. Nvidia's recent rise is likely due to the probability of the ARM deal actually becoming more likely.\n\nIn case you dont understand why the ARM deal is good for NVDA, it means that all ARM-based chip manufacturers are beholden to NVDA. ARM is the most dominant CPU architecture for all mobile CPUs including micro controllers in other devices. Apple, qualcomm, samsung, amd, intel, huawei, IBM all have ARM licenses\n\nIt allows NVDA to penetrate the mobile market. Nvidia has the highest profit margins on their mobile CPUs because they don't have to rely on partners to distribute chunky desktop cards. They sell the silicon directly. Every iphone and samsung galaxy could have an Nvidia-produced CPU and GPU.\n\nThe reason ARM is used for mobile is because of its power efficiency. If Nvidia knows what they are doing (they do) then they know how they can use their proprietary access to ARM to create ultra performant and efficient server chips, feeding into their datacenter revenue.\n\nNvidia has announced plans to enter the server CPU market. When they announced this, Intel and AMD stock tanked 5% or so. My bet is that they are already working with ARM to deliver their CPU server chips\n\nTL;DR - ARM deal going through would make NVDA pull a page out of 2020 TSLA's book. Downside is ARM deal delays, pricing in approval then having it get denied. Would crush the stock.",

        "body": "TGT: Consumer staples are among the most defensive stocks on the market, and that tends to hold true with their dividends. While Target's dividend is currently not very competitive, I believe overtime that it will become more dominant. Target provides basically the same service as Walmart, but attracts higher wage earners than Walmart, resulting in higher profit margins. Target is also ahead of the fight for 15, having already committed to raising employee wages to 15 dollars an hour across the board. This has not stopped Target from shattering it's earnings Estimates every quarter since the start of the pandemic. There's no reason not to think that Target won't grow it's dividend overtime as it matures.\n\nPFE: Pfizer has a dividend yield of 3.83% compared to its market median of 2.26%. The company has steady revenue for a while with the demand for covid vaccines still rampant abroad, and the eventual need for booster shots will give them additional revenue. In addition, the company is situated to handle it's short and long term debts. \n\nIBM: Controversial company due to the fact that it recently quietly laid off its older workforce, some would argue a necessary evil in a tech company that needed to adapt. Having said that, IBM is a rare tech stock with a high dividend yield. While many would prefer tech stocks reinvest their earnings, IBM is a mature company that likely would not fully benefit from future reinvestment at this point.  IBM currently has a dividend yield of 4.36. IMO this stock is worth holding long term for the Quantum Computing potential alone, as IBM is working on Quantum Computers that while not currently applicable, have applications that can potentially increase productivity tenfold in the future, and thus would be massively profitable. This is a long shot, as other companies are working on such computers, but still significant upside nonetheless. \n\nCNQ: Did a DD on this stock [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nx2scl/cnq\\_dd\\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nx2scl/cnq_dd_analysis/)\n\nAFL: Safety is an important component of dividend stocks, and Life/Health Insurance is one of the safest industries out there. There will always be a demand for insurance products, and stocks like Aflac that are underpriced can make for great conservative investments as well. With a 2.35% dividend yield in a defensive industry, this stock is a safe bet to raise its dividend in the future. It also currently trades at a PE ratio of 7.22, which is very reasonable this day and age and undervalued from its earnings. The stock has been earning at a PE ratio of about 10, suggesting the stock is undervalued by 40%",
