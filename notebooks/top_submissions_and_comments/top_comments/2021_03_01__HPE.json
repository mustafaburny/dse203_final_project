So, we could assume the same was happening with other brokers. At the same time, I know that at least TDA isn't allowing short selling of GME at all (was on the phone with them the other day, and the guy told me they haven't allowed it since the end of January).\n\nStill, the price has not only held, but risen pretty significantly today. I'm having a hard time seeing the downside to continuing to hold, I just don't think it's a wise thing to sell at this point. The gamma squeeze seems like it'll happen, the short squeeze is likely too. And even if it's not, the company is pivoting and may become a big player in the years to come. All those things are why I will keep holding.\n\nAt the same time, if you haven't covered your initial investment, please do so. I sold off enough at the end of January to pay off almost $50k of CC debt and to have a bit leftover to provide for me and my kids. Now I'm playing with house money, so it's easier for me to weather the dips.\n\nI'm holding 307 shares @ \\~$70 per share. I also have a 17 calls for different dates.",

You should do your own research, read the DD, and make informed decisions. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.\n\nIn other words, fuck safely, or you'll get fucked.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060There is no \"we.\"\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I'm holding because that's my choice. I believe in GME\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I will not buy because someone else says to do so\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I will not encourage others to buy\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Nothing I say is financial advice\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060If you're confused, read the rules. No market manipulation.\n\nReport posts that encourage everyone to buy at the same time. The primary reason for this is legal, but the secondary is that the media will cherry-pick comments like this to give us a bad name and put more negativity out there through their articles, broadcasts, etc.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060There will be plenty of FUD (or \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\")\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I am including this out of belief, if not pure spite\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060There are redditors being paid to scare you\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060There are bots made to SPAM negativity\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060There are people profiting when you sell\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060This starts ramping up in the afternoon\n\nThere are two sides to this fight, and we have to remember that there are people profiting if we fail. There are people playing the other side who will come into the thread and try to throw us off track by ruining the morale. We mustn't give in to them. Besides, they can't even provide any good DD for their bear-case, it's all just \"sElL iT's OvEr.\"\n\n\u2022\t\u2060This is the motherfucking GME Megathread\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Do not push other tickers\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Do not jingle keys in our faces\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Fuck you\n\nI, personally, go out of my way to CTRL/CMD+F and search for other tickers. If you're bringing up non-GME stocks in order to distract the thread, I'm one of the downvotes on your comment. Sue me.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060We can fucking do this\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060We have them where we want them\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060We can name our price\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060As long as we hold, we have what they want\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060They will pay out the ass to get it\n\nThey'll do whatever they can (manipulate the market, short the stock further, short EFTs, etc.) for as long as they can manage, all hoping we'll give up and sell (Hell, they've even tried to bore us to death). But they don't understand just how dumb we really are. We are far too stupid to be afraid of their fearmongering, and we'll hold 'til the moon.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060If you're new, this may not be for you\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060This is something you have to be really brave or really stupid for\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060You will either see enormous gains or enormous losses\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Invest wisely, don't spend your rent money, and read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060DD is short for Due Diligence, and it's basically just researching a stock before you buy in. There's plenty of great DD on this sub, and you can sort by the DD flair to see the highest-voted posts. Do that before asking dumb questions and risking your karma.\n\nIf you think there's anything else I should add, please reply and tell me.",

The best time to buy GME was 2 months ago, the second best time is NOW.\n3. Buy shares, not options. Invest only the money you can afford to lose.\n4. Don't fall for FUD. Any account can be a shill/bot, even the ones created before January. They are PAYING users to spread fear and enroll you to post negative comments/posts.\n5. GME has been and will always be the only play. Anything else is a distraction to limit the impact GME can have. (Yes, even RKT). Never will the planets align this perfectly again to trigger the biggest short squeeze of your lifetime.\n6. The most important point : Don't sell. Supply and demand : you have something they want, we all do. So YOU set the price you want. And the price can actually go up to infinity. This is going to be the biggest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen, don't ruin it being a paper hand and selling low.\n7. Hold. Hold. Hold. Selling at 1k is trolling. They want you to sell at 1k, that's why they keep spamming comments saying they put stop limits at 1k. 1k is lowball. 1k could just be a gamma squeeze. 10k is lowball.\n8. As stated by u/Polihanna, the squeeze will last multiple days. Don't be afraid that it lasts a few seconds and you'll miss it. You won't. \n9. Don't day-trade GME. It's extremely volatile, and you actually help them by selling shares that they can buy for cheap. You delay the squeeze and reduce its impact if you day-trade.\n10. THIS IS NOT A GAME OF GREED. IT IS A GAME OF TRUST.",
