Biggest holding being Lockheed, United Tech, Boeing at around 15% a piece the rest of the companies are around 5% of holdings. \n\nIt is a 3X\u2019s ETF and was sitting between $60-$70 before crash currently at $10 if you believe defense/aerospace will make a comeback eventually you can get good exposure through it. I don\u2019t believe it will hit previous highs unless Boeing gets there shit as it is a larger holding but I do believe most holdings are extremely oversold and even through just buying shares you can easily net 75-100% return due to 3X\u2019s exposure.",
