All companies are government backed for the most part and have very little chance of failing especially if tensions continue to rise with this \u201cwas it made in a lab or wasn\u2019t it\u201d deal going on or if another country tries to take advantage of the Covid situation. \n\nDFEN holds Lockheed, United tech (not airline), Boeing, General Dynamics, Teledyne, L3 Harris, Northrop Grumman, Trasdigm group, Raytheon, Huntington Ingralls. Biggest holding being Lockheed, United Tech, Boeing at around 15% a piece the rest of the companies are around 5% of holdings. \n\nIt is a 3X\u2019s ETF and was sitting between $60-$70 before crash currently at $10 if you believe defense/aerospace will make a comeback eventually you can get good exposure through it. I don\u2019t believe it will hit previous highs unless Boeing gets there shit as it is a larger holding but I do believe most holdings are extremely oversold and even through just buying shares you can easily net 75-100% return due to 3X\u2019s exposure.",
