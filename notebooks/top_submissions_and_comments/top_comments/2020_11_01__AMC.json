At one time they were one of the top five largest companies in the US (By market cap).  \n\nBy contrast, AMC is a \"micro cap\" company with a market cap of $393M. In other words, Pfizer is almost 1000 times larger than AMC. Red Robin has a $277M market cap. The hotel chain Marriott has a $38B market cap; much, much larger than AMC or Red Robin, but still about 1/8th that of Pfizer. \n\nFurthermore, Restaurants, theaters and hotels have lost HUGE chunks of business due to the pandemic, whereas Pfizer has lost virtually zero business due to the pandemic.  Once a vaccine starts becoming used by the public those restaurants, hotels, theaters (and casinos and airlines, too) are going to get much of that business back, whereas, it will only represent a small amount of Pfizer's total business.",

With that amount, you can buy est 6.9 shares of SCHD, or 49.25 shares of Ford, or 3.5 shares of VOOV, or 138 shares of AMC. You get the idea.

Think about how simple that is. \n\nAnd now process the reality that the survival of AMC Theatres relies on the successful implementation and distribution of vaccinations throughout the country which will need to be actively given and received by the same people who are unable to wear a mask. \n\nThe people that don\u2019t want to wear a mask will need to actively seek out a vaccination center, wait patiently for a vaccination, allow the government or healthcare system to administer a painful vaccination, feel ill for a day or so, and then go on with their lives while still following social distancing and mask wearing. \n\nThese are the people who can\u2019t literally take a piece of cloth and put it on their face for a few minutes or hours a day. \n\nNot to mention there\u2019s the anti-vaxxers, the anti-being the first ones to get the vaccination, the anti-government people, etc. \n\nThe reason AMC is attractive is because there is a ton of upside. They could go to the moon. But realize that\u2019s literally because they are in the bottom of bottoms right now. With your logic, every company on the verge of bankruptcy could theoretically be a great investment if the perfect convergence of circumstances leads to rescue. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t gamble. So no, I\u2019m not buying AMC.",

I just monitor the overall market's performance and individual companies' performance in industry I know decently well. I wait until there is an obvious buy - I don't search for it. I wait until it presents itself. Which sometimes is months, sometimes is years. Periods of volatility thrust a ton of these obvious opportunities at me. Usually these opportunities are clear when I've noticed that the majority of the market is on the brink of fear and trepidation, yet the fundamentals are still there. \n\nSome Examples: \n\n* Boeing at 88 dollars a share in march. I've bought Boeing at 5 separate dips and come out ahead each time. \n* AMC theaters. bought at the dip. came out ahead.\n* Delta. bought at the dip. came out ahead.\n* Boston Scientific in 2009. 4 dollars a share. seriously?
