All the talk and hype is about vehicle production and FSD but it's the batteries themselves that I'm seeing huge potential in. It's not just home solar and battery backup. They're also getting into grid backup. It's right there in the company mission statement: \"To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\"\n\nCars are just where they get started. The push to develop new battery technology, drive down costs and ramp up production of cells will have major ripple-effects of a world where massive energy storage is cheap and plentiful.\n\nVehicle production for Tesla in the future is going to look like book sales for Amazon. Google used to be just a search page. Apple used to just make computers. West coast tech companies tend to grow and develop far beyond their initial paths for profitability. So if you're looking for a reason why TSLA is still cheap there you go. Any comparisons to GM/Ford/VW/Toyota is like still comparing Amazon to Barnes and Noble or Apple to Hewlett-Packard.",

Instead of selling a vertical spread each month, I often will buy a put with a longer DTE (90-120 days, let's say Delta 20) and then sell a put with a shorter DTE (30-60 days and higher Delta). Then over time, I will continually close / roll the short put positions, essentially recycling the long put again and again to keep the reduced margin requirements for a spread. \n\nIn an evolution of this strategy, I often buy and sell the puts at different times. In times of low volatility or on green days I will try to buy puts, and I do that first. Then if the market goes down and volatility increases, I will sell puts. BUT if the market goes down far enough, I'll just sell the put that I bought instead of putting a spread on. \n\nClear as mud? It's hard to be specific with so much variability in the markets. Generally, I use this strategy on more stable / boring companies (VZ, HPQ, T for example)",
