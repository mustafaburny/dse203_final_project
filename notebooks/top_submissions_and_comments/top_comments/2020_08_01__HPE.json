        "body": "[This link](https://www.dogsofthedow.com/djdelete.htm) has all the Dow changes. It does have a habit of sell low and buy high though, some examples: \n\n- Microsoft replaced Chevron in November 1999. Over the next 5 years, $MSFT was down 50% and $CVX up 25%. Microsoft eventually redeemed itself, but not after putting its shareholders underwater for 13 years.\n- Chevron reentered Dow on Feb 19 2008, 120% higher than November 1999, replacing **Honeywell**. Since then, $CVX is up ~50%, dividends included; $HON 300% higher. **Honeywell reentered Dow today.**\n- Also on Feb 19 2008, Dow replaced Altria with Bank of America. You should all know what happened to $BAC over the next year. $MO is up 300% after being booted from the Dow.\n- AIG replaced International Paper in April 2004. $IP is a lousy company indeed and has only gained about 60% since then, but $AIG got obliterated during the GFC and was booted from Dow on September 22 2008 after suffering 95% loss.\n\n------------\n\nDow has also done many things very right, such as:\n\n- Replace Woolworth with Wal-Mart in 1997\n- Replace Sears with Home Depot in 1999, although $HD actually underperformed Sears until at least 2008 \n- Replace Kodak with Pfizer in 2004, Kodak went bankrupt in 2012\n- Replace Kraft with UnitedHealthcare in 2012\n- Replace Alcoa with Nike and Hewlett-Packard with Visa in 2013\n- Replace AT&amp;T with Apple in 2015",

Ironically, buying that option blew out my buying power for the day, or I would have short-strangled ULTA and gotten my ass handed to me yet again this morning.\n\nI also dabbled in a few other longs: SLV 26c, HPE 9p and TNA 9/4 36. None of that shit is working out. The TSLA 2300c FD made a profit simply because I saw it went green and took my money back; if I held ten minutes more, I would have taken a loss.  \n\nI don't know what it is, but every long position I have ever taken since I started dabbling in 2005 has turned to shit. This serves as yet another a reminder to stick with what works for me, even when I have to take a big fat L.\n\nI am become Theta, destroyer of profits.\n\nEnding the week, I am down 22% of my account value. It puts me at 60% up for the year, and a little over 100% since abandoning bear ways in April.\n\nI need a drink.",

If you have employees who are not bringing you competitive AMD EPYC 7002 quotes along with Xeon quotes, then they are not doing their jobs getting competitive bids. In a world where AMD only has a 0-20% performance edge, that would not be the case. Instead, AMD\u2019s price and performance is closer to 2x. Even for many corporate contracts with large IT vendors like Dell and HPE where putting volume against certain SKUs yields discounts, the AMD EPYC 7742 can have a big enough impact that renders those discounts not attractive. This is especially so with use-cases such as general virtualization platforms where AMD can consolidate multiple mainstream Xeon sockets into each EPYC 7742 socket. If Intel is competing on price and selling what it has, great. If you are not evaluating EPYC 7742 or other SKUs in their stack, then you are not doing your organization justice.",

I think INTC is undervalued right now, but they need to change their perception in among the general public. Probably sinking a lot of money into marketing is the way to go.",

You'll be hearing from them for the rest of your life. You can leave a similar message with HPE, Lenovo on their servers marketing / ordering pages.\n\nNone of what they send you is going to be privileged info. IT depts at massive companies like MSFT, AMZN \\*will\\* get glimpses of NDA hardware that won't be shown publicly for a year, however, and trading on that is illegal.\n\nI just paid attention to them pushing AMD servers towards the top when Intel has always been in bed with Dell (and still is, with Dell keeping AMD out of their premium laptops despite FAR better performance, heat, and power use). When a company that's famously in bed with Intel to the point that it was part of Intel's antitrust a long time ago pushes AMD, its a sign of bad things coming for Intel.",

Dell owns VMWare, yet companies like HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro also pushes their product. Hermann also wants Arm to be purchased partially by the GB government (to keep it in the UK) to go public, which isn't likely at all.\n\nI think the best argument against the acquisition would be government approvals, which could be a real issue, as NVIDIA is an US company, and many Chinese companies use Arm design.",

        "body": "This deal is so odd to me. TikTok is a social media platform that is shrowd with controversy (Microsoft isn't keen on such) with it being banned in some countries, government agencies and companies demanding it be removed immediately off work devices and also flogged as Chinese spyware. So it's a murky deal going in but a popular app nonetheless.\n\nThis would have made SOME sense if we were in 2014 with Windows Phone. Microsoft since 2015 has shed itself from their previous consumer offerings such as Groove Music, W10M and Phones, MSN Health+Fitness and HealthVault, as well as canning almost all of the physical retail stores that were recently oriented towards (very) SMB customers as that was actually where a chunk of sales were legit coming from. \n\nMicrosoft's growth the past few years and ESPECIALLY recently has been dominant with the enterprise and SMB sectors. Consumer products and services aren't where Satya is focused on much at all. Like, Surface nearly was on the chopping block in 2014 if it wasn't a knock out it turned out to be. And to this day, they're focusing on doing what Dell and HPE do with enterprise oriented hardware sales as again, larger revenue streams than consumer.\n\nXbox is obviously their main consumer product and service that is a bright spot here. LinkedIn is more or less a service internally at Microsoft we don't know how money is made off the platform (and also doubles as our job listings board internally that we didn't need to build up from scratch). Not a social media platform really though. Microsoft has dabbled in projects like SoCl before where it was a Pinterest style platform.\n\nThis buyout, I don't unterstand where the tie in could be. As we did with Skype, it got rebranded as Lync for many years and Skype still is around for consumers but included with Office 365. I just don't see where they can realistically add this into an existing service or product to enhance an offering. It very much makes me think this is a foreray into social media, which...ok? If they are doing that, what a weird time to that. Microsoft has a stance of privacy focus and if this gets used for marketing and advertising, that negates a bit of that perceived trust people have with Microsoft. We really don't have a good advertising platform in part due to us not going so hardcore with connecting user data dots across people's devices like Google and Facebook do.\n\nI'm also wondering if Microsoft is trying to play the savior role and being the reason it's not banned in the US, I guess it'll score them brownie points. It'll possibly outshine Snap with SnapChat and stick it to them for being the reason in part Windows Phone failed to grow as Snap refused to even bother with Microsoft. It'll also possibly demonstrate to the tech industry that YES, you can have a social media site that people trust as it's not invading every God damn aspect of that user's life and still monetize it well. They like looking like the noble red herrings PR wise.",

        "body": "While AWS and Azure offer the same on-premise tools and capabilities that customers can use for hybrid cloud - like ML, containers, VMs, etc - neither company (or Google) specializes in the actual hardware for computer, networking, and storage that is required for an on-premise solution. Yes, AWS Outposts is dipping their toe into the water on hardware. But they won\u2019t be offering the full range of hardware products that a Dell or HPE can. As much as people talk about convergence to the \u201ccloud\u201d, this is often very over-simplified as computing/storage needs are not monolithic and are totally dependent on the customer and workloads. \n\nIn most scenarios in which you choose AWS or Azure Stack for example, you still need a Dell or HPE frame, box, etc. to run your private cloud. HPE GreenLake runs on top of both AWS and Azure, so they aren\u2019t necessarily mutually exclusive anyway. GreenLake is a force multiplying service in that it also offloads management of the hybrid cloud estate to HPE. Companies continue to struggle with hybrid cloud requirements, I.e. using similar tools across different environments or understanding how to provision workloads most efficiently. HPE shows GreenLake customers the best way to do this based on cost, governance, performance, security, and other factors. That saves customers money and computing resources. Sure, Azure is subscription-based and pay-per-use as well. But if the customer doesn\u2019t know how to efficiently provision on-premise resources given those factors above they won\u2019t realize the cost-savings. \n\nEven more, over 80% of public cloud users are using a multicloud strategy (according to Gartner). GreenLake provides multicloud customers a singularly unified management interface to integrate data and workloads across multiple cloud environments (AWS and Azure) which is not something that Amazon or Microsoft can offer. We tend to think of the cloud as this thing that just runs in the background and makes data storage and application performance better. But there are huge IT staffing and CAPEX costs associated with managing these resources and getting the most out of them. And for companies needing to scale compute resources up or down on a regular basis, GreenLake can de-risk these decisions while also freeing up IT resources for other requirements. \n\nThe ability of HPE to bundle hardware, management, and services brings overall cost down and customers can end up getting more than they would with just AWS or Azure for a competitive price (and 20-30% lower compared to the public cloud offerings). Additionally, applications and data consumption is moving away from centralized compute (public cloud) and to the edge. Increasingly companies will be bundling edge networking and management services into their GreenLake subscription alongside the private cloud requirements. And again, this is not something that is offered by Amazon or Microsoft. They are in edge computing through AWS Lamda and Azure Edge but that\u2019s not a direct competitor. \n\nWhen you look at the fact that GreenLake has over 700 customers and a 99% retention rate, in addition to order growth of 82% year-over-year, I think the evidence is pretty strong that there is a unique value proposition and demand. If standalone hybrid offerings from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud were already eliminating the need for this service, I don\u2019t think we would be seeing that level of growth and retention.",
