Of course, they may implement some cyber security best practices for your billing data and stuff like that but ISPs don't encrypt customer data.\n\nSource: worked for one.\n\nAdditionally, to answer OP question: You should consider looking at large IT solutions providers. For example CDW. \n\nDD: companies and the public sector are currently developing plans to support remote work long term. This takes time. Many of them, especially public sector, will rely on large managed services providers and solutions providers like CDW. We may start seeing those contracts finalized and reflected on the balance sheets during Q2 earning seasons. Also worth looking at microsoft azure ans amazon AWS as long term value generators for companies.\n\nTL;DR: ISPs don't protect your traffic.  \nLEAPS on MSFT,AMZN, CDW and similar.",

They will sell more VPN licenses, bigger firewalls, VPN concentrators and load balancers, but again - this will be offset by slowdown in sales in other areas. Their products that are more geared towards endpoint management (like Umbrella) are going to see a rise, but they are  small and inexpensive compared to the real money makers in other line ups.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think you need to look at peripheral manufacturers, cloud document management companies, remote support tools providers, distributed workforce management, time keeping and monitoring vendors. Also places like CDW and other big resellers with own warehouses are probably doing well.",
