Or will you blow it up trying for that new comma?\nIf you can turn 1k to 10k\nAnd 10k to 100k.\nYou can turn 100k to 1m.\nJust trade exactly the same way from each checkpoint. Take gains along the way to pat yourself on the back, but stay focused.\n\nThe trick is learning how to keep the money. Keeping the money is HARD, much harder than making it. Along your trading journey, you will encounter a lot of very very very tempting tempting scenarios. It\u2019s up to you to jump into these scenarios and if the risk is worth it for you. If you accept the risk, remain patient, and execute your trading plan (very important to have a plan for every single options trade) regardless of market conditions, you will win.\n\nYou also win by doing nothing. Patience is key!\n\nDid you just blow your account up last week? Feeling like shit? Been there 6-7 times myself. If you like trading, because you\u2019re a degenerate autistic fuck like myself, or just because you enjoy doing it and see it as a way to become independent, then keep at it. Learn from the L.\n\nAccumulate tiny Ws. Base hits. Tony Gwynn those trades. Don\u2019t Griffey Jr. the trades. If you keep hitting singles and stop trying to juice up for a homerun every trade, you\u2019ll live to battle another day. Then when you see CONVICTION BUY opportunities (another story about what those are) you swing for the fences.\n\ngod damn I\u2019m stoned as fuck\n\nI swung for the fences Thursday when i saw Tesla break the 8D MA. Hit a fucking GRAND SLAM\n\nWrong one \n\nThis is the right one https://i.imgur.com/ogZW3Yj.jpg",

Bitcoin will either continue to rip up exponentially higher than it has previously done all whilst having major corrections thereafter but at the same time being exponentially higher than the previous correction or it will just all go to zero. My bet is on the former - based off adoption (look up visa, MasterCard, office of comptroller allowing bank custody, fidelity digital assets, CashApp/square, etc..... ) as well as metcalfes law (there\u2019s more bitcoin wallets today than ever before , there\u2019s more people holding fractions of bitcoin and only goes up every single day), as well as the defining features/properties of hard money and the current currency debasement going on with the US dollar . Add all this shit together and that\u2019s reason enough for me. \n\nI\u2019m never expecting bitcoin price to be similar to growth stocks. If anything it mimics precious metals pretty closely , the only difference in the huge ass swings and volatility between the two? It\u2019s only a $299 billion market. This tells me there\u2019s tons of room to grow before it starts acting less volatile like the giant and battle tested markets like precious metals",

(do not put all your eggs in one basket).\n\nDo not sell out of fear if your stock loses 20%... if you have made an investment plan stick to it, if you've invested in good strong businesses that 20% will bounce back! let the day traders get on with it, sit back and let your money grow for you....

For example, ECL is not a growth stock, it is a value stock that has undergone high price appreciation but only modest revenue growth. That is the opposite of a good growth buy.\n\nAlso, by typical growth stock metrics (e.g. market cap/revenue ratio), both V and MA are very expensive. Contrast, for example, with AMZN which has both a higher growth rate and is much less expensive relative to fundamentals. If AMZN was valued like MA as a growth stock, its price would be north of $10k/share. (AMZN only looks \"cheap\" relative to most other growth stocks; in absolute terms it is probably in the ballpark of being correctly priced.)",

Keep hustling and saving and you\u2019ll be able to retire earlier than most.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know much about investing, you should definitely learn before investing any money. It is easy to lost your money if you aren\u2019t careful. Youtube is a great place to learn. I like sending people to Andrei Jikh\u2019s channel to learn how to invest. He is more focused on dividend stocks, while I think that growth stocks are better. Most people on YouTube aren\u2019t too bad.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much you should trust redditors (probably not at all), but if you do decide to, here is my opinion.\n\nI think for young people, growth stocks and ETFs are best. Here are some good stocks IMO.\n\nLarge/Mega Cap Growth Stocks: AMZN, MSFT, ADBE, LULU, NFLX, PYPL, MA, NVDA, TSLA (be careful w/ TSLA).\n\nSmall/Medium Cap Growth Stocks: LOGI, SQ, TTD, SE, LVGO, CHGG, NET, AMD.\n\nGrowth ETFs: QQQ, WCLD, QCLN, TAN, all of the ARK ETFs.\n\nIf you are OK with risk, Bitcoin could be an interesting buy, but don\u2019t make it more than 10% of your portfolio and make sure you know if you actually own the Bitcoin.\n\nNote that this is my opinion. These are all growth stocks/ETFs, which carry more risk but pose a higher return. If you want something more safe, invest in SPY.\n\nMake sure to do your own DD (due diligence) and research to make sure you are OK with investing in a stock.\n\nMy absolute favorite stocks on this list are MSFT, ADBE, NVDA, TSLA, LOGI, SQ, and ARKK.",

The amount of times I\u2019ve seen comments like \u201cV &amp; MA will do well during COVID because people won\u2019t be able to pay their credit card bills\u201d is astonishing. I\u2019m convinced that this sub is invested in the two companies because everyone has a Visa or Mastercard-branded credit card in their wallet.  \n\nVisa\u2019s revenue is basically split between three business segments: Service Revenue, Data Processing Revenue, and International Transaction Revenue.\n\n- Service Revenue is revenue from services provided to support client usage of Visa's payment services.\n\n- Data Processing Revenue includes all revenue generated as a result of the company's clearing, settlement, authorization, network access and similar services.\n\n- International Transaction Revenue includes cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion.\n\nIn addition, most people on this sub sleep on PayPal, and it\u2019s purely based on the echo chamber effect. I think PayPal has an incredible future lined up with a very diverse set of products and services ranging from payment processing, peer-to-peer (Venmo), consumer credit and business loans.",

For example, ECL is not a growth stock, it is a value stock that has undergone high price appreciation but only modest revenue growth. That is the opposite of a good growth buy.\n\nAlso, by typical growth stock metrics (e.g. market cap/revenue ratio), both V and MA are very expensive. Contrast, for example, with AMZN which has both a higher growth rate and is much less expensive relative to fundamentals. If AMZN was valued like MA as a growth stock, its price would be north of $10k/share. (AMZN only looks \"cheap\" relative to most other growth stocks; in absolute terms it is probably in the ballpark of being correctly priced.)",

        "body": "Great question. This idea that the price will always reflect the best possible guess at the value of the underlying isn't mine. It's [a 50 year old, well established framework that has shown to be true except in rare, anomalous conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis). So we need to figure out how, not if, it applies.\n\nYou've also made a critical assumption that we need to call out. Your assumption is that crossing this 7 day moving average is a real signal. Anybody seeing it, human or algo, should exploit it. I'm cool with that, but we need to call it out as an assumption.\n\nHere's how I venture things would play out under that assumption. The price is rising, crossing the 7 day moving average. The algo can see this. It's faster than you and has incredibly deep pockets. So the price crosses the 7 day MA and \"Bang\" the algo triggers. Buy buy buy. The price rises rapidly. What stops it? Not the pockets of the algo. It's actually the risk-adjusted value of the underlying. Suddenly (and I do mean suddenly, it would only take seconds) the thing has become appropriately valued based on crossing that moving average. More buyers come in (as the crossing predicted would happen), driving up the price, but again the algo is prepared and ready to sell to them. From *your* perspective, the chart went straight up vertical to the appropriate price, then straight horizontal after. From the algo's perspective, it's making money on the bid/ask spread as it sells to the masses of incoming buyers that were guaranteed to come after crossing the 7 day moving average.\n\nWhy don't we really see this? Because your original assumption, while interesting, isn't the only effect in the market, and most trends aren't followed 100% of the time. The algos do exist and have billions to throw around every day though, so they'll invest just enough to absorb any predictable upcoming trend and sell/buy to exit their position pocketing the spread. It's end-game level AI, but we're already there for financial market predictions. Have been for a few years now.",

        "body": "I\u2019m going to reiterate my [MRK](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hkpyve/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of_july/fww5ouh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) comment with some additional research. \n\nFirst off, there\u2019s currently a huge [shortage ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) of HIV meds where basically what happened is part supply chain disrupt, but also the two drugs they were using proved to be ineffective for HIV patients because of covid. Something about them is no longer working. \n\nSecondly, MRK\u2019s press release for their phase 3 trial of [Islatravir](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) is set to begin soon after their presentation at the AIDS 2020 virtual divulging that the Phase 2b results proved that their drug has higher efficacy and safety from the analyses. \n\nThirdly, MRK has a proven track record for putting up great [earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-earnings-surprise-streak-could-161004767.html), and most analysts are bullish already about them for their earnings coming out 7/31. And will be even more so in the near future thanks to their EIDD-2801 exclusive rights from RidgeBack Therapeutics for an antiviral for covid until others produce a sustainable vaccine, and more so because they\u2019ll likely make up the shortage for HIV meds with current meds and their upcoming Islatravir. \n\nFuthermore, MRK just got [FDA approval](https://www.mrknewsroom.com/newsroom/news-releases/news-details/2020/FDA-Approves-Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-First-Line-Treatment-of-Patients-With-Unresectable-or-Metastatic-MSI-H-or-dMMR-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx) to use Keytruda for first-line colon cancer. Which will only drive their earnings. \n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t share the seeking A article, but it goes into further detail about why antivirals will be very important in the coming months since vaccines are still projected to be at least 6 months out, if not longer. If you want to see the SA article just google \u201cAntivirals Rather Than Vaccines for COVID-19\u201d\n\nAlso, the EIDD-2801 candidate they have rights to from RidgeBack is currently in quite a few trials, but one of the more pertinent one is in South Africa where they\u2019re needing 50 HIV positive people to see if it can help prevent covid in them, but also they\u2019re secretly hoping by sheer luck that the same drug can help manage HIV at the same time it prevents covid. \n\nSticking with my originals 7/31 $85-$90c, and 10/16 $90-$95, but I\u2019ll also add 1/21 $100-$105c since there are many analysts setting $100+ fair values for eoy.\n\nEdit: TL;DR\u2014 MRK $85+ calls cause they make the good drugs for bad things and it make printer go brrrrrrrr.",

Something about them is no longer working. \n\nSecondly, MRK\u2019s press release for their phase 3 trial of [Islatravir](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) is set to begin soon after their presentation at the AIDS 2020 virtual divulging that the Phase 2b results proved that their drug has higher efficacy and safety from the analyses. \n\nThirdly, MRK has a proven track record for putting up great [earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-earnings-surprise-streak-could-161004767.html), and most analysts are bullish already about them for their earnings coming out 7/31. And will be even more so in the near future thanks to their EIDD-2801 exclusive rights from RidgeBack Therapeutics for an antiviral for covid until others produce a sustainable vaccine, and more so because they\u2019ll likely make up the shortage for HIV meds with current meds and their upcoming Islatravir. \n\nFuthermore, MRK just got [FDA approval](https://www.mrknewsroom.com/newsroom/news-releases/news-details/2020/FDA-Approves-Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-First-Line-Treatment-of-Patients-With-Unresectable-or-Metastatic-MSI-H-or-dMMR-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx) to use Keytruda for first-line colon cancer. Which will only drive their earnings. \n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t share the seeking A article, but it goes into further detail about why antivirals will be very important in the coming months since vaccines are still projected to be at least 6 months out, if not longer. If you want to see the SA article just google \u201cAntivirals Rather Than Vaccines for COVID-19\u201d\n\nAlso, the EIDD-2801 candidate they have rights to from RidgeBack is currently in quite a few trials, but one of the more pertinent one is in South Africa where they\u2019re needing 50 HIV positive people to see if it can help prevent covid in them, but also they\u2019re secretly hoping by sheer luck that the same drug can help manage HIV at the same time it prevents covid. \n\nSticking with my originals 7/31 $85-$90c, and 10/16 $90-$95, but I\u2019ll also add 1/21 $100-$105c since there are many analysts setting $100+ fair values for eoy.\n\nEdit: TL;DR\u2014 MRK $85+ calls cause they make the good drugs for bad things and it make printer go brrrrrrrr.",

        "body": "Reposting one of my comments from another thread (with some slight changes to be particularly relevant to answer OP):\n\nThe Reddit popular \"Pandemic Bull Tech Thesis\" is just parroting of a nonsensical idea that world's populous has permanently altered their habits (be it in the form of individual consumption or in business practices) in the last 4 months thus justifying the valuations of companies that were likely already trading at lofty sums pre-crash.\n\nThe \\*only\\* way you can justify this narrative is if you believe the world isn't heading (further) into a deep recession for the next 1-3 years and that the new normal is simply a reorienting of pre-COVID level spending and consumption toward these few \"tech titans\".\n\nIf you decide to buy into this sand castle story of infinite tech growth, ask yourself...\n\nWhy have Zoom's execs been dumping their stock during its COVID run?\n\nHas Apple sold more iPhones since March YOY (and will people have the disposable income to continue to buy Apple products for the next year)?\n\nIs NVIDIA really worth more than Intel now at 1/7th their revenues?\n\nIs Netflix, a company that isn't profitable, worth more today with the increasing competition in the streaming space?\n\nIs Shopify with an estimated PEG of above 20 (when anything above 1 is considered over valued) going to sustain it's current price with massive earnings while we're in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression?\n\nIs Facebook losing its biggest advertisers bullish?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Tesla... \\*bUt iT's a BaTtErY sTaRt-Up\\*\n\nIt's hard to believe so many people are justifying these company's valuations based on this idea that the companies themselves somehow represent the next major technological revolution. An expanded product line of shiny computers and reality TV-show streaming aren't something to be counted on for unlimited upward stock movements nor is it something to celebrate as the dazibao of 21st century progress.",

I believe it has room to grow further but that\u2019s 2-3 years down the line with Giga Berlin and second China factory or US factory up and running, what we have had in the past week is shorts covering and day traders trying to jump on a bandwagon .\n\nMSFT is still cheap for their potential\nAAPL is on the 5G super cycle \nNVDA and AMD are buyable as well as they have room to grow sales wise . \nTSLA is a buy for me as I have shares in 200s to cover me from a massive loss. I am not sure I would encourage you to start now unless you have enough to keep buying if it falls, which it will just look at the past 3 years .

        "body": "I'll get downvoted but w/e\n\nLet's take AMZN for example. Everyone knows the price is forward looking. Right now they have 21 billion in FCF. Let's be generous and say tech *should* trade at 30x FCF. AAPL, for instance, trades at 27x FCF. WMT (which is MUCH more tech than people give credit to), who has more infrastructure in place than AMZN for single/same day deliveries is trading at 24.5x FCF.\n\nI digress. AMZN is trading at 76x FCF. They operate on liquid thin margins if you're not including AWS which its market share/profit margins are being competitively eaten up by GOOGL, MSFT, etc. Anyway, even INCLUDING AWS, to get twice the FCF is going to be insanely hard. When a company is that large, growth is so, so much harder to achieve. Also keep in mind that it would have to maintain its market cap.\n\nMy point being that AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, etc kind of companies are so forward looking that it will be impossible for them to \"catch up\" to their current evaluations. Eventually, either they'll lose market cap or grow FCF (probably a mixture of both). Please don't talk about growth potential either (what do you think forward looking means?)\n\nI know the meme here is stocks only go up, which right now is true, but over time a company's goal is to make money and eventually hype will die down and investors will put money into more profitable/sustainable businesses. I'm not taking about value investing, either. It's never *not* happened given an extended period of time. And sure, we could have hyper asset inflation that is so far \"unknown\" making these PE ratios and FCF x's actually acceptable, but that wouldn't explain other companies being \"unfairly\" valued.\n\nAnyway, my other point being is *some* of tech is in a bubble that *will* be popped. everyone knows this but no one knows when it will happen.",

Not to mention that they have a brilliant new CEO and are dominating intel in the cpu game and nvidia in the gpu game as far as price to performance is concerned. You can trust my word, I am a day trader and investor. Also this is kind of a risky investment because if you look at AMDs past you can see that every time they seem like they are doing good their stock price crashes because intel launches a new insane chip.

Tesla is short squeezing and it's rigged by computers and insiders taking money from idiots not only shorting it but also pumping it.\n\n2. I also had AMD at $2/share back in 2015 or something.. I let it go..  Don't wanna talk about that either, today its pushing $60/share.\n\n3. I had Tvix at $6/share and then it split to $44/share and then it went to 800 on the corona virus.. I sold out well before it went to $800 from $44..\n\n\nThere is more as well, I had $40,000 in Apple in shares at $156 let it go when it went down to $150..    today its $380..\n\n\nI had Tesla at $380/share with $18000 in shares, I let it go when it went to $354..  today its... well you know..\n\n\n\nSo, here is what I can REMIND YOU.\n\nTODAY in 2020, you need to buy low and sell after pumps.\n\nSo, I want you to setup your charts to show %.  And when a stock drops 4% or more, you buy some calls or shares..\n\nI want you to watch from now on TQQQ and SPXL.\n\n\nWait for them to dip and then dip a 2nd time and on the 2nd or 3rd dip, buy in with shares or calls 1-3  months out..\n\n\nI want you to know this:\n\nAs the market tries to grind up to SPY $345-ish, I want you to watch Vix and UVXY..\n\n- WHEN YOU see Vix drop down to 15 or lower, you need to start buying calls for 6 months out.\n\nWait till Vix even possibly goes to 12 and then go all-in with Vix calls 3-6 months out.\n\nSo my point is this, even though you missed out and  this and that, don't EVER EVER TRY  to do the Revenge Trading or Diamond hands bullshit they try to push here on Dumb WSB.\n\nWhat you need to do is look in to using margin with covered calls.\n\nThis is where you buy 100 shares of something and sell 1 call at a strike you think the stock will go to and you will lose your shares after it goes above the strike you sold in profit.\n\nTD Ameritrade gives you 4x margin your cash which means if you have $25,000 you can actually buy $100,000 in shares of something, now Imagine day trading with $100,000 of AMD on any $0.40 cent up move in 1 day ?? see the picture here now?\n\n\nAnyway, regardless of all that, you need to do covered calls from now on.\n\nSo be on the lookout for Vix going closer to 12 and then go all-in Vix and hold with your \"diamond\" hands then for the next correction.\n\n\nHere is the kicker, the big insiders know they have now trained us to \"buy the dip\" now since everyone has \"missed out\" on all the gains and all the stocks flying up like Tesla and Nvidia and Facebook and Amazon etc.. so REMEMBER this WELL my friend, they now will trick everyone good again by doing a nice correction/sell-off drop, but then drop it a 2nd or 3rd time down with waves going down and when you think you are buying the dip, it will be a continual small dip over and over again so you get scared and mentally rekt out of the trade.\n\nSO, to prevent any of that, here is what you do, \n\nLook at charts of 2-3 years and buy when things are cheap.\n\nExample you ask??\n\nEasy, \n\nRCL $130 high, now $40-50\n\nCCL  $15/share and normally $50-60\n\nHST \n\nJets\n\nXLE (wait for this to go lower, then buy a lot though)\n\nand there are some more.. \n\nSPXL and TQQQ are big ones, please start buying these after they drop a lot ok.\n\n\nI hope this helps some. You can make money, you just need to stop with the options and try more with shares and/or covered calls as well as only buy calls when VIX has had a major drop, then buy calls on Vix and Calls on SPXL etc..  along with some otm cheap cheap ass puts 2 weeks out. But make the calls 3 weeks or more.\n\nAnd ONLY ONLY ONLY buy after something has dropped a lot.\n\nIt's actually that simple.\n\nNow what if the stock \"keeps dropping\" you say?? Well, then you weren't looking at 2-3 year charts like I said earlier.. See what I'm saying?\n\n\nSo now go fourth and show me that all you have to do is buy low an sell high after any pump. Unless you really are holding something for the long run but that should only be S&amp;P or etc..",

        "body": "TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both.",

I hate to say it but nothing AMD has coming down the line looks particularly competitive, and if Nvidia can get ray tracing and AI tech more refined with these new cards it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath. \n\nI thought that Ampere would nudge them north of $400 this fall, but now I don\u2019t know what to think. $500c October-December calls might be the play but who the fuck knows.",

We\u2019re talking self driving cars, delivery drones, and doctors in New York performing surgery on soldiers in Afghanistan in a tent. \n\nFrom there you have the companies that make the actually radio transmission device like Nokia and Ericsson (both very reasonably priced). Those devices have to go somewhere so you put them on a tower owned by AMT and CCI (crown castle, not carnival cruise line). Those companies make money renting the towers to the service providers. Then you have the companies that make the chips that go into those devices, the chips that go into cell phones, drones and the internet of things (NVDA, INTC, MRVL, QCOM, etc.). Then there are the companies that make the devices we buy to connect us to 5G (Apple, amazon, google, Tesla). Finally there are the service providers like Verizon att and t mobile that connect our devices to the 5G network. \n\nI suggest starting at YouTube. There are videos that explain what each company does and their role in the 5G network.\n\nHowever, I wanted ALL of the companies with not a lot of money so I went after the 5G ETF (ticker: FIVG).",

It makes it an enticing play for everyone here, but an offering is something that can be hard to predict.\n\nHonestly, it looks like they had the change in leadership and started getting some ducks in a row. I think the next thing they need to tackle is their low margins on high cost products. They listed this in their last presentation. Might be part of what is keeping the share price down. Nobody ready to dive in yet.\n\nThat being said there is a decent amount of institutional ownership and they've added more shares semi-recently. Tinfoil hat theory is that smart investors want to keep this price down and pick up shares on the DL as this is one with high potential to explode considering how many tech giants they service, plus the really healthy partnership with Nvidia.",

An expanded product line of shiny computers and reality TV-show streaming aren't something to be counted on for unlimited upward stock movements nor is it something to celebrate as the dazibao of 21st century progress.",

Let's be generous and say tech *should* trade at 30x FCF. AAPL, for instance, trades at 27x FCF. WMT (which is MUCH more tech than people give credit to), who has more infrastructure in place than AMZN for single/same day deliveries is trading at 24.5x FCF.\n\nI digress. AMZN is trading at 76x FCF. They operate on liquid thin margins if you're not including AWS which its market share/profit margins are being competitively eaten up by GOOGL, MSFT, etc. Anyway, even INCLUDING AWS, to get twice the FCF is going to be insanely hard. When a company is that large, growth is so, so much harder to achieve. Also keep in mind that it would have to maintain its market cap.\n\nMy point being that AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, etc kind of companies are so forward looking that it will be impossible for them to \"catch up\" to their current evaluations. Eventually, either they'll lose market cap or grow FCF (probably a mixture of both). Please don't talk about growth potential either (what do you think forward looking means?)\n\nI know the meme here is stocks only go up, which right now is true, but over time a company's goal is to make money and eventually hype will die down and investors will put money into more profitable/sustainable businesses. I'm not taking about value investing, either. It's never *not* happened given an extended period of time. And sure, we could have hyper asset inflation that is so far \"unknown\" making these PE ratios and FCF x's actually acceptable, but that wouldn't explain other companies being \"unfairly\" valued.\n\nAnyway, my other point being is *some* of tech is in a bubble that *will* be popped. everyone knows this but no one knows when it will happen.",

        "body": "Well I know the feeling well. Here is what I can tell you.\n\n1. Tesla is short squeezing and it's rigged by computers and insiders taking money from idiots not only shorting it but also pumping it.\n\n2. I also had AMD at $2/share back in 2015 or something.. I let it go..  Don't wanna talk about that either, today its pushing $60/share.\n\n3. I had Tvix at $6/share and then it split to $44/share and then it went to 800 on the corona virus.. I sold out well before it went to $800 from $44..\n\n\nThere is more as well, I had $40,000 in Apple in shares at $156 let it go when it went down to $150..    today its $380..\n\n\nI had Tesla at $380/share with $18000 in shares, I let it go when it went to $354..  today its... well you know..\n\n\n\nSo, here is what I can REMIND YOU.\n\nTODAY in 2020, you need to buy low and sell after pumps.\n\nSo, I want you to setup your charts to show %.  And when a stock drops 4% or more, you buy some calls or shares..\n\nI want you to watch from now on TQQQ and SPXL.\n\n\nWait for them to dip and then dip a 2nd time and on the 2nd or 3rd dip, buy in with shares or calls 1-3  months out..\n\n\nI want you to know this:\n\nAs the market tries to grind up to SPY $345-ish, I want you to watch Vix and UVXY..\n\n- WHEN YOU see Vix drop down to 15 or lower, you need to start buying calls for 6 months out.\n\nWait till Vix even possibly goes to 12 and then go all-in with Vix calls 3-6 months out.\n\nSo my point is this, even though you missed out and  this and that, don't EVER EVER TRY  to do the Revenge Trading or Diamond hands bullshit they try to push here on Dumb WSB.\n\nWhat you need to do is look in to using margin with covered calls.\n\nThis is where you buy 100 shares of something and sell 1 call at a strike you think the stock will go to and you will lose your shares after it goes above the strike you sold in profit.\n\nTD Ameritrade gives you 4x margin your cash which means if you have $25,000 you can actually buy $100,000 in shares of something, now Imagine day trading with $100,000 of AMD on any $0.40 cent up move in 1 day ?? see the picture here now?\n\n\nAnyway, regardless of all that, you need to do covered calls from now on.\n\nSo be on the lookout for Vix going closer to 12 and then go all-in Vix and hold with your \"diamond\" hands then for the next correction.\n\n\nHere is the kicker, the big insiders know they have now trained us to \"buy the dip\" now since everyone has \"missed out\" on all the gains and all the stocks flying up like Tesla and Nvidia and Facebook and Amazon etc.. so REMEMBER this WELL my friend, they now will trick everyone good again by doing a nice correction/sell-off drop, but then drop it a 2nd or 3rd time down with waves going down and when you think you are buying the dip, it will be a continual small dip over and over again so you get scared and mentally rekt out of the trade.\n\nSO, to prevent any of that, here is what you do, \n\nLook at charts of 2-3 years and buy when things are cheap.\n\nExample you ask??\n\nEasy, \n\nRCL $130 high, now $40-50\n\nCCL  $15/share and normally $50-60\n\nHST \n\nJets\n\nXLE (wait for this to go lower, then buy a lot though)\n\nand there are some more.. \n\nSPXL and TQQQ are big ones, please start buying these after they drop a lot ok.\n\n\nI hope this helps some. You can make money, you just need to stop with the options and try more with shares and/or covered calls as well as only buy calls when VIX has had a major drop, then buy calls on Vix and Calls on SPXL etc..  along with some otm cheap cheap ass puts 2 weeks out. But make the calls 3 weeks or more.\n\nAnd ONLY ONLY ONLY buy after something has dropped a lot.\n\nIt's actually that simple.\n\nNow what if the stock \"keeps dropping\" you say?? Well, then you weren't looking at 2-3 year charts like I said earlier.. See what I'm saying?\n\n\nSo now go fourth and show me that all you have to do is buy low an sell high after any pump. Unless you really are holding something for the long run but that should only be S&amp;P or etc..",

        "body": "Lets take this one bite at a time. Please understand this isn't a personal rant of Intel hate or AMD love, just my informed opinion about the companies as investments. \n\nClock speed - Yep. Intel still holds *single core* performance crown, at the cost of incredibly high power draw and all for maybe 5% improvement. Multi-Core AMD still leads and offers more value per $ overall. \n\nMarket Share - Depends on your sources and regions so I won't nitpick on specifically \"who has more % of market share\" but rather, who has momentum and is gaining vs. losing market share. AMD is gaining consistently regardless of data source. \n\nSecurity Flaws - Threat to both, Intel has just had more bad press lately. No telling when these flaws get picked up in the media or how much they will effect. However, the CTS Labs scandal from 2018 shouldn't be ignored. An intel funded \"security\" company based in Israel announces AMD vulnerabilities publicly without contacting AMD (industry standard to give notice so they can fix). Vulnerabilities were practically nothing (diversion from Spectre and Meltdown) and company has faded into the background without answering any questions, deleting their webpage \"[AMDFlaws.com](https://AMDFlaws.com)\"\n\nMarketing Deception - \n\n* 2018 Computex Industrial Chiller incident to distract from Threadripper\n* Principled Technologies funded study, using an Intel funded benchmark, that pitted the i9-9900K  against a 2700X that deliberately had half its cores disabled\n* Threadripper losing to an i5 in same Intel funded benchmark\n* 2019 MDS vulnerability appears, Intel bribes researchers to downplay severity\n* \"Real World Performance\" campaign the moment benchmarks started showing AMD consistently in the lead, trying to devalue long standing benchmark validity. \n* \"Financial Horsepower\" $3 BILLION set aside to persuade anyone considering AMD to stick with Intel.\n* \"Real World Performance\" caught deliberately hiding disclosures, which exist because Intel was previously caught in anti-consumer deceptive practices in 2009. \n* Plethora of vaporware product announcements with rigged benchmarks, but since the product was never released we can't independently test. \n\nAnti-Competitive Practices - See $3Billion bullet above. And dont' recall what their latest margins on CPUs were, but AMD margins are increasing and Intel has been price cutting. Again, momentum in AMDs favor. \n\nNvidia Market Leader - Team Green has long been the GPU market leader and it isn't debatable, but as AMD (hopefully) and Intel both become more competitive Nvidia may be forced to cut into their margin to stay on top. Sources vary again, but typically they sit at about 70% market share +/-. \n\nMy comparison to Ford/Tesla = Intel/Nvidia remains. Intel has the capability/cash to turn the ship around but I'm not buying until I see a defined culture shift there.",

Zen 3 moving to 7 nm to 7 nm EuV is a relatively big step that should bring 10% performance, they're talking another +15% in architecture so it could solidify AMD at the top. AMD keep saying Q3, I have no idea how they will pull that off, that's like now. \n\nZen 4 will be total market dominance in CPU (if not from Zen 3), Huawei got banned from TSMC and AMD joinked their reserved wafers on 5 nm. The smartphone guys usually launch on the new node in like March, AMD will probably need longer, but not that much longer. There's another 7-10% performance or 15% power reduction at 5 nm and I think Intel is targeting their first 10 nm desktop processors Q4 2021 on 10 nm++ (no joke, that's their name). \n\nAMD's advantage fighting TSMC's 5nm vs Intel's 14 nm++++ for most of 2021 will absolutely crush Intel.",
