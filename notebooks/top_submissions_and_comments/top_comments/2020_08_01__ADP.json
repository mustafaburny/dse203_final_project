The only stock that has positive EPS and makes money and has the strongest balance sheet. \nPalo Alto has partnered with all 4 of the largest cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, Alibaba, Google) which makes me believe they know what they are doing. Having these 4 large entries on their side should help them grow even further for many years. \nCrowdStrike like you mentioned is the youngest company for all 3 but disrupting the industry. I don\u2019t know a lot about this company but I keep hearing more and more about it (especially from Jim Cramer). Virgin, Mercedes, Goldman Sachs, Sony, ADP are among their clients which is very impressive considering how long they have been around. \nAll 3 companies have its own strengths and weaknesses and room to grow.

I\u2019m a bit nervous to buy into the bigger tech companies because of the recent run up and the potential for significant cooling. That said, it doesn\u2019t look like CRM has had the insane success that the giants had this last quarter. \n\nI suppose it shouldn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m holding 5+ years. And the small cap companies aren\u2019t any more immune with 50x ratios.\n\nEdit - I should add that I\u2019m incredibly green when it comes to financial statement analysis. Every decision I\u2019ve made to this point has been grounded in how I feel about the product and what I\u2019ve read from others.",

Learned the difference between a hyped up pump-and-dump and a legitimate company, and shifted my focus to more established companies, mainly in tech.\n\nSince then I've followed a strategy similar to what the OP has done, buying stocks whose success is evident in my daily life and companies that demonstrate obvious value to their clients: I work as an IT consultant, so when I see that all my clients are using Paypal, building ecommerce sites with Shopify, and hooking up the CRMs with Salesforce, I research these companies and look for investment opportunities.\n\n1. Stick with what you know\n\n2. Trust your instinct\n\n3. Buy for long term",
