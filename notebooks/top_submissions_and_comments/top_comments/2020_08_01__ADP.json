The only stock that has positive EPS and makes money and has the strongest balance sheet. \nPalo Alto has partnered with all 4 of the largest cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, Alibaba, Google) which makes me believe they know what they are doing. Having these 4 large entries on their side should help them grow even further for many years. \nCrowdStrike like you mentioned is the youngest company for all 3 but disrupting the industry. I don\u2019t know a lot about this company but I keep hearing more and more about it (especially from Jim Cramer). Virgin, Mercedes, Goldman Sachs, Sony, ADP are among their clients which is very impressive considering how long they have been around. \nAll 3 companies have its own strengths and weaknesses and room to grow.

Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.\n\nDivesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP\u2019s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom &amp; will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.\n\nMain downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this &amp; the sky didn't fall.\n\nTLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP",

Date them later if you are concerned. Firstly, the same thing happened after weak Q2 guidance last year and Intel proceeded to skyrocket 30% after bottoming around 45. Secondly, Intel relies on less than 25% of revenue from chip manufacturing. In addition they have double digit YOY growth 10+ years in a row, and they have beaten earnings both quarters this year. Finally, they have 18 BILLION in free cash flow. This company could be a disorganized mess for the next 10 years and still be valued highly just from how strong their financial spreadsheet is.

Once Apple Silicon Macs prove themselves to be superior to Intel Macs, AMD is gonna start pushing more into ARM chips.

If they prove to be better since they are more power efficient.. good luck Intel.",
