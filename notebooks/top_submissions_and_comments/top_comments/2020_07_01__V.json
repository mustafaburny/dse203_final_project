For all we know airlines will continue lower. It's pretty certain that airlines will simply be smaller companies for the next 3-5 years.\n* Tech/growth stocks have bounced back quickly in a V shape since the market crash. Are you going to let a few weeks of volatile market data be the deciding factor with regard to a long-term investment decision? What if tech/growth stocks crash next week?\n* Dominion fell on the news of their divestiture to Buffet. This tells me that Buffet had the better end of that deal.\n* If you're only 50% weighted into BRK, you should still have decent diversification if the rest of your portfolio is invested in broad index funds. VTI or VUG would compliment BRK well.",

For example, ECL is not a growth stock, it is a value stock that has undergone high price appreciation but only modest revenue growth. That is the opposite of a good growth buy.\n\nAlso, by typical growth stock metrics (e.g. market cap/revenue ratio), both V and MA are very expensive. Contrast, for example, with AMZN which has both a higher growth rate and is much less expensive relative to fundamentals. If AMZN was valued like MA as a growth stock, its price would be north of $10k/share. (AMZN only looks \"cheap\" relative to most other growth stocks; in absolute terms it is probably in the ballpark of being correctly priced.)",

If a stock is above the vwap line you should look for a long position, if the stock is below the vwap line you should look for a short position.  The vwap also acts as a strong support or resistance. It\u2019s not like many indicators in that it doesn\u2019t give you a cross signal that says buy here, but it\u2019s a powerful and flexible tool once you get used to using it.  A stock crossing the vwap line may indicate a change in trend.  I think this trader has a good explanation and does some live trades using the vwap indicator.  So you can see how he likes to use the vwap indicator to enter trades.  Normally I like to look for consolidation around the vwap line and then use the candles for the buy signal, but some people might prefer to combine it with other indicators.  Or prefer finding trades trading far away from the vwap line which would indicate a strong trend, but you must be careful here as it\u2019s still a lagging indicator so a swift reversal will not be in your favor.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rZRt-miYr2I  \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=arTMbtZum7w  \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp",

(I don't want to insult your intelligence here, but I also don't want to assume you know something you may not know).  The funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 are considered the \"standard\" of ETFs. There are a number of them, but the two most popular are **VOO** and **SPY**.  \n\nThat said, there are a number of ETFs, both broad market ETFs and Sector ETFs, that consistently outperform the S&amp;P 500.  That's what I'd recommend (assuming you want something other than **AMZN** and **MSFT**). \n\nConsider the following approach:\n\n$1000 in **VOOG** \\- **VOOG** is an index fund that attempts to mimic the S&amp;P 500 Growth index. The S&amp;P 500 Growth index is essentially and index of the S&amp;P 500 stocks that are more growth-oriented. \n\n$1000 in **XLY** \\- **XLY** is the SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF. This fund has been consistently one of the best ETFs over a long period of time and consistently outperforms the S&amp;P 500.\n\n$1000 in **ICLN** \\- **ICLN** is an ETF that invests in renewable, clean energy companies. I believe that clean, renewable energy is definitely the future, and this fund is one that I've been invested in. It has been a very solid performer and my feeling is that after the first of the year, if the elections go the way I think they might go, this fund could really take off. But even if it doesn't, it has been giving me a solid return.\n\nIf you want to stick with individual stocks, you might look into:  **KO, KR, ABBV, V, O, DIS, SBUX,** etc. \n\nDisclaimer: I own shares in every stock and ETF mentioned above except **VOO** and **SPY**.",

For all we know airlines will continue lower. It's pretty certain that airlines will simply be smaller companies for the next 3-5 years.\n* Tech/growth stocks have bounced back quickly in a V shape since the market crash. Are you going to let a few weeks of volatile market data be the deciding factor with regard to a long-term investment decision? What if tech/growth stocks crash next week?\n* Dominion fell on the news of their divestiture to Buffet. This tells me that Buffet had the better end of that deal.\n* If you're only 50% weighted into BRK, you should still have decent diversification if the rest of your portfolio is invested in broad index funds. VTI or VUG would compliment BRK well.",

        "body": "The vwap works similar to a moving average but weighted by volume.  If a stock is above the vwap line you should look for a long position, if the stock is below the vwap line you should look for a short position.  The vwap also acts as a strong support or resistance. It\u2019s not like many indicators in that it doesn\u2019t give you a cross signal that says buy here, but it\u2019s a powerful and flexible tool once you get used to using it.  A stock crossing the vwap line may indicate a change in trend.  I think this trader has a good explanation and does some live trades using the vwap indicator.  So you can see how he likes to use the vwap indicator to enter trades.  Normally I like to look for consolidation around the vwap line and then use the candles for the buy signal, but some people might prefer to combine it with other indicators.  Or prefer finding trades trading far away from the vwap line which would indicate a strong trend, but you must be careful here as it\u2019s still a lagging indicator so a swift reversal will not be in your favor.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rZRt-miYr2I  \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=arTMbtZum7w  \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp",

I know that\u2019s maybe an unpopular pick but a lot of the ETFs will have crossover with each other and the stocks I\u2019d buy \nYou really need to make the call yourself but again if it were ME I would go hard into the aforementioned ETFs. They all have room to run. (Maybe 10-20%) \nI\u2019d put a gigantic sum into MSFT (like 15-20% of my portfolio) and then throw the rest into runners. \n\nReddit darlings are: SPOT, PYPL, ADBE, SE, NET, FSLY, LVGO, DDOG, BABA, MU, AMD, CRWD, V, M, JPM, INTC, NVDA, SPLK (splunk idr the exact callsign), AVGO, MELI, CRM, TTD, DOCU, SHOP, etc. all pretty pricy shares but I believe in all of those companies. AMZN is a near must buy but it\u2019s something like $3000 now lol. \n\nSome smaller cap stocks I\u2019m bullish on are DKNG, AVCT, APPS, KLR, maybe get yourself an EV they\u2019re all the rage now idk \n\nAlso look into a REIT possibly. \n\nThat\u2019s if you want to be active investing \nIf you want to be passive just go 60/40 ETF/Stock and throw it all into an array of ETFs and then MSFT or whatever",

While you probably couldn't go wrong just putting it all in **AMZN** and **MSFT**, I'll give you some other options, as well.\n\nWith only $3000, if you want to diversify a bit, your best bet is probably an ETF. \n\nETFs are exchange traded funds; funds that invest in a variety of stocks. (I don't want to insult your intelligence here, but I also don't want to assume you know something you may not know).  The funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 are considered the \"standard\" of ETFs. There are a number of them, but the two most popular are **VOO** and **SPY**.  \n\nThat said, there are a number of ETFs, both broad market ETFs and Sector ETFs, that consistently outperform the S&amp;P 500.  That's what I'd recommend (assuming you want something other than **AMZN** and **MSFT**). \n\nConsider the following approach:\n\n$1000 in **VOOG** \\- **VOOG** is an index fund that attempts to mimic the S&amp;P 500 Growth index. The S&amp;P 500 Growth index is essentially and index of the S&amp;P 500 stocks that are more growth-oriented. \n\n$1000 in **XLY** \\- **XLY** is the SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF. This fund has been consistently one of the best ETFs over a long period of time and consistently outperforms the S&amp;P 500.\n\n$1000 in **ICLN** \\- **ICLN** is an ETF that invests in renewable, clean energy companies. I believe that clean, renewable energy is definitely the future, and this fund is one that I've been invested in. It has been a very solid performer and my feeling is that after the first of the year, if the elections go the way I think they might go, this fund could really take off. But even if it doesn't, it has been giving me a solid return.\n\nIf you want to stick with individual stocks, you might look into:  **KO, KR, ABBV, V, O, DIS, SBUX,** etc. \n\nDisclaimer: I own shares in every stock and ETF mentioned above except **VOO** and **SPY**.",

The companies driving the index through the roof are all but absent from BRK's portfolio. They haven't outperformed the market for a while now, but the market has changed pretty radically in the last decade. BRK wasn't extremely different during the financial crisis and look at how it performed v the index when the shit hit the fan (very well.)\n\nI own BRK as a bit of a hedge _against_ the companies that dominate the index taking a nose dive. Right now I imagine they are trading below book value as well because their mark to market \"earnings\" which hurt them (on paper) so badly in March have now been all but erased (or grown; their largest stock position is AAPL).\n\nI think they're actually a very good buy right now, but I'm not expecting 20% annually.

        "body": "&gt;only gaming really uses 1-2 cores ,not most programs, its 2020 software  developers know how to utilize multiple cores, and for gaming GPUs are  where its at anyways. Workstations don't care about clock speed, they  want multi core throughput. \n\nWhat is your technical knowledge? I doubt any average software uses more than 6 cores. Not only that, but multi-cores becomes very ineffecient the more cores you have.\n\nAlso games don't use 1 or 2 cores, games really do use all the cores usually, just at a certain point it doesn't make a difference anymore because of a lot of technical difficulties. And most of modern games barely use the CPU for anything, so the FPS differences between 9600K and 3700X will be almost none except for very CPU-intensive games. \n\nYou should watch this : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5-3MMoA\\_A0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5-3MMoA_A0)\n\n&gt;again I have both AMD and Intel comps, the AMD wins hands down with  price per performance on everything but gaming higher clock speed and I  could still overclock if I absolutely needed more but most games do not  care about CPUs its GPU bottle-necked. \n\nHow did you test that? Sounds like some bullshit you made up with no objective data. As I said before, most programs don't use multiple cores effeciently as they simply can't.\n\nThe only thing a 3700X, which is much more expensive than the 9600k, would beat the 9600K in, would be either specific software utilizing multiple cores to compute independent lines of code or a lot of active programs being ran at once. \n\n&gt;only in single core speed, in multi core processes the 3700X has 2 more  cores and twice the threads it would dominate the i5 9600K. A better  comparison in the cheaper benchmarks is a 3600X anyways as it has the  same 6 cores but more threads at roughly the same clock speed and  similar price as a i5 9600K. Making it a better choice than the i5 9600K  in everything but gaming and in gaming both CPUs would perform just  fine. \n\nSame answer as above. \n\nAnd no, a 9600K should be compared to a 3700X, the 3600X is no match at all. The 9600K outperforms the 3600X even on the 8-core test, lmao. Showing how threads aren't that useful. \n\n**Here are the specific and objective numbers that are relevant :**\n\n3700X is \\~42% more expensive than the 9600K, 170 euros vs 240 euros.\n\nThese are the performance scores, 9600K on the left and 3700X on the right. Non-OC :\n\nMemory speed : 93,3 vs 79\n\nSingle-core : 136 vs 136\n\nTwo-core : 271 vs 269\n\nFour-core : 532 vs 516\n\nEight-core : 761 vs 928\n\nSixty-four core : 905 vs 1499\n\nOC :\n\nMemory speed : 97,4 vs 89,2\n\nSingle-core : 155 vs 141\n\nTwo-core : 308 vs 281\n\nFour-core : 616 vs 548\n\nEight-core : 899 vs 1025\n\nSixty-four core : 768 vs 1418\n\nSource : [https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-9600K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4031vs4043](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-9600K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4031vs4043)\n\nAs you can see, objectively, there's no reason to ever buy the much more expensive 3700X over the 9600K unless you specifically require a very high core count.  Also note that in benchmarks the conditions for multi-core are ideal with minimum memory usage and no overlapping calculations. In real world software, there will always be a lot of memory storage and reading between CPU's, which will make the multi-cores less effective. \n\nIn games that like multi-core CPU's like CS:GO the 9600K still outperforms the 3700X by 20% in fps, this mostly likely caused by the memory latency of the 3700X. \n\nI'm not saying Intel is much better, I'm saying Intel's performance is king, while AMD's price per performance is king.\n\nI believe the Ryzen 5 3600 is the most valuable processor right now. As you can see, many AMD's on the list :\n\n[https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu\\_value\\_available.html](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_value_available.html)",
