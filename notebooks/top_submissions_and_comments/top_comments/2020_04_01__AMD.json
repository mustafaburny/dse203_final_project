Get into these UVXY calls with me.\u201d And I did and you can see where it helped me make a good recovery.

I tried Disney but don\u2019t fuck with the mouse. \n\nThen I noticed that the downturn was going slower and slower and with the feds taking notice I decided to start putting in less. I was seriously doing some stupid YOLO plays, putting in like 60% or more of my portfolio in at a time before this. Luckily I only lost $7K when the fed pump happened.\n\nNow I just ride the wave, I only ever throw in $35K at a time so if I get fucked I\u2019m not going to end up like the other people on here who lost everything. \n\nThis savings account is also meant for a house.

The fact of markets is that its driven by 80% financial institutions who are not barred from holding short positions. The market is irrational in the short term, but its never irrational long term. \n\nTake a look at the VIX, its at 42. This implies that SPY can move 12% up or down as driven by premium prices. This means that the underwriters of options (the guys you buy options from) are pricing in this movement. Now lets look at SPY's movement the last 2 weeks, gee what do you know? its moved up 12% well within the expected volatility of the market. \n\nThis means that the SPY index can swing up or down 12% within this month, and it will mean absolutely NOTHING. It would be considered random noise.\n\nNow during the last 2 weeks we've had 2 uncertainties become certain.\n\n1. PPP was activated and disbursed\n2. Fed commited to buying Equity based securities\n\nThese were the 2 big driving factors of the gains.\n\nNow if you scrutinized the winners and losers of the last 2 weeks of gains, you can notice a theme. Companies like MSFT/AMD/NVDA/Netflix are rewarded. Can you think of a rational reason why that is? Compared to say BA? This is proof the market is evaluating companies rationally corp to corp.\n\nNext, I want all the bears to understand that in the history of 100 years of equity movement, the stocks only moved down 4% of the time ( vs 96% of the time up) and in addition, bear markets only lasted 200 days on average. With the way algos reacted and the fed, you can expect this bear market to be compressed at LEAST by a factor of 2. Lets say 100 days. Now we've had market reaction for over 60 days now. this means, we are likely already halfway through this market correction statistically.\n\nKnowing the above quantifications, how many are actually brave enough to continue to short? It makes no sense logically given the above.",

No innovation, the lack of security is missing in nearly every cpu, I've been hearing about 10nm progress for 5 years and they haven't even accomplished that (this is in an industry that is supposed to innovate at exponential rate. \n\nCompletely ignores that Intel does non-CPU work.  You cherry-picked modem, but optane is crushing NAND in performance, they're now the top [silicon photonics](http://www.reddit.com/r/siliconphotonics) supplier.  On the CPU side, they made a bad decision to tie their innovations so closely to the process, then another one when they refused to back-port said innovations for several years, so yeah it looks like they haven't innovated.  I imagine they'll surprise in the next year or two now that the process is un-gummed.\n\n&gt; They are mostly paying/bribing other companies to make worse amd products/not advertise amd products/not carry amd stuff. They've done it in the past and got fined 1 bilion dollars. \n\nUnless you have a more recent allegation, that was 15 years and 3 CEOs ago.  Perhaps you'd like to chastise IBM for supplying the Nazis as well?",

Intel didn't drop because they're losing a small amount of earnings on Apple machines when apple makes the vast majority of their money on iPhones. They dropped after a 23% earnings growth and an estimate beat because of their shaky Q2 guidance. The fact that their even providing Q2 guidance puts them ahead of most other companies.\n\nAMD is coming up behind them, but take a look at their balance financial statements and PE. Intel is a great value buy right now (I don't own any). I'm fine being told I'm wrong, but if you're not doing it with facts and numbers you just being emotional. Intel grew earnings 23%; they're not tanking next year. The question is whether or not you think AMD is going to grow at a rate to justify the premium and why you think Intel is DOA given the facts.",

End of April contracts expired less than worthless cause the virus grinded transports to a halt. Thus too much supply and no demand.\n\nHis max loss isn't the premium paid, it's that + the cost of movement of that oil. Options give you the right but not the obligation. Futures contracts as I understand it, don't give you a right, only an obligation. If you play around with these, you are doing so with an understanding that you are responsible for the underlying security.\n\nIf you buy AMD calls, and they expire worthless. You lose only the premium paid for it. You are not responsible for the movement of (hypothetically) all the chips that amount of stock would buy you in equivalent cash.\n\nIf you buy oil futures, it doesn't matter if they're OTM/ITM or expire worthless. You're on the hook for movement of the material goods. That's also because oil is a tangible material that needs specialized equipment to transport and store in a legally and environmentally proper way. You can't just fill your pool up with it. The fumes will kill you, your mom, her boyfriend, and all the trees within a few dozen yards of your house.\n\nAnd unlike gold, which if you were theoretically responsible for, you can't just dump it onto the ground of your backyard. Doing so sets you up for legal suits from the county, state, federal or all of them in precession.\n\nThis guy literally just ended his economic life.\n\n*Caveat: I don't know shit about how any of this works, but basic fucking googling and having more than two brain cells, has taught me enough to just stick with stocks and options, and don't go fuck around with shit I don't fundamentally understand.",

It takes a lot of fortitude to stick with it. There\u2019s no such thing as easy money. The reason why you\u2019re getting paid very high multiples in returns is because of the risk and volatility you took on, as well as your patience. Getting lucky is of course also a part of it",

Even if you don't believe in Moore's law in this day their lack of progress is appalling.  They are putting industrial cooling on their top chips just so they don't overheat and can somewhat benchmark near AMD but can't compete in performance or price.  \n\nThey are mostly paying/bribing other companies to make worse amd products/not advertise amd products/not carry amd stuff.  They've done it in the past and got fined 1 bilion dollars.  But their product is such shit now it doesn't matter.  They are going to lose the Apple business, they are losing the datacenter business.  \n\nWhen you see these big companies like sears, macys, blockbuster etc cut every corner and not change with the times that's how a behemoth dies out.  The brain drain at Intel is very real.  You've got a technology company with no good tech, they poured billions into their modem business, flopped so hard the sold it to apple for fractions.  \n\nIntel has been overheating and forcing laptops to throttle in macbooks for ages.  Apple was either going with their own chip or amd, intel is the worst choice by far now. \n\nAMD has risen from $1.70 in 2016 to near $60 now partly because of their tech advances but partly because their competition has flopped so hard.  Yes they were in the $1 and change realm in 2016ish, you can look that up.",

        "body": "Yea that's a good question (tldr at end).  For some stocks it can be like 5+ years.  For sure, Tesla won't realize it's fundamentals until like 5+ years, and even then, it can pull a MSFT in which it goes from a blue chip to a blue chip + growth stock (with Azure), in which case, it still may not fully realize that part of it's fundamentals until we know how big cloud will be.\n\nBut when I invest, my target is always like 2+ years for all my stocks and for the stock market as a whole.  That's why I've always been buying this entire time, since even though we can definitely sell off short term back to say 240, I know long term, the stock market will be better than 280.  More importantly, I am confident the individual stocks I pick will be better than what they are currently longer term.  That's why a DCA approach is a fairly standard and safe approach.  Of course, you can adjust this DCA approach to be way more aggressive on drops and less aggressive on up moves (like buy way less on a day like today, if today was your set buying date).  I don't worry about the market going down short term for my long term investments.  Plus, if you look, so many tech stocks, like MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, NFLX, etc. are all up for the year despite this!\n\nNow, for trading, you can also trade the fundamentals in the short term - which would be months here.  If you believe the economy will be slower to return to work, if the Q1 and Q2 earnings will be bad, if the vaccine will take longer than normal, if social distincing in a way still continues even after we open up, if consumer demand is less, if the credit problem comes back, etc., or some combination of that, you can trade that.  So for example, you can buy like a 3 month 15% OTM put or something.  Perhaps you believe QQQ &gt; IWM (that's what I believe), so in that case, maybe if you are long QQQ, you can short IWM as a market hedge.  So many ways to trade that.\n\ntldr: \n\nTrading should be on either short term TECHNIALS (days - weeks) or short term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be months)\n\nInvesting should be on long term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be years).  I'm a believer in the US Economy and particularly the tech sector and a few non-tech stocks like COST, so I will always invest when I have the chance to do so, without having to always try to predict the bottom.  Predicting the bottom or the top is best used in the above trading section.",

Not writing articles for investors. \n\nThe most successful investors don't try to predict this crap. They take a single asset, security, or company, analyze it for solvency, make a long term prediction, and trade based on that. Buffet evaluates what he thinks a company should be worth before looking at the stock price and sees how it compares. The guy in the big short saw systemic flaws in the mortgage industry and traded on that. Both are frequently wrong short term, but usually right long term. If you think Microsoft (just picking a company) has the management, products, vision, and capabilities to double their income in 10 years, you should buy them regardless of what their stock price is or does over the next year. If you are right about those core pieces, the stock price will eventually reflect the success of the company. Anything short term is just gambling.",

        "body": "Jesus H Christ. There is so much conspiracy theory in here that it would be impossible to maintain if this was even remotely true. The fact of markets is that its driven by 80% financial institutions who are not barred from holding short positions. The market is irrational in the short term, but its never irrational long term. \n\nTake a look at the VIX, its at 42. This implies that SPY can move 12% up or down as driven by premium prices. This means that the underwriters of options (the guys you buy options from) are pricing in this movement. Now lets look at SPY's movement the last 2 weeks, gee what do you know? its moved up 12% well within the expected volatility of the market. \n\nThis means that the SPY index can swing up or down 12% within this month, and it will mean absolutely NOTHING. It would be considered random noise.\n\nNow during the last 2 weeks we've had 2 uncertainties become certain.\n\n1. PPP was activated and disbursed\n2. Fed commited to buying Equity based securities\n\nThese were the 2 big driving factors of the gains.\n\nNow if you scrutinized the winners and losers of the last 2 weeks of gains, you can notice a theme. Companies like MSFT/AMD/NVDA/Netflix are rewarded. Can you think of a rational reason why that is? Compared to say BA? This is proof the market is evaluating companies rationally corp to corp.\n\nNext, I want all the bears to understand that in the history of 100 years of equity movement, the stocks only moved down 4% of the time ( vs 96% of the time up) and in addition, bear markets only lasted 200 days on average. With the way algos reacted and the fed, you can expect this bear market to be compressed at LEAST by a factor of 2. Lets say 100 days. Now we've had market reaction for over 60 days now. this means, we are likely already halfway through this market correction statistically.\n\nKnowing the above quantifications, how many are actually brave enough to continue to short? It makes no sense logically given the above.",

If you want to play oil do XOM or MRO. If you want to do tech do AMD, NVDA, MSFT, AAPL or whatever. Then buy puts against the shares so if we do go down soon you\u2019ll have cash to buy more shares on down days. Over time you\u2019ll be rich, alternatively buy long calls instead of shares. Always at least a month out. \n\n\nBuy the oil dip, airline dip, hotel dip. But don\u2019t expect bug returns in the short term. \n\nFinally. Don\u2019t listen to advice on this sub.

Laying off at least half of our dick beating workforce will save us enough cash to be able to start buying back shares of our stonks again, boosting EPS by {UNREASONABLE\\_PERCENTAGE}.\n\nThanks to the free money printer, we haven't had to outlay much working capital to continue to pay our work from home employees, as JPOW has been cranking that money crank till his eyes started bleeding and he had to hire an intern to take over.  In addition, team JPOW has been buying up our high yield bonds that we've been issuing, further preparing us to continue our very efficient stonk buyback program.\n\nWhile we can't issue guidance at this time, we all here at {COMPANY} want you to know that we are very excited about what 2021 is going to look like.",
