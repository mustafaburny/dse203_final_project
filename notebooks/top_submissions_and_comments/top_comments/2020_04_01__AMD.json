The fact of markets is that its driven by 80% financial institutions who are not barred from holding short positions. The market is irrational in the short term, but its never irrational long term. \n\nTake a look at the VIX, its at 42. This implies that SPY can move 12% up or down as driven by premium prices. This means that the underwriters of options (the guys you buy options from) are pricing in this movement. Now lets look at SPY's movement the last 2 weeks, gee what do you know? its moved up 12% well within the expected volatility of the market. \n\nThis means that the SPY index can swing up or down 12% within this month, and it will mean absolutely NOTHING. It would be considered random noise.\n\nNow during the last 2 weeks we've had 2 uncertainties become certain.\n\n1. PPP was activated and disbursed\n2. Fed commited to buying Equity based securities\n\nThese were the 2 big driving factors of the gains.\n\nNow if you scrutinized the winners and losers of the last 2 weeks of gains, you can notice a theme. Companies like MSFT/AMD/NVDA/Netflix are rewarded. Can you think of a rational reason why that is? Compared to say BA? This is proof the market is evaluating companies rationally corp to corp.\n\nNext, I want all the bears to understand that in the history of 100 years of equity movement, the stocks only moved down 4% of the time ( vs 96% of the time up) and in addition, bear markets only lasted 200 days on average. With the way algos reacted and the fed, you can expect this bear market to be compressed at LEAST by a factor of 2. Lets say 100 days. Now we've had market reaction for over 60 days now. this means, we are likely already halfway through this market correction statistically.\n\nKnowing the above quantifications, how many are actually brave enough to continue to short? It makes no sense logically given the above.",

The fact that their even providing Q2 guidance puts them ahead of most other companies.\n\nAMD is coming up behind them, but take a look at their balance financial statements and PE. Intel is a great value buy right now (I don't own any). I'm fine being told I'm wrong, but if you're not doing it with facts and numbers you just being emotional.
