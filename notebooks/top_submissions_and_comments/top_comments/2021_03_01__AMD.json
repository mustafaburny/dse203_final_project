        "body": "Also the additional question people ask...\n\nWell if the hedge funds are trading stocks then why can't they sell those shares to cover the short positions.\n\nThis is where the illegal morally but legal system comes into play.\n\nThe hedge fund have been borrowing non existance shares from clearing house and using those to short the system. So they actually don't own any stock to close their short positions. when you see people say that they have shorted 137% of the market it means they can't even buy back all real shares in the market to close positions. So they are bleeding every day a lot of money.\n\nOne of the rules is that when they borrow a stock they will promise to return the stock in x days to the borrower and each day it costs 0.5% in interest of the stock value.\n\nSo now they have x days to drive the stock price down enough to cover their interest payments and make a profit. And remeber they do this every day, hundreds of thousands of transactions all with different parameters as things get worse.\n\nNow this is managable on a small scale but when you have it on the scale if GME its not possible. They do this every day trying to push the price down. And remember interest is a % so when the price starts to rise that is 0.5 turns into 0.5 of the current stock price. So if we hold our positions they just keep bleeding amd when the short positions are called they need to go and buy real stock at the real price. So if we hold and don't sell the price keeps going up as the more they buy the more the price rised.\n\nDiaclaimer: I have no idea what I talk about, read up about naked short selling and also about fake share issuers for trading and cry because rules don't apply for the rich.",

What percentage of the market values companies purely in DCF anyway?\n\nI think this is more a broader correction around fears that the Fed will not live up to it's word on 'average inflation targeting' and will have to raise rates sooner and quicker than normal. I personally can't see this happening, as the Fed has shown itself to be extremely dovish and is trying to recover the real economy first (jobs ans solvency issues). \n\nThere is also the huge debt problem they now have from all the money printing they've done, the easiest way for them to solve that is to inflate it away as quickly as possible, so long term high inflation seems like something they would try for.

        "body": "There are three main aspects of a company that I try to evaluate: (1) How large it might become (2) How quickly it will grow to that size (3) How expensive it is relative to points 1 and 2.\n\nTo understand how large the company might become, I'll read the company's earnings reports and presentations. This informs me of the company's current and potential long-term plans. I also want to know how large the industry is, so I'll look at the market caps of other companies in the industry. If you google \"addressable market of company x\", there might be a report about that. If you don't find it for the company in question, then try googling its closest competitors. Preferably, the industry is very large or the company is one of the smaller ones as this suggests there can be a long runway of growth.\n\nHow quickly the company will grow might be the easiest of these three points to evaluate. I tend to look for consistent high growth (&gt;40%) and strong forecasted growth. This isn't a requirement as companies like [AMD](https://theportfoliolab.com/summary/AMD) have experienced poor historical growth, but their current future looks good (I own some shares in AMD). Nonetheless, I still see it as a positive. As I tend to invest in unprofitable, smaller companies ($5-10B), I pay more attention to revenue and gross profit growth, rather than net income. I use this [correlation](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare) feature as a guide for which metrics to focus on by measuring the correlation between market cap and revenue, gross profit, net income for the company's industry.\n\nTo evaluate how expensive the company is, I'll compare its growth vs price-to-X ratio, where X is usually revenue or gross profit. I prefer to pay more attention to gross profit than revenue as that includes gross margin in the calculation. I think companies that perform a similar service, but at a higher margin (more efficient), should have a higher valuation. Price-to-gross profit growth ratio (similar to [PEG ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp)), is useful as it balances gross profit growth and price-to-gross profit ratio. I see expansiveness as a relative concept, so I'll use this [distribution](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare) feature to compare companies within an industry.\n\nSo to summarise: (1) Large and growing market (2) high, consistent gross profit growth (3) low price-to-gross profit ratio",

On one hand you want to puke up your lunch but on the other hand.... we should want this drop in tech and the chance to buy back the key growth companies.  \n\nI bought AAPL, NVDA, AMD, AVGO, XLE and DB (to add some more financials and energy to my portfolio).  This keeps me balanced and I can wait out the pain that tech is providing.  \n\nMy biggest gains that I have held are from VIAC, SBUX, HP, JPM, STOR, LUMN, SPY, and a host of others.\n\nLet's see if adding to tech this week will pay off.",

        "body": "Also the additional question people ask...\n\nWell if the hedge funds are trading stocks then why can't they sell those shares to cover the short positions.\n\nThis is where the illegal morally but legal system comes into play.\n\nThe hedge fund have been borrowing non existance shares from clearing house and using those to short the system. So they actually don't own any stock to close their short positions. when you see people say that they have shorted 137% of the market it means they can't even buy back all real shares in the market to close positions. So they are bleeding every day a lot of money.\n\nOne of the rules is that when they borrow a stock they will promise to return the stock in x days to the borrower and each day it costs 0.5% in interest of the stock value.\n\nSo now they have x days to drive the stock price down enough to cover their interest payments and make a profit. And remeber they do this every day, hundreds of thousands of transactions all with different parameters as things get worse.\n\nNow this is managable on a small scale but when you have it on the scale if GME its not possible. They do this every day trying to push the price down. And remember interest is a % so when the price starts to rise that is 0.5 turns into 0.5 of the current stock price. So if we hold our positions they just keep bleeding amd when the short positions are called they need to go and buy real stock at the real price. So if we hold and don't sell the price keeps going up as the more they buy the more the price rised.\n\nDiaclaimer: I have no idea what I talk about, read up about naked short selling and also about fake share issuers for trading and cry because rules don't apply for the rich.",

I personally can't see this happening, as the Fed has shown itself to be extremely dovish and is trying to recover the real economy first (jobs ans solvency issues). \n\nThere is also the huge debt problem they now have from all the money printing they've done, the easiest way for them to solve that is to inflate it away as quickly as possible, so long term high inflation seems like something they would try for.

        "body": "There are three main aspects of a company that I try to evaluate: (1) How large it might become (2) How quickly it will grow to that size (3) How expensive it is relative to points 1 and 2.\n\nTo understand how large the company might become, I'll read the company's earnings reports and presentations. This informs me of the company's current and potential long-term plans. I also want to know how large the industry is, so I'll look at the market caps of other companies in the industry. If you google \"addressable market of company x\", there might be a report about that. If you don't find it for the company in question, then try googling its closest competitors. Preferably, the industry is very large or the company is one of the smaller ones as this suggests there can be a long runway of growth.\n\nHow quickly the company will grow might be the easiest of these three points to evaluate. I tend to look for consistent high growth (&gt;40%) and strong forecasted growth. This isn't a requirement as companies like [AMD](https://theportfoliolab.com/summary/AMD) have experienced poor historical growth, but their current future looks good (I own some shares in AMD). Nonetheless, I still see it as a positive. As I tend to invest in unprofitable, smaller companies ($5-10B), I pay more attention to revenue and gross profit growth, rather than net income. I use this [correlation](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare) feature as a guide for which metrics to focus on by measuring the correlation between market cap and revenue, gross profit, net income for the company's industry.\n\nTo evaluate how expensive the company is, I'll compare its growth vs price-to-X ratio, where X is usually revenue or gross profit. I prefer to pay more attention to gross profit than revenue as that includes gross margin in the calculation. I think companies that perform a similar service, but at a higher margin (more efficient), should have a higher valuation. Price-to-gross profit growth ratio (similar to [PEG ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp)), is useful as it balances gross profit growth and price-to-gross profit ratio. I see expansiveness as a relative concept, so I'll use this [distribution](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare) feature to compare companies within an industry.\n\nSo to summarise: (1) Large and growing market (2) high, consistent gross profit growth (3) low price-to-gross profit ratio",

On one hand you want to puke up your lunch but on the other hand.... we should want this drop in tech and the chance to buy back the key growth companies.  \n\nI bought AAPL, NVDA, AMD, AVGO, XLE and DB (to add some more financials and energy to my portfolio).  This keeps me balanced and I can wait out the pain that tech is providing.  \n\nMy biggest gains that I have held are from VIAC, SBUX, HP, JPM, STOR, LUMN, SPY, and a host of others.\n\nLet's see if adding to tech this week will pay off.",

        "body": "automod deleted my main post :(\n\nHi everyone long time lurker/AMD retard here. Sorry for poor formatting I am on mobile but i really want to discuss this. \n\nProof of position before starting: https://imgur.com/a/GXhOznp\n\nShares: https://imgur.com/a/urp4YcN\n\nLoss porn the first week: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay29a/hold_lads_gme_will_remember_us_we_will_not_be/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n$250-250k to basically 0 now to the theory! \n\nI have been watching \ud83e\udd13 the GME saga for weeks now and ready every single post, shitpost from WSB, GME and so on and something has really bothered me. \ud83e\uddd0\n\nHow will \ud83d\udca9 shitadel get out of this. So lets talk about a few theories as to what is happen and multiple fronts.\n\n1. Front is old and new shorts, have a war according to uncle bruce between NYC hedge funds and CME options traders in which shorts are flipping long at the expense of naked sellers of the CME. To do this you buy enough ITM calls to cover your short and a little extra to sell back to naked options sellers thus getting out of the short and passing the burning house to options sellers. Now granted this may only work for small positions.\n\n2. The second front is the large short positions that are so fucking deep it will form the black hole of the galaxy. How do they cover and still break even or profit without necessarily cheating. \n\nWell you heard of interstellar \ud83e\ude80 i shall put on my tin foil hat and explain black hole event horizon slingshot.\n\nHow does it work? Well it requires 3 things shorts that will exit, put/call options but mainly puts and chaos/volatility. \n\nThe theory is that shitadel will tank the market and use the stimulus money. Now retarded spud \ud83e\udd54 how do they do that? Well.. \n\nMost people are getting a $1400 \ud83d\udcb0 check which they should be buying food and shit with but are buying FDs and stonks.  Fun fact if 1 million Americans yoloed GME thats 1.4 Billion $$$. Now imagine how much shitadel can get out with if half did that. \n\nEffectively pumping the markets. So what do you do if your short so fucking deep that your anus is wider than the sun and the sun is shining? \n\nYou first cheat to stabilize the position aka GME and the market. Thus effectively shorting volatility and lowering IV. \n\nNow how does that relate to GME? Well if GME does the damage we think it will do then you need insurance. Which are basically options.\n\nQueue magnifying glass. If you look at any boomer stock and or blue chip etc there are 10s of thousands of puts for march 19th. \n\nFOR EVERY FUCKING large cap. Now lets look at the chaos/volatility fuel in this case VIX and VXX derivatives. \n\nConsidering how chaotic the market looks and the looming doom that is GME vix is really low. \nIf you look at VXX in particular for march 19th there are 80000 calls at $20 and 40000 at 40.\n\nIm no tin foil man but that seems like an elaborate setup for a rug pull and ive been through many. \n\nShitadel may use that as justification for shorts and right now theyre fucked. GME turn around, they lost their mole CFO and now the SEC is turning sides with new officials. This smells the ultimate exit.\n\nJDST, JNUG, UVXY, SVXY, AMD, BEYOND MEAT, THE piss, the coup, the shitcoins shill, montezation of WSB attempt, SPY FDs 0DTE and Trump Tweets I have been with WSB through it all and this time i want to contribute.\n\nTl;dr. Shitadel is planning the biggest rug pull ever and its powered by gamestop. How do you capture the violence that will occur to 401ks ane retirement? \n\nGamestop, VXX, and puts on \u201cinsert favorite boomer stock here\u201d or SPY.\n\nPositions \n\nGME: \nCalls for \n\n3/5\n3/12\n3/19\n3/26 \n\nat various strikes at 115-800\n\nVXX: \n\nCalls for\n3/19 at $40 for 500 calls adding an additional 500-1000 for insurance.\n\nFun position\nRKT\n\n3/12 at $25 for 45 calls. \n\nThey will be rolled into GME and additional puts across the market.\n\nAlso: 100+ shares and holding across 5 brokers https://imgur.com/a/urp4YcN\n\nLet me know and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 my fellow smooth brain \ud83e\udde0 \ud83e\udd8d  brothers! Ice cream on me when this is over \ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\n\nSide note i bet a girl to marry me at 10000 on GME make sure it happens y\u2019all invited to the livestream.\n\nEdit: A SILVER? Spend it ON GME, also when and if we implode load up on the dip! You now can feel like rich billionaires crashing the market to buy cheap shit! Or you know LONG black berry\n\nEdit2: Shoutout to the boys over at the other subreddits with the amazing DD you all helped me develop a wrinkle you know who you are. Pixel man and New guy\n\nEdit3: added shares for confirmation bias and \ud83e\udd8d hype for bananas \ud83c\udf4c",
