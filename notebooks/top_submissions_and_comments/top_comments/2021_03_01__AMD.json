        "body": "Also the additional question people ask...\n\nWell if the hedge funds are trading stocks then why can't they sell those shares to cover the short positions.\n\nThis is where the illegal morally but legal system comes into play.\n\nThe hedge fund have been borrowing non existance shares from clearing house and using those to short the system. So they actually don't own any stock to close their short positions. when you see people say that they have shorted 137% of the market it means they can't even buy back all real shares in the market to close positions. So they are bleeding every day a lot of money.\n\nOne of the rules is that when they borrow a stock they will promise to return the stock in x days to the borrower and each day it costs 0.5% in interest of the stock value.\n\nSo now they have x days to drive the stock price down enough to cover their interest payments and make a profit. And remeber they do this every day, hundreds of thousands of transactions all with different parameters as things get worse.\n\nNow this is managable on a small scale but when you have it on the scale if GME its not possible. They do this every day trying to push the price down. And remember interest is a % so when the price starts to rise that is 0.5 turns into 0.5 of the current stock price. So if we hold our positions they just keep bleeding amd when the short positions are called they need to go and buy real stock at the real price. So if we hold and don't sell the price keeps going up as the more they buy the more the price rised.\n\nDiaclaimer: I have no idea what I talk about, read up about naked short selling and also about fake share issuers for trading and cry because rules don't apply for the rich.",

What percentage of the market values companies purely in DCF anyway?\n\nI think this is more a broader correction around fears that the Fed will not live up to it's word on 'average inflation targeting' and will have to raise rates sooner and quicker than normal. I personally can't see this happening, as the Fed has shown itself to be extremely dovish and is trying to recover the real economy first (jobs ans solvency issues). \n\nThere is also the huge debt problem they now have from all the money printing they've done, the easiest way for them to solve that is to inflate it away as quickly as possible, so long term high inflation seems like something they would try for. I can't see the USA going into any kind of austerity to pay it off.",

This informs me of the company's current and potential long-term plans. I also want to know how large the industry is, so I'll look at the market caps of other companies in the industry. If you google \"addressable market of company x\", there might be a report about that. If you don't find it for the company in question, then try googling its closest competitors. Preferably, the industry is very large or the company is one of the smaller ones as this suggests there can be a long runway of growth.\n\nHow quickly the company will grow might be the easiest of these three points to evaluate. I tend to look for consistent high growth (&gt;40%) and strong forecasted growth. This isn't a requirement as companies like [AMD](https://theportfoliolab.com/summary/AMD) have experienced poor historical growth, but their current future looks good (I own some shares in AMD). Nonetheless, I still see it as a positive. As I tend to invest in unprofitable, smaller companies ($5-10B), I pay more attention to revenue and gross profit growth, rather than net income. I use this [correlation](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare) feature as a guide for which metrics to focus on by measuring the correlation between market cap and revenue, gross profit, net income for the company's industry.\n\nTo evaluate how expensive the company is, I'll compare its growth vs price-to-X ratio, where X is usually revenue or gross profit. I prefer to pay more attention to gross profit than revenue as that includes gross margin in the calculation. I think companies that perform a similar service, but at a higher margin (more efficient), should have a higher valuation. Price-to-gross profit growth ratio (similar to [PEG ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp)), is useful as it balances gross profit growth and price-to-gross profit ratio. I see expansiveness as a relative concept, so I'll use this [distribution](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare) feature to compare companies within an industry.\n\nSo to summarise: (1) Large and growing market (2) high, consistent gross profit growth (3) low price-to-gross profit ratio",

On one hand you want to puke up your lunch but on the other hand.... we should want this drop in tech and the chance to buy back the key growth companies.  \n\nI bought AAPL, NVDA, AMD, AVGO, XLE and DB (to add some more financials and energy to my portfolio).  This keeps me balanced and I can wait out the pain that tech is providing.  \n\nMy biggest gains that I have held are from VIAC, SBUX, HP, JPM, STOR, LUMN, SPY, and a host of others.\n\nLet's see if adding to tech this week will pay off.",

People have been researching and developing this technology recently. The biggest issue is that purifiers are extremely costly and can cause more harm than good if they arent installed properly. They want to spend a lot of money on marketing to properly educate people how and where to install it, so I doubt its going to cost 45k$, probably more towards 50-60k$, but that is still a massive difference.\n\nAs for how it will end up performing on the stock market, I doubt the stock will keep rising, but I am fairly certain that it will at the very least spike once it is proven to have any positive results on covid, let alone that a lot of aging purifiers can be replaced with higher end hardware for the same cost.  \n\n\nAs for which ticker belongs to the company providing the new technology, I have no clue exactly, but according to other comments, there is vyst(for cheap play), LLC, trox, carr, jci(carr and jci might already be too late to invest), xiaomi, haier and midea(last three for china market).
