        "body": "This is a great question, and it\u2019s one that I think each person will answer differently. In general, I believe the more that you can put under one umbrella/ management console, the better for the customer.  It can also be better for the service provide/ sales team at the tech partner because it gives them an easier runway to sell more product into the customer environment. But the last part you said is key, which is integration. As of late, Cisco has not done a great job integrating all of their products to talk to each other. I\u2019ve been a huge Cisco fan for years, and it\u2019s one of the first times I can say they are struggling. It took their NGFW a very long time to work well with their own products, let alone other products. \n\nI think the second thing to look at is the simplicity of its rivals products. Nutanix is so incredibly easy to run (especially if you buy it on SuperMicro which is their OEM hardware) that it doesn\u2019t matter if they are the only product in an environment, it makes more sense to sometimes buy 5 very easy to use solution from 5 different companies instead of 5 difficult solutions from the same company. \n\nFinally, I think most of these \u201cone off companies\u201d are starting to have a broader portfolio. For example, most people think of Fortinet as just a firewall company. But they also have switches, access points, endpoint security, email security, IP Phones, SD-WAN, and sandboxing capabilities. So customers, IT partners, MSP, etc all have the same ability to offer a platform of products and solutions. And my personal opinion is a majority of customers have responded to the management and ease of use of Fortinet better than the Cisco platform. An enterprise company with an IT Staff of several hundred would argue it\u2019s not a problem managing Cisco because well, they have several hundred guys that can do it :-)\n\nCisco is slowly starting to bring their products together, and I think have realized that their customers and partners aren\u2019t going to buy/sell Cisco anymore because it has a Cisco logo on it. For the first time, Hyperflex is actually a well working solution, but it\u2019s 5 years after Nutanix went to market and they are so late to the game.  Their SD-Wan product is finally starting to work very well, but I would have a hard time recommending it without looking at a solution like Velocloud or CloudGenix, who offer much better solutions.  They also have to compete against the telecoms who are baking in SD-WAN, which is eating more potential market share. \n\nI dont want to be hating on Cisco too much. They have excellent leadership and I think they will always be relevant, I think they are just trying to discover their new identity. \n\nI hope this helps, and feel free to ask more questions!  As I mentioned, very amateur investor, but know the tech world pretty well! One day it might even help me invest more efficiently :-)",

Like you see you listed panw, ftnt, for network security ..but then listed duo and it's competition as okta .. hci hyperex and it's competition nutanix .. but no one competitor of csco seems to do all csco does. \n\nDoesn't this have some benefit? If I am a procurement guy for tech for a company I would try to squeeze most return from one vendor for 4-5 products rather than trying to deal with 5 vendors and deal with each alone. This alone helps reduce the amount of work needed. \n\nPlus I am not sure how well different csco products talk to each other.  But that can be a big positive for them.  \n\nLooking forward to your response",
