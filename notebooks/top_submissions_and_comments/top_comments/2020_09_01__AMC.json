The company has missed earnings expectations every quarter going back a few years (Negative earnings at that)\n\n\\- Expenses have exploded due to retrofitting requirements for theatres to reduce the chance of COVID transmission.\n\n\\-Only 70% of theatres are open, these are the theatres with typically the lowest revenue as well. On top of this AMC is offering 99 cent tickets and reduced concessions. This means they are losing money on every ticket they sell.\n\n\\- HEAVY debt burdens, AMC had to take out a massive loan of hundreds of millions at a 10%+ interest rate in order to avoid bankruptcy a couple of months ago. Stock shot up?? I guess stonks only go up on news.\n\n\\-Movie studios are considering alternate forms of delivery, primarily pay per view for new movies. Theatres eat up half of the movie studios' revenue on a new release up to the first 90 days. Releasing on PPV allows for the studios to retain 100% of their revenue.\n\n\\-Ticket sales have declined YOY since 2000, this industry was struggling and dying before COVID hit. Don't believe me? Look at historical earnings and their stock prices.\n\n\\-This is a slam dunk return, even if AMC does not go bankrupt the stock price WILL come down, just wait till the next round of earnings when they touch on bankruptcy again, or the chaos of the election in October.\n\n\\-Primary risk is COVID vaccine coming out in October could cause the price to shoot up, but not for long. Also the irrational RH crowd buying AMC because \"DURRR WHO WONT GO TO THE MOVIES DURRR\"",

Then AMC moved out of the market and sold to Landmark Cinemas, and I like them even better than I did AMC.\n\nIt doesn't seem like they know what they're doing when companies like Landmark only seem to be expanding whereas Cineplex is closing down theatres.\n\nBut I also don't think movie theatres are profitable right now. Maybe they'll make a comeback but I can't see them doing good numbers for the next year at least. Most people are wary of going to the movies right now and will probably continue to be, and on top of that the people who did go regularly have probably gotten used to not being able to go by now.\n\nAnd at this point I don't know if I really care if movie theatres go under. Like 90% of what they show is superhero garbage anyway. I get there are people who enjoy that, but the rise of superhero blockbusters has coincided with me losing interest in going to the movie theatre. It's very rare that a movie comes out where I actually care about seeing it in the theatres - Dune is the only one in the last couple years, and given the current situation I'll be happy just watching it at home instead.",

So there could be a sixth. But at this point, there are basically 5 major producers of fiction content, and one non-fiction producer (Discovery who owns HGTV, Food Network, TLC, etc.), and a handful of news companies, and then there\u2019s sports, too (Fox, Sinclair, etc). But for fictional content, we\u2019re looking at 5-6 players. \n\nWhen there\u2019s only 5 to 6 players, they\u2019ll probably all succeed. There could be consolidation over time and we end up with 3 (Disney, Comcast and ATT). But things have come a long way in fiction content from 3 network channels to 100 cable TV channels back to a handful of companies dominating it. \n\nIt will be interesting to watch how it all plays out.\n\nEdit: Viacom CBS could be the one that buys AMC Networks, too.",

Here's my understanding -- \n\nThe company is drowning in debt and burnt through nearly 300M in cash in Q1 before the pandemic took hold completely. Since then all theatres were shuttered, it kept burning cash. They opened 70% of them recently but are heavily discounting the tickets and concessions which will no doubt hurt revenue and margins. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the million-dollar question is, how the hell is this stock back to pre-COVID prices? Keep in mind it was failing back then too! Now with Disney releasing Mulan on its platform, other entertainment studios are bound to follow because they don't have to share half their revenues with the theatres. There is bound to be a correction prior to the election and with their earnings due on November 4th, I think it makes sense to buy the cheapest in the money puts, no way they have blowout earnings, in fact, I am confident they will miss analyst estimates by a longshot. \n\nThis could be really easy money boys.",

AMC fell 0.36% today which is pretty much nothing. Most inta-day price action is completely random. Perhaps try some 2 - 10 plays.

So I\u2019d buy in NVDA a little bit, as it also Wall Street\u2019s favorite out of the three\n\nAccenture is a good investment, I like that quite a bit\n\nAlso can\u2019t go wrong with buying in VOO and QQQ, and for younger investor\u2019s ARKK is personally where it\u2019s at too.\n\nAmazon is a decent hedge against Lowe\u2019s too that I\u2019d think about",
