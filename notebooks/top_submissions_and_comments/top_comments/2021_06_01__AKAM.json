Any website, particularly those with static content (those that are article based, or even a site like reddit that has fairly permanent comments as their primary content) can offset costs for serving content by using a CDN to cache these static pages and resources rather than paying for the networking and server capacity to handle every request.\n\nFastly's advantage over its competitors (Akamai, AWS Cloudfront, numerous others) is its simple configuration interface using a version of the well known proxy, Varnish. It is exceptionally flexible, being text based, and Fastly provides an API which can be used to programmatically manage the configuration. Fastly also has an extensive worldwide network of POPs (point of presence, basically a data center hosting a connected instance of their service). They have the capability to bring up a new POP in a few weeks, which is fairly unique among their competitors, though for a customer to directly benefit (i.e. require a new POP) they would need to be exceedingly large and/or pay a lot.\n\nAs for customers, I transitioned Refinery29 (now merged into Vice Media) onto them some years ago, and will always advocate for them when their use would be beneficial at any company I work at, but otherwise can't speak to their overall strategy.",
