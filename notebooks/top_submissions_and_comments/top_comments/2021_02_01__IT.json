        "body": "Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.\n\nThen that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan. \n\nThat then accelerates the selling. \n\nWhich then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what to do ? \n\nIf you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do. \n\nWhy ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work. \n\nI have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.\n\nI know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.",

I\u2019m planning on getting g out of RH for obvious reasons, any retail trading companies you\u2019d recommend? I want to support free trade and hit Robinhood in the wallet for what they\u2019ve done here. Also, any legitimacy to a class action suit against them? \n\nPick the brokerage with the strongest balance sheet. What ruined it on RH is that they didnt have enough cash to deal with the growth in accounts, margin loans and volatility. The EXACT SAME THING will happen at the next broker if you dont make sure they have a MULTI-TRILLION dollar balance sheet to be able to handle these kind of circumstances \n\nAnd there will be class action suits. And they will be combined and they will win and you will get a check for less than $10",

What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\n\nIn the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!\n\nThe corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!\n\nWhat they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.\n\nPeople, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!\n\nThey will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.\n\nThey are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!\n\nHERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;\n\nNo matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...\n\nTHEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It\u2019s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.\n\nThey can\u2019t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!\n\nEveryone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.\n\nIf everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.\n\nPlease upvote, share etc. Don\u2019t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what\u2019s necessary and finally get ours. We\u2019ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It\u2019s time for change.\n\nGME &amp; AMC are the main focus.

From diffrent sorts of media, countries and perspectives, basically everything i can get my hands on. And let me tell you one thing, ***the world is ill.***\n\nThe coronavirus hit the world hard, everywhere and more or less homogeneous. Germany, USA, Europe, Russia, China, you name it. Every country is handling the problem on its own. And besides China, with their guerilla tactics on the virus and mass surveillance with big brother, the majority of the countries are doing pretty fuc\\*\\*\\* bad at it. Bascially every single country in the world is fighting the virus in expense of us humans. They restrict every privat aspect in our lives, just to keep the economy running as long as possible. Bailing out huge privat companies with tax money, pumping trillions of fresh cash into a system which is already at the bottom with 0 intrest rates all over the world. Investing and promoting climate-killing activites. All of that, because **the economy** is ruling every single country. Not the elected parties or politicans, all of them are just on the payroll of big corporations. They (big corp) set the Laws and rules which we all have to obey. It does not fuck\\*\\*\\* matter if you fight dems vs. reps, at the bottom, both parties are payed and controlled by big corp. Its the same in Germany, Russia, Spain and all over the world. Some are ruled by obvious corrupt dicators, some are better hidden with \"elected\" parties and representatives. At the end we - the people - are working and living exclusively for the purpose to serve the rich, wealthy, 1%.\n\nWe have to empower the people, showing them the mirror. We dont fight reps vs. dems. ; Black vs. white ; Immigrant vs. citizen ; you name it. We have to fight the 1%, the rich. They try everything to drive a wedge betweeen us the people. Making us hating each other, fighting each other. But GUYS were all on the same side. **Everyone of us 99%.**\n\nThe unequal distribution of wealth in the world is peaking never seen before in history. We all get pissed on our heads by our governments and they dont even have the decency to sell it as rain. People all over the place working in systemically relevant jobs earning the least money and having the greatest risk of all. All that while the Stockmarkets are skyrocketing and Billionairs and Millionairs are just getting richer and richer every. single. day. People struggeling making ends meet, living paycheck to paycheck, still recovering from 2008.\n\nAnd as this global pandemic is ongoing and finally uncovering who the government/big corps really cares about. People start to become awake of the situation. Schools are all over the place garbage, the Health system is stressed out, privatized and monetized for max profit. Riots taking place all over the world. Rioting against dicators, corrupt governments and mishandling the pandemic, everything in favor of big corp.\n\nI was devistated and felt powerless, knowing i couldnt change anything by myself in this fuc\\*\\*ed up rigged system.\n\nThat was until last week...\n\n# You crazy motherf**** autists.\n\nI do not exaggerate, when i say, - **this is History in the making** \\- All it takes are some brave, loyal, and stupid apes liking the Stock. Thats it. The financial system is on the merge of collapse and we\u00b4re witnissing a never seen before wealth transfer. This thing will change the market and the world for all future.\n\nI finally found a way to take action in the revolution we need. Simply liking $GME **\ud83d\ude80** and buying all the stocks I fuc\\*\\*\\* can **\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** . I already build a position last week and will buy more moday morning **\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c** . I yolo everything i have in, I dont even care. This is a once in a liftime opportunity for us to make a change in the rigged system. We cant live and work only for the rich an wealthy. Apes together strong!!!\n\nSo take your shot, seize the opportunity, dont let it slip and make the **GAME STOP**\n\n# #POWER TO THE PEOPLE\n\n# #EAT THE RICH\n\n \n\n# $GME I just love the Stock \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice or whatsoever, im just your everyday normal guy",

        "body": "I'm going to explain what volume and open interest are because it appears no one in this thread understands. Regarding the $800C's...\n\nThe open interest of 6,687 refers to the number of contracts that were OPEN prior to the start of the trading day. The open interest (OI) is updated once per day PRIOR to open; it is not updated again until premarket the following trading day. You also don't know if those are long or short calls - it's impossible to tell from OI alone. OI just tells you how many contracts are \"open,\" and you can sell a call to open - effectively shorting the underlying.\n\nThe volume for those $800C today was 16k. Volume includes all transactions that occurred this day i.e. sell to open, buy to open, sell to close, buy to close.  So 16k volume doesn't mean 16,000 contracts were open. It could mean 7k contracts were bought to open + 7k were sold to close (could've been opened/closed the same day) + 2k were sold to open. In that example, the volume is 16k even though the net effect was selling to open 2k contracts.\n\nSo how do you interpret the volume? You compare OI on consecutive days.\n\nTomorrow morning the OI will update to reflect the total number of open contracts, so the previous 6.6k may go up OR down depending if net contracts were open or closed. If we use that above example of net 2k contracts sold to open -&gt; tomorrow's OI would be 6.6k + 2k = 8.6k. So you can't look at that 8.6k and say \"That must mean there are 8,600 long calls\" because we just explained that we know 2,000 are short calls...and we have no idea about the other 6,600.\n\nStill, even after looking at how OI changes, it's impossible to say if those are buys or sells without looking at the order book/flow. For example, if the OI goes up by 2k those could be 2k long calls, 2k short calls, or some combination.\n\nThe call flow OP posted probably indicates OTM call buying because it's at the ask price (\"the \\_A\" indicates that), but in that same screenshot he posted there was some large ATM put buying. In this screenshot you could say there were 2k calls bought vs. 1.2k puts, but you have to remember the puts are much closer to the money so they will have a much greater effect on how MM's hedge.\n\nThere's been a lot of misinformation here recently, so hopefully this explains what vol/OI mean.",

The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It\u2019s illegal market manipulation at its finest.\n\nHedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.\n\nIn reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you\u2019d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.\n\nSo, stop panicking pussies. They\u2019ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven\u2019t already.
