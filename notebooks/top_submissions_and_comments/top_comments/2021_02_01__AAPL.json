        "body": "Those of us who have bought in have to remember why we bought in: we believed that GME was worth more than the share price.  DFV had this conviction and so he bought and held.  Daddy Cohen brought the value play up even further.  He believed so heavily in the company that he bought 12.9% and brought 2 ex-Chewy members on the board.  RC has conviction that he can stage a turn around.  \n\nMost of us grew up gaming and remember that you couldn't find shit at anywhere other than Gamestop or EB Games.  Since EB Games got bought out by Gamestop, Gamestop became the only player.  We ALL know that gaming has seen a huge uptick in 2020 (COVID) and even before then.  How many of your friends' kids, your little nieces/nephews, your own kids are glued to a freaking screen?  Gamestop.com is now offering PC parts and there's been a lot of DD that Gamestop will start having build-a-pc kiosks which is amazing because you literally cannot do that at any other retail location. And don't forget their current online sales, they are already spectacular at 300% YoY!!  Yes, COVID drove online sales, but this isn't a dead company.  There's probably less risk buying GME at $50 than Apple at $2.   \n\nAll the short's thesis of Gamestop being the next Blockbuster was built on hubris; they've paid for that in the last few weeks.  They have again opened new short positions and those are now printing heavily, but how long will that last?  They probably still think that Gamestop is still the next Blockbuster, but it will just take a longer time to die due to the uptick of the new console release.  Short float as of yesterday 2/1/2021 was 226.42% according to this [source.](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today).  Cost to borrow was at 20-25% according to Ortex which is still insanely high. Regardless of winning position, they need to pay interest on their position.  Will that explode in their face again?  I believe it will when Gamestop has another big catalyst or there's the turn around story. \n\nIs the stock worth $80 right now?  I have no idea.  Is it worth $150?  No idea?  $30/share?  No idea.  Is Tesla worth almost $900?  No idea, but someone will pay almost $900/share for Tesla.  \n\nHere's something insightful that was posted right before all this GME madness took hold.  It's a great reminder on how and why we invest.\n\n[A Venture Capital Perspective on GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=wallstreetbets&amp;utm_content=t3_lbc758)\n\nI'm still holding 800+ shares and sold 4x 2/5 45p.  If the price does hit $45 on Friday, I'll take these shares and hold.",

Have you ever heard of the DTCC telling brokers that they have to now front 100% of all shares bought? It may have happened before, but in low profile cases. In December, sec fail to deliver of GME shares was 1.7m shares, that\u2019s about 2% of float. Compare that to Apple whose fail to deliver was .0002%, not even a percentage point. For the first two weeks of January, before GME made the news cycle, the fail to deliver was over 10mm shares, 14% of float. Michael Burry tweeted last week that in March of 2020 he recalled his shares of GME and it took weeks for brokers to get them. There is some crazy shit happening here and everything points to someone not wanting people to buy GME. Will this bet payoff, I have no idea, but to say that this squeeze play was a sham goes against everything that\u2019s played out so far. I can\u2019t tell or advise you what to do, but I\u2019m in it just to see this thing through and the worst case scenario, for me, is that I own shares in GameStop for the rest of my life, almost as though I actually made a real investment.

They control the ability to create brand new futures contracts out of thin air to bring the spot price down. But spot price doesn\u2019t mean shit if there is no silver to buy. The physical silver market extremely tight, 100% of yearly production gets used every year meanwhile on the paper markets 1-2 billion ounces get traded daily whilst a mere 750-850 million ounces are mined every year and even less than that in 2020, the already weak system is weaker now more than ever.\n\nHave a read of the rest of my comment and take a look at some of the stuff I\u2019ve linked. To be clear I\u2019m not saying sell GME and go to silver, I\u2019m saying once you\u2019ve stuck it to the man for GME, let\u2019s really stick it to all the banks that rely of this metals manipulation so that they can keep a fiat currency going and enjoy being the recipients of bailouts while you and your children inherit the invisible tax of inflation.\n\nThere may be some bots but I can assure you there is legitimacy to this argument.\n\n**Physical silver is no trap, It is simply people who have been following the silver short for literal years and have become encouraged by the recent happenings in the market.**\n\nWhatever your choice is ensure you absolutely **DO NOT BUY SLV, that is 100% a trap.**\n\nThe truth is, sure you\u2019re sticking it to the man but other hedge funds are also making money - which I find no issue with but fundamentally you have not changed the system which allows this to happen. If you truely want to stick it to the man I urge you to do some research on silver whilst you enjoy holding GME as many of us are.\n\nSome details here;\n\nSilvers use is largely inelastic, whether it cost $20oz or $100oz apple will still buy it to make iPhones, Samsung will still buy it to make their phones, white goods companies will still purchase it to make their appliances. Those pushing for the green deals will not care about the price, they will just continue printing to fund their deals and this just plays into the cantillon effect.\n\nThe addition of investor demand will be too much for the fragile system. A system where silver is primarily produced as a byproduct/pollutant in the mining of other metals.\n\nIf silver goes up, it will take gold up with it, but it must be through silver because, as stated it is inelastic and almost 100% of production is used every year and in some cases such as this year more than 100%. With gold, the central banks can easily flood the market and we will quickly run out of cash with which to buy the gold that comes out of cold storage.\n\nSilver is the Achilles heel of the financial system, as silver goes up - gold must follow; if gold follows then confidence in the dollar is lost since gold is generally a fear trade (let\u2019s not forget bonds have a negative real yield). If confidence in the dollar is lost, central banks must revert to honest money. The most likely and least disruptive way this would occur is by a revaluation of the price of gold and silver relative to the amount of fiat dollars that exist. The banks have been buying gold for years in anticipation of such an event.

An investment bank or pension fund or bond fund will buy the bond for 100. Then the government wants to increase the money supply right now so they buy the $105 promised note for 104 in June 2020. There is now $104 more in existence than before because the feds printed it and bought the bond with it. However Apple will have to pay $105 to whoever holds the bond (the fed reserve) in May 2021. The feds get the cash from Apple and the spread of $1 is in now in the reserve. The move was upfront inflationary yes but long term deflationary by $1. This is why post 2008 we saw very little inflation.",

        "body": "**Listen here you absolute fucking apes**\n\nSLV is shit because you don\u2019t own it and it uses leased silver anyway, you can\u2019t even get delivery unless you own 50,000 units and also must be an \u2018approved buyer\u2019.\n\n**HOLD GME** and buy Physical silver after GME.\n\nBuying anything other than physical is playing in the banks sandpit. They control the ability to create brand new futures contracts out of thin air to bring the spot price down. But spot price doesn\u2019t mean shit if there is no silver to buy. The physical silver market extremely tight, 100% of yearly production gets used every year meanwhile on the paper markets 1-2 billion ounces get traded daily whilst a mere 750-850 million ounces are mined every year and even less than that in 2020, the already weak system is weaker now more than ever.\n\nHave a read of the rest of my comment and take a look at some of the stuff I\u2019ve linked. To be clear I\u2019m not saying sell GME and go to silver, I\u2019m saying once you\u2019ve stuck it to the man for GME, let\u2019s really stick it to all the banks that rely of this metals manipulation so that they can keep a fiat currency going and enjoy being the recipients of bailouts while you and your children inherit the invisible tax of inflation.\n\nThere may be some bots but I can assure you there is legitimacy to this argument.\n\n**Physical silver is no trap, It is simply people who have been following the silver short for literal years and have become encouraged by the recent happenings in the market.**\n\nWhatever your choice is ensure you absolutely **DO NOT BUY SLV, that is 100% a trap.**\n\nThe truth is, sure you\u2019re sticking it to the man but other hedge funds are also making money - which I find no issue with but fundamentally you have not changed the system which allows this to happen. If you truely want to stick it to the man I urge you to do some research on silver whilst you enjoy holding GME as many of us are.\n\nSome details here;\n\nSilvers use is largely inelastic, whether it cost $20oz or $100oz apple will still buy it to make iPhones, Samsung will still buy it to make their phones, white goods companies will still purchase it to make their appliances. Those pushing for the green deals will not care about the price, they will just continue printing to fund their deals and this just plays into the cantillon effect.\n\nThe addition of investor demand will be too much for the fragile system. A system where silver is primarily produced as a byproduct/pollutant in the mining of other metals.\n\nIf silver goes up, it will take gold up with it, but it must be through silver because, as stated it is inelastic and almost 100% of production is used every year and in some cases such as this year more than 100%. With gold, the central banks can easily flood the market and we will quickly run out of cash with which to buy the gold that comes out of cold storage.\n\nSilver is the Achilles heel of the financial system, as silver goes up - gold must follow; if gold follows then confidence in the dollar is lost since gold is generally a fear trade (let\u2019s not forget bonds have a negative real yield). If confidence in the dollar is lost, central banks must revert to honest money. The most likely and least disruptive way this would occur is by a revaluation of the price of gold and silver relative to the amount of fiat dollars that exist. The banks have been buying gold for years in anticipation of such an event. They are well aware of what they\u2019re doing.\n\nYou can find a pretty comprehensive report on silver in the In Gold We Trust Report on and after page 249;\n\n[https://ingoldwetrust.report/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/In-Gold-We-Trust-report-2020-Extended-Version-english.pdf](https://ingoldwetrust.report/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/In-Gold-We-Trust-report-2020-Extended-Version-english.pdf)\n\n**Also check out this solid post:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7zzg0/silver\\_an\\_undervalued\\_inflation\\_hedge\\_with\\_short/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7zzg0/silver_an_undervalued_inflation_hedge_with_short/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",
