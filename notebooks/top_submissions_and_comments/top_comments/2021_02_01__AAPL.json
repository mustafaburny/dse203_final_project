Musk, however, did \u2013 with just one sentence presumably aimed at The Post\u2019s owner, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\n\n&gt; \u201cGive my regards to your puppet master,\u201d Musk responded after a request for comment from the newspaper.\n\n&gt;     \u201cTesla did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In response to emails seeking comment, Musk replied only: \u201cGive my regards to your puppet master.\u201d\n\n&gt;     \u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) February 23, 2021\n\n&gt; Bezos owns The Post, as noted in the article, and is mentioned as one of the examples of the potential for giant companies to stumble amid change. The Post noted that Apple CEO Steve Jobs\u2019 2011 death \u201cprompted what some view as a loss of innovation at the tech giant.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cAmazon will soon face the transition of founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos to executive chairman, testing the culture he\u2019s instilled. (Bezos owns The Washington Post),\u201d the article added before pointing out some of Musk\u2019s political comments throughout the global pandemic.\n\n&gt; \u201cHe knows whatever he says, people do and he\u2019s taking advantage of it,\u201d one anonymous employee reportedly said of Musk, according to The Post.\n\n&gt; The worker reportedly recalled telling a co-worker that Musk \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about you\u201d and will \u201cruin you,\u201d the piece also noted.\n\nhttps://dailycaller.com/2021/02/23/elon-musk-flames-the-washington-post-tesla-puppet-master/",

Between the limit on buying stocks and hedge funds trading between themselves to drive the price down, and creating a distraction (SLV) to draw attention and fill pockets, this should be throwing off a significantly larger red flag than \"ERMERGERD WSB SAYS GME WORTH $69,420 LOOL\". Who gives a shit, you're completely missing the point here. Short sellers expose themselves to basically unlimited risk. But that risk never actually materializes for them because they can just cheat the system. Meanwhile someone can go buy a stock and lose value because of *their* game OR someone can go short a stock and become insolvent while the *big boys on WallStreet* walk away.\n\nGME isn't an isolated incident. BB, NOK, AMC and a number of others are getting hammered- and have been getting hammered since last Wednesday because the people on the losing side don't want to lose at the game they created for themselves. BB basically experienced a rug pull- it didn't taper off or settle in the 20's... it looks like someone pulled a plug. Look at what happened a month ago (or more) with PLTR and Shitron. Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia... AMD have all been recent targets of this institutional wide short selling.",

        "body": "Those of us who have bought in have to remember why we bought in: we believed that GME was worth more than the share price.  DFV had this conviction and so he bought and held.  Daddy Cohen brought the value play up even further.  He believed so heavily in the company that he bought 12.9% and brought 2 ex-Chewy members on the board.  RC has conviction that he can stage a turn around.  \n\nMost of us grew up gaming and remember that you couldn't find shit at anywhere other than Gamestop or EB Games.  Since EB Games got bought out by Gamestop, Gamestop became the only player.  We ALL know that gaming has seen a huge uptick in 2020 (COVID) and even before then.  How many of your friends' kids, your little nieces/nephews, your own kids are glued to a freaking screen?  Gamestop.com is now offering PC parts and there's been a lot of DD that Gamestop will start having build-a-pc kiosks which is amazing because you literally cannot do that at any other retail location. And don't forget their current online sales, they are already spectacular at 300% YoY!!  Yes, COVID drove online sales, but this isn't a dead company.  There's probably less risk buying GME at $50 than Apple at $2.   \n\nAll the short's thesis of Gamestop being the next Blockbuster was built on hubris; they've paid for that in the last few weeks.  They have again opened new short positions and those are now printing heavily, but how long will that last?  They probably still think that Gamestop is still the next Blockbuster, but it will just take a longer time to die due to the uptick of the new console release.  Short float as of yesterday 2/1/2021 was 226.42% according to this [source.](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today).  Cost to borrow was at 20-25% according to Ortex which is still insanely high. Regardless of winning position, they need to pay interest on their position.  Will that explode in their face again?  I believe it will when Gamestop has another big catalyst or there's the turn around story. \n\nIs the stock worth $80 right now?  I have no idea.  Is it worth $150?  No idea?  $30/share?  No idea.  Is Tesla worth almost $900?  No idea, but someone will pay almost $900/share for Tesla.  \n\nHere's something insightful that was posted right before all this GME madness took hold.  It's a great reminder on how and why we invest.\n\n[A Venture Capital Perspective on GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=wallstreetbets&amp;utm_content=t3_lbc758)\n\nI'm still holding 800+ shares and sold 4x 2/5 45p.  If the price does hit $45 on Friday, I'll take these shares and hold.",

As in, if you wear anything but \"iglasses\" you'll look like a plebe. They will be overpriced pieces of garbage like all apple products but all the rich douche offs in san Francisco and new York will still buy them. We'll all be having virtual meetings with our stupid iglasses in 5 or 6 years. If you have kids, they'll be begging you for iglasses every Christmas and Birthday until you give in. Are you about to make it big from GME speculation tomorrow? Guess what, you're future trophy wife is going to want a Porsche Cayenne, an IPhone 17S, Airpods, and iglasses. \n\nSo yea, i'm in your boat, I'm not an apple fan, but I still feel like it's going to go up by 200% over the next 3 or 4 years. Then who knows. At some point these tech companies have to run out of ideas for stupid devices for us to use.",

Have you ever heard of the DTCC telling brokers that they have to now front 100% of all shares bought? It may have happened before, but in low profile cases. In December, sec fail to deliver of GME shares was 1.7m shares, that\u2019s about 2% of float. Compare that to Apple whose fail to deliver was .0002%, not even a percentage point. For the first two weeks of January, before GME made the news cycle, the fail to deliver was over 10mm shares, 14% of float. Michael Burry tweeted last week that in March of 2020 he recalled his shares of GME and it took weeks for brokers to get them. There is some crazy shit happening here and everything points to someone not wanting people to buy GME.

They control the ability to create brand new futures contracts out of thin air to bring the spot price down. But spot price doesn\u2019t mean shit if there is no silver to buy. The physical silver market extremely tight, 100% of yearly production gets used every year meanwhile on the paper markets 1-2 billion ounces get traded daily whilst a mere 750-850 million ounces are mined every year and even less than that in 2020, the already weak system is weaker now more than ever.\n\nHave a read of the rest of my comment and take a look at some of the stuff I\u2019ve linked. To be clear I\u2019m not saying sell GME and go to silver, I\u2019m saying once you\u2019ve stuck it to the man for GME, let\u2019s really stick it to all the banks that rely of this metals manipulation so that they can keep a fiat currency going and enjoy being the recipients of bailouts while you and your children inherit the invisible tax of inflation.\n\nThere may be some bots but I can assure you there is legitimacy to this argument.\n\n**Physical silver is no trap, It is simply people who have been following the silver short for literal years and have become encouraged by the recent happenings in the market.**\n\nWhatever your choice is ensure you absolutely **DO NOT BUY SLV, that is 100% a trap.**\n\nThe truth is, sure you\u2019re sticking it to the man but other hedge funds are also making money - which I find no issue with but fundamentally you have not changed the system which allows this to happen. If you truely want to stick it to the man I urge you to do some research on silver whilst you enjoy holding GME as many of us are.\n\nSome details here;\n\nSilvers use is largely inelastic, whether it cost $20oz or $100oz apple will still buy it to make iPhones, Samsung will still buy it to make their phones, white goods companies will still purchase it to make their appliances. Those pushing for the green deals will not care about the price, they will just continue printing to fund their deals and this just plays into the cantillon effect.\n\nThe addition of investor demand will be too much for the fragile system. A system where silver is primarily produced as a byproduct/pollutant in the mining of other metals.\n\nIf silver goes up, it will take gold up with it, but it must be through silver because, as stated it is inelastic and almost 100% of production is used every year and in some cases such as this year more than 100%. With gold, the central banks can easily flood the market and we will quickly run out of cash with which to buy the gold that comes out of cold storage.\n\nSilver is the Achilles heel of the financial system, as silver goes up - gold must follow; if gold follows then confidence in the dollar is lost since gold is generally a fear trade (let\u2019s not forget bonds have a negative real yield). If confidence in the dollar is lost, central banks must revert to honest money. The most likely and least disruptive way this would occur is by a revaluation of the price of gold and silver relative to the amount of fiat dollars that exist. The banks have been buying gold for years in anticipation of such an event. They are well aware of what they\u2019re doing.\n\nYou can find a pretty comprehensive report on silver in the In Gold We Trust Report on and after page 249;\n\n[https://ingoldwetrust.report/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/In-Gold-We-Trust-report-2020-Extended-Version-english.pdf](https://ingoldwetrust.report/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/In-Gold-We-Trust-report-2020-Extended-Version-english.pdf)\n\n**Also check out this solid post:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7zzg0/silver\\_an\\_undervalued\\_inflation\\_hedge\\_with\\_short/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7zzg0/silver_an_undervalued_inflation_hedge_with_short/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

They control the ability to create brand new futures contracts out of thin air to bring the spot price down. But spot price doesn\u2019t mean shit if there is no silver to buy. The physical silver market extremely tight, 100% of yearly production gets used every year meanwhile on the paper markets 1-2 billion ounces get traded daily whilst a mere 750-850 million ounces are mined every year and even less than that in 2020, the already weak system is weaker now more than ever.\n\nHave a read of the rest of my comment and take a look at some of the stuff I\u2019ve linked. To be clear I\u2019m not saying sell GME and go to silver, I\u2019m saying once you\u2019ve stuck it to the man for GME, let\u2019s really stick it to all the banks that rely of this metals manipulation so that they can keep a fiat currency going and enjoy being the recipients of bailouts while you and your children inherit the invisible tax of inflation.\n\nThere may be some bots but I can assure you there is legitimacy to this argument.\n\n**Physical silver is no trap, It is simply people who have been following the silver short for literal years and have become encouraged by the recent happenings in the market.**\n\nWhatever your choice is ensure you absolutely **DO NOT BUY SLV, that is 100% a trap.**\n\nThe truth is, sure you\u2019re sticking it to the man but other hedge funds are also making money - which I find no issue with but fundamentally you have not changed the system which allows this to happen. If you truely want to stick it to the man I urge you to do some research on silver whilst you enjoy holding GME as many of us are.\n\nSome details here;\n\nSilvers use is largely inelastic, whether it cost $20oz or $100oz apple will still buy it to make iPhones, Samsung will still buy it to make their phones, white goods companies will still purchase it to make their appliances. Those pushing for the green deals will not care about the price, they will just continue printing to fund their deals and this just plays into the cantillon effect.\n\nThe addition of investor demand will be too much for the fragile system. A system where silver is primarily produced as a byproduct/pollutant in the mining of other metals.\n\nIf silver goes up, it will take gold up with it, but it must be through silver because, as stated it is inelastic and almost 100% of production is used every year and in some cases such as this year more than 100%. With gold, the central banks can easily flood the market and we will quickly run out of cash with which to buy the gold that comes out of cold storage.\n\nSilver is the Achilles heel of the financial system, as silver goes up - gold must follow; if gold follows then confidence in the dollar is lost since gold is generally a fear trade (let\u2019s not forget bonds have a negative real yield). If confidence in the dollar is lost, central banks must revert to honest money. The most likely and least disruptive way this would occur is by a revaluation of the price of gold and silver relative to the amount of fiat dollars that exist. The banks have been buying gold for years in anticipation of such an event. They are well aware of what they\u2019re doing.\n\nYou can find a pretty comprehensive report on silver in the In Gold We Trust Report on and after page 249;\n\n[https://ingoldwetrust.report/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/In-Gold-We-Trust-report-2020-Extended-Version-english.pdf](https://ingoldwetrust.report/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/In-Gold-We-Trust-report-2020-Extended-Version-english.pdf)\n\n**Also check out this solid post:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7zzg0/silver\\_an\\_undervalued\\_inflation\\_hedge\\_with\\_short/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7zzg0/silver_an_undervalued_inflation_hedge_with_short/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

Additionally, for the last 10 years there's been consistent talk of apple being too big to have significant sales growth anymore and then they still manage to grow their sales and create new revenue streams. I bought apple in March and don't regret it.",

As someone who is really down mentally after losing money (not  my lifesavings, I was playing with 3k$) because of making an emotional call, posts like those make me feel a little better. Even though deep inside I am completely hopeless, those little posts without no logical backings make me feel a little better. And that's why they keep getting to the top. Most new WSB members are GME, AMC 'investors' and the subreddit is nothing like I remember since I first saw it. It was filled with crazy people for sure, but they had some rational analysis. Now I see one good post for every 10 to the moon post \n\nThe reason I feel so bad is not because I went with the hype created by people who went all emotional, but because I used my money that I was using to become better at trading to fuel a craze. I went against my own principles.\n\nI started investing in renewable energy last month and had a nice portfolio of PLUG, FCELL, AAPL and I made over 40% over my principle in just 1.5 months. And then I decided to sell those and go YOLO in AMC, GME. \n\nI am disappointed because I broke my own fundamentals and let emotions take over. \n\nI would appreciate any suggestion from anybody and just to let you know, I am still holding. But maybe not for long. I am just praying for a miracle (and I am not even religious).",
