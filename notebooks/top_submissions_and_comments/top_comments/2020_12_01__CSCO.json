Worth noting, there might be some rumors floating around that Cisco might acquire FSLY, which is why it pumped today. Short term, it might be a good trade, but doesn\u2019t help them for innovation. I think if those things pan out, investors will buy up NET instead. All speculation of course... https://mobile.twitter.com/JonahLupton/status/1334884445770436609",

Worth noting, there might be some rumors floating around that Cisco might acquire FSLY, which is why it pumped today. Short term, it might be a good trade, but doesn\u2019t help them for innovation. I think if those things pan out, investors will buy up NET instead. All speculation of course... https://mobile.twitter.com/JonahLupton/status/1334884445770436609",
