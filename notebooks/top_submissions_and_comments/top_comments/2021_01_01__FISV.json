Posted to promote discussion.\n\nDon't decide what you do based on what I think but here is the bear case for the catalyst for the GME sell-off:\n\nThe events of last Friday's gamma squeeze triggered the stocks run-up and possible short squeeze action we saw this week.\n\nMy thoughts are based on the market events of Wednesday 1/27.\n\nFrom Melvin Capital's most recent quarterly holdings filing (which can be read publicly here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml) we can almost say with certainty that they liquidated most, if not all of their long positions to cover losses with their short positions. I don't think they reloaded shorts yesterday - I think they are waiting to reload.\n\nAll their assumed short positions have run up over the last month, either due to Melvin covering or due to buys from traders making the same play that has been made on GME or a combination of both.\n\nI think one of these scenarios could play out next week,BE CAREFUL:\n\nOfficial short interest reports release for the end of the month are due for publication from NASDAQ on 2/9 (I am assuming the current reports are not accurate as they are not official). The short interest reports include up to 1/29 and are due for processing on 2/2. IF and ONLY IF they show a LOW short interest, this will trigger a major sell-off in the GME as without the high short interest there is NO MORE upside. I don't think Melvin Capital has given up in this yet, they are not done. Prior to that official data release, I believe they will reload shorts and then cover after the sell-off upon official data release, which is their next attempt to fuck the little guy.\nIf official short interest is still high, this could be another buy catalyst, but I don't think it will be. Melvin liquidating all its capital shows that they HAD to of covered. There has been so much buying and selling that it would have been less detectable to cover systemically throughout the week.\n\nIt depends on how you play this, if you hold you'll still be OK as the price won't drop. Everything points to next week being pretty tame and the 2nd week of February leading to a potential bloodbath. With low short interest on that report most people will have no choice but to sell off.\n\nSee below for all of my DD:\n\nMelvin's long positions include the following: (a majority of which were sold off between on Mon. 1/25 and Wed. 1/27 included below are the highs and lows of the week, I am not going to calculate the market caps but you can do it if you want but the MAJOR price action on no news indicates that these were Melvin selling off all or most of their position:\n\nADBE: H: 480.25, L: 454.97\nAAP: H: 160.11, L: 143.15\nAMD: H: 99.98, L: 86.22\nADYYF: H: 2435.60, L: 2076.56\nBABA: H: 267.98, L: 251.00\nALGN: H: 535.60, L: 507.77\nGOOG: H: 1935.00, L: 1806.48\nAEO: H: 25.46, L: 21.92\nPLAN: H: 73.00, L: 61.05\nTEAM: H: 240.15, L: 208.62\nAZO: H: 1241.39, L: 1111.71\nAVIS: H: 49.94, L: 38.89 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND)\nBKNG: H: 2109.51, L: 1860.73\nEAT: H: 67.53, L: 54.70\nBURL: H: 257.50, L: 234.07\nDRI: H: 124.94, L: 110.89\nDDOG: H: 112.29, L: 96.02\nDECK: H: 325.54, L: 276.70\nDOCU: H: 260, L: 221.89\nDPZ: H: 384.00, L: 366.50\nEXPE: H: 140.50, L: 118.30\nFICO: H: 514.75, L: 436.66\nRACE: H: 214.50, L: 203.00\nFISV: H: 108.65, L: 100.36\nGART: H: 161.08, L: 149.74\nHLT: H: 108.62, L: 98.10\nH: H: 72.33, L: 65.44\nIAA: H: 60.86, L: 52.31\nJD: H: 101.68, L: 88.22\nKAR: H: 19.94, L: 17.63 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND)\nLB: H: 46.31, L: 36.10\nLH: H: 234.30, L: 212.85 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND)\nLVS: H: 54.80, L: 47.44\nLAUR: H: 14.39, L: 13.00\nLYV: H: 74.34, L: 65.88\nLOW: H: 175.75, L: 166.50\nMA: H: 335.15, L: 312.38\nMCD: H: 215.51, L: 203.11\nMSFT: H: 247.7, L: 224.22 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND - GREAT EARNINGS REPORT)\nMSCI: H: 416.58, L: 380.00\nNKE: H: 141.88, L: 128.91\nNUAN: H: 51.00, L: 42.19\nPYPL: H: 256.20, L: 225.00\nPINS: H: 75.60, L: 62.15\nRHP: H: 68.18, L: 61.24\nSBAC: H: 279.57, L: 265.70\nSEA: H: 242.86, L: 202.00\nNOW: H: 563.88, L: 508.22\nSQ: H: 227.41, L: 194.50\nTPX: H: 29.84, L: 25.88\nTXRH: H: 79.87, L: 73.20\nTJX: H: 68.20, L: 62.24\nTUP: H: 34.08, L: 29.62\nTWTR: H: 52.99, L: 46.50 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND - SOLD OFF EARLIER IN MONTH)\nV: H: 205.33, L: 192.84\nWDAY: H: 240.60, L: 220.50\nWYNN: H: 109.95, L: 99.00\n\nSEC requirements do not require institutional traders to report shares held short, however they do require them to report puts; which from that we can infer Melvin also held shares short for the puts they owned: they hold puts for the following stocks:\n\nBBBY\nDDS\nELAN\nGME\nGSX\nHASI\nIRBT\nIRM\nLGND\nMNKKQ\nMLM\nMYL\nFIZZ\nOLLI\nSKT\nTRIN\nVIAC\n\n\u200b\n\nDisclaimer: I HAVE NO POSITION in GME - this is only my interpretation of the situation and not financial advice as I am not a registered financial professional.",

        "body": "Ok, I'll try to give a constructive reply to each of your replies.\n\n1. Like I said, ~140% is not illegal in the U.S. There's no need to bring up other countries. The short interest is ~55% if you include synthetic longs. The point is, this is not illegal in the States, and there was no naked shorting. \n\n2. There's good reason as to why Citadel bailed out Melvin. Melvin is a perfectly good hedge fund manager, that failed to account for the risk that a bunch of people would band together and try to short squeeze game stop. Melvin will now adjust for this factor. In the long term, I can see why Citadel believes Melvin will be able to outperform the market.\n\n3. I don't disagree that when DFV first discovered Gamestop, Gamestop was undervalued. I agreed with him at the time, and I held Gamestop until it hit ~$20/share. This was already a ~100% profit. If you read the WSJ interview with DFV, DFV clearly doesn't think Gamestop is undervalued anymore. If you look at DFV's posts on WSB, he's been decreasing and liquidating his position.  The media isn't missing anything. At maybe $10-30/share, Gamestop is undervalued. At $200-300/share, Gamestop is beyond overvalued. \n\n4. What was dishonest from Robinhood? The only dishonesty from Robinhood was their claim that they were not having a liquidity crunch. This claim doesn't hurt retailers at all. \n\n5. You keep saying \"these guys have screwed us for so long.\" I don't get where this comes from and that \"dumb money was never welcome at the table.\" I don't really get this sentiment. You're welcome to buy equities and also buy options as much as the funds are. Sure, you don't get to participate in some activities (such as buying at the IPO price), but this is really due to market regulation from Congress. \n\n6. I really, really recommend that you sell soon. You made your money, and you made a profit of a lifetime. You're literally acting like \"dumb money\" and the stupid retailer that everyone will laugh at, if you hold on to your shares until the very end. This is not a business that will last. Even if it does a hail-mary and somehow successfully transforms itself into a e-commerce retailer (against the likes of Amazon, Walmart, and etc.) the CURRENT PRICE ALREADY REFLECTS THAT POSSIBILITY. The stock price has exceeded Gamestop's ATH by many multiples, when Gamestop was at its prime.\n\n7. let's agree to disagree on the greed point. I don't really think it's morally reprehensible that Melvin was shorting GME. There are plenty of companies that are trading below cash value. If you think that shorting is bad, sure. I think shorting is useful for weeding out bad companies. It also allows people to hedge their long bets. \n\n8. If they engaged in illegal practices, you think the consequences won't be big. I think it's plenty big enough. Beyond just a fine, there may be criminal repercussions, a political backlash, a retail backlash, people taking out money from funds, being barred from the financial world, etc. etc. I don't know why you think they'll only get a slap on the wrist.\n\n9. If you exited a short position, why wouldn't you tell people? Is there any reason against doing so? Also, in this case, there was a reason for Melvin to tell people they were out. People were speculating that Melvin wasn't out, so they started shorting Melvin's long positions (or also just simply selling Melvin's long positions) in Fiserv, L Brands, Pinterest, Autozone, and etc, assuming that Melvin would have to exit long positions in order to cover. This obviously harms Melvin. \n\n10. The trading volume in Gamestop, for the past few days, is multiples of the short interest. The squeeze happened again and again. I'm not sure what more you're expecting. Short interests can stay high forever, with these levels of volume. That does not mean a short squeeze will be induced everytime. At a certain price point, the squeeze won't happen, and then the price will collapse. There's a limit to everything. And when the price collapses, I hope that you aren't the one holding. \n\n11. FWIW, based on Citadel data, it looks like retail is a net seller the past few days (and not a net buyer).",

Look at the price action on some of those top holdings (Fiserv, L Brands, Expedia, Pinterest) on the date that Melvin is claiming that they covered their short.\n\nYou see two things. First, all of Melvin's top holdings took a significant hit. You can interpret this as -- Melvin sold their long position stocks so they could cover their short position in GME.\n\nSecond, the volume on the GME was highest ever that day. You can also interpret this as Melvin having covered their short position.\n\nAdditionally, the only \"proof\" we have of Melvin's short position is Melvin's put option. Put options do not have to be covered, they just need to be sold at a discount. Melvin of course, likely did have a short position, but exactly how much they were short is anybody's guess.\n\nAnd finally, Melvin went on air saying that they closed their short position. If this was false, Melvin is likely committing securities fraud and will be liable in multiple ways.\n\nSo you have these four factors. What are the reasons you think Melvin is actually lying?

So I bought the stocks that I make good products I enjoy using and trust as a consumer of these products.  Full disclosure, I made these picks because their tech works and I feel that technical leadership in this area will beat out accounting, marketing, and other aspects of successful companies.  That bet has paid off with 300-400% gains in the last year for the companies I bought with every penny of available capital \\~yr ago.  Those were $NET, $CRWD, and $ZS I am still long on these.  I also was into $MSFT which is good in this respect and $ESTC (which I unfortunately sold around $100 because they were going sideways). I have since gone into $FROG, $PLTR, and $SUMO which are more recent IPOs.\n\nThere are a few categories of attack that you worry about from an IT organizational standpoint.  This list is in no particular order other than the first one because you asked about $NET.\n\n* Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)\n   * Cloudflare ($NET) is the best protection you can have for this.  End of story.  They have many other products that make them a great company. They have introduced a new set of tools that cover everything you need for a work anywhere company.  They also have made some things that do for cloud computing what CDNs (like Akamai) did for static content.  There main competitors are Fastly, Akamai, and Limelight but $NET is best from tech standpoint.\n* ID management and access control\n   * $MSFT, $OKTA, Ping, Sailpoint from login perspective\n   * $FROG is also good from the perspective of managing access control to intellectual property\n* Malicious websites and phishing \n   * $ZS, $PANO, Fortinet, and a few others play in this space\n* Post attack cleanup\n   * $CRWD is the best here\n   * $ESTC is actually the best but it is open source and european which I think had some negative influences for me as an investor.

It's an easier market to disrupt.\n\nOnce a company starts running their critical workloads and applications through the NET infrastructure, I suspect it would be much more difficult to pull away.  NET is more sticky for the customer.\n\nAs an alternative, I would offer up PANW or FTNT.

Others would include Carbon Black, Forcepoint, Proof Point, Qualys, Splunk, Imperva, and F5. I honestly am inclined to just dump money into Microsoft and stop trying to pick the next cybersecurity winners. Microsoft has a significant advantage over a lot of companies because a lot of people just next/next their way through Windows first setup so they can easily collect data to improve their endpoint products (Defender ATP is competent enough), Azure is an attractive alternative to AWS, and they're even dipping into things like the SIEM market with Azure Sentinel.

He's sometimes called the UK Warren Buffett for his extremely successful fund company, Fundsmith. \n\nNot exclusively a tech guy, but in contrast to Buffett's \"value\" style, I think Smith would call himself a \"quality\" investor. He's massively beaten the market over the past 10 years with picks like Intuit, Paypal, Microsoft, etc.\n\nRecent book by Terry Smith \"Investing for Growth\" is very well worth a read- it's a collection of all his writings with Fundsmith's annual letters and various others.",

        "body": "Hi.  Wow.  You've put a tremendous amount of work into all of this, and it's incredible of you to share.  I take a similar approach.  I use Morningstar reports (a popular analysts which you can access for free on Charles Schwab) to see if a business is good and favorably valued.  Morningstar focuses on qualitative analysis and also makes judgements about whether a business has a moat (no moat, narrow moat, wide moat).  So, my strategy is I look on Morningstar to see which companies have a wide moat.  Then I take notice on how a wider array of analysts including Morningstar values the current stock price.  All of this gives me some assurance that the company is long lasting and defensible, and it's a fair price.  Then I see which of these Wide Moat stocks are also in Ark Invest funds.  This tells me if the stock is also offensive.  I figure why not buy a business that Morningstar thinks is defensive and what Ark Invest thinks is offensive (growth).  There's actually a lot of companies that fall in this category.  They've included Google, Salesforce, Amazon, Adobe, Intuit, Ansyss, Roche, Novartis, Charles Schwab, Mercado Libre, Caterpillar, and probably a few others that I can't recall at the moment.  My last filter is that I do not buy companies that have a high debt to equity ratio.  I'm concerned about a future looming big debt crisis.  Anyways, I hope that helps you as well.",

        "body": "Sharing my reply from the original thread since the article leaves a lot of relevant info on how these platforms work:\n\nI work in FinTech (but not for Plaid or a direct competitor) and am happy to field some questions. Plaid and other aggregators aren't a new thing and frankly have been key to the emergence of nearly all personal finance platforms that use your bank account information.\n\nPlaid, MX, Finicity, Yodly, Intuit, etc help:\n\n* Authenticate user bank accounts\n* Maintain account security (the bank or company using your info does not receive any sensitive info, just an access Token that can be shut off)\n* Perform live balance checks\n* Pass transaction logs\n* Facilitate certain types of transactions\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list but are the most common cases. An account and routing number is not able to provide most of these functions\n\nSo why do these platforms exist?\n\nBanks have done their best to keep the financial system \"closed\". This is good for security but means that you can't easily share your financial information in real-time. This is good for banks because it lets them control that access by selling your information and limiting competition. Platforms like Plaid have introduced \"open\" banking, which lets you share your information securely with any app or website that passes their standards. The apps benefit by not having to build a system with as high of security or deal with compliance. You, the consumer, benefit by having access to more options.\n\nExamples of \"Open\" banking that use these or similar platforms: Banking- Chime, Varo, Empower Savings- Digit, Stash, Acorns Credit- Line, Self, Brex Investing- Wealthfront, Betterment, Robinhood Payments- Venmo, Stripe Lending- SoFi, FloatMe, Dave Budgeting: Mint, Personal Capital, You Need A Budget (YNAB)\n\nAll of these could not exist without a more open banking system. Banks are fighting back by taking various actions to try and make consumers wary of these platforms. They do this by finding ways to try and block their functionality (many have given up and now work with them by providing an API so they directly integrate- PNC is a notable holdout and does not work with many apps), lawsuits challenging the regulatory carve-out which allows this, and pushing misinformation. These app/websites love platforms like Plaid because it lets them launch faster, cheaper, and not worry about compliance or as much security.\n\nSo how do these platforms work?\n\nInstead of providing sensitive information like your account number to a 3rd party app (this is a horrible idea), you provide access a secure \"tunnel\" that the app can't see into. Plaid does this via their API and informs the user that you are using Plaid (this is the first page). Plaid receives login credentials from the user and then creates a secure link to the bank account using either an API (preferred) provided by the bank or via a login system they built. The app does not receive any sensitive info- just an access \"token\" like when you sign into an account using Facebook or when pay a merchant via PayPal so they don't see your card number.\n\nYou can see what accounts you're using Plaid with (and unlink them) at [https://my.plaid.com/](https://my.plaid.com/)\n\nAs a general rule: assume everyone is using your data if you provide it. This isn't nefarious, this is the reality of the internet. Plaid makes money partly through this (as do banks) and through subscription fees from the companies that use them. \\[I believe Plaid anonymizes the data, so it is not personally identifiable but haven't verified this\\]\n\nI hope this helps demystify this topic a bit and make it a little less alarming. I saw a LOT of misleading information that overlooked why these platforms are beneficial to consumers.\n\nHappy to talk more on the topic of FinTech in general- I've worked in the space for several years and have an abundance of experience with startups &amp; tech generally.\n\nEdit: From the Privacy Policy \"We may collect, use, and share End User Information in an aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized manner (that does not identify you personally) for any purpose permitted under applicable law.
