        "body": "Shadow banned. Fucking mods. Posted to promote discussion.\n\nDon't decide what you do based on what I think but here is the bear case for the catalyst for the GME sell-off:\n\nThe events of last Friday's gamma squeeze triggered the stocks run-up and possible short squeeze action we saw this week.\n\nMy thoughts are based on the market events of Wednesday 1/27.\n\nFrom Melvin Capital's most recent quarterly holdings filing (which can be read publicly here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml) we can almost say with certainty that they liquidated most, if not all of their long positions to cover losses with their short positions. I don't think they reloaded shorts yesterday - I think they are waiting to reload.\n\nAll their assumed short positions have run up over the last month, either due to Melvin covering or due to buys from traders making the same play that has been made on GME or a combination of both.\n\nI think one of these scenarios could play out next week,BE CAREFUL:\n\nOfficial short interest reports release for the end of the month are due for publication from NASDAQ on 2/9 (I am assuming the current reports are not accurate as they are not official). The short interest reports include up to 1/29 and are due for processing on 2/2. IF and ONLY IF they show a LOW short interest, this will trigger a major sell-off in the GME as without the high short interest there is NO MORE upside. I don't think Melvin Capital has given up in this yet, they are not done. Prior to that official data release, I believe they will reload shorts and then cover after the sell-off upon official data release, which is their next attempt to fuck the little guy.\nIf official short interest is still high, this could be another buy catalyst, but I don't think it will be. Melvin liquidating all its capital shows that they HAD to of covered. There has been so much buying and selling that it would have been less detectable to cover systemically throughout the week.\n\nIt depends on how you play this, if you hold you'll still be OK as the price won't drop. Everything points to next week being pretty tame and the 2nd week of February leading to a potential bloodbath. With low short interest on that report most people will have no choice but to sell off.\n\nSee below for all of my DD:\n\nMelvin's long positions include the following: (a majority of which were sold off between on Mon. 1/25 and Wed. 1/27 included below are the highs and lows of the week, I am not going to calculate the market caps but you can do it if you want but the MAJOR price action on no news indicates that these were Melvin selling off all or most of their position:\n\nADBE: H: 480.25, L: 454.97\nAAP: H: 160.11, L: 143.15\nAMD: H: 99.98, L: 86.22\nADYYF: H: 2435.60, L: 2076.56\nBABA: H: 267.98, L: 251.00\nALGN: H: 535.60, L: 507.77\nGOOG: H: 1935.00, L: 1806.48\nAEO: H: 25.46, L: 21.92\nPLAN: H: 73.00, L: 61.05\nTEAM: H: 240.15, L: 208.62\nAZO: H: 1241.39, L: 1111.71\nAVIS: H: 49.94, L: 38.89 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND)\nBKNG: H: 2109.51, L: 1860.73\nEAT: H: 67.53, L: 54.70\nBURL: H: 257.50, L: 234.07\nDRI: H: 124.94, L: 110.89\nDDOG: H: 112.29, L: 96.02\nDECK: H: 325.54, L: 276.70\nDOCU: H: 260, L: 221.89\nDPZ: H: 384.00, L: 366.50\nEXPE: H: 140.50, L: 118.30\nFICO: H: 514.75, L: 436.66\nRACE: H: 214.50, L: 203.00\nFISV: H: 108.65, L: 100.36\nGART: H: 161.08, L: 149.74\nHLT: H: 108.62, L: 98.10\nH: H: 72.33, L: 65.44\nIAA: H: 60.86, L: 52.31\nJD: H: 101.68, L: 88.22\nKAR: H: 19.94, L: 17.63 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND)\nLB: H: 46.31, L: 36.10\nLH: H: 234.30, L: 212.85 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND)\nLVS: H: 54.80, L: 47.44\nLAUR: H: 14.39, L: 13.00\nLYV: H: 74.34, L: 65.88\nLOW: H: 175.75, L: 166.50\nMA: H: 335.15, L: 312.38\nMCD: H: 215.51, L: 203.11\nMSFT: H: 247.7, L: 224.22 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND - GREAT EARNINGS REPORT)\nMSCI: H: 416.58, L: 380.00\nNKE: H: 141.88, L: 128.91\nNUAN: H: 51.00, L: 42.19\nPYPL: H: 256.20, L: 225.00\nPINS: H: 75.60, L: 62.15\nRHP: H: 68.18, L: 61.24\nSBAC: H: 279.57, L: 265.70\nSEA: H: 242.86, L: 202.00\nNOW: H: 563.88, L: 508.22\nSQ: H: 227.41, L: 194.50\nTPX: H: 29.84, L: 25.88\nTXRH: H: 79.87, L: 73.20\nTJX: H: 68.20, L: 62.24\nTUP: H: 34.08, L: 29.62\nTWTR: H: 52.99, L: 46.50 (OUTLIER - DOES NOT FOLLOW TREND - SOLD OFF EARLIER IN MONTH)\nV: H: 205.33, L: 192.84\nWDAY: H: 240.60, L: 220.50\nWYNN: H: 109.95, L: 99.00\n\nSEC requirements do not require institutional traders to report shares held short, however they do require them to report puts; which from that we can infer Melvin also held shares short for the puts they owned: they hold puts for the following stocks:\n\nBBBY\nDDS\nELAN\nGME\nGSX\nHASI\nIRBT\nIRM\nLGND\nMNKKQ\nMLM\nMYL\nFIZZ\nOLLI\nSKT\nTRIN\nVIAC\n\n\u200b\n\nDisclaimer: I HAVE NO POSITION in GME - this is only my interpretation of the situation and not financial advice as I am not a registered financial professional.",

Look at the price action on some of those top holdings (Fiserv, L Brands, Expedia, Pinterest) on the date that Melvin is claiming that they covered their short.\n\nYou see two things. First, all of Melvin's top holdings took a significant hit. You can interpret this as -- Melvin sold their long position stocks so they could cover their short position in GME.\n\nSecond, the volume on the GME was highest ever that day. You can also interpret this as Melvin having covered their short position.\n\nAdditionally, the only \"proof\" we have of Melvin's short position is Melvin's put option. Put options do not have to be covered, they just need to be sold at a discount. Melvin of course, likely did have a short position, but exactly how much they were short is anybody's guess.\n\nAnd finally, Melvin went on air saying that they closed their short position. If this was false, Melvin is likely committing securities fraud and will be liable in multiple ways.\n\nSo you have these four factors. What are the reasons you think Melvin is actually lying? Compare the two arguments (Melvin covered v Melvin is lying), and pick what you think is more convincing.",

I cant trust the company, and it sounds like many people are in that same boat. \n\nIt's been pump and dump for a couple years now. Its gonna dump soon. You cannot say with a straight face that TSLA is more valuable than American Express, Boeing, Goldman Sachs, Caterpillar, Ford, GM, IBM and Dow Chemicals COMBINED. That is just fucking ridiculous. And now its market cap is greater than the top automotive makers in the world COMBINED. that doesnt make any fucking sense no matter what moon or planet youre on.",

She is 60 doesn\u2019t have any debt has other passive income (rentals), cure t holding are random funds her employer had with mass mutual they will be liquidated into cash and put into a traditional Roth. Risk tolerance I would say a 5 out of 10 (10 being very risky).\n\nMy thoughts where to select a handful of dividend stocks for 50-60% i like names such as jnj, mmm, xom, T, pg, Abbv, csco, ibm (trying to stick with dividend champion companies that are reasonably priced now..) etc and then the remaining 20% would be in a couple vanguard bond funds and remaining 20% in a vanguard s&amp;p fund. \n\nAny inout would be great this isn\u2019t her complete retirement fund it is a small portion and 1 of 3 of her retirement accounts. \n\nThanks,",

Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",

My investments have always been owned longer than a year, most closer to 5+ years or almost the entire duration.  My main holdings over the 2010-2019 (pre-COVID) period were Microsoft ($28 cost basis), Disney ($46 cost basis), Nike ($55) and Xylem ($50).  I got \u2018lucky\u2019 and dumped Disney when Iger stepped down in February out of nowhere at $135.  I never bought back in and I should have. I did have some duds such as IBM and GE over that time that dragged me down, but I can\u2019t complain.  This year I did well but I traded more than usual and lost my cost basis for everything out of panic selling.  The trades I made were Zillow ($78-115), Starbucks ($78-103), Penn ($3-15), NIO ($3-16) and some losses like Slack and CARA.

(I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",
