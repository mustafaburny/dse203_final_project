It is something I have done in the last few months: if it is not a high conviction play, I sell, and reinvest only in my highest conviction plays. So that I know that if the stock tanks I would hold on to it anyway and not panic sell. That made my portfolio more concentrated, but I sleep better now.",

There are like 10 of us in the class and we each manage a sector and if I sector is under-allocated (based on what our school's investment committee wants) we co-manage some sectors. I am the manager of the Real Estate sector and co-manager of Tech but we can buy in either. We are only making one stock purchase a semester based on a DCF, DDM and a few other financial models (we use Bloomberg terminals to screen stocks) then we vote as a class after we present. Its a very basic model and I don't even know how accurate they are. I can upload my report of QCOM if you want but its not good lol",
