That's why I left a few disclaimers saying to take this all with a grain of salt.

Certainly. Is any company a good company to buy shares on to sell CCs? Not really just by nature.",

Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes.

        "body": "Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat. That\u2019s as of 0630.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes. You\u2019ve been warned (Voltswagen, er Volkswagen did a good job of preparing you for that as well).",
