The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**\n\nShort Attack:\n\n1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n3. Spread disinformation through \"analysis\" to get people to sell their stocks because \"the fundamentals aren't there\". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, [\"here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly\".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\\*\n\nInvestopedia \\[\"Short and Distort\" - illegal short tactic \\]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are \u201cforced\u201d sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or \u201cprop\u201d desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing \u201cvolatility\u201d**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated \u201cdumps\u201d of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices.

The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**\n\nShort Attack:\n\n1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n3. Spread disinformation through \"analysis\" to get people to sell their stocks because \"the fundamentals aren't there\". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, [\"here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly\".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\\*\n\nInvestopedia \\[\"Short and Distort\" - illegal short tactic \\]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are \u201cforced\u201d sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or \u201cprop\u201d desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing \u201cvolatility\u201d**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated \u201cdumps\u201d of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.\n\nsource: [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html)\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don't exist to scare us.

Get multiple brokers and consume and purchase and hold as much amc as you can we are about to take off... if you don\u2019t get in on this opportunity right now you will miss out on these discounted prices of AMC and GME. It was very important for us to hold the line. We can\u2019t let them win. They are very desperate right now. With the legal lawsuits with robinhood they are now tied down.... this is in our favor!!!

        "body": " KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like  \n\n\n1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers.  \n\n\n2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying \"lets get this to $30\" or \"let get this to 100\". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.  \n\n\n3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video &gt;&gt;&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)  \n\n\n4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)  \n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.  \n\n\n\\- They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.  \n\n\n5. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.  \n\n\n6. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.  \n\n\n7. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.  \n\n\n8. What is short selling: &gt;&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)  \n\n\n9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)  \n\n\n10. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.  \n\n\n11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.  \n\n\n12. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.  \n\n\nI hope this helps many.",

        "body": "This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.  \n\n\nKEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)  \n\n\n1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.  \n\n\nPATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.  \n\n\n2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying \"lets get this to $30\" or \"let get this to 100\". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.  \n\n\n3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video &gt;&gt;&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)  \n\n\n4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)  \n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.  \n\n\n\\- They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.  \n\n\n5. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.  \n\n\n6. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.  \n\n\n7. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.  \n\n\n8. What is short selling: &gt;&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)  \n\n\n9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)  \n\n\n10. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.  \n\n\n11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.  \n\n\n12. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.  \n\n\nI hope this helps many.",

The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**\n\nShort Attack:\n\n1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n3. Spread disinformation through \"analysis\" to get people to sell their stocks because \"the fundamentals aren't there\". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, [\"here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly\".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\\*\n\nInvestopedia \\[\"Short and Distort\" - illegal short tactic \\]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are \u201cforced\u201d sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or \u201cprop\u201d desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing \u201cvolatility\u201d**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated \u201cdumps\u201d of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.\n\nsource: [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html)\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don't exist to scare us. They don't know our apps don't even have a sell button, only a liftoff button for the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nCopied from u/master0jack\n\nThis is not investment advice, just an opinion from a dumb ape\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19 \ud83c\udf14 \ud83c\udf16 \ud83c\udf1b \ud83c\udf1c \ud83c\udf15",

If you do - this whole plan falls apart.  Do not be tempted by small profits.  You need to hold and not sell.  We also have to keep buying.  For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers.\n\n2.  Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100.  If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher.  Please, everyone, stop saying \"lets get this to $30\" or \"let get this to 100\".  This has so much more potential than those low numbers.  Patience, and hold.  \n\n3.  How does a short squeeze work:  Watch this video &gt;&gt;&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY \n\n4.

DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy.  DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.  \n\n5.  Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price.  Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period.  However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up.  The price, technically speaking, is infinite.  \n\n6.  Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account.  Just open another broker account and buy through there:  Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying.  If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.\n\n7.  Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing.  You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.\n\n8.  What is short selling:  &gt;&gt; https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp  \n\n9.  Short selling does not expire.  Options do expire.  Familiarize yourself with the difference.  Link here:  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp  \n\n10.  Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this.  With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.  \n\n11.  Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares.  Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading.  Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m).  Please understand the difference.\n\n12.  Again.  I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both.  To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up.  HOLD.  Buy, and HOLD.  Do not sell for small profits",

There were Wall Street folks who stood to gain by all of the WSB hype.  And the majority of them probably unloaded their positions into the hands of the gullible WSB investors who think they are sending a message by trading their hard-earned dough for a piece of a company that will most likely die before too long.\n\nThe takeaway message is this: \n\n**Never believe the hype.

The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**\n\n \nShort Attack:\n\n1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n\n\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n\n\n3. Spread disinformation through \"analysis\" to get people to sell their stocks because \"the fundamentals aren't there\". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n\n\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.\n\n\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n\n\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n\n\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, \n[\"here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly\".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info, /u/blancochocolate)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*\n\nInvestopedia [\"Short and Distort\" - illegal short tactic ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are \u201cforced\u201d sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or \u201cprop\u201d desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing \u201cvolatility\u201d**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated \u201cdumps\u201d of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.\n\nsource: http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don't exist to scare us. They don't know our apps don't even have a sell button, only a liftoff button for the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19 \ud83c\udf14 \ud83c\udf16 \ud83c\udf1b \ud83c\udf1c \ud83c\udf15",

If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers.**   \n \n\n**2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying \"let's get this to  $30\" or \"let get this to 100\".

This video will show you:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)   \n \n\n**Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.**   \n \n\n **- They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.**   \n \n\n**5. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys,  and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.**   \n \n\n**6. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have an RH account,  just keep holding those there for now.**   \n \n\n**7. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money,  or you could make a boatload of money - both are possible.**   \n \n\n**8. What is short selling: &gt;&gt;** [**https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)   \n \n\n**9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here:** [**https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)   \n \n\n **10. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.**   \n \n\n **11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the number of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the number of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.**   \n \n\n**12. Again. I  cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.**   \n \n\n**I hope this helps many.**",
