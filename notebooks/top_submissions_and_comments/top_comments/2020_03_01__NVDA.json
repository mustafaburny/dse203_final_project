Let me tell you that it has been a rollercoaster. Rode the highs of TSLA stock in which I used the gains to get into options trading. Rode the waves of MSFT and NVDA calls until coronavirus caused it to come crashing down. Started from scratch and became a bear, bought puts on airlines and rideshare taking my portfolio back to where it started. Until recently I started trading VXX and 3X bear ETFS in which I lost $2.3K in the span of a week. For some odd reason, it didn't phase me. It just felt like numbers on a screen. What I took away from it, is that everyday you try something new, there is a cost to it. Think of it as insurance to never make that mistake ever again. There is a lot more to lose when your portfolio ultimately grows, and it will. Think of today's losses as guarantees for tomorrow's gains\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/HRTIlpK](https://imgur.com/a/HRTIlpK)",

For some reason I didn\u2019t feel satisfied and added more only for it to start dropping. I then play Tesla puts looking for a flush past 380, my TA was perfect but when I saw I was down 500 on the day I sold Tesla put for 200 loss when I would\u2019ve made nearly 1k. Then the rest of the day I kept trading regardless of getting a GFV to get my gains back. Now at 1.1k.\n\nHow do I fix this ? Is it mental where I just tell myself hey man take the money even though it doesn\u2019t look real at all since it\u2019s on a damn screen and comes so easily ...",

A year ago they had no viable offerings for a good CPU (fx was dated af and not a contender, dont tell me about the fx series as an offering) and their best GPUs were weaker and not as cost effective as nVidias. The best they had was low to medium performance options for both markets. This has been their position with respect of Intel and nVidia for a long time. Now their CPUs are king and their GPUs are competitive, even lacking a flagship as powerful as the 2080 or 2080ti. \n\nThey have rapidly transitioned from a sustained underdog position to a real tooth and nail competitor. If we assume that this trend will continue does it not stand to reason that their share price should also continue to perform as they seize a greater market share?\n\nThis of course says nothing about server and console hardware, which im less familiar with but i hear they're doing well in those sectors as well.",
