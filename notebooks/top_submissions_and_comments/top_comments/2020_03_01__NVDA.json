Massive blowouts and all the subjective things were in their favor.  Low China exposure, check.  Where is the sales strength?  The lucrative data center, check. How's the pipeline? exciting new product is imminent, check.  They're better diversified now, unlike their last breakout which was fuelled by shaky cryptocurrency speculation. \n\nSeeing the stock drop after we already know how the business is doing can sometimes be like a free look into the future.  \n\nThat said, Nvidia was pretty casual about corona/China.  So maybe it will emerge that they haven't been conservative enough.  If so, the stock will be punished.  \n\n\n\nContrast that with MSFT who sells digital bits and has little sales exposure or supply chain exposure, yet they gave themselves a pass with their statement.\n\n\n\nHowever what's your risk/reward?  I held in through ER with a target of $330.  Even if it were magically achieved this week, is $275 to $330 the best reward for the risk?  I'm looking more at VMW which is down from $206 to $120 and only 7.5 P/E compared to NVDA 60 P/E, which will likely be rising as some sales will be deferred due to corona virus.",
