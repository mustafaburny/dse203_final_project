If you have 60 seconds, I'd like to share the idea with you. You got a minute?\nArauz :\u00a0Actually, I'm really very...\nListen says:\u00a0The name of the company, Aphria. It is a cutting edge high-tech firm out of the  Lemonham awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of radar edibles that have both huge military and civilian applications. Now, right now, Prophet, the stock trades at just a shade under 4 bucks, its PB ratio. And by the way, Arauz, our analysts indicate it could go a heck of a lot higher than that. Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment could be upwards of $60,000!\n\nAs you all know, APH lags behind its peers based on market cap.\n\nArauz :\u00a0Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.\nJordan Belfort\u00a0:\u00a0Exactly. You could pay off your mortgage.\nProphet :\u00a0This stock will pay off my house?\nSpy says:\u00a0arauz the one thing I can promise you, even in this market, is that I never ask my clients to judge me on my winners. I ask them to judge me on my losers because I have so few. And in the case of Aphria, based on every technical factor out there, we are looking at a grand slam home run.",

In the past I noticed companies easing money vff at 9.25 a few months ago and weed md did a raise for 8 million around 1.50 .. so in the case of wmd where some guy bought like 4 million of that raise is he in the hole that much? What about aph bought deal at 11 ish last year ???",

Many companies have higher gross margin and lower all-in costs.  \n\nAphria's main advantage seems to be either their branding and/or Southern Glazers.  Adult rec market share has increased 25% in ON over the last 3 Qs.  Adult rec revenue nationally has doubled over the last 2 Q's.  OGI, for example, has low cost production but falling adult rec market share every quarter since the initial 1.0 quarter.  What is Aph doing right that OGI is not?  It's not related to cost of goods sold.",
