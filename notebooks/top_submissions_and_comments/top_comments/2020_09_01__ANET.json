        "body": "This is from Giverny Capital\u2019s quarter letter. It\u2019s an interesting way of looking at it and valuing growth in general.\n\nFun fact: if a stock trading at 71x its forward earnings estimate grows EPS by 13% for a decade, it would trade for 21x earnings in 2030. That is roughly the current S&amp;P forward multiple. There are enormous expectations built into the price of many growth stocks.\nGCAM owns six companies on the list of 75. Three are Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon. The other three are Mastercard, Arista Networks and Five Below. All of them are profitable today, and all of them trade at less than 21 times analyst estimates of their 2024 earnings estimates, per Empirical. Alphabet and Facebook trade for 13x their 2024 estimate; Arista trades for 14x. If these estimates are roughly accurate, then our six growers need two or three years to become reasonably priced, not 10.\n\nNo one knows what the economy will look like in 2024, much less 2030, so take that exercise with a grain of salt. But it gets at what we\u2019re trying to do: own growing businesses without taking quite so much risk. Per both Morningstar and FactSet, the GCAM portfolio earns higher returns on capital than the Index, while also using less leverage. It generates higher profit margins on a weighted basis than the Index. And while our portfolio is slightly more expensive than the S&amp;P 500 on a PE multiple basis, it is less expensive based on multiples of free cash flow. Half of our companies have a founder as CEO or Chair, which we think leads to better decision making.",

Still long $FXF Swiss Franc because they cannot even control their currency rising against the Euro.\n\nI am going to set up a poor mans covered call on BETZ or DKNG or both.  2022/2021 calendar calls on SPXL.\n\nShorting OXY.  Cramer just mentioned this stock again as a short today so I hope he did not jinx it but unless there is a takeover that is willing to overlook a balance sheet from hell....\n\nSelling my 0DTE puts tomorrow after the morning pre-market pump I expect a sea of red again on the $QQQ with 18 put contracts.

Cost 1.80.    \n\nIf rocket shoots up to like 80....lose all extrinsic value....spread is worth 2.00.    Needed to make sure spread was larger than premium paid.   After that...anything less than a massive sell off is profitable.  It could dip a little, trade flat, or go up.   Based on bad wsb info that i should've double checked, thought it was gonna go up a little at the very least.    \n\nResults, It sold off a little and I sold my spread for 3.05 this morning.  Stock went down, made profit on a bullish spread...iv is a bitch.   \n\nCurrently had avgo sept 4 / sept 11 call spreads at 375.  Bought for 0.4, sold half for 1.2.  Already booked a profit.    Expect good numbers...more so it just didn't have the run up the other semis implied it should have...., sell off because bitches are scared. Then a run up next week.",

        "body": "Broad Market:  That's tough to say.  If your very bullish on Tech stocks, QQQ might be your best bet. If you want a broader fund, then VOO is a good one.  QQQ uses the NASDAQ 100 as its bench mark while VOO uses the S&amp;P 500 as its benchmark. The top five holdings are the same for each of these, but in different percentages.  Another broad market fund I like is IWF. IWF uses the Russell 1000 as its benchmark.  It has a very good track record and seems to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over time. It's very similar to QQQ in its holdings, but again, percentages are slightly different.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices for a broad market fund. \n\nTech:  You'll get lots of opinions on this.  ARKQ and ARKW would be the choice of the ARK funds if you want it to be purely tech.  If you want to invest in disruptive innovative companies, but don't mind expanding beyond tech, consider ARKK. \n\nAnother one I like for tech is XLK. However, you have to keep in mind that XLK is almost 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft.  If you believe in those two companies, consider this one.  (VGT is very similar). \n\nSOXX is a fund that invests in semiconductor technology. One thing I like about this fund is that there will not be a lot of crossover between this one and your broad market fund.  Top holdings include: QCOM (9.5%), NVDA (9.5%), AVGO (8.3%), TXN (8%), INTC (5%). \n\nWCLD:  Cloud computing is a great sector, but be aware that many of these companies will also be in QQQ.  Top holdings include ZM (2.4%), CRM (2.3%), PLAN (2.2%), CRWD (2.1%), WDAY (2.1%). One thing I like about this ETF is that the investments are much more spread out than most ETFs. So, if any one company in the ETF is affected by bad news, it should have little impact on the ETF as a whole. I think WCLD is an excellent choice. \n\nClean Energy ETF:  I like ICLN like many others on this site.  I think the clean/renewable energy sector is really going to blossom over the next 10 years and I think ICLN is one of the better ETFs in the sector. Others you may want to look into include:  PBW, QCLN and TAN.",

That's basically admitting defeat in the cutting edge manufacturing aspect of chips, making their investors loose a lot of faith in them.\n\nI'm not saying this will happen, but the risk of it happening, means that I will not take the chance.\n\nA safer bet IMO would be TSMC ($TSM)\n\nMost of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, Broadcom., Marvell, MediaTek, Nvidia, and Qualcomm are or were customers of TSMC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA ***riskier*** bet, but with higher upside, is AMD.",

(If it's even a bubble). I\u2019m holding my calls because it keeps going up no matter what. When we have a red day or negative news I tell myself: \"Stonks go up\" and either by EOD or the next day, it goes green without fail.\n\nBut at the same time I\u2019m starting to get worried about a bubble- but what will trigger it? \nMoney is practically free, poor people who are getting devastated by the virus with no stimulus never invested in the market anyways. If anything the average person with spare change can now throw their money into the market easier than ever before with RH.\n\nI understand the subprime crisis was undetected, so what could possibly be undetected now? \nWhat will pop this? Am I missing something? Give me a reason not to hold my tech calls.\nSometimes I feel like the market will pop is because doubling my money in months doesn't sound right, this isn't supposed to happen. But maybe we're just smarter than the rest and making as much as we can while the printer is on (this doesn't sound right either).  \n\n**Positions:**\n\nFB 300c 3/19\n\nMSFT 230c 4/16\n\n2x MSFT 220c 6/18\n\nNVDA 600c 3/19\n\nORCL 60c 9/11 (somehow up 14%)\n\n2x PYPL 200c 1/15\n\nPYPL 210c 3/19\n\n2x SPY 360c 9/21 (2021) \n\n5 shares of AMZN (sold after making $10K on 3600c 1/15)\n\n25 shares of MSFT\n\n30 Shares of PYPL",

I have V in my Roth account, and won't sell it, basically forever, or at least 5-10 years. Visa and mastercard are likely the only finance companies related to consumer spending that have an actual moat due to their ability to process payments immediately in a way that literally every other bank (large or small, old or fintech) is required to utilize their channels to have payments process.\n\nYes, SQ is a bank now. Yes I'm happy they've had a huge run up for the past couple years. Yes I'm sad that I sold half of my position when I had 100% return. No, I do not plan on selling more. Yes SQ is fantastic, and yes I hold a similar amount in PYPL as well. \n\nNo, I do not think SQ or PYPL will surpass visa as the king of payment processing. Visa is a giant, and could simply reveal their own p2p lending platform if any of the minor banks manages to cross their moat....it still hasn't been crossed yet.",

Will it come back down. Potentially not.  \n\n\nThe reality is, we are in a hyper unique period of digital transformation. PayPal, Shopify, amazon have all seen their best quarters and largest growth cycles in history. More than any of them predicted.  \n\n\nWe have accelerated the shift from physical to digital, and in the business world, communication is happing on the back of Zoom. Against all odds they are the clear market leader in a growing industry and service that will not be dropped when the pandemic ends. Will video calling slow? Sure. But customers won\u2019t cancel their service.  \n\n\nPer the Boeing comp... how many of you have flown on a plane recently? How many have a trip booked? I work in sales at a top 5 tech company in San Francisco. They have already told us we will not be having business travel the way we did before due to companies like zoom and the opportunity to work better and engage remotely.  \n\n\nThat industry is changing rapidly as well and not in the direction of Boeing. A company with MASSIVE overhead costs that literally cannot stop burning cash and will need to revamp its revenue models moving fwd.  \n\n\nAre they undervalued. Probably. But it\u2019s in line with the risk involved in that industry. Did you guys see today that United got rid of all change fees? Desperate much?  \n\n\nPoint being, these are unique times. And you certainly can\u2019t comp a hyper growth, perfect positioned saas company against a legacy company in an industry that is at risk of bankruptcy with an uncertain future.",

For NFIN think they explained this / it makes logical sense - the parent company started Triterras and were its first customers giving it critical mass of traders at launch and their share of revenues has fallen from 100% to 11% today (in 14 months) with it being no more than 15% for the full year and falling meaningfully thereafter....as long as its falling and is single digit number in a year or so i dont think this is cause for concern.... Point noted re no PIPE though - potentially its a bad signal....but maybe they just didnt need one (business is net cash, cash generative and profitable).... not seen anyone flag no external (ie non-sponsor) PIPE as an issue at LCA or Utz.",

        "body": "&gt;yep, they had etrade, sharebuilder (let you buy fractional shares), first trade was another one back then. It cost you i think about 5 dollars a trade and later you had a monthly fee. Fidelity you had to have 15k and some of the others a high amount as well. this was easy to ignore when everything was going up not so much post 1999.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;i invested everything in november of 1999 from my time in the military after a financial planning meeting. I went with communications, Lucent, qualcom, nokia, JDS uniphase and glw. I just remember a mutual fund i had went from 1000 dollars when i bought it to 200 dollars the next month.  I had about 10k worth of stock and it lost about half its value in the course of 3 months and kept going lower. I sold some and bough marvel comics which was around a 1 dollar a share after the release of the first x-men movie but they were risky due to flirting with bankruptcy yet again.  I did really well with my 500 dollars i bought sold at 23 dollars a share wish i kept it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  My dad sold his Apple stock about 50k worth  (he bought one year after the ipo) in 1992 to buy Marvel Stock which went bankrupt.",

        "body": "Not even close to what I was saying. I had suspected it was going to form a cup and handle on Thursday. Which is why I anticipated a drop today, which forms the handle. If I had bought at the bottom of the cup, there was no way of knowing whether it was forming a cup or about to trade flat or drop. Right now is the best time to buy in since there\u2019s a stronger probability of it completing the formation. Once it pushes through the resistance, it will go up by the difference between the resistance (~$13.80 for GME) and the bottom of the cup (~$11.80), which is $2. So anticipate GME reaching at least $15.80 this week. Just look at the cup and handle formed by GLW between July 28th and August 12th. \n\nRight now is when you buy, it\u2019s definitely not too late.",
