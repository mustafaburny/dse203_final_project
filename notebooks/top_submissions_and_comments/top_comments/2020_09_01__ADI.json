NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said \u2014 assuming it isn\u2019t derailed at the last minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world\u2019s smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics\u2014and play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year\u2019s biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm\u2019s customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals. Most or all of that is already under way or completed and its shares are up more than 20% this year. Among the sales: big chunks of its holdings in China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and T-Mobile US Inc. following the wireless provider\u2019s merger with Sprint Corp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank has also purchased options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks this year. The sheer size of the bet has had an outsize effect on the overall stock market, driving prices higher, the Journal has reported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt SoftBank, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been working with a small team to negotiate the Arm deal including the chief executive of the chip company, Simon Segars, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, as well as Rajeev Misra, CEO of the firm\u2019s giant Vision Fund, and Akshay Naheta, another executive at the fund.",

However, airlines are taking on an *insane* amount of debt to weather this storm. They\u2019re straight up burning *tens of millions a day* to keep what travel is allowed available. Airlines are getting hit even harder than casinos right now, and that recovery will take a very, very long time.\n\nBut, if you step that logic back a couple steps into something more fundamental it avoids a lot of those issues. No, I\u2019m not talking Boeing (that will be shorter but still extremely subdued), I\u2019m talking about Amphenol. They\u2019re an electronics manufacturer that makes aerospace-grade parts. The further you get away from consumer habits, the wider timeframe these profits and losses operate in, and (right now at least) the more attractive that makes an investment.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t flying, companies aren\u2019t going to be replacing planes any time soon either, but there\u2019s foundational companies that are already up and running in anticipation of that. Because that\u2019s *their* business cycle. Same goes for other industrial companies, like Air Products, or raw materials manufacturers on the DOW.\n\nDon\u2019t play this recovery at the consumer level, whatever you do. Play it at the manufacturing level, and play it as diversely as you can.",

So essentially a ton of people bought a ton of upside calls today could account for this massive IV increase. \n\nHowever, from a trading perspective this seems super exploitable. Essentially here's what it's implying. \n\nIt's saying Yesterday there was an X % chance for Tesla to be &gt; 800 (or pick any other upside strike) by September 18. Now Today, despite Tesla going down 4-5% at this current point, there is still an X % chance or even &gt; X% chance for Tesla to be &gt; 800 by September 18. That's insane!\n\nDespite 1 day passing by and a 4-5% drop in stock, the probability, according to MM, didn't change or even increased at certain points in the day! And it's not like there's that many days until September 18 anyways.\n\nI feel like this isn't a supply/demand issue. I think actually it's possible this market got broken due to outsized, black swan moves from stocks like CRM, ZM and DOCU who didn't even have an earnings yet that MM are so pressed to selling vol they jacked up everything arbitrarily across all names, which includes Tesla and CRM but should include others, which I haven't delved into.",

So retail keeps on buying at x+y and then x+y+z, etc. We keep on making sales at these 'inflated' prices and they keep on buying them.\n\nI presume this phenomena is happening in AAPL. Got steamrolled in CRM (what a move) and ZM (today). So we keep on offering at higher and higher levels (and retail keeps on buying) which is nuts.\n\nBecause the big tech stocks make up a huge portion on the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY), we can get a little hedge on buy bidding up calls in the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY). Because we are bidding up calls, we are now impacting VIX.\n\nThis is the only explanation I have for you.

        "body": "My feeling is that there is genuine panic at these market making firms because of these insane moves that just do not make sense (but they still continue because of the feedback loop). I would bet that a senior trader/partner has taken over these names (TSLA AAPL CRM FB GOOG etc) to make sure that the firm doesn't get clobbered too much.\n\nWe all know to respect the markets, but at some level the 'madness' has to end. Of course, nobody knows when that will happen. Notwithstanding, the 'edge' you get selling at x+y+z volatility is more than you got at x+y which is more than what you got at x. You may be wrong at the x and x+y levels, but at the x+y+z level you made up for your losses (from x and X+y) and then some. Thus, the snowball effect of implied volatility becoming actual volatility might be true at the x and x+y level and overstated at the x+y+z level. (There has to be some edge selling options because you need a balance sheet selling options versus buying options).\n\nSo I do agree with what you are saying that the implieds will eventually be overstating what is happening with actual volatility. Unfortunately, nobody knows what level this will be. Thus, selling vol in small pieces at higher and higher levels is probably the safest way of doing this (and this is probably what the market makers are doing). You should have enough edge that you can scratch a trade if it doesn't feel right...",
