LRCX, AVGO, INTC, TXN, ADI, SOXX, and MU are near all time highs.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the demand for chips is through the roof amd will remain high. Every industry thats booming needs them. The shortage is a positive thing for us. Demand is high. We dont want a glut. We want to operate at a slight shortage. That said, we will need perfect numbers to start the next leg up or a breather to let things cool off. Ive been hoarding shares on the dips and am selling covered calls and cash secured puts and then putting the money towards more shares.",

As of 4/5/2021, I see qqq ETF is most likely reach 330 in a week and make all time new high in a month. However, it cannot go straight up without pullback. Sometimes those pullback could be very deep. The worst thing could happen is that qqq falls to the very bottom when you truly need to cash out from it.  Find something less volatile and delivering constant divvy.  You may even build your own high yield fund by investing several stocks such as KO, RIO, and AVGO.",
