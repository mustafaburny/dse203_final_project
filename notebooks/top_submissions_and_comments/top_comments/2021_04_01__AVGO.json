As of 4/5/2021, I see qqq ETF is most likely reach 330 in a week and make all time new high in a month. However, it cannot go straight up without pullback. Sometimes those pullback could be very deep. The worst thing could happen is that qqq falls to the very bottom when you truly need to cash out from it.  Find something less volatile and delivering constant divvy.  You may even build your own high yield fund by investing several stocks such as KO, RIO, and AVGO.",
