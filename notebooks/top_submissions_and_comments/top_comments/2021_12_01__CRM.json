If someone here is completely unbiased, then why do I care about their opinion?\n\nMSFT products are enterprise tools.  A lowest common denominator that fills gaps.  For example, no one uses sharepoint for for sales workflows (even though the could) and no sales manager angrily decries using salesforce because it\u2019s significantly more expensive than the Microsoft alternative.  Pricing pressure rarely (if ever) dominates managers\u2019 tool decisions.  All the people who moved to DocuSign in COVID aren\u2019t going to move away from it because the Microsoft alternative is slightly cheaper.  That\u2019s just not the way that SaaS works.\n\nOther competitors like adobe are relevant, but saying Microsoft will come and take over this market is just wishful thinking.",

Things kind of equilibrate and rebound sometimes. \n\nUnfortunately there\u2019s no free lunch with this kind of thing",

ARKK at -12.7% or QQQJ at -4.8% for the week is closer to telling the story.\n\nThe only story for me that I have is Salesforce this week (which I still want to hold and am in profit but falling over 10% on an earnings report gives me major pause) but seeing those huge ARKK down days were a stunner for me.",
