If someone buys a subscription from me I'd rather it was PP billing agreement than anything else. \n\nPayPal express is also brilliant. Yeah other providers offer similar, but a lot of people who use PayPal are logged into it, having that in your cart almost guarantees a percent or two improvement in conversion rate, since its just so easy to pay. \n\nPayPal isn't perfect, but from the perspective of someone who does business with it and uses it as both a merchant and end user, there's nothing else that even comes remotely close.",

So why is it happening again? \n\nOf the thousands of dot-coms that were \"going to change the world\", only a scant handful actually did. Amazon and Google, for instance. \n\nAnyone remember Geocities? It was the amazing new social media game-changer, until it got trounced by MySpace, who succumbed to Tumbler's short lived heyday until Facebook owned the world. \n\nYahoo, Infoseek, AskJeeves, etc. were all in the game way ahead of Google. \n\nWhat's my point? Everyone thinks Tesla is the new Google (or Amazon), but from my perspective on history, it looks a lot more like the earlier days, when Yahoo was the golden child waiting for Google to come along and eat its lunch. Tesla is more like Yahoo was than what Google is. \n\nA lot of people seem to think Rivian is going to do the Google thing to Tesla. \n\nBut they are all wrong. Flooz failed to take-down PayPal partly because everyone expected it to, including their own leadership. That's a poisonous attitude. Also, cars are not the Internet. This game is different. \n\nMy money is on the charge-point suppliers. As long as it takes batteries an hour or so to recharge, every restaurant, movie theater, shopping center, etc. will want to have chargers installed as a draw to attract customers. \n\nI'm also invested in battery tech that \\*could\\* create those \"charge in under a minute\" batteries, just in case, but I'm skeptical on those.  When you consider that recharging a 35 kWh battery in one minute requires more than *two-million* watts of energy...  There's a safety issue with that. (Level-2 charging is about 7000 watts. Household current in the US is typically 1600 watts...)",

Everyone on Reddit was still shitting on Bitcoin. \n \nEven though Bitcoin had a small market cap (200 bn) compared to what it could be (gold\u2019s 10 trillion). \n\nAs soon as everyone on Reddit started getting on the hype train that\u2019s when it crashed from 69k to 40k. \n\n\nI remember the same thing with Tesla too. When it was still at a 100bn - 200bn market cap. Everyone on Reddit was shitting on it only for it to reach 1 trillion and now people are suddenly starting to get on the train. \n\nI also remember the same thing with the ARK ETFs. \n\nEveryone was hyping up the ARK ETFs at all time highs. Now that it and it\u2019s underlying stocks have reached lows everyone is now starting to shit on ARK. \n\n I think that means now is a good time to buy a lot of the underlying companies. \n\n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m probably gonna start scaling into TDOC, ZM, COIN, ROKU, SQ  again.",

Their average revenue/customer is $1000 and has been growing. They are Squarespace, Amazon, Square, Paypal, Walmart all in one. The dip on the China crackdown is not deserved. It's trading at a good discount from IV as well. \n\nTencent I only have on my WL. But they are mostly the same but with IPs and all things Digital. Also, Asia likes mobile games. They also own parts of Riot Games and some other western game studios. \n\nChina's Shiller PE is lower which provides more long term prospects while still being an EM. Bullish for the long run. \n\nRight now I m learning about the gold mining industry. I see some value there with the USD looking pretty shaky right now. Not giving out names here since I see more potential. Sorry boys.",
