Depends a lot on region. Europeans love it, but there are lots of local competitors.\n\nAs far as UX and innovation goes, PayPal are light years ahead of credit card companies and have so much more to offer in terms of integrations and ways to make your customers have an easier time paying. \n\nPayPal billing agreement is solid gold for renewals billing success - better than anything else by a few points. If someone buys a subscription from me I'd rather it was PP billing agreement than anything else. \n\nPayPal express is also brilliant. Yeah other providers offer similar, but a lot of people who use PayPal are logged into it, having that in your cart almost guarantees a percent or two improvement in conversion rate, since its just so easy to pay. \n\nPayPal isn't perfect, but from the perspective of someone who does business with it and uses it as both a merchant and end user, there's nothing else that even comes remotely close.",
