The worse part is they currently believe it could have been cryptically circulating in Washington for six weeks now.  About the best news, I've seen is the number of cases in China has slowed, at least if you believe them.\n\nSo, the things that triggered the correction have only gotten worse.  Hence why I said this week will most likely be redder.  There very well could be another announcement like you got from Apple/Mastercard/etc as icing on the cake.  \n\nI'm personally not that concerned about the illness itself.  I am more concerned about potential disruptions.  It could seriously put a hurt on your income and life regardless.  I work in the school system part-time and if they were to say close a school down for two weeks, well there goes that income.  It goes beyond catching the illness itself.\n\nI live in Atlanta, about 30 mins from Jackson Hartsfield, I can tell you that Georgia has been already making lots of preparations (I'm surprised because normally our state is four steps behind).",

Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

I actually had some extra income due to this situation as I work for some wealthy individuals and they asked for some extra help right when the issue hit, but I have to pay off a credit card with 0% interest until November. So I have 10k in assets right now, and 10k that needs to be paid off in November. I am 35 with a family, and we expect to be able to save $1400 per month moving forward as well which includes paying my car payment at 3%, but I live rent free (so I will be able to have another $8.4k to pay off the card). I also have retirement already and put enough in there, so I am not too worried about that. I placed a bit of money in Tesla for 1 week (a friend of mine got in really low talks about it all the time) and I removed it after making some money, just at the right time. I realize I was lucky and want to make the right decisions moving forward. Being as I can make enough to pay off most of my debt, I feel I could be a bit risky. I was contemplating placing about 1k or 2k into the market as I could still double down another 2k if the market goes way down, and then again if it goes down further. Is this the right strategy? 10-20% now knowing I could make that money back by investing more if it crashes? What else should I know? Should I do a Roth IRA now for 2k, or wait until my finances settle....\n\nLastly, I have been using Fidelity as they are already my bank. I like their website, hate their app. I am not locked in to using their services. I tried using Uplift on my phone just to track stocks... hated it. I have heard good things about Sigfig, but did not realize it was not more than a stock tracker and they wanted all my info.
