They're still minuscule when compared to even to PAYPAL, so I believe there's still plenty of growth left. Same with MC. So, if I was you, I'd buy them, especially if there's a pullback. \n\nI do own SQ, MC, and AMZN strictly because of the growth that is still ahead of them. There's also two growth stocks I'm truly impressed with - PAYC (I do own them) and PAYX - don't own, but tempted to jump on their ride. They're also in growth mode, still tiny compared to industry behemoths like ADP. Personally, I think MC is a good buy at this price, SQ is a bit overbought, AMZN too, but if you're buying to hold them for long period of time it don't matter.",

As someone that has been on 3 day work weeks since March, but being paid full salary, I assume this might have something to do with it. This feature was just added about 7 weeks ago, and 2 weeks ago we were all sent a reminder to go back and re-assure that all of our \"scheduled furlough days\" were set correctly in the ADP system. \n\n\nI guess it's possible that these were wrongly reported, and got re-adjusted as ADP asked employers to have their employees assure the furlough's were recorded correctly?",

        "body": "&gt; Hedge-fund billionaire William Ackman has come roaring back after years of dwindling assets and a self-imposed exile from the spotlight.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But the famed activist investor\u2019s recent wins haven\u2019t been fueled by publicly agitating for companies to change. They have instead come from outside-the-box moves like the one that will be on display next week, when Mr. Ackman is expected to launch an initial public offering of the biggest blank-check company ever, raising money to take a future acquisition public.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Ackman hasn\u2019t initiated a public shareholder-activism campaign since he lost a proxy fight with Automatic Data Processing Inc. in 2017. Instead, he has made long-term bets on large companies where he remains an involved shareholder, like Starbucks Corp. Earlier this year, he made a prescient bearish wager that enabled his fund to sidestep the stock market\u2019s plunge. Now he is taking a big swing in the IPO market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the first half of 2020, Mr. Ackman\u2019s public fund, Pershing Square Holdings Ltd., returned 29%\u2014handily beating a 4% decline in the S&amp;P 500\u2014boosted in part by complex hedges he began to put in place in February. Those hedges generated $2.6 billion in proceeds and offset other losses in his portfolio. His strong start to 2020 follows a big win in 2019, when Pershing Square returned more than 50%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Ackman declined to comment for this article.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hailed as an investing savant after strongly outperforming the broader market during the financial crisis, Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square fund swelled to $20 billion under management in mid-2015.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then, his fortune turned. A big bet on drugmaker Valeant began to unravel, ultimately costing the fund billions of dollars and driving losses for three consecutive years. A bet against Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. also floundered, and despite Mr. Ackman\u2019s many public appearances deriding the company\u2019s accounting and business practices, the stock kept rising. Between 2015 and 2019, his private fund shrunk by roughly $9 billion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Ackman stopped raising money for that private fund and focused on the public fund, retreated from the limelight and told investors he was returning to the type of investment analysis that first catapulted him to success.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;His assets under management are now more than $10 billion, with the public fund contributing more than $8.5 billion and the rest in the private fund. That money is concentrated in mostly large companies, such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. \u2014a formerly activist position where the team is on the board\u2014Starbucks and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Ackman has previous experience with taking companies public, having [helped flip](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577322270322801942) Burger King Holdings Inc. public in 2012 through the special-purpose acquisition company he co-founded.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next week, he will take another blank-check company public with the aim of raising $3 billion in its IPO. Pershing Square could add another few billion dollars to the pot, bringing the total amount for the SPAC to invest in a company to nearly $6.5 billion. The goal: to use the money to bring a large private company public, according to a regulatory filing\u2014potentially a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d valued at billions in the private market\u2014and continue Mr. Ackman\u2019s recent winning streak.",
