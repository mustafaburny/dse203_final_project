        "body": "From [Seeking Alpha](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3724985-xilinx-deal-spread-with-advanced-micro-devices-widens-to-highest-ever):\n\nThe deal spread between Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had widened to $65/share, or about 45%, the highest since the deal was announced in October. Xilinx fell 3.7%, while AMD rose 5.9%. Several other technology deals that also need Chinese antitrust approval also saw their spreads widen today.\n\nOne reason for Xilinx's (XLNX) move down may be that risk arb investors can't handle the potential downside for Xilinx (XLNX) if a deal with AMD (AMD) were to fall apart as AMD's shares continue to rocket higher, according to CNBC's David Faber. CNBC's Jim Cramer also said he believed that AMD (AMD) has become a meme stock at this point. AMD shares have jumped almost 25% in the past two weeks.\n\nIn addition a Dealreporter column from last night may be contributing to weakness in the spreads. The opinion piece points out that China's leaders appear to have changed their tone about the importance of technology in late May and may have put the country on a \"technology war footing.\" The U.S. and South Korean's announcement to fund multi-billion dollar semiconductor factories may also have contributed to China's potential slowdown on approving the U.S. deals.\n\nAs far as Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) planned purchase of Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM), the Dealreporter column says the timing is uncertain. Last month traders circulated a report that the timing for Chinese approval had moved out as some customer have issues with export controls, though the deal was still likely to be approved.\n\nRisk arb investors may also be \"de-risking\" due to heightened antitrust risk after Aon (NYSE:AON) and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) abandoned their $30B deal last week after the U.S. sued to block the deal and after a report from The Information last night that the U.S. DOJ is considering filing a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth's planned $8B purchase of Changed Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG).\n\nLast month MLex reported that the AMD's (AMD) purchase of Xilinx (XLNX) is expect to see a Phase Two review by Chinese antitrust regulators. China's State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR is believed to have reached out to industry participants a few months ago to find out their views on market definitions and market shares.\n\nOther deal spreads that are wider today include Maxim (MXIM)/Analog Devices (ADI) and Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR)/II-VI(NASDAQ:IIVI).\n\nAlso last week it was reported that China's review of Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) planned purchase of Arm Holdings (ARMHF) was said to be delayed. China's antitrust regulatory hasn't started its formal review of the deal for Softbank to sell Arm to Nvidia, according to a report from The Information.",

All the while, TSMC is planning to break ground on their 2nm fab at the end of this year, so it remains to be seen if Intel can even catch up to TSMCs breakneck development pace.\n\nOn the other hand, AMD only has 9% of the datacenter market, partly due to supply.  So while Intel will be behind in technology, most server customers have no choice but to choose them since they're what's available.  But you're looking at a slow, continuous bleeding of Intel DC market share, and margins for the next 4 years minimum.  And that means a likely range bound stock price that will probably underperform the market.",

        "body": "Lol investing isn\u2019t easy. People either don\u2019t believe in ur success\u2019s or they want to believe that it\u2019s as easy as picking a name they\u2019ve heard allot or analyst are telling them to buy. \n\nTrue the markets are not too hard fir the regular person to navigate. True the same 10 % those analyst told people was a typical expected ROI, Is actually a percentage that most good options traders would never consider an acceptable margin. At least not from a normal everyday retail investor(  buying a contract for 100.00 ) even on a daily profit margin. Much less a yearly ROi. \n\nBut what\u2019s completely misconceived is it comes easy.  If you are lazy. If you want to be out doing whatever. Hang it up be prepared to work for your edge. Strength and market understanding comes only from time in the market. Hell even being able to time the market only comes from time in the market. It\u2019s not ever really timing it anyway. It\u2019s reading it. There is nothing easy about this. I spend most my days with my face in charts. Or hunting  down stuff like Edgar , patents and financials to build a proper thesis and gauge a perceived area of momentum. \n\nBut wait your not even done there bc the market now days is ran by algos. Meaning value , at least in the common sense it\u2019s not even the deciding factor anymore in deciding which stock to buy. \n\nThen after you teach yourself all of that so that you\u2019re able to do it correctly and be confident, then you still have to be able to rea amd gauge  the market sentiment sector saturation , track \u201c smart money \u201c, differentiate the two finding what the momentum means\u2026 a  pump and dump from her very overpriced stock that\u2019s just got the juice to sustain that trajectory. And we haven\u2019t even talked about the downsideLike right now when the market can go either way. How to protect yourself what options to play what not to do. I\u2019m sure you get the point\n\nPoint is Anything in life worth having comes from hard work. this is a hell of a rewarding line of work to be into once you\u2019re good at it you don\u2019t have to spend as much time on it anymore it comes naturally but definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy and definitely don\u2019t  ask anybody to do your dirty work for you because you will get caught up.  \n\nAll that said sorry the comment is so long. I\u2019m passionate about this. A lot of people need to know",
