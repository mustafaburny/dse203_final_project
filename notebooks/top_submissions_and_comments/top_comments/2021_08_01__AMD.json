INTC will float 50-60 for the foreseeable future but you'll get a dividend.\n\nWhile I have it, I sell covered calls.  It's so predictable makes pricing a preferred outcome easier.  \n\nAfter 12 months I sell covered calls with a tighter strike price and let someone else take the shares.  Usually after pocketing the price on a few sold contracts.\n\nInternally, there is definitely a sea change.  Lots of smart development moves.  Gelsinger has a vision.  Swan didn't.\n\nSome cool innovations under the radar that could bode well.  Hard to talk about.  Lots of cool packaging tech that's 5 years ahead of the competition.  Packaging chips has a lot to do with thermals which is the only reason Intel chips don't burst into flames.\n\nPrognosis: AMD eats our lunch for a few years.  Intel ramps up their foundry (selling their factory usage) which makes investors happy in the short term.  Long term - Intel innovates and is fine.\n\nSuper long outlook - Intel drops tech and gets in the restaurant business.  Or clowns.",

So while Intel will be behind in technology, most server customers have no choice but to choose them since they're what's available.  But you're looking at a slow, continuous bleeding of Intel DC market share, and margins for the next 4 years minimum.

        "body": "&gt;Growth, on the other hand, provides an informational asymmetry that Wall Street can\u2019t efficiently price.  So retail traders can win in that game.  In fact, retail traders can outperform in growth because they have more collective experience on the product side that Wall Street can\u2019t buy.\n\nTotally agree. However I think it is slowly being eroded. I've noticed funds like Baillie Gifford are good at growth investing, I think it's actually probably not that hard if its your day job and you know what to look for.\n\nI think that this information asymmetry edge is actually a difference edge in disguise. I think the real edge retail has is the volatility, because they can hold on to a business that they know is good in the long run, even with step drops. Even the very, very best equity hedge funds, like Tiger group back in the day, have a lot of pressure to produce consistent results.\n\nI held onto AMD through a 50% drop once, decided to buy more, I wasn't being super brave or anything, I just knew the issues were temporary. Anything institutional probably isn't allowed to do this even if the analyst knows.\n\nThe market might be an even better hunting ground now than Buffetts time, because there are so many more stocks to look at, and the incentives haven't changed. In fact, the usual incentives now have these algorithms they can pour money into, so there's probably less eyeballs and brains actually valuing businesses based on real world information relative to the opportunities available. It's just that numerical data is priced in better.",
