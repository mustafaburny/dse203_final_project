Rome already get much better traction and qualified much faster than Naples, Milan likely coming mid year and it will qualify fast too\n* new 7nm Zen 2 with 8 cores Renoir-APU and better memory controller (huge power savings, clockspeed gains, IPC gains, better dealing with bandwith bottleneck) are expected tomorrow/very early this year (increased cadence compared to last years), while Intel has capacity and node issues. Intel tries to cut iGPU for desktop to regain capacity, but they samewhat forfeit marketshare with this call. OEMs have to use discret graphics, which they hate for Budget PCs (additional cost, additional power supply...). a refresh with better graphics can be expected ready for holiday season (van Gogh)\n* overall better economy forecast and china deal, so likely higher demand, Intel cannot supply processors, so AMD will even more\n* AMD ordered a **huge** amount of TSMCs wafer capacity, so they made a call\n* there is still the possibility of Apple using Zen for MacBooks and Macs, it's only clear that they drop Intel this year. Apple may use it's own chips, but that's quite a barrier (x86 -&gt; ARM) and they use AMD GPUs\n* Nvidia has yield issues, probably their line up is delayed a few months",
