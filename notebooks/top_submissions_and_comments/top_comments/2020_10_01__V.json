This is when central banks purchase short term bonds (with money that's created out of thin air) to create liquidity in the market. This liquidity is created because the central bank is buying up so many bonds that all the sellers now have money that become bank deposits (which lowers the overnight lending rate between banks, aka the target interest rate) and can stimulate the overall economy in general.\n\nBut if you compare our central bank assets (the bonds the BoC purchased) to our **GDP YoY**... which is the measure of the annualized change in the inflation-adjusted value of all goods and services produced by the economy...

        "body": " **I\u2019m considering cashing out my income portfolio and sitting in the sidelines for a while.** Ah, trying to do some \"smart shit\" like \"buying low, selling high, and timing the market\". Cool man, good luck with that.  \n\n**My problem is, I don\u2019t know what I would need to see in order for me to get back in.** I don't either because I don't try to do \"smart shit\" like you.\n\n**If my holdings dip after I sell, I\u2019ll gladly re enter at a lower price. But how low?** Only you can answer that.\n\n**If the downward move doesn\u2019t happen, then I\u2019ll get back in at a X% loss, which would more than likely be less than the loss of holding through it.** Good observation.\n\n**But who\u2019s to say it won\u2019t drop right after I get back in??** No one. Not even \"professionals\" (whatever the fuck that means).\n\n**Is this why ppl just dollar cost average through all the volatility? I get that it makes sense, but there\u2019s gotta be a better way. Right?** Yes, the better way is to turn your brain off and stop trying to do \"smart shit\". Time in the market beats timing the market.\n\n**Any help would be much appreciated.** Your statements and/or questions scream of noobness and lack of knowledge. You are playing a game with real money and it sounds like you have no idea what you are doing. Here are some more general guidelines which I sincerely believe that everyone should have ingrained in their heads when formulating their personal strategy:\n\n1. Pay no respect to volatility of the markets. Who fucking cares about low growth times, high growth times, COVID, no COVID, \"all time highs\", \"all time lows\" or wherever the fuck we are on the \"graph\". You should not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, you should not care at all. Volatility should not mean anything to you since you should be a super long-term investor.\n2. You cannot predict the future and you cannot time the market. \"Time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies. Therefore, you should invest as much as you can every time you get paid while while balancing a decent quality of life (whatever that means to you). Basically, don't try to pull off some \"smart shit\" by pulling out your money because you think the markets will crash and then put your money back into the market after it crashes to capitalize on that hypothetical situation in your little head. Turn off your brain and keep your money in the markets because again, \"time in the market\" is superior to \"timing the market\" as per academic studies.\n3. You should consider investing in an \"index exchange traded fund\" or \"index-ETF\" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index-ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors who pick stocks will under perform an index-ETF over the long-term.\n4. Don\u2019t day trade. Don't try to \"get rich quick\". Don't try to \"buy low, sell high\". Don't buy shit/garbage. Don't buy \"meme stocks\". Don't worry about \"missing out\". Build wealth slowly over time as this is a long-term game and not a short-term or medium-term game.\n5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity because everything goes on sale which includes high-quality companies and index-ETFs; and therefore, you get to buy more stuff at a discount. Do not fear these times, embrace them instead because these are the times which can actually accelerate you towards your financial goals quicker.\n6. Again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens in the world, economy, politics/elections, wars, recessions, poverty, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). You should have an unshakable discipline in buying index-ETFs or purchasing well-established, high-quality, dividend growth companies with wide economic/competitive moats as well as a proven track record of paying dividends through tough times every two weeks until you retire or die.\n7. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks regardless of what happens (even if this time is \"different\" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, long-term minded investor who just doesn't give two fucks about volatility).\n\nKeep it simple. Keep yourself disciplined. Keep hustling. Keep your money. Good luck with personal finance and investing! =)",

Thought to myself, \u201cJPow\u2019s gonna let it slide a lil to send a message to munchkin and pelooski, I\u2019ll capitalize on the dip and then go balls deep in calls for the V recovery right? Wrong, I watched 58% of my account bleed out over the course of six days. Yes I\u2019m a retard for letting it happen that long, and yes it would\u2019ve been better for me to light that money on fire. \n\nIt deadass took me 30 minutes and five spy calls today to make up 40% of my losses. Idk what I can say except I\u2019m sorry. \n\n\nTLDR: Puts r gey, ber r fuk, and blackrock is my daddy",

        "body": "Potential earnings plays:\n\nATVI: Bull Case: Will beat estimates. Forward guidance will be great considering new console releases and Christmas. Winner of election does not have a big impact. Trading below ATH and trading below price from previous earnings. Has been consolidated for a while and no pre-earnings run up. Free advertising in forms of celebrity streamers playing ATVI games is underappreciated.\n\nBear Case: Last earnings beat but was a buy the rumor sell the news ordeal. Do investors feel safe putting their cash in ATVI during these times? ATVI has burned lots of people who played their earnings.\n\nETSY: Bull Case: Has been consistently green in this massive sea of red. Profitable for 4 consecutive quarters with a recent S&amp;P inclusion. Advertising revenue should be up bigly. Etsy does a great job of retaining first time customers. COVID cases and potential lock downs help ETSY. Christmas around the corner.\n\nBear Case: No stimulus which impacts this non-essential business+. Lots of competition. Big run up post SNAP earnings largely in part of surprise ad revenue from SNAP earnings. This could very well be priced in and a beat could still result in a sell off. Large part of business was mask sales. IV very high and estimated EPS high\n\nTWTR: Bull Case: Increased users that will continue due to elections. Could have a major gap up like SNAP in large part of unexpected ad revenue. Potential for 10+ bagger.\n\nBear Case: Trading at ATH. Growing at a much slower rate in terms of Y/Y revenue and profitability versus its competitors (FB, SNAP, etc.) Lots of controversy this quarter. An insane run up to earnings. Expectations very high because of SNAP. Last quarter was atrocious. Expectations are a big increase in ad revenue. TWTR struggles with ad revenue in large part because it is a more text-heavy platform in a social media world dominated by visual ads. Not too profitable and operating at a loss.\n\nSQ: Gapped up on previous 4 earnings (feel free to fact check me this may be incorrect). Purchase of $50 mil in shitcoin and may offer crypton payments like PYPL. Has an edge on the younger demographics. Approved for bank opening in 2021. Cash app is very profitable (23% of revenue is profit) . Cash app is 62% of revenue. Price to sales lower than PYPL and V. Nice dip for good entry. Earnings not priced in (yet). SQ Card readers are a hot item with a big profit margin.\n\nBear Case: Competition from PYPL and Chase who just entered this market. Sort of a one trick pony that relies too much on revenue from Cash App. Already up 150% on the year. Do investors trust Jack Dorsey long term?\n\n\\*Disclaimer\\* I have no positions in any of these. This is hardly DD but just some quick analysis for a potential play. All depends on how the market reacts tomorrow. I'd stay away from TWTR unless you're buying puts. Now do your own DD you lazy fucks.\n\nEdit: I can add this as a flaired discussion post if you'd like to it doesn't get lost in this thread.",
