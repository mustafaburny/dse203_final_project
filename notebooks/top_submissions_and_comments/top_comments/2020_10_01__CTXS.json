        "body": "I started out with a 2 year degree in computer science and lucked into a 38K a year job as a sysadmin. At that job I started my 4 year degree in compsci and started pursuing certifications. In 2 years years I finished my A+ and network+, which allowed me to get a new job as a server administrator for a credit union. A year into that job I got microsoft certified, and a year after that I got my security+ certification with a promotion to systems engineer. I learned everything I could at that credit union; I made their consultants obsolete by learning cisco networking and VMware administration. The following year I finished my bachelor's in computer science, and then asked the same consultants I made obsolete at the credit union for a job. That was 6 months ago, right as all this covid stuff hit.\n\nThe only reason they lost my credit union as a client was because they took the time to show me around VMware and cisco administration. They taught me just enough for me to put together a vsphere cluster in my home lab with cisco switching and routing. That was all I needed to gain the confidence necessary to stop calling them. I decided that I wanted to work with them around the time I no longer needed their help! \n\nI knew it was risky going from a secure job as a Systems engineer at a credit union to an IT consultant for a small firm, but it was totally worth it. I wake up when I want to and work when I want to. I need to bill 15 hours a week to pay for myself and make the firm some extra money. Anything extra just makes me look good! Now I'm VMware certified and working on Citrix and Cisco certifications. I love all of my colleagues and the constant learning opportunities. I wouldn't trade my current job for anything.\n\nTldr: Never stop learning. Aim for a new certification every year, and make sure to network!",

Amazon actually has better synergy between its a) streaming biz b) Amazon online biz by the way of cross-marketing between the streaming customers and buyers, on top of that the home automation market, and much more capital to play in the streaming biz vs. Netflix, and lastly  c) Netflix's production capabilities is very much replicable with enough capital.\n\n2) I believe Amazon is well positioned to dominate the streaming market with Twitch, yet it will have synergies between the Streaming biz, Gaming biz, and Online Retail biz. Amazon can potentially fight steam for the platform biz, and it is already incorporating advanced gamification into Twitch that I believe will ultimately integrate with its Online retail and Gaming Biz\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) AWS and thin clients,. desktop virtualization space. This is a market that has explosive underlying growth behind it, and Amazon alongside Citrix is well positioned to capture more MS down the road.",

There is an endless amount of \"free\" youtube videos and courses from TD Ameritrade, TastyTrade, eTrade, Fidelity, etc. But, what they don't show you is how someone actually puts that knowledge to practice into developing a strategy that allows you to make an income while properly managing risk. The course I went through helped with that and may be most people don't necessarily have the issues that I ran into using these courses. But, in hindsight, I wasted way too much time just going through these free videos without really understanding how they work in the real world.     \n    \nEdit: I didn't want to appear as if I'm spamming but I got a couple of DMs asking about the course I took. It's from ZipTrader. You can get 70% of the information from his youtube channel. But, I wanted something more structured and he really goes in a lot more detail in the course. I highly recommend it. Check out his free videos on YouTube particularly the one on why he is a trader and if it resonates with you (like it did for me), and you want to go ahead and check out the course, DM me for a discount coupon.",

        "body": "TOS has great charting. Very flexible. Very nice but it can be overwhelming. But it is good. \n\nYou need to apply to trade the different options trading levels. Some people complain that they can\u2019t get to the level they want so they change brokerages. \n\nIn my experience Tastyworks is the most liberal in giving out option permissions and I think they are a little cheaper.\n\nI trade with TW, TDA and Fidelity. I trade Roth accounts and cash accounts. \n\nThe Roth and IRA accounts have limited trading permissions but I\u2019m ok with that. You can\u2019t have margin you can\u2019t sell naked calls. \n\nYou want to be able to trade ...\n\nCash secured puts\nCovered calls\nSingle leg calls/puts\nAnd importantly call/put spreads\n\nIf you BUY an option, that is your max loss. \n\nIf you SELL an option, that is your max gain. \n\nI strongly suggest that you take advantage of TOS paper trading. It\u2019s free. Practice trading options for months. For free. No risk. You can practice all the strategies and most importantly learn to manage a trade. \n\nYou will need to roll a trade out in time to give yourself more time to be right. You can also roll a trade out and up/down. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to teach you how to trade, but option trading requires management. It is as important to manage winners as well as losers. \n\nMonths ago I bought SNAP at $19.8x and sold a $20 covered call for $1. That is 5%. Not bad for a month. \n\nI\u2019ve rolled it out and up so I now have a $25 covered call. I\u2019m still ITM but the point is that it\u2019s never only one trade. And the trade isn\u2019t over. \n\nAm I an expert - no. But just realize that options trading is not one and done. It\u2019s not. \n\nAnd it is a sum zero game. Your lose is my gain. We all don\u2019t profit. Stocks go up and everyone wins. That is not true with options. \n\nYou need to be very smart to make money. Smarter than average. Are you?\n\nPaper trade. See how you stand.",

(I've only ever used Schwab, which is fantastic, but the others are known for great support.)\n* Financial advice and free workshops\n* As far as I can tell, better order flow. Schwab abides by NBBO and provides price improvement on approximately\n90% of orders. (Unlike RH, other brokerages apparently don't make a lot of money on order flow.)\n* Native real-time trading apps (Schwab has StreetSmart, Fidelity has Active Trader Pro)\n* Roboadvisors\n\nNone of this costs anything extra, though tailored financial advisor services do come extra.\n\nI think one of the big draws of a brokerage like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard is access to mutual funds. At Robinhood you're limited to stocks, which includes ETFs. Mutual funds offer a wider range of funds, including target date funds and tax management funds. (Contrary to what many people on Reddit seem to believe, mutual funds don't just mean expensive actively managed funds! There are tons of cheap funds, and some that are even cheaper than ETFs.) For example, my IRAs are all in target date funds that have a fee of just 0.08%.\n\nIf I were starting out today, I'd pick Vanguard. Fantastic company with a uniquely altruistic vision.",

        "body": "From an interview with Fidelity Contrafund manager Will Danoff: \n\n\"So, I'd say it's a very healthy give-and-take and dialogue. And I would say, often because Joel and I and all the other fund managers started as Fidelity research analysts, when a new analyst arrives, they usually show up at my office with a list, and say \u201cI'm the new railroad analyst. Here are my names, and I like XYZ railroad because the group's trading at 14 times earnings, and this ones trading at 11 times earnings.\u201d And I might say, \u201cWow, that's interesting. Why is that one trading at such a discount to the group?\u201d And the analysts might say, \u201cWell, they just lost their largest customer\u201d or \u201cthey've got a big business into Mexico and Mexico's into a recession,\u201d or \u201cTrump wants to build a wall and therefore the Mexican business is falling off a cliff.\u201d **And I usually say, \u201cThat's not the type of company I'm interested in. I'm interested in companies that are doing well, where the earnings outlook is positive, where earnings per share is growing. Maybe it's growing faster than people think. What do you have on your list that would fit that bill even if it's more expensive than the average company in your group?\u201d** So, it's that's sort of give-and-take. And I might encourage an analyst to reorient their priority list to help me look for stocks that fit my ideal pattern.\" (https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/the-long-view/40)\n\nToo many people I think jump to an Intel because \"LOOKS CHEAP!\" when they'd have been better off with the things that appear more expensive where the company is doing well and the outlook is positive.\n\nIntel spent $15B on Mobileye, and for all the discussion of self driving, I don't know that I've heard anything much regarding Mobileye probably since they bought it.\n\nLastly,\n\n\"Intel completely missed out on the smartphone revolution, too, having been unable to come up with an answer for the rise of the ultra-low-power ARM SoC. After its smartphone insurgency, ARM chips quickly moved on Intel's territory by spreading to tablets and laptops. Intel's latest black eye is being completely dumped by Apple, which, after building its own ARM design house for the iPhone and iPad, has announced plans to upscale its ARM chips to Mac laptops and desktops.\"\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/heads-roll-at-intel-after-7nm-delay/\n\n\"Laptops and desktops are the next great frontier for Apple's chip division. That division will help the company avoid the same fate that has befallen Android smartwatch manufacturers: letting some other company dictate your product lineup. Apple's plans to update the Mac have often been stymied by Intel's product roadmap, and Intel does not make chips that serve all of Apple's design priorities. The new CPU will be just one part of an Apple-designed system-on-a-chip that would also include (among other things) an Apple GPU and a desktop version of Apple's Neural Engine machine learning and AI processor found in the iPhone and iPad.\"\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/this-is-apples-roadmap-for-moving-the-first-macs-away-from-intel/\n\n\"Intel actually says that the issues with its current 7nm production means that production is trending a year behind its internal roadmap. For some reason, though, the company says that being a year behind schedule will still only result in that aforementioned six-month delay to market. For comparison, AMD has already been outputting its own Ryzen 4000 chips based on its 7nm architecture for months, which have been handily outperforming Intel\u2019s offerings.\"\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu",

You can put money in there and buy stocks just like robinhood, plus you have access to international stocks if that matters to you, and it will be tax free when you turn 59.5. Plus, you get free withdrawals of your contribution amount anytime (you\u2019re only taxed on your gains for early withdrawals I believe). So there\u2019s not much of a downside.

I had major paper hands, and just couldn't resist checking the prices to see if I had lost a few dollars. \n\nI would say that most people would and should be investing as early as possible, reason being that you can put money in index funds and hold for the long term. Trading is a different matter, I would say that around the age of 15-16 is probably a good time to start. Start with a little bit, and play around with it. The reason being is that you're able to experiment and learn things about the market before actually committing larger amounts of money. \n\nAs for starting off, I would highly recommend watching youtube videos or a udemy course on investing basics, as well as looking at Investopedia. Those in combination with reading posts on specific reddit subs (r/stocks, r/finance, r/stockmarket, r/options) helped me get started. Reading reddit posts gets me more interested into trading. Stay away from WSB though, there's a lot more meme material there.\n\nIf you want to invest and not trade, then research basic market principles, how index funds/ETFs work, and research various ETFs. Generally I like to look at total market index funds, mid-large cap company funds, and emerging markets/fast growing markets such as Tech, EV, and Cannabis.\n\nIf you want to minimize risk, hold ETFs for the long term. Open a brokerage account through Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Schwab, etc and put a portion of your paycheck into it. I actually really like this short document that has an ETF trading strategy: [https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)\n\nTL;DR: Look at a basic investing course on Udemy or YouTube to learn basics of the market, and read about things on specific reddit subs. Invest and don't trade (investing tends to be holding for the long term while trading tends to be more short term). Invest in ETFs, and there are many different resources for finding which ones to invest in.",

        "body": "&gt;yep, they had etrade, sharebuilder (let you buy fractional shares), first trade was another one back then. It cost you i think about 5 dollars a trade and later you had a monthly fee. Fidelity you had to have 15k and some of the others a high amount as well. this was easy to ignore when everything was going up not so much post 1999.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;i invested everything in november of 1999 from my time in the military after a financial planning meeting. I went with communications, Lucent, qualcom, nokia, JDS uniphase and glw. I just remember a mutual fund i had went from 1000 dollars when i bought it to 200 dollars the next month.  I had about 10k worth of stock and it lost about half its value in the course of 3 months and kept going lower. I sold some and bough marvel comics which was around a 1 dollar a share after the release of the first x-men movie but they were risky due to flirting with bankruptcy yet again.  I did really well with my 500 dollars i bought sold at 23 dollars a share wish i kept it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  My dad sold his Apple stock about 50k worth  (he bought one year after the ipo) in 1992 to buy Marvel Stock which went bankrupt.",
