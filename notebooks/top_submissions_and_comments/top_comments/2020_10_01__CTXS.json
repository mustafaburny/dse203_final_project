        "body": "In my experience calls are particularly risky on low cost stocks whether they are close to earnings or not. For one, you need to buy a lot of calls to make a solid gain. Even average down on calls. Secondly if unforeseen issues arise like failed stimulus packages, an increase in COVID outbreak, an increase in unemployment, other bad news, perhaps the market shits itself like it did in March, or bad GDP numbers come out .... well .... options expire. Stocks live forever ... or until bankruptcy at least. I believe in PSFW, GPK, &amp; at least for now, ITI. I know that bagholdong these will eventually get me my money back if the unforeseen happens. Not so buying calls. \n\nNevertheless it may work out for you. But I buy calls two quarters out. Which is in part why these stocks don\u2019t look particularly attractive to me from an options stand point. They\u2019ll need to pump hard to break even. IV can be massive near earnings. If I were to buy calls I would do it after a post earnings sell off. The IV crush will make them cheaper and the value added by IV will grow until next ER. Your question isn\u2019t an easy one for me to answer because I am very risk adverse when it comes to options. Just sold my 5 CTXS call options for a profit today and could have made a lot more of I had just held on to them.\n\nLong answer but I wanted you to see it at a different point of view.",

        "body": "I started out with a 2 year degree in computer science and lucked into a 38K a year job as a sysadmin. At that job I started my 4 year degree in compsci and started pursuing certifications. In 2 years years I finished my A+ and network+, which allowed me to get a new job as a server administrator for a credit union. A year into that job I got microsoft certified, and a year after that I got my security+ certification with a promotion to systems engineer. I learned everything I could at that credit union; I made their consultants obsolete by learning cisco networking and VMware administration. The following year I finished my bachelor's in computer science, and then asked the same consultants I made obsolete at the credit union for a job. That was 6 months ago, right as all this covid stuff hit.\n\nThe only reason they lost my credit union as a client was because they took the time to show me around VMware and cisco administration. They taught me just enough for me to put together a vsphere cluster in my home lab with cisco switching and routing. That was all I needed to gain the confidence necessary to stop calling them. I decided that I wanted to work with them around the time I no longer needed their help! \n\nI knew it was risky going from a secure job as a Systems engineer at a credit union to an IT consultant for a small firm, but it was totally worth it. I wake up when I want to and work when I want to. I need to bill 15 hours a week to pay for myself and make the firm some extra money. Anything extra just makes me look good! Now I'm VMware certified and working on Citrix and Cisco certifications. I love all of my colleagues and the constant learning opportunities. I wouldn't trade my current job for anything.\n\nTldr: Never stop learning. Aim for a new certification every year, and make sure to network!",

Amazon actually has better synergy between its a) streaming biz b) Amazon online biz by the way of cross-marketing between the streaming customers and buyers, on top of that the home automation market, and much more capital to play in the streaming biz vs. Netflix, and lastly  c) Netflix's production capabilities is very much replicable with enough capital.\n\n2) I believe Amazon is well positioned to dominate the streaming market with Twitch, yet it will have synergies between the Streaming biz, Gaming biz, and Online Retail biz. Amazon can potentially fight steam for the platform biz, and it is already incorporating advanced gamification into Twitch that I believe will ultimately integrate with its Online retail and Gaming Biz\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) AWS and thin clients,. desktop virtualization space. This is a market that has explosive underlying growth behind it, and Amazon alongside Citrix is well positioned to capture more MS down the road.",
