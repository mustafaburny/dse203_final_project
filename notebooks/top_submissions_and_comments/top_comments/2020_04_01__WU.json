        "body": "&gt;The coronavirus outbreak has brought China\u2019s extraordinary, nearly half-century-long run of growth to an end \u2014 a stark reminder of the enormous task ahead for world leaders trying to restart the global economy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Chinese officials on Friday said that the world\u2019s second-largest economy shrank 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year compared with a year ago, ending a streak of untrammeled growth that survived the Tiananmen Square crackdown, the SARS epidemic and even the global financial crisis. The data reflects China\u2019s drastic efforts to stamp out the coronavirus, which included shutting down most factories and offices in January and February as the outbreak sickened tens of thousands of people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The stark numbers make clear how monumental the challenge of getting the global economy back on its feet will be. Since it emerged from abject poverty and isolation more than 40 years ago, China has become perhaps the world\u2019s single most important growth engine, one that lifted fortunes during previous times of trouble, like the financial crisis.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now China is trying to restart its vast, $14 trillion economy, an effort that could give the rest of the world a much-needed shot in the arm. The coronavirus\u2019s spread to the United States and Europe, which froze the economies there, has led to forecasts that the world\u2019s output could shrink far more this year than it did even during the financial crisis.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That global halt will, conversely, hurt China\u2019s efforts to get back on track, creating a difficult economic puzzle for top leaders in Beijing. The pandemic and attempts to contain it have sharply cut the world\u2019s appetite for China\u2019s goods, which could lead to factory shutdowns and worker furloughs even as the country tries to get back to business.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;China has gradually lifted many of its limits on work and travel in recent weeks. But businesspeople across China say that times remain difficult. Families say their incomes have fallen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThis year is difficult \u2014 some have lost their jobs, some cannot find work to do,\u201d said Liu Xia, a fruit vendor from a village on the northern outskirts of Beijing. \u201cThose who do go to work and those who are still in business are greatly affected.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The contraction, announced on Friday morning in Beijing by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, is the first economic shrinkage acknowledged in official statistics since 1976, when the country was in the final days of the Cultural Revolution, a national spasm of urban violence and torture.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;China\u2019s historic growth streak was fueled by the creation of an extensive, modern network of highways and railways, the strong entrepreneurship of its people, its skilled work force and a government that was willing to set environmental and labor concerns aside for the sake of ever-greater economic output. But those factors were no match for the coronavirus, which, after it first emerged from the city of Wuhan in late December, ground the country\u2019s huge engine of industry to a virtual halt.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Beijing\u2019s options are limited. It has so far avoided unfurling a huge spending package like leaders in the United States and Europe have done. Its economy has become too big and complex to easily restart like it did in 2008, when it unveiled a plan to spend more than half a trillion dollars. Years of easy lending have also left local governments and state-run companies mired in debt.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yet China\u2019s leaders face pressure to act. Withering household incomes have caused families to retrench their spending. Han Xiaojuan, a 35-year-old who has a small shop selling jackets and slippers, said many people were only buying necessities these days.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for more than 10 years in Beijing,\u201d Ms. Han said. \u201cThis is the worst of times.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;China has eased up on its most drastic measures against the epidemic. Last week a stringent lockdown ended in Wuhan, where the outbreak began.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yet many social distancing measures remain. From restaurants to passenger planes to trains, many seats may no longer be used, which limits sales. Shopping malls and sidewalk shops still have less foot traffic than usual, as many people stay home, wary of infection.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The continued effect of the epidemic showed up in other data released on Friday morning, reflecting the country\u2019s economic performance in March. That data, like statistics on imports and exports that were released on Tuesday, showed that the economy has begun to recover but still has a considerable distance to go.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Industrial production slipped 1.1 percent in March compared to a year ago, while retail sales fell 15.8 percent. Investment in fixed assets was down 16.1 percent for the first three months of the year compared with last year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cGiven the continuous spread of the epidemic globally, mounting downward pressure on the world economy and growing uncertainties, we are now facing heightened pressures,\u201d said Mao Shengyong, the spokesman of the National Bureau of Statistics, at a news briefing in Beijing on Friday morning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next blow for China\u2019s economy could come from weakening global demand for its exports.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Canton Fair is the country\u2019s main export event, featuring tens of thousands of exhibitors and hundreds of thousands of buyers from around the world. It was supposed to start on Wednesday of this week and last until early May. Instead, it is slated to be a more modest, online event in mid-June.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even Chinese businesses with existing overseas customers are finding that many buyers want to postpone or cancel deliveries.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe delays in orders are occurring everywhere,\u201d said Aaron Yang, owner of Arnan Fashion Jewelry, an earrings exporter in Yiwu, in east-central China.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Wu Jianying, the owner of Fang Weimei Toys, a water pistol exporter in Yiwu, said that this should be the busiest time of year for her exports, as retailers in the West prepare for the summer swimming pool season. But retailers have stopped placing orders. Some have even stopped wiring money for existing orders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe payments are difficult to collect,\u201d she said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Businesspeople say the near-complete closure of China\u2019s borders to limit a potential second wave of infections has hurt export orders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cA lot of clients wanted to come to China from Africa but can\u2019t, because the flights are canceled,\u201d said He Liehui, chief executive of Touchroad Group, a Shanghai trading and investment firm that buys minerals and timber from Africa and exports apparel and other manufactured goods there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. He said there had already been changes within both the domestic and overseas markets. Sales have fallen for more fashionable garments with higher price tags. But sales have actually increased for pajamas and other simple garments that people may want to wear indoors during lockdowns, he said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cFor that, the companies need to make some adjustments\u201d in what they manufacture, he said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Beijing has closed the country\u2019s borders so tightly that even foreign residents of China who have gone overseas are not allowed to return. That has slowed big construction projects and other investments that need technicians and other specialists who cannot re-enter the country, said Cheung Yup Fan, the chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in the city of Tianjin.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Another worry lies in how many small and medium-sized enterprises in China can survive the current difficulties. Even before the pandemic, many of those businesses had been struggling, as state-owned enterprises with better political connections increasingly monopolized the available loans from the state-controlled banking sector.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As a result, small businesses tend to borrow within informal networks. Now those networks are in trouble, said Sara Hsu, an economist at the State University of New York at New Paltz who specializes in small businesses in China.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cA lot of small and medium enterprises borrow from friends and families, who also have small and medium enterprises,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a crunch for all of these borrowers.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;China\u2019s output for the entire quarter was depressed by the broad suspension of economic activity from late January to late February. SpaceKnow, a commercial satellite imagery business, said northern China\u2019s notorious air pollution almost completely vanished in February as businesses shut down and people stopped driving.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even now, satellite imagery of nighttime lighting in China suggests that the country\u2019s industrial base is running at half its usual level, according to SpaceKnow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cChina may have seen the Covid-19 outbreak first and local closures slowed the economy, but now China appears to be feeling the brunt of the slowing global economy,\u201d said Jeremy Fand, the company\u2019s chief executive.",

        "body": "I'm with you dude.  Just did a sell that puts me basically in the 80+% cash territory.  I was already 20% out of the market before this crash began mostly because 2019 was a ganbuster year and I felt like 2020 was going to be slower.  I was waiting until tax season to exit further, but COVID caught me by surprise.  I exited to the tune of 60% earlier during this bounce, early last week.\n\nI was waiting to see if it would keep going up before selling more.  Right now overall the market is at around mid 2019 levels.  Some of the individual equities I sold (e.g. AMD) were back up to end-of-2019 levels.  I'm leaving a few small funds and equities in: health care related stuff, and a very small amount (&lt;5% total) in gold.\n\nMy reasoning is broader than the market situation.  I don't speak in terms of \"confident that the market will drop\".  I don't know exactly what the market will do.  All I know is that I have no confidence in my understanding of why the market is behaving as it does, and I don't have confidence it will stay up.\n\nThe second factor is employment.  I'm employed right now, but who knows 1 year or 2 years down the line.  The market effects of this pandemic, especially labour market effects, are going to play out over a while.  If I lose my job (and the risk of that is definitely higher now that half the economy across the continent are shutting down), a bunch of \"time in the market\" funds that are temporarily low does nothing for me.\n\nAs the philosophers from the Wu-Tang Clan posited: cash rules everything around me.  I'm not a market ninja.  I'm not neo from the matrix, dodging bullets and reading fucking falling heiroglyphics.  I'm just a hustler that knows when to turn in :)",
