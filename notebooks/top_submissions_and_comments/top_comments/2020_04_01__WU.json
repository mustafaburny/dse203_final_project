        "body": "I'm with you dude.  Just did a sell that puts me basically in the 80+% cash territory.  I was already 20% out of the market before this crash began mostly because 2019 was a ganbuster year and I felt like 2020 was going to be slower.  I was waiting until tax season to exit further, but COVID caught me by surprise.  I exited to the tune of 60% earlier during this bounce, early last week.\n\nI was waiting to see if it would keep going up before selling more.  Right now overall the market is at around mid 2019 levels.  Some of the individual equities I sold (e.g. AMD) were back up to end-of-2019 levels.  I'm leaving a few small funds and equities in: health care related stuff, and a very small amount (&lt;5% total) in gold.\n\nMy reasoning is broader than the market situation.  I don't speak in terms of \"confident that the market will drop\".  I don't know exactly what the market will do.  All I know is that I have no confidence in my understanding of why the market is behaving as it does, and I don't have confidence it will stay up.\n\nThe second factor is employment.  I'm employed right now, but who knows 1 year or 2 years down the line.  The market effects of this pandemic, especially labour market effects, are going to play out over a while.  If I lose my job (and the risk of that is definitely higher now that half the economy across the continent are shutting down), a bunch of \"time in the market\" funds that are temporarily low does nothing for me.\n\nAs the philosophers from the Wu-Tang Clan posited: cash rules everything around me.  I'm not a market ninja.  I'm not neo from the matrix, dodging bullets and reading fucking falling heiroglyphics.  I'm just a hustler that knows when to turn in :)",
