Then you sell one call or put right ATM (right at 50 delta). This gives you a total of 100 (or -100 for the puts) deltas. So, you are synthetically long or short 100 shares of the underlying. The longer you go out the more it will cost, but usually you can get a spread for about 50% of what it would cost to buy 100 shares. And that is going out one year or more. \n\nAnd I also will sell calls against the position like a CC, but with about more leverage.",

IMO, you're not going to see explosive growth with these stocks like in tech, but they are probably pretty safe bets. Most companies specialize in one thing such as PKG that focuses on corrugated boxes or SEE that manufactures plastics (eg. air pillows, bubble wrap). One interesting company is ZBRA, that is more of a tech company that does a lot in logistics. Also, a lot of manufacturers don't sell direct and go through a distribution network to sell their products which adds some complexity to understanding the market. There's a ton of competition from China and Mexico where they make and sell super cheap packaging materials.",

It has resulted in less work (due to efficiency), so that has also caused the FCs to be overstaffed because there is a lag in adjustment.  Less shifts for workers.
