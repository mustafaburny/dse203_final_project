The most I feel I could probably say is it's really cool and has way more potential than the SNPs and predisposition service which they provide to the user, that's less interesting. I don't actually think the consumer side of 23 and Me is particularly amazing and is quite easily replicated by others, as, as you say, much of their information is from journals that anyone could use. However, you should be excited for the company, they're definitely the big player in the field and if anyone could pivot from the SNPs into another cash cow, even WGS, it's probably them.",

The only difference is the speed and most are pretty fast already so it\u2019s not gonna look that attractive. \n\nPerhaps you are talking about detecting SNPs or different ways of using PCR or RFLP that\u2019s more useful in detecting genetic diseases",
