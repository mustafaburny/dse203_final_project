My school feels fake lol, it\u2019s all just turning stuff into canvas. keep grinding on it and keep your ducks in a row. If you\u2019re pressed over real estate, take a look at Monish Pobrai\u2019s Shinoken SHIOF and let me know what you think. Monish invests for long term compounders. I was buying micron heavy 69 and lower in hindsight should went all in seemed so obviously oversold. In tech tbh all I\u2019ve been doing is DCA into INTC FB and small bits of PLTR at these depressed prices. Love the tech sector but nothing stands out as obvious undervalued and ready to pop atm",

By all means, I think a lot of retail investors get turned on thinking about anything tech/electronics related (the same way people get excited about batteries for electric cars) but... if it is a commodity... aren't typical wholesale margins like 10-15%?\n\nWhat makes it an attractive company? I know making specialized electronics like memory at their scale is not easy by any means but if your customers (other businesses) beat you down on price... does that really matter?\n\nThey aren't clearing 40% profit on orders to Samsung/Apple/etc/whoever I'm guessing?",

They can fill a gap in the GPU market for lower cost GPUs. \n\nI have a sizeable position in Intel and I have a smaller one in AMD. I will be looking at Intel's and AMD's server CPU and discrete GPU offerings next year to determine which position I will be expanding. Both look promising but Intel looks like it will offer a lot more value long term. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC you might want to open positions with all of them.
