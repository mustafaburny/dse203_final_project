So the idea that they are dead in the water or can't compete is plain wrong. \n\nTheir GPUs aren't looking too good right now but they are coming pretty soon. They can fill a gap in the GPU market for lower cost GPUs. \n\nI have a sizeable position in Intel and I have a smaller one in AMD. I will be looking at Intel's and AMD's server CPU and discrete GPU offerings next year to determine which position I will be expanding. Both look promising but Intel looks like it will offer a lot more value long term. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC you might want to open positions with all of them. Betting that the 4 of them will do well is probably a pretty safe bet. I would also look at MU, that's another position that I like right now. It has started to move up, but probably has a lot more room to grow.",
