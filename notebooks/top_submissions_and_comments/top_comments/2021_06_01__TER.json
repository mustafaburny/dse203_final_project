So the real price in the first year you buy the ETF is 100$-1%, while you only buy or sell them (to simplify there is no spread) at 100$.\nNow imagine the ETF performs 0% in one year. Then the price will drop to 99$, because the ETF Manager had to pay themselves.\n\nWe never really see the costs of TER. They are included in the price. It has a similar effect on the price like a dividend payout on the ex-day.\n\nMaybe I am overthinking, but like Buffet said: \"never loose money!\"",

I.e. not a sensible choice. \n\nIf you have access to it through your broker, you could also probably construct that portfolio cheaper by buying individual ETFs and manually rebalancing.
