Basically I can invest 30% of my income and deduct the investment from my taxable income. This alone will give me a 10% return just from tax savings.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m also forced to pick from the very limited offerings of the local banks.\n\nI\u2019d like to invest in SPY, ACWI-ex-US and MSCI emerging markets.\n\n\nFrom what\u2019s available, I found a S&amp;P500(TER 1.1%) and an ACWI(TER 0.6%). An ACWI-ex-US is not available, so I would be exposed to the US with both, as the ACWI has 60% US stocks on its own already. In that situation, would you go with both or only ACWI since it has enough US exposure already?\n\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve been advised that I should put 20% into bonds for now as there is too much liquidity in the market from covid and then shift it into index funds if/when a contraction happens.\n\n\nBasic Info:\n\n\n35 yo\n\nThailand\n\nNo debt\n\nNo savings :(\n\nObjective and horizon: Keep the money in a diversified passive index and dont touch until retirement\n\nRisk tolerance: Moderate I guess. I\u2019m expecting indexes to go up and down quite a bit over the decades and just want to wait them out without actively trying to beat the market.",

If you're sending money from the US to here, you barely pay normal western Union fees, which are like $8 for every $100. People over here are not educated enough to know the risks this move implies for our population. \n\nCurrently, this idiot cut ties with OAS and is looking to cut ties with the US and have China as our main economic partner, just as Nicaragua did (take a look at their economy and see how they're doing). This is a disaster, uneducated population taking on high risk speculation, while cutting ties with the country that supplies 80% of our oil, for one that enslaves its people.\n\nThis move will basically make El Salvador safe haven for the corrupt ones in the world because it wouldn't be possible to trace their stolen money to have them accountable for something. By cutting ties with OAS, we're becoming a no-extradition country. The worst part is, ignorant people who voted for him still supports this crap even after being explained to.",

If you're sending money from the US to here, you barely pay normal western Union fees, which are like $8 for every $100. People over here are not educated enough to know the risks this move implies for our population. \n\nCurrently, this idiot cut ties with OAS and is looking to cut ties with the US and have China as our main economic partner, just as Nicaragua did (take a look at their economy and see how they're doing). This is a disaster, uneducated population taking on high risk speculation, while cutting ties with the country that supplies 80% of our oil, for one that enslaves its people.\n\nThis move will basically make El Salvador safe haven for the corrupt ones in the world because it wouldn't be possible to trace their stolen money to have them accountable for something. By cutting ties with OAS, we're becoming a no-extradition country. The worst part is, ignorant people who voted for him still supports this crap even after being explained to.",
