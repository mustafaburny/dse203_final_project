Valor glass. Same Corning update suggested that this sales levels would materialize upon the product\u2019s \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d by the market. Reasonably likely that demand from clinical trials and production of Covid vaccine/treatments alone would be sufficient to satisfy the threshold for \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d if not more; not surprising per se, covid is merely a catalyst.
