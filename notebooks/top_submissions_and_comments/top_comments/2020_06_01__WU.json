Recently they sold over 2100+ in May, their first month of running operations and currently will EXCEED last months sales. Not only that they have over 11k orders locked in. Second, After it\u2019s best year to date (2018) they decided to fully restructure its company into MEG(current business venture) and are already making profits. Third, their owner is multi billionaire Bruno Wu and his wife is just as impressive as him. The top of the board looks amazing. IDEX also has a pretty big spot in the Microfluidics industry which is expected to end the year at 15.7 Billion and grow to 44 Billion by 2025. As for the recent surge and trend upwards, that\u2019s due to their deals with NISSAN, KIA and most importantly TESLA. Yes, that TESLA! Even better there\u2019s rumors of a partnership. To add onto that, oil prices rising will most likely see many change from Oil to EV so it\u2019ll only help the business boom as well as the push for less environmental damage in China. All in All IDEX is short term and long term gains. Don\u2019t miss out.",

It\u2019s my first post after doing my own researching, being new to this, and I\u2019m tired so if I mix up things a little, be kind. It\u2019s only some thoughts I\u2019ve gathered. Any feedback is appreciated.\n\n\n\nAddress Information:\n(https://ideanomics.com/contact/)\nWhat exactly is this address at \u201c16 RAFFLES QUAY #41-01, HONG LEONG BUILDING\u201d. It seems to be in Singapore and doesn\u2019t match their website.\n\nTheir website shows the Beijing address, which is a drive-in movie theater? And the Singapore address does not specify a unit number in that skyscraper building. Maybe the websites I\u2019ve seen aren\u2019t up to date with information as I am using a search engine in my own country.\n\nI\u2019m also not sure but I think their New York address is up for listing but maybe it\u2019s just a sub lease and they\u2019re moving most of their production to Asia. However, it is a seven year lease and if this is a sub lease then the math makes sense. It\u2019s a prime location as well.\n(https://www.commercialcafe.com/commercial-property/us/ny/new-york/55-broadway-1/)\n\nI can\u2019t find any information on the MEG Center in Qingdao either.\n(https://twitter.com/ideanomicshq/status/1265273936683696128?s=21)\n(https://youtu.be/-Axv9YZhwxE)\n(https://mobile.twitter.com/ideanomicshq/status/1268924154545307648)\n\nIs it because the company has less than 100 employees these offices seem odd or? They\u2019re in good locations, just a bit odd. Is it due to being subsidiaries or because it\u2019s too new and we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic so there\u2019s lack of updated information?\n\n\n\nBusiness Transition and Names:\nSun Video Group to Wecast to Seven Stars Cloud Group  to Ideanomics\nThe company changes its name in a matter of years? Why? It seems like this was largely a media company that somehow transitioned into cars? Can someone explain this to me?\n\n\n\nCompany History:\nThe company has lawsuits due to misrepresentation of earnings due to inflation so they were sued by shareholders.\n(http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1070/II6600_06/2019719_f01c_19CV06741.pdf)\n\nI skimmed this as I can\u2019t see the information or make much understating of it. I saw \u201cFiling Error\u201d and how the last Date Filed was June 5, 2020. I just find it odd.\n(https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15940574/jose-pinto-claro-da-fonseca-miranda-v-ideanomics-inc/)\n\nFintech Village:\nThey bought it then the property seems to be neglected due to a shift in focus and funding. It was supposed to be an entire campus to create jobs.\n(https://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/after-98m-loss-ideanomics-weighing-future-of-west-hartford-project)\n(https://we-ha.com/residents-raise-concerns-about-maintenance-of-ideanomics-property-town-negotiating-lease-for-ball-fields/)\n(https://vimeo.com/348056058/4988193d17)\n\nFamous Namesakes:\nBruce Wu: Do we really know much about him? I don\u2019t know how to find information on what companies he\u2019s been involved with between 2006 up until this IDEX. Can someone find that information?\n\nShane McMahon: It\u2019s easier to find information on him. He\u2019s linked to YOU On Demand which profited from C Media. His mother served on the SBA from 2017 to 2019. His family is linked to Trump.\n\nNews Sources:\nWhy does most of the news seem to be from the Ideanomics website itself being a source to PR Newswire? I tried googling but it usually trails back to this website?\n(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ideanomics-outlines-its-mobile-energy-group-meg-activities-and-provides-updates-on-other-activities-300907067.html)\n\nIs this normal for an up and coming company or is it more?\n\n\n\n-\n\nThank you for any feedback and opinions.

        "body": "The most valuable company in the world never to have made a single quarter of operating profit is on a stock market run.  Pinduoduo, which claims to have reinvented online shopping in China, has seen its share price rise by more than 130 per cent in the past three months, giving it a market value of $101bn, above that of Uber or Sony and twice that of Baidu or Foxconn.  Its founder and chief executive, Colin Zheng Huang, who earned his master\u2019s from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and later worked at Google, is now China\u2019s third-richest man, behind Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba. He attributes Pinduoduo\u2019s success to a magic formula of bargains and entertainment \u2014 he has said he wants his company to be both \u201cCostco and Disneyland\u201d.  The result is a heady marketplace where hundreds of millions of shoppers pick up heavily discounted big-ticket items such as iPhones, play games, and even order their fruit and vegetables directly from farmers.  Pinduoduo does not hold stock in warehouses, it simply connects buyers and sellers, takes a small commission on sales and charges merchants to boost the visibility of their products on its app.\n\nJust five years old, Pinduoduo says more than Rmb1.16tn ($163bn) of goods flowed across its platform in the year to the end of March, meaning that it handles more business than eBay and that it has achieved what it took both Alibaba, China\u2019s largest ecommerce company, and JD.com, another large online retailer, about 14 years to realise. But its rapid ascent has been accompanied by persistent questions over how it reports its order volumes, its corporate governance and in particular whether it will be able to move from burning huge amounts of cash to buy growth to a more sustainable business model.  The analysts that cover the company are divided, with many believing it has established itself as a key player in China\u2019s still nascent ecommerce industry, but others warning that it is already showing signs of stress.  \u201cThe current Pinduoduo is the biggest bubble in Chinese internet history,\u201d commented Wu Fan, at local broker Guosheng Securities in a recent report, even before the company\u2019s net losses more than doubled in the first quarter of this year to Rmb4.1bn. Behind the losses lie lavish subsidies and promotions from Pinduoduo to attract customers. Some Apple iPhones and computers are notably cheaper on Pinduoduo than in Apple\u2019s own stores, with the company last May launching its Rmb10bn subsidies marketing campaign, eventually prompting a similar promise from its biggest rival, Alibaba.  Since 2017, its sales and marketing expenses, which include these subsidies, have been either close to, or higher than, its revenues. In the first quarter of 2020, sales and marketing cost Rmb7.3bn on revenues of just Rmb6.5bn. As well as subsidies on orders, Pinduoduo also offers users cash rewards for playing a game that involves bringing others to its platform. \n\nAs it spends freely, Pinduoduo has regularly tapped the capital markets, raising a total of $3.3bn in three fundraising rounds since its IPO on Nasdaq in July 2018, which raised $1.7bn.  By attracting huge numbers of shoppers, Pinduoduo hopes also to attract huge numbers of sellers, which it can charge for advertising and promotion. Advertising is the core of its business model, accounting for 89 per cent of last year\u2019s revenues, well ahead of sales fees. On average, Pinduoduo\u2019s 5.1m sellers spent Rmb5,258 ($744) on advertisements last year, a rise of 64 per cent. But it is unclear whether this pace of growth will continue. Pinduoduo is an emporium of low-priced bargains and margins are already razor-thin for merchants, who also have to absorb the cost of shipping, which is almost always free for customers. Last year, the average order was worth just Rmb51. \u201cThey have a low-price image, a cheap stuff image, and also this image won\u2019t change, they don\u2019t have any way to change that because that\u2019s what has made them successful,\u201d said Steven Zhu of research firm Pacific Epoch.\n\nDing Tingting, also at Guosheng Securities, suggested that merchants have little room to increase their spending on marketing. \u201cWe think that the merchants on the Pinduoduo platform will face declining profits or even no profits and the impact of this will gradually show,\u201d she wrote in a report.  \u201cHere I don\u2019t pay for any ads, I play with the free traffic the platform gives me,\u201d said one shoe vendor surnamed Gao, who said he sold a couple of thousand pairs a month. He said Pinduoduo\u2019s lower marketing costs had convinced him to focus on the platform after years of selling on Alibaba\u2019s Taobao marketplace. Pinduoduo has also bet on scale, and often underlines the size of its marketplace to investors, shoppers and merchants, quoting the rapid growth of its gross merchandise value (GMV). Like its rivals, it defines this as the total value of all orders placed, regardless of whether they are later cancelled or returned. Shipping costs are also often included, since sellers embed them in their listed prices.\n\nBut analysts have asked if GMV is the best metric to judge success. Charlie Chen, an analyst at China Renaissance, pointed out in a recent note the difference between the company\u2019s 99 per cent on-year quarterly GMV growth in the first quarter, its 44 per cent growth in revenues, and China\u2019s total growth in posted parcels of just 3 per cent.  \u201cGiven the uncertainties in GMV data, we believe it is not a reliable metric to consider when we assess \\[Pinduoduo\u2019s\\] current operations,\u201d said Mr Chen, who downgraded the company to \u201chold\u201d last month because of its unclear timeline to breaking even. A spokesperson for Pinduoduo said it reported GMV \u201con the same basis as other industry players\u201d. Alibaba and JD.com have stopped publishing a GMV figure every quarter, opting to report it once a year. Jack Ma said the metric could be \u201cmisleading\u201d when Alibaba changed its reporting in 2016.   \n\nGMV is also flattered by sellers who inflate their sales numbers, in the hope of rising up the search rankings. This practice, known as \u201cbrushing\u201d, involves hiring third party users willing to place fake orders and write glowing reviews for money.  One of several \u201cbrushing\u201d platforms, Carlobo.com, even lets merchants customise the fake reviews they get. The cost for a fake Pinduoduo order through the platform runs Rmb4 per order \u2014 well below the Rmb9 needed to buy a fake Taobao order. A spokesperson for Pinduoduo said it was meaningless to compare the per order cost for brushing and that \u201cPinduoduo has a zero-tolerance policy toward the illicit practice of brushing, which afflicts the global internet industry.\u201d Nevertheless, Pinduoduo warned investors in its listing prospectus that brushers may be able to evade its detection measures and inflate GMV and other metrics. So far, Pinduoduo\u2019s investors have preferred to focus on its remarkable growth and have been encouraged by its blue-chip partners, most notably Tencent, which directs traffic to Pinduoduo from the 1.2bn users of its WeChat superapp. Tencent is Pinduoduo\u2019s second-largest shareholder behind Mr Huang, with 16.5 per cent of the company.  Mr Huang, meanwhile, owns 43.3 per cent of the shares and controls 88.4 per cent of the voting power. He also certifies the company\u2019s results as its principal financial officer, as well as its chief executive and is chairman of the board.  Pinduoduo has never had a formal chief financial officer despite its US listing. The company\u2019s previous \u201cvice-president of finance\u201d, Tian Xu, resigned for personal reasons in April last year after just 10 months in the job. \u201cConcentrating almost all corporate power in the hands of a single individual should raise a red flag, as it creates substantial corporate governance risk,\u201d said Jesse Fried, a corporate governance expert at Harvard Law School. \u201cThat\u2019s true even if a corporate controller serves as board chair and CEO, but not CFO. But what\u2019s unusual and particularly worrisome here is that the controller is also effectively the CFO.\u201d  A company spokesperson said Pinduoduo was looking for a CFO. \u201cThe CFO position is an important role and we are actively searching for the right person,\u201d the spokesperson said, noting the company has a strong finance and accounting team in place and that its vice-president of strategy performs some functions of a CFO. Meanwhile, Jessica Wu, a university student, has taken to Pinduoduo not to shop but to earn pocket money through its \u201cEarn Cash Everyday\u201d in-app game. Ms Wu said she had earned Rmb500 by convincing others to download the app. \u201cI told them they could delete it afterwards, they didn\u2019t buy anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve only bought once, a one yuan paper napkin packet,\u201d said Ms Wu. Delivery was free. Nian Liu contributed reporting from Beijing",

But looking further, the key lies in **Bruno Wu** imho. His connections in China is unquestionable, so much so that a media mogul can be made the vice chairman of a national think tank for China-US relations. His wife was one of the most popular tv personality ( before joining him in business. Together they are truly well connected in the upper echelons of China. \n\nI have no doubt that without Bruno, MEG would never be anywhere close to their current success. Personally, I think the whole pivot to EV in China came from him and theres probably a demand back in China thats providing him with deals. The most important thing about doing business in China is connections and he brings plenty. \n\nSo, I dont really think it is a scam but I am much more interested in whats their next move. Other than EV wholesaling, there have been news about other infrastructure projects, Are they going to evolve into a service provider that helps organisation/cities to cross over to green energy? But as of now it seems to be direction isnt as clear.\n\n\" Its electric vehicle division, Mobile Energy Global (MEG) provides group purchasing discounts on commercial electric vehicles, EV batteries and electricity as well as financing and charging solutions. \"\n\nThis still sounds like a opportunistic diversion, if they were to seriously transform their business, then I think theres real value in it.",

Dr. Wu became aware of another investor requiring liquidity from their share holding in Ideanomics and negotiated to purchase those shares directly at a price which **both sides agreed better represented the value of the shares.** The total value of the transaction was $5.1 Million dollars, and was reported in the company's recent 10-q filing for Q2.\"\n\nIn August 2019 the stock price was roughly only $1.50 - $2. Pretty Strange.",

The company has lots of challenges as the post below suggests. \n\n\" March 17, 2020   Mr. Wu took many large personal risks and is still invested in the project(s). He and the company are saying there have been unanticipated costs, especially environmental issues at the site. Ideanomics lost $98M last year, but it didn't lose that money on this project. To say they are reevaluating does not indicate bad faith or breach of contract. Meanwhile, cleanup continues at no cost to Hartford, and if the property reverts to Hartford's ownership Mr. Wu will have done us a favor. You might dismiss Mobile Energy Group as a PDF of smoke and mirrors with fractional buzzwords, but entrepreneurs can be intentionally vague if they're not beholden to their investors. He's not doing an IPO for chrissake, he's creating a clean campus on a slag heap left by OUR forefathers and Our former employers. Local people who invested time researching this didn't waste it, they invested and took a risk which may yet pay off. Move aside and let the man go through!\"",

        "body": "Questions about $IDEX. (Learning how to DD.)\n\nI have a few questions about the DD and would like insight. It\u2019s my first post after doing my own researching, being new to this, and I\u2019m tired so if I mix up things a little, be kind. It\u2019s only some thoughts I\u2019ve gathered. Any feedback is appreciated.\n\n\n\nAddress Information:\n(https://ideanomics.com/contact/)\nWhat exactly is this address at \u201c16 RAFFLES QUAY #41-01, HONG LEONG BUILDING\u201d. It seems to be in Singapore and doesn\u2019t match their website.\n\nTheir website shows the Beijing address, which is a drive-in movie theater? And the Singapore address does not specify a unit number in that skyscraper building. Maybe the websites I\u2019ve seen aren\u2019t up to date with information as I am using a search engine in my own country.\n\nI\u2019m also not sure but I think their New York address is up for listing but maybe it\u2019s just a sub lease and they\u2019re moving most of their production to Asia. However, it is a seven year lease and if this is a sub lease then the math makes sense. It\u2019s a prime location as well.\n(https://www.commercialcafe.com/commercial-property/us/ny/new-york/55-broadway-1/)\n\nI can\u2019t find any information on the MEG Center in Qingdao either.\n(https://twitter.com/ideanomicshq/status/1265273936683696128?s=21)\n(https://youtu.be/-Axv9YZhwxE)\n(https://mobile.twitter.com/ideanomicshq/status/1268924154545307648)\n\nIs it because the company has less than 100 employees these offices seem odd or? They\u2019re in good locations, just a bit odd. Is it due to being subsidiaries or because it\u2019s too new and we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic so there\u2019s lack of updated information?\n\n\n\nBusiness Transition and Names:\nSun Video Group to Wecast to Seven Stars Cloud Group  to Ideanomics\nThe company changes its name in a matter of years? Why? It seems like this was largely a media company that somehow transitioned into cars? Can someone explain this to me?\n\n\n\nCompany History:\nThe company has lawsuits due to misrepresentation of earnings due to inflation so they were sued by shareholders.\n(http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1070/II6600_06/2019719_f01c_19CV06741.pdf)\n\nI skimmed this as I can\u2019t see the information or make much understating of it. I saw \u201cFiling Error\u201d and how the last Date Filed was June 5, 2020. I just find it odd.\n(https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15940574/jose-pinto-claro-da-fonseca-miranda-v-ideanomics-inc/)\n\nFintech Village:\nThey bought it then the property seems to be neglected due to a shift in focus and funding. It was supposed to be an entire campus to create jobs.\n(https://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/after-98m-loss-ideanomics-weighing-future-of-west-hartford-project)\n(https://we-ha.com/residents-raise-concerns-about-maintenance-of-ideanomics-property-town-negotiating-lease-for-ball-fields/)\n(https://vimeo.com/348056058/4988193d17)\n\nFamous Namesakes:\nBruce Wu: Do we really know much about him? I don\u2019t know how to find information on what companies he\u2019s been involved with between 2006 up until this IDEX. Can someone find that information?\n\nShane McMahon: It\u2019s easier to find information on him. He\u2019s linked to YOU On Demand which profited from C Media. His mother served on the SBA from 2017 to 2019. His family is linked to Trump.\n\nNews Sources:\nWhy does most of the news seem to be from the Ideanomics website itself being a source to PR Newswire? I tried googling but it usually trails back to this website?\n(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ideanomics-outlines-its-mobile-energy-group-meg-activities-and-provides-updates-on-other-activities-300907067.html)\n\nIs this normal for an up and coming company or is it more?\n\n\n\n-\n\nThank you for any feedback and opinions. I\u2019m trying to learn.",

Either single sourced from IDEX or paraphrased articles. The meg centre \\~2000 EV deal in Qingdao has zero verification.\n\nHard Facts: Bruno Wu and his wife are known CCP affiliates and him in particular has several company name changes under his belt. His Seven-star group has a large share of contracts on eastern China's municipal transport EV replacement.  Mr. Wu and Seven stars might give you confidence but no one I talked to knows how the MEG bulk discount works or if it was even verified. This is a penny stock that grew +60% in one day with high volume of shares changing hands. Lack of reputable news sources in both the west and the east. Bruno Wu has the power and reputation for conducting pump and dumps.\n\nSpeculation based off confirmed info: The all EV public transport by 2022 policy is legit but current economic conditions has rumours that this policy might not be hard line and subject to change. Rumours are that China's economy is not looking solid enough to follow through this policy given future uncertainties.\n\nBenefit of the doubt: My sources and CCP are collaborating to withhold confirmation for this\n\ntl;dr: I believe that if you try to hold long and you will be holding CCP dick.

To say they are reevaluating does not indicate bad faith or breach of contract.

A couple things I learned when I did my own DD a few weeks back. \n\nIdeanomics as an entity has been around for a long time, originally focusing on entertainment, specifically acting like a PayPerView for China. They were called YouOnDemand and thats when Shane McMahon came aboard (around 2010). Eventually , Wu acquired the company and saw some success with the YouOnDemand brand, since his background is in television/entertainment (was chairman of Sun Media Group since 1999 and was heavily involved in Chinese television his entire career. I believe his wife is a hostess of some day time talk show or something of that sort.). Eventually they decided to get into petro but it didn't work out. In 2019 they completely revamped their business model and decided to go into being a dealer for electric vehicles. Their earnings for 2019 are a bit rough compared to previous years only because they had to front salaries and overhead for starting this new business model. They brought on a team of experienced and knowledgeable people which makes me confident they know exactly what they're doing (seriously, worth it to do some homework on their companies principals/management).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShane McMahon is a bit of a funny situation because, like I said, he was with this company before Wu was even involved, so hes been on a wild ride between entertainment,  energy, to dealing electric vehicles. The only thing that had me cautious at first was that exactly: Two of the company's bigshots, one being the chairman, made their mark in entertainment. Not energy or vehicles. However, both McMahan, and especially Wu are very successful people and the most important thing is, they know how to build a successful company. That's something that doesn't discriminate between industries.",

Second, After it\u2019s best year to date (2018) they decided to fully restructure its company into MEG(current business venture) and are already making profits. Third, their owner is multi billionaire Bruno Wu and his wife is just as impressive as him. The top of the board looks amazing. IDEX also has a pretty big spot in the Microfluidics industry which is expected to end the year at 15.7 Billion and grow to 44 Billion by 2025. As for the recent surge and trend upwards, that\u2019s due to their deals with NISSAN, KIA and most importantly TESLA. Yes, that TESLA! Even better there\u2019s rumors of a partnership. To add onto that, oil prices rising will most likely see many change from Oil to EV so it\u2019ll only help the business boom as well as the push for less environmental damage in China. All in All IDEX is short term and long term gains. Don\u2019t miss out.",
