Those networks are probably going to be built up regardless of the virus outbreak. On top of that I like Intel and IBM because they will benefit from those networks. \n\nBasically I am looking for stocks which have little exposure to the reaction to the virus (positive or negative) and working around the assumption that some projects will be impacted but not significantly. Intel vs AMD comes down to the price points of the two stocks but a factor I am considering is that if the TSMC (the foundry which produces the AMD 7nm GPUs and CPUs) supply line is cut then AMD has no product to sell.",

They make sense with what they say. Then talked to several executives (they are our clients) about shit that's going on.... Not part of the companies im talking about buying into, that's not ethical.... Rather companies similar to the ones I'm talking about. Obviously aside from all being high risk clients, and the positions being speculative af, it all checks out. Legit 90% of the portfolios I touch, maybe 10 or so a day, for the last 3 months have these companies. I've broken it all out into Excel in the equity positions they hold.... It's rather sizeable and the only \"new\" positions they hold. Rather than their apple stock from 1996 or their Cisco  and PG from 1990.... These are buy and hold clients. Not too many YOLO traders, grated, most if not all hold reg D positions.... But I don't see those trades. I've also not had the opportunity from talking to any creditable/big time hedge funds. The ones at my work are separated from me. And I won't risk going to jail. I'm going to run it by compliance before doing anything.",

We sold a short term OTM Call and financed a 50 strike long call. I kept the long call and lost. He converted to a credit spread by selling the short 48 call. He made money. I lost.

When you first start out you are going to literally bust your ass until you hit the point you can hire a driver to deal with the work.\n\nLets say you have a machine that takes 20 cases of soda to fill and you have 20 machines around. Your talking about 400 cases at 20 pounds a case. 8000 pounds.\n\nYour moving 8000 pounds at the store to your cart, from your cart to the truck, from the truck to the hand truck, from the handtruck into the machine. Can your back handle 32000 pounds and bending up and down each time you refill? Obviously rough math, but you get the idea.\n\nDo you have a vehicle that can handle this?\n\nRepair is dirty cheap if you have good machines and a good mechanic. Very easy to swap boards, validators, etc.\n\nStay away from snack and food machines if you are just starting out. Hassle to be cognizant of perishables and dates, etc. Need to consider how well candy holds as well - are you in Florida and have candy/chocolate machines?\n\nYou can absolutely crush it in the right location - but keep in mind its not get rich quick. It's get rich slow and by making sure your machines are all in a relatively close proximity (at least to start).\n\nWhen we do the rough math it usually comes out that 50% of sales price is profit. So for $1 can of soda, $.50 goes towards gas, products cost, commission, operational expense etc.\n\nHow do you plan on moving the machines? Each time you move its $150-$200. Where do you store them when not using?\n\nJust food for thought :)",

When you first start out you are going to literally bust your ass until you hit the point you can hire a driver to deal with the work.\n\nLets say you have a machine that takes 20 cases of soda to fill and you have 20 machines around. Your talking about 400 cases at 20 pounds a case. 8000 pounds.\n\nYour moving 8000 pounds at the store to your cart, from your cart to the truck, from the truck to the hand truck, from the handtruck into the machine. Can your back handle 32000 pounds and bending up and down each time you refill? Obviously rough math, but you get the idea.\n\nDo you have a vehicle that can handle this?\n\nRepair is dirty cheap if you have good machines and a good mechanic. Very easy to swap boards, validators, etc.\n\nStay away from snack and food machines if you are just starting out. Hassle to be cognizant of perishables and dates, etc. Need to consider how well candy holds as well - are you in Florida and have candy/chocolate machines?\n\nYou can absolutely crush it in the right location - but keep in mind its not get rich quick. It's get rich slow and by making sure your machines are all in a relatively close proximity (at least to start).\n\nWhen we do the rough math it usually comes out that 50% of sales price is profit. So for $1 can of soda, $.50 goes towards gas, products cost, commission, operational expense etc.\n\nHow do you plan on moving the machines? Each time you move its $150-$200. Where do you store them when not using?\n\nJust food for thought :)",

I'm actually part of that group.  I didn't clear out of the market, but I put a big chunk of my 401k money into treasuries soon after Trump got elected.  That money has suffered pretty big opportunity cost for me.\n\nNow a lot of people are convinced that the market has entered irrationality territory, and that fundamentals don't support share prices.

A lot of people were certain that the policies of President Obama would further tank the economy and market, so they stayed away from the stock market through his entire presidency.\n\nA lot of people were convinced that President's Trump's policies would tank the market, and that the bull market was getting too old and had pushed too far, so they pulled money out.  I'm actually part of that group.  I didn't clear out of the market, but I put a big chunk of my 401k money into treasuries soon after Trump got elected.  That money has suffered pretty big opportunity cost for me.\n\nNow a lot of people are convinced that the market has entered irrationality territory, and that fundamentals don't support share prices.  I get that.  Mind you, there are a lot of stocks out there, and some trade at very discounted prices.  I recently added shares of GLW, XOM, DD, and SFM in my portfolio based on extreme share price weakness.  But yeah, maybe it's finally time to cash out some of those huge earnings on high-flying stocks and ETFs.  I don't know.  I'm holding more than I buy these days.  Only time will tell whether we're at or near a top, and by then it'll be too late to act on today's market.",
