It's where you have a large red candle, a second candle that's trades within the body of the large red, and then a 3rd candle that closes above the second candle. (Google it for a better explanation). In an edit for JKHY and INCY trades yesterday, he said he's also looking at EMA (10 day I think) as entry confirmaiton. I'm sure there's other indicators he's adding and then uses those combined to backtest his strategy",
