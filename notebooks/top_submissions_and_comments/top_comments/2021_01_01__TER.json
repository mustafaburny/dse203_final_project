Deflation or stagflation will prohibit an economy from growing e.g.) Japan over the last 30 years. \n\nBtc may not be the true answer but I can guarantee you that central banks are not.

But there needs to be somewhat stable prices and medium of exchange. Do V/MC/AMEX really need to take up to 4% of small business transactions to transfer money from one person to another, No crypto eliminates those companies. Do we even need WU or MGI for remittances, no, crypto solves for that. Can we get rid of BAC/WF/C et cetera? I\u2019d like to think we can.",
