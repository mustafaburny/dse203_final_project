        "body": "Strategy*:  I trade 0.5% of portfolio value on a company.  Sell with 5% gain.\n\nWatchlist: I have watchlist where I add blue chips and popular holdings (per news and other sites on buig movers).  I also use my broker's stock evaluation tool (Fidelity) or simplywall.st site and then add the company's competitors that look good fundamentally.\n\nScan**:  Technical indicators scan of the watchlist looking at these 3 indicators:\n\n* Wm%R (length:  10) on 4 Hour chart: Below -80%\n* Wm%R (length:  260) on 4 Hour chart: Below -80%\n* RSI (length: 14) on 4 Hour chart:  Wilders Below 30%\n\nEntry:  Only if stock and price is considered undervalued per Fidelity, simplywall.st, and/or TDAmeritrade site analysis (e.g., JNJ, HPQ, GILD, NVAX).  If the stock is overvalued on any of these sites, I pass (e.g., SPOT, FSLY, NFE, VRSN, AXP, V, MC). You can decide for yourself if there is a discrepancy whether to buy or not.\n\nEntry price:  Look at current price and determine on 1 hr candle chart the closest breakup candle price.  Basically, draw a price level of today's low and extend LEFT.  Then, scan eyes left.  Key markers are also recent gaps; price may float down and fill before bouncing higher.  Price is attracted to these levels of support.  CAVEAT:  This is individual.  If you like the stock, and it's falling like a rock, then you can just buy at market price.  \n\nExit price:  Entry price x 1.05 to the nearest 0.25 above calculation (e.g., 22.23 x 1.05 = 23.34.  exit price limit order at 23.50).  You can then plot price level and look on candle chart again.  Scan left to find breakdown candle high and maybe choose this.  Price is attracted to these levels of resistance.\n\n*Scan will show oversold price situation short and longer term.  Oversold does not mean price cannot go lower.  Especially with RSI indicator; many times price goes lower a few days past, but RSI is higher (divergence).  This is why buying undervalued is important.  Price will likely bounce to 5% target to sell. With major selloff like yesterday, target gain could be 10% depending on how.much the company sold off.  The scan is set up in TDAmeritrade's ThinkOrSwim platform.  I get a bell every time something hits all three scan criteria.  Usually, these oversold equities have dropped so far and fast that a bounce is coming.  I usually get in 2%-10% early with this signal, so take that for what it is worth.  Experiment.\n\n**0.5% portfolio value keeps it real folks.  No all in, big payday, slow and steady wins.  When you are (-), a 10% loss is only $50 or a $100 when buying only $500 to $1000 worth of a company.  You can go higher in $ amount held (higher %), but losses are magnified.  This allows one to sleep well at night; I am not worrying about $50-$100 and I know it will come back.  Undervalued company that has good fundamentals.\n\n***You can do 1-5 equities either up to 5% stake or hold long-term or both.  Example, crypto and TSLA and AAPL.",

They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

But they're also spending a hell of a lot of money to get all this other crap done. I have January calls it'll probably expire worthless. I've come to accept that unless Microsoft or the government or somebody buys a company which unfortunately is not for sale. But then again everything has its price. Including me because I've been giving $5 blow jobs behind the Wendy's dumpster near my house just to make ends meet.\nI've already lost my half my portfolio which is about $80,000 thank you AMD for moving your earnings date without telling anyone and buying xilinx. And now dunkin' donuts is going private and I knew about it and I didn't buy any calls or puts or any goddamn thing.\nThe only advice I can give you is stay out of this for a while or buy leaps for 2022. Nokia doesn't move enough to day trade you're better off investing in Erickson or Comcast or T-Mobile. Even Qualcomm I stay away from AT&amp;T though period well good luck with your investment you can always buy Tesla. I just bought Amazon and the price went down even though earnings were through the roof. The stock market is just not stable right now it's almost as if Trump is running that also as well as the country period both are in very sad state. Put your money in the bank and leave it there for a while you're better off period again this is only my opinion or is everyone says the mad ravings of a madman Good luck Chuck. Cheers",

Before I list out the portfolio I am considering, please see my answers to the relevant information questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How old are you? **23**\n* Are you employed/making income? How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out. I've replaced them with Pinterest in my portfolio as my new search/advertising stock. Social search is the future and I now see the genius advertising potential of the Pinterest platform; I see them stealing advertising dollars away from Google and growing much better than Google over the next 5 years.",

IBM was a computer company.\n\nThe brilliance of MSFT was in - and this seems weird today - realizing that a company could make money just selling software. A ton of money. More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",
