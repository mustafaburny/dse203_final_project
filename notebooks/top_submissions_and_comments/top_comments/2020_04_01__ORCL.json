Sitting on a shit ton of cash everyone waiting for him to buy anything and instead he sticks to his guns, says everything is overvalued, and gives money back to shareholders.\n\nNow, especially if we do have another leg down, he has enough cash on hand to acquire companies for half of their market cap 2 months ago. \n\nHe wouldn't have sold Delta shares during the \"rally\" if he thought it was truly a V shaped recovery. \n\nI'm with the Oracle. SPY 273P 06/19 picked up today at the highs. Would love to add a 300P if it gets there so keep Brrrring Powell.",

Look back over time at how the stonk tends to trade around VWAP and the upper/lower bands.\n\nMost of the time, you should see that the stock will want to \"float\" back to VWAP throughout the day-sometimes it doesn't, but it's better than just trying to trace a chart with your finger on robinhood and guestimate purely off price and not volume.\n\nCombine this with time and sales flow to get an idea as to the momentum.  It's something you need to just play with and get a feel for.\n\nMy approach is basically - has the stock plunged well below VWAP, and pierced the lower bound?  I probably wouldn't go short but will consider going long to catch a bounce back to VWAP.  Inverse?  Consider going the other way.  Sitting at VWAP and VWAP is flat?  Probably won't touch it as I'm not an oracle  \n\n\nIt's not a silver bullet though and won't always work - I've seen SPY explode over VWAP and just keep reaching upwards, beyond the upper band.  I've tried to short from here and have gotten stopped out as JPOW's raging erections just keep blowing out the chart with green dildos.",

He is just a source of info like the rest out there. I learned a lot about the fundamentals of investing reading his book that cut straight through the bullshit. He even admits that he lost $90 million dollars in a day in the intros of one of his books and not to expect a get rich quick scheme from reading it. In my opinion he provides helpful, common sense advice that is sometimes dead wrong, and sometimes dead right. If people try to turn a fallible human into an oracle that's their problem.",

Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

The only top of the mind thoughts I had are:\n\nGo with individual stocks if you enjoy stock picking, you can index in your 401k and ESOP.\n-drop oracle from the list\n- add AYX and possibly ANET to your tech list, everything else on there looks great.\n- I like higher growth names in healthcare as well, LVGO, GH, HQY come to mind as all long term plays (I also own Illumina, watching NVTA but don\u2019t love it)\n- PINS and SFIX seem to have a lot of upside from current levels as well, (SFIX popped pop my radar due to incredible amounts of insider buying). \n\nHope this gives you some decent ideas, either approach seems well thought out and would work fine.  I guess it depends on how much time you want to dedicate to it and how much you enjoy stock picking.",

(Not disagreeing with your positions btw, actually pretty intrigued ..  keep us updated!)\n\nHere are my reasons to buy LEAPS on MSFT\n\n1. Teams that will eat slacks lunch\n2. JEDI contract will help secure future government contracts and helps further to move the legacy applications from Cobol or whatever language to .Net/ C#\n3. Has Visual studio, .net ( asp.net, c# and vb.net) to compete against java. Also SQL server competes directly with Oracle DB\n4. New Xbox releasing this year\n5. Linked helps during hard times like this\n6. GIT Hub - 60% of the worlds open source software projects are stored on GIT hub\n7. Azure which is the crown jewel and competes with AWS\n8. VR/ AR with Hololens and hardware with surface\n9. I assume they will buy Service now or Sales force since Microsoft Dynamics is not that of a great CRM tool.",

So I treat it similar to how you would forecast Capex. Usually capex is taken as a % of revenue historically then projected forward, I do the same with acquisitions. They do tend to be lumpier so my model will be smoother than the eventual reality but what you are trying to get to is how much capital the company is reinvesting in the business. I also want to make sure that my growth projections are not out of line with my reinvestment requirements so sometimes I will use acquisitions to fill that gap.",

And hence, quite risky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf our best-case scenario holds, and they manage to not bleed out by the end of this pandemic, then give it a couple years or more for them to recover their books and it could turn into a good play for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind though, asking us for suggestions on REITs, is basically asking us to look into a crystal ball, and tell you who is going bust and who will survive.
