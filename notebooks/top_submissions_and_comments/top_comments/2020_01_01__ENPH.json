Instead I invest in things I use or know a lot of other people use, or what a lot of companies use. \n\nI\u2019m invested in FB because I have a Facebook, use it a lot, and I know that Facebook is more then just a social media website. They\u2019re tryng to rebrand as such so I invested. I have near 28% return for the year. They\u2019re at a 52 week high so I\u2019ll probably be selling at least some of my stock. \n\nI want a Tesla really bad, I\u2019m starting to get into electric and alternative energy. But I know TSLA is all over the place and I\u2019m to afraid to jump in atm, especially since I don\u2019t know a lot. Instead I looked into solar energy and noticed there\u2019s really two major solar companies that are really developing quick. So I invested in ENPH and have a 16% return. \n\nBut I also have a portion of my portfolio in mutual funds like FNCMX which is what I first started using when I invested and got a 401k for the first time. It follows the NASDAQ but there\u2019s also funds for the S&amp;P. If you really want to start putting your money in the mutual funds are a relatively safe and consistent choice. Read a few articles about mutual funds and you\u2019ll understand they\u2019re pretty simple to grasp. There\u2019s also funds that follow different regions, international, specific market, etc. Read up on ETFs as well. \n\nThe only real \u2018research\u2019 I do is read the links and sources other people post in r/stocks when they talk about something I\u2019m familiar with.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m pretty young and can risk being a little risky with what I\u2019m doing.

Here's  3 for you:\n\n1) lattice semiconductor LSCC.  quality is off the charts for their work. Company turned itself around in the last few years. It has been on a nice run, so maybe  a bit over 2B mc now.  Great growth ahead with 5g, AI, autonomous vehicles coming and needing quality chips and chip equipment.  \n\n2) Digital Turbine APPS   . very rare company.  No debt. Software play that installs people's apps on phones in the box, remotely. They have partnerships with samsung, htc, etc....new innovative products coming soon. Still under 1B mc\n\n3) Enphase Energy ENPH. Another high growth small cap. Will be mid cap pretty soon. Enphase is legitimately dominating solar micro inverters. They are the shovel of the solar gold rush.\n\nRunner up: Endava, plc. DAVA. british tech consulting firm. Huge growth already and just getting started.\n\n\n*also a word of advice,  avoid crypto and cannabis",

Climate change play. \n\nNOK for reasons mentioned elsewhere in this thread. \n\nAPHA as the most financially sound MJ company. \n\nNUAN and CRNC for voice AI. I see massive room for growth with the former as EMRs expand globally. Also, I\u2019ve used Dragon and it\u2019s exceptional. Much better than Alexa or Google in my experience. They have a large moat in the medical industry and will continue to collect subscription dollars for many years to come. I expect the latter to eventually be acquired by an auto company or FANG as an asset to help compete against TSLA. \n\nSBUX as they continue to push into new markets. The dividend isn\u2019t terrible in the meantime. \n\nITHUF and TCNNF if Bernie is elected. They will make a huge run if US closes in on MJ legalization. \n\nWELL and OHI for REITs. Old people need care. Inflexible and growing demand with the aging population. \n\nGOOGL, MSFT, V, DAL, WM and MDT are my plays for lower risk growth.

Lmao their programmers/devs don't even input the right algorithms half of the time. It's nice to talk to actual people who are investing as well. I'm aware of other forums and I interact with those as well. Thanks again. My only other question is to drop enph for earnings day and 24 hrs afterwards. Last time it dropped from 25 to 19 in a matter of minutes. It came back of course, but it'd be nice to be able to avoid that. I see a lot of high growth stocks with this behavior. Great earnings report.... 15-30%+ drop &lt;24  hours",

Baker Brothers get this stuff right most of the time. \n\nENPH because they are still early in their growth, coming out with new products, leading technology, would not be surprised at all to see this at 70 by end of year. My biggest holding by far. \n\nKALA is more of a gamble but I feel it is asymmetrical risk in my favor. They could easily go to 15 in the next 3 months depending on pending FDA actions, and their biotechnology is applicable to more products. some speculate it could become $100 stock in a matter of a few years certainly if it pops to 15 I will not be selling.\n\nPRVB - I am invested in this one fairly deeply but it worries me the most. The reason it worries me is I cannot figure out why it is trading as low as it is given their pipeline and where they are in process with it. Depending on what happens in the next two months this could be a $5 or $50 stock. Maybe more if someone like NORD takes them out.",
