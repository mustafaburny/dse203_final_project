They will keep generating a boatload of cash and will do more buybacks and dividend growth. They are also putting capital into the fintech space so those will take time to show up on the income statement. They are tech in their heart so they will reinvent along with the times. They were on the cusp of acquiring Plaid but that was blocked by the authorities. I just think this will take a while to play out but I expect PE compression similar to what American Express faced along the way after the financial crisis. American Express only recently exhibited some PE expansion. Having said that, Visa went down from a close to half a trillion dollar market cap to 400B in market cap. So they really have to deliver to expand market cap. So a lot hinges on reopening in the short to medium term.",

They will keep generating a boatload of cash and will do more buybacks and dividend growth. They are also putting capital into the fintech space so those will take time to show up on the income statement. They are tech in their heart so they will reinvent along with the times. They were on the cusp of acquiring Plaid but that was blocked by the authorities. I just think this will take a while to play out but I expect PE compression similar to what American Express faced along the way after the financial crisis. American Express only recently exhibited some PE expansion. Having said that, Visa went down from a close to half a trillion dollar market cap to 400B in market cap. So they really have to deliver to expand market cap. So a lot hinges on reopening in the short to medium term.",

They will keep generating a boatload of cash and will do more buybacks and dividend growth. They are also putting capital into the fintech space so those will take time to show up on the income statement. They are tech in their heart so they will reinvent along with the times. They were on the cusp of acquiring Plaid but that was blocked by the authorities. I just think this will take a while to play out but I expect PE compression similar to what American Express faced along the way after the financial crisis. American Express only recently exhibited some PE expansion. Having said that, Visa went down from a close to half a trillion dollar market cap to 400B in market cap. So they really have to deliver to expand market cap. So a lot hinges on reopening in the short to medium term.",
