        "body": "&gt;And the most important due diligence is that it's a SPAC so it will get destroyed at merger time and hold a taint for probably 3 to 6 months before any chance of really recovering.\n\nthis is a very defeatist attitude due to recent SPAC price action, and isnt even true so far. nobody has a crystal ball. $ASTS went down to $7ish after merger, but then popped back up to $15 or so shortly thereafter. Astra popped off directly after the merger, which I was not expecting. it has retraced a bit of that though w/ general market weakness\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The space hype meme fomo crap won't keep reoccurring. It will get exposed at some point for not actually being a great business area.\n\nSpaceX is worth around $70b , I believe. they're doing quite well. I'd love to invest in that, but I cant as its all big private equity. the biggest bear case for the smaller SPACs is not that space has no potential, it's that you have 3 different giga billionaires with their pet projects all in the same sector (Elon, Jeff and Richard)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;At least with electric vehicles the whole world really is moving towards that and probably will end up there even quicker than current projections.\n\npersonally i would prefer to invest in space companies. the EV sector is oversaturated and all these companies have to compete not only with Tesla which is the established top dog but also all the legacy automakers.\n\nspace is still a relatively small industry with very few established players and enormous potential. you have SpaceX... and then a handful of stocks that are tangentially related like Trimble, Maxar, Iridium or defense companies like Lockheed Martin, Northrop, etc.\n\nit's still an industry in its infancy, but i predict over the course of the next decade or two, it will be one of the biggest growth sectors. many companies will fail and go to zero. but you'll get 100+ baggers too.\n\nrisk/reward",
