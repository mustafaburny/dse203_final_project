Cars are paid for and we have no credit card debt. \n\nMy question is about our current investments.  our primary investment vehicle i my ROTH 401k.  Do our current holdings and contributions  look ok?  Once my wife begins working I will max out my ROTH 401k, ESPP, and HSA.  I would like to use my HSA to invest in something, but I have no idea what.  my first thought would be FXAIX but I already have VOO.  Is it ok to more than one S&amp;P 500 index fund?  Should I drop VOO for the for VFAIX?  My wife and I want to have a solid investment base before we start saving for investment properties.\n\nAlso, the funds available in my ROTH 401k are very good so I don't believe we need to think about an IRA.   \n\nAny advice will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",
