(As of last filing numbers)\n\nAlong with this, the amc ceo and top execs took millions in compensation and sold shares, while gme just announced pay cuts for top execs and ryan cohen wont take pay, rather take shares, and the only insider selling was small ownership insiders who were let go of for doing so.

Unlike GME, AMC hasnt even bothered to show any support for apes on social media or press releases. If anything, AMC is so freaking greedy they are willing to forego the squeeze just to make short-term earnings from a share dilution. At this point, I am thinking if, AMC itself cant be bothered, then why I should keep holding into their stocks and risk my money or even let AMC make more money at my expense. Might as well let HFs short the hell out of them. I personally think that if any price jump happens then it will be some sympathy action during the GME squeeze.
