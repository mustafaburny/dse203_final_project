AVGO has a yield of 3.64% with a payout ratio of around 60%. IBM has a yield of 5.46% with a payout ratio of around 60% too. \n\nSo even though IBM has a much larger yield than MCD, they are paying out less of their overall earnings, which I would argue means their dividend is technically safer. That being said, don't invest based on payout ratio or yield alone. Invest in quality companies with good long term prospects, which I'd argue IBM doesn't have.",

        "body": "Broad Market:  That's tough to say.  If your very bullish on Tech stocks, QQQ might be your best bet. If you want a broader fund, then VOO is a good one.  QQQ uses the NASDAQ 100 as its bench mark while VOO uses the S&amp;P 500 as its benchmark. The top five holdings are the same for each of these, but in different percentages.  Another broad market fund I like is IWF. IWF uses the Russell 1000 as its benchmark.  It has a very good track record and seems to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over time. It's very similar to QQQ in its holdings, but again, percentages are slightly different.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices for a broad market fund. \n\nTech:  You'll get lots of opinions on this.  ARKQ and ARKW would be the choice of the ARK funds if you want it to be purely tech.  If you want to invest in disruptive innovative companies, but don't mind expanding beyond tech, consider ARKK. \n\nAnother one I like for tech is XLK. However, you have to keep in mind that XLK is almost 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft.  If you believe in those two companies, consider this one.  (VGT is very similar). \n\nSOXX is a fund that invests in semiconductor technology. One thing I like about this fund is that there will not be a lot of crossover between this one and your broad market fund.  Top holdings include: QCOM (9.5%), NVDA (9.5%), AVGO (8.3%), TXN (8%), INTC (5%). \n\nWCLD:  Cloud computing is a great sector, but be aware that many of these companies will also be in QQQ.  Top holdings include ZM (2.4%), CRM (2.3%), PLAN (2.2%), CRWD (2.1%), WDAY (2.1%). One thing I like about this ETF is that the investments are much more spread out than most ETFs. So, if any one company in the ETF is affected by bad news, it should have little impact on the ETF as a whole. I think WCLD is an excellent choice. \n\nClean Energy ETF:  I like ICLN like many others on this site.  I think the clean/renewable energy sector is really going to blossom over the next 10 years and I think ICLN is one of the better ETFs in the sector. Others you may want to look into include:  PBW, QCLN and TAN.",

It makes sense because those are the top dividend stocks since they are cyclical and won't see 2x growth in their stock.\n\nSo is it under valued? Under COVID times when their revenues are beaten down, probably not. But If you're thinking long term, I'm sure it will return that 28% gap that you're seeing, its just a matter of when. And when it starts to make up that gap, will growth indexes still outpace it's progress? Thats an answer only your crystal ball can tell.\n\nOver the past 10 years, growth has absolutely destroyed value in terms of ROI. Projecting the future is not easy, but my gut tells me growth is here to stay. People like innovation, and people want growth stocks that invest in their future.\n\nBut growth is volatile, so there is always a place for high dividend value companies.\n\nI expect value to pick up steam once a vaccine is formally announced and fully administered to the world populace. Until then, many of these value stocks will continue to be beaten down since they depend so much on status quo to continue to operate with reliable income levels.",
