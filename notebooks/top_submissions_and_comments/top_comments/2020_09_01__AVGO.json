Cost 1.80.    \n\nIf rocket shoots up to like 80....lose all extrinsic value....spread is worth 2.00.    Needed to make sure spread was larger than premium paid.   After that...anything less than a massive sell off is profitable.  It could dip a little, trade flat, or go up.   Based on bad wsb info that i should've double checked, thought it was gonna go up a little at the very least.    \n\nResults, It sold off a little and I sold my spread for 3.05 this morning.  Stock went down, made profit on a bullish spread...iv is a bitch.   \n\nCurrently had avgo sept 4 / sept 11 call spreads at 375.  Bought for 0.4, sold half for 1.2.  Already booked a profit.    Expect good numbers...more so it just didn't have the run up the other semis implied it should have...., sell off because bitches are scared. Then a run up next week.",

        "body": "Broad Market:  That's tough to say.  If your very bullish on Tech stocks, QQQ might be your best bet. If you want a broader fund, then VOO is a good one.  QQQ uses the NASDAQ 100 as its bench mark while VOO uses the S&amp;P 500 as its benchmark. The top five holdings are the same for each of these, but in different percentages.  Another broad market fund I like is IWF. IWF uses the Russell 1000 as its benchmark.  It has a very good track record and seems to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over time. It's very similar to QQQ in its holdings, but again, percentages are slightly different.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices for a broad market fund. \n\nTech:  You'll get lots of opinions on this.  ARKQ and ARKW would be the choice of the ARK funds if you want it to be purely tech.  If you want to invest in disruptive innovative companies, but don't mind expanding beyond tech, consider ARKK. \n\nAnother one I like for tech is XLK. However, you have to keep in mind that XLK is almost 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft.  If you believe in those two companies, consider this one.  (VGT is very similar). \n\nSOXX is a fund that invests in semiconductor technology. One thing I like about this fund is that there will not be a lot of crossover between this one and your broad market fund.  Top holdings include: QCOM (9.5%), NVDA (9.5%), AVGO (8.3%), TXN (8%), INTC (5%). \n\nWCLD:  Cloud computing is a great sector, but be aware that many of these companies will also be in QQQ.  Top holdings include ZM (2.4%), CRM (2.3%), PLAN (2.2%), CRWD (2.1%), WDAY (2.1%). One thing I like about this ETF is that the investments are much more spread out than most ETFs. So, if any one company in the ETF is affected by bad news, it should have little impact on the ETF as a whole. I think WCLD is an excellent choice. \n\nClean Energy ETF:  I like ICLN like many others on this site.  I think the clean/renewable energy sector is really going to blossom over the next 10 years and I think ICLN is one of the better ETFs in the sector. Others you may want to look into include:  PBW, QCLN and TAN.",
