It will probably be more risky so you\u2019re going to take your gains, pay taxes on it, and risk losing it anyways. \n\nYou\u2019re basically betting that the company is going to quit being profitable.

Their customers are getting tired of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't invest in Intel but one thing that's very important to keep in mind is what Intel excels at is support. When you buy Intel hardware for your server farm they are there to help you at every step with whatever problem you encounter. AMD's support is substantially poorer. One of the reasons Intel has stuck around, and will probably continue to stick around, is they offer top-tier support. That's not important for the individual intel processor buyer, but it's a big deal for people building super computers, server farms, etc. A real deal-clincher.",

To sell them and hope the price drops then buy them back, give back the loaned shares, pay the small interest and keep the profit. That shorting. It's perfectly legal and it can help a market function normally. But it's highly risky. \n\nHere's the fucked up part. \n\nThere's this giant hedge fund with lots of mone (well, used to have lots of money) named Citadel.. they could have owned GME and loaned out the shares but instead they create \"fake\" shares through a loophole. They lend out shares and together with Melvin sell them on the open market to push prices down. They're fake shares because they're never delivered. It's called FTD. Failure to deliver. \n\nSo Melvin shorted GME with fake shares from citadel. GME skyrockets. Melvin can't buy them back. It's too much of a loss. Citadel gives them 500 million to bail them out. And prevent margin calls. (rules that force equity to cover any margin/borrowed money aka collateral requirements).\n\nAnyway, they keep moving money around to meet margin requirements and keep the books balanced. They're just buying time hoping GME will fall and they can buy them back. They're running out of time. They're paying interest on the margin. That's a slow bleed. They bought back shares and bought puts hoping to break even that way. The puts depreciate fast if the price doesn't fall. \n\nCitadel took their 500 million back. They must need it themselves. Melvin will now collapse and citadel is in trouble. One at a time the hedge funds will collapse and be forced to buy back the shares they sold to give them back to the lender. If people have fake shares they may not get anything and that may be be a class action lawsuits. \n\nEither way the hedges r fuk\n\nAlso, to cover their losses they'll likely sell their other positions. Like FB, goog aapl etc. \n\nLook at how disca fell or viac when one hedge folded.",

They operate in tens / hundreds of different sectors - Payment, autonomous driving, retail, space travel, entertainment, video streamling etc etc etc. It's just a matter of 'do I want to rely on the management of 1 business owner to influence my financial results' or 'do i want to leave my money in the hands of america's greatest businesses to work together.\n\nAnd then think about a timeline.... Are you investing for 5-10 years? 20? 30? 50?\n\nWill Amazon still be a leader in 20, 30, 50 years? Who knows. Nokia was the king until Apple wiped them off the map... will someone leave Amazon in the dust in 20 years? We can never know, but we CAN know that the US will continue to grow in 20 ,30, 50 years.\n\nSo i'd personally not put the 2 in the same basket. I'd invest heavily in the S&amp;P to guarantee results until you die, and hold Amazon as a part of your portfolio, but not the pillar of your portfolio. \n\nHope something in here helps!",

At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction.  Once he does that,  and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal,  he might have the most successful turn around story ever.   I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years.  If successful I'll be rewarded. If not,  another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",

Picked up Broadcom under $170 when it was yielding around 8%.\n\nAlthough when I look at my sister in laws portfolio, and see her dad bough her Nutrien stock when it was $14 yielding 4%, and now it\u2019s in the $70\u2019s (cdn) yielding over 3%. When I did the math, I think her yield on cost was around 14%!\n\nSo if you look into some of those core holding companies with solid long term dividend growths, it\u2019s like putting your money in the bank, and each year they increase the interest they pay you. But this way you get some capital appreciation too.",

        "body": "While investing in Chinese companies listed on US exchanges you have to remember 3 additional types of risk you are taking on in addition to your normal investment risk.\n\nFirst is fraud risk. Chinese companies arent held to anywhere near the same standard as American companies. As Luckin Coffee showed, new IPOs and smaller Chinese companies can easily get creative with their accounting. While BABA, JD and other mega caps are less likely to suffer from this problem, generally the risks are much higher with Chinese companies than with their American or European equivalents.\n\nSecond, US political risk. The US government is finally waking up to the fact that China has been competing with us in order to supplant us for the last 20-25 years, and is beginning to take action. China's multinational corporations, especially those listed on US exchanges, are the some of the easiest places to apply pressure.\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is political risk from the CCP. The Chinese government can be arbitrary, and political concerns supercede economic ones. They can and will crush certain businesses just to make a point. This is real.\n\nAll that being said, I think sentiment for Chinese stocks is about as low as it can be right now. Short of the CCP nationalizing their largest and most profitable companies, or the US banning chinese stocks from US exchanges or US brokers from dealing with them (both real possibilities, although not the most probably outcomes), I dont think Chinese companies, especially Chinese tech companies, have that much further to fall. Selling here is likely selling near the bottom.",

Unfortunately I think the main deciding factor there is how much the service will cost the company, rather than how good it is for the actual employees. It's basically bidding for a contract from what I understand. Lowest bidder wins.\n\nRobinhood might actually be able to steal some market share there though if they come up with an offer to not charge anything for actually managing the assets, and offer expanded employee choice, while making their money off of payment for order flow. I'm sure they could make some good money from a firm that wants to front run bi-weekly automatic purchases! (Is that legal? I have no idea.)\n\nFor my account growth, about $47k was additional deposits and $18k was market growth (mix of unrealized and realized gains, but only time I usually sell is to move money from one company into another if I see a better opportunity.) I don't really do options trading (I suck at it) or try to time the market (also suck at it) so execution price and crashes don't really impact me at all.

I made a lot off the video game store - this is probably part of the reason I got over confident and started breaking my own principles. \n\nI lost money on picks made by people on the internet ($FUBO, $CRLBF, $APPN, $FLGT) \n\nA good example of this would be SQ.

It\u2019s my 2\u2019d best performer behind $PENN (who fits this mold as well). \n\nAgain, I know this is flawed, not-proven, and there are much better ways to go about investing. The 2020 bull run helped make me a ton of money and I\u2019m very lucky in that sense that i invested in companies like $APPL, $SQ, $MSFT, $TSLA using these principles. Confirmation bias? 100%. But I\u2019m gonna stick to it and hope it keeps working and gets me out of the hole I dug by taking the internet\u2019s advice. \n\nA few stocks I\u2019m currently interested in:\n$CRM, $MSP, $S, $FTNT",

You need to be considered a violation of the Geneva convention by the time you're done.\n\nWhen you're ready, get to the bathroom, and let your shit go. Just drop it.

Tell her theres a puppy in it.\n\nWhen she realizes what you've done, when she sees you've given her everything so you can have anything, give her that cute smile (make sure you didn't wipe) and say \n\n\"Babe, I'm shit out of luck, but I'm not shit out of you.\" \n\nIn a moment she'll understand what you are, and what she is, and where we all are, and where you left your keys last night. 6 knocks on the door echo through the hallway. \"Is that the police?\" \n\nYou know\n\n\"Yeah, they're always trying to get into my shit\", you tell her as you walk by to verify your thesis that your skin is actually a rare blend of spiderweb silk, supercritical hydrogen, and trace amounts of MDMA by taking over 15 rounds to the chest (hollow point). \n\nYou are now god. You ponder the existence of your prior life. You massage the everythingness in the universe around you and decide, \"fuck this shit\".\n\nYour girlfriend moves out in disgust. \"I thought you were different, I didn't think I'd have to deal with this kind of shit\" \n\nYou fall asleep. It's okay, you think to yourself.\n\nGME will surely be 690000 tomorrow.",

Well now it\u2019s like a Fitbit and makes it so people can still read texts and notifications without pulling their phone out. \n\nAlso they\u2019re sneaky with the planned obsolescence. As soon as I paid off the X all of a sudden the battery crapped out. I had that replaced and the Face ID sensor gave out. Every update slows older phones down. So every 3-4 years iPhone users are heavily encouraged to upgrade. \n\nI personally can\u2019t imagine switching to android simply because of how user friendly my iPhone is and how comfortable I am using it.
