Most of the investing money in the world is managed by about 30 people at black rock and vanguard. The money that isn\u2019t managed by them has to follow and trade based around the way br and vanguard trade or get run over. \nUntil there\u2019s a fundamental change in how the institutions manage the system, going against their grain will just make you cry. \nYes there will be small dips and sector rotations and some stocks will be riskier than others.

This one is a good overview but it focuses more on futures but the stuff is generally applicable to stocks as well: \"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications\". Use z-lib or some other book pirating sites\n* Try and stay away from price action because that's the most suspect of all technical analysis. On the other hand, algorithmic/system trading is arguably the most rigorous of technical analysis based strategies.\n\nIf you want to learn about fundamental analysis\n\n* Learn about multipliers and other fundamentals e.g. P/E, EBITA, EV.\n* Learn how to make financial models e.g. Here's Martin Shkreli teaching how to build a financial model with IBM as an example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fASInVKShnM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fASInVKShnM) (disclaimer, I think this particular valuation turned out to be wrong so focus more on the techniques/models used rather than specifics about the companies) and here's DeepFuckingValue valuing GME [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U).

They are in a dying industry and have been unsuccessful in pivoting away from fossil fuels to alternative sources of revenue. b.) They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",
