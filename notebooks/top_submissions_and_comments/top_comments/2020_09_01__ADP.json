        "body": "Daily Market and Options Summary for Sept 1st, 2020\n\nDaily Synopsis\n\n* The S&amp;P 500 (+0.8%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) rallied to fresh record highs on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq getting an added boost from the momentum in the mega-caps and growth stocks. The wealth spread around to the Russell 2000 (+1.1%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%), too.\n* Today's key moves were Apple (AAPL 134.18, +5.14, +4.0%) rising 4% after JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock to $150 from $115, and Zoom Video (ZM 457.69, +132.59, +40.8%) surging 40% after it crushed Q2 earnings expectations.\n* Apple was a major factor in today's index gains given its 7.3% weight in the S&amp;P 500, while Zoom provided the fuel for other growth stocks like Netflix (NFLX 556.55, +26.99, +5.1%) and DocuSign (DOCU 268.80, +45.80, +20.5%). Another supporting factor was the ISM Manufacturing Index for August increasing to 56.0% (consensus 54.5%) from 54.2% in July.\n* The manufacturing data helped lift the S&amp;P 500 materials (+2.8%) and industrials (+1.0%) sectors into positive territory with the information technology (+1.9%), communication services (+1.0%), and consumer discretionary (+1.1%) sectors. Each advanced at least 1.0%.\n* Conversely, the utilities (-1.1%), health care (-1.0%), and energy (-0.9%) sectors underperformed and declined around 1.0%.\n* Recapping some other mega-cap moves, Walmart (WMT 147.59, +8.74, +6.3%) climbed 6% after officially introducing its Walmart+ membership program. Tesla (TSLA 475.05, -23.27, -4.7%), however, was a notable holdout after the company disclosed plans to sell up to $5 billion in stock.\n* U.S. Treasuries ended the day higher after reclaiming overnight losses. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.11%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 92.34 after being down 0.4% in the morning. WTI crude futures increased 0.3%, or $0.14, to $42.76/bbl.\n* Looking ahead, investors will receive the ADP Employment Change Report for August, the Fed's Beige Book, Factory Orders for July, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, and auto and truck sales for August on Wednesday.\n\nIndex Summary\n\n**S&amp;P 500 :** (+0.94%);  **NasDaq :** (+1.72%);  \n**Russell 2000 :**(+1.15%);  **Dow :**(+0.88%);  \n\\*\\*Vix :\\*\\*26.12 -0.29 (-1.1%)\n\nSector Summary -\n\n(1-day %), \\[5-day %\\], {10-day %}\n\n***Currency -***  \n\\*\\*USD Index :\\*\\*92.131 (-0.31%); \\[-1.24%\\]; {-1.5%}; \\*\\*BC :\\*\\*11835 (+1.77%); \\[+4.92%\\]; {+2.99%}\n\n***Precious Metals -***  \n\\*\\*Gold :\\*\\*1978.6 (+0.94%); \\[+2.91%\\]; {+3.23%} ; \\*\\*Silver :\\*\\*28.594 (+1.91%); \\[+6.23%\\]; {+9.1%}\n\n***Farming -***  \n\\*\\*Soybeans :\\*\\*953.5(-0.29%); \\[+1.44%\\]; {+5.55%}; \\*\\*Corn :\\*\\*357.75(-1.12%); \\[-1.12%\\]; {+3.74%};  \n\\*\\*Coffee :\\*\\*129.05(+2.36%); \\[+7.44%\\]; {+9.99%}\n\n***Industrials -***  \n\\*\\*Crude :\\*\\*42.61 (+1.17%); \\[-0.65%\\]; {+1.82%}; \\*\\*Nat Gas :\\*\\*2.63 (-1.03%); \\[+5.77%\\]; {+6.33%}  \n\\*\\*Copper :\\*\\*3.0615 (+0.18%); \\[+3.63%\\]; {+5.27%}\n\nOptions Fast Facts\n\n***CBOE Put/Call Ratio - 0.45***  \n***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** GOGO with 4263x the ADV of 72004.

With that said BLS employment last numbers were like 20% temporary census jobs sooo perhaps manipulation? Also my point was referencing unemployment rate whereas now we are discussing employment added estimates. Fed projected 9.3% by EoY in June which we\u2019re already below (regardless of whether we want to believe that data or not). \n\n\u201cEvery MM knows\u201d referencing that tomorrow won\u2019t indicate drastic changes in fed reserve position on interest rates. I\u2019d argue volume is low because of uncertainty on stimulus bill AND election but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re sitting on their thumbs expecting a rate hike announcement tomorrow. Now that you\u2019ve said this I\u2019m curious if he will touch on this as an additional warning to congress/markets on the ramifications of additional stimulus does not come to fruition. \n\nGreat point about GDP\u2014I was trying to demonstrate in my highlights that Main Street is going to shit no doubt and there are probably dozens of other metrics to prove this point. Question is how will Wall Street react?",

If you work for a company that uses Square's payroll thing, get your paycheck deposited into your Cash App bank account and pay people with your Cash App bank account, that's one entity holding all the money without paying interchange fees and other bank related garbage.  Right now my money goes from Employer to ADP to Bank Account to Credit Card and every time someone else is making money there.  Everything in one spot?  Only one company is making money.  Square processed the payment putting the money in the employer's account, the employer keeps the money in the Square ecosystem to pay people, the people getting paid keep the money in the Square ecosystem until it's time to pay other people and even then with P2P using Cash App it's a decent shot that money makes a few more rounds inside the Square ecosystem.  \n\nI don't know if there are any other systems like that in existence other than that scam where Walmart tried to justify paying employees in walmart giftcards or cashing checks out to walmart giftcards at a higher balance than their base pay.  \n\nSquare I guess charges for the use of payroll services and instant thing fees while holding on to cash so it sounds like a good double dip that everyone else sorta can't do since they have to divest the money rather than hold on to it.",

ADP\u2019s client portfolio almost certainly has nuanced but important biases that skew it away from being a statistically significant representative of the entire US employment landscape. \n\nThis was an issue I first came to terms with when I worked in TV advertising. Nielsen is the trusted source of ratings even today, despite having a tiny sample size (I think less than 100K panelists). Compare that to a service like Rentrak, which reads data straight off of set-top boxes giving it a panel of 10s of millions of viewers. \n\nYou would think that Rentrak would have the better data. Yet it doesn\u2019t, and for good reason. It turns out that the type of person that would have a set-top box to begin with is skewed towards certain demographics, such as higher-income, whiter, older people. Which makes sense: you don\u2019t get cable tv if you can\u2019t afford it (low income), you don\u2019t want it (cord cutters), or can\u2019t get it (rural areas). Nielsen can have a small panel because it meticulously strives to make it representative of the entire country. \n\nADP is probably like Rentrak: it skews towards certain types of employers and therefore is blind to important segments of the US labor market.",

        "body": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**-Rocket Mortgage** \n\nQuicken Loans\n\n**-Rocket Homes**\n\nEssentially a large network of real estate agents. QL MLOs will refer their client's who are purchasing a home to Rocket Homes, who then in turn collects a referral fee if a deal closes.\n\nI like this one because it does 2 things. 1) It guarantees $$ for RKT even if the customer buying a home uses another lender other than QL. 2) Because the real estate agent got referred to the buyer (basically) by QL, it means they wont actively steer a customer to another lender making it more likely that QL gets the deal. \n\n\\-**Rocket Loans**\n\nA personal loan company that uses the same technology as QL. They are seriously awesome. I used them to get a personal loan and it's incredible. Using the same technology as QL does for Rocket Mortgage, they can have you approved for a personal loan in minutes and have the $$ into your bank account the next business day.   \n\n\nAdditionally, since they are in the RKT family, the QL MLOs can also refer their client's over to Rocket Loans. (\"I see you have a lot of credit card debt, might make sense for you to consolidate that with a personal loan\")\n\n**-Rocket Auto**\n\nHonestly, this must be very new because it wasn't around when I worked there and I cant find much about it online. I assume it is/will be auto financing of some sort using the RKT technology. \n\n\\-**Rock Central**\n\nFrom their website, emphasis my own:  \n\"At our core, we operate with the spirit of a startup and years of experience. We were **formed to support the growth within our Rock Family of Companies** and we provide the services that our partners need to evolve while allowing them to focus on their business. Our expertise encompasses human resources, accounting, technology, legal services and more. From helping companies who are just getting started to working with experienced industry veterans, our teams will partner with you to help you go further.\"  \n\n\nAgain, another piece that directly supports and keeps revenue within RKT.\n\n**-Amrock**\n\nTitle company that does most of the title work for QL. Any mortgage that QL originates is referred to Amrock for the title work, unless the client specifically requests another title company. \n\n**-Core Digital Media**\n\nThe parent company of Lower My Bills Inc. You know those adds on Facebook where you see a picture of an old lady throwing money in the air and says \"Click here to see how you can save up to $700 a month!\", or those that say \"The banks don't want you to know this secret to paying off your mortgage!\". This company does stuff like that along with other lead generation and advertising for consumer finance.  And because RKT owns them, this means that QL probably gets a pretty big discount on paying for those leads which other lenders pay big bucks for. I also wouldn't be surprised if QL and Rocket Loans are prioritized when the consumer gets to the page where it displays what lenders can offer them what products as well.\n\n\\-**Rock Connections**\n\nBasically outsourced telemarketers. They contract to companies for high volume call campaigns but will also prospect for mortgage leads for QL when business is real high and the regular QL banker force cant keep up with the lead volume out there.\n\n**-Lendesk and Edison Financial.** \n\nRecent acquisitions and RKT's jump into the international stage. Canadian mortgage companies that are just starting to take off and [grow](https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/online-mortgage-firm-edison-financial-puts-down-roots-in-windsor). Keep in mind that the Canadian housing market is also [blowing up.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/more-canadian-homes-sold-in-july-than-any-other-month-in-past-40-years-1.5067203)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nSince working there, getting more business experience in other positions, and then looking back at my time with QL, I have realized that Dan Gilbert is absolutely fantastic at ruining a company. You can see that he has essentially built his own ecosystem that continues to grow and feed itself.  Not only that, but Dan was the first (and for quite some time, the only) leader in the mortgage industry to put a huge emphasis on technology. When I was at QL they would always say \"We aren't a mortgage company, we are a tech company that does mortgages', and that's honestly an accurate way of describing it.   \n\n\nYou mentioned how expensive their loans are, and you're right. There are some products they offer that are very competitive, but a lot are not. That said, a lot of the people that use them don't care.  The generation that is now buying/refinancing homes don't want to talk to someone about their rate and closing costs. They don't want to talk to a \"salesperson\", they want to log on, and have a computer tell them exactly what they can/need to do. This is the technology that RKT offers. Do you work for a company that uses a major payroll supplier (like ADP)? Great, they can pull your paystub in seconds without you uploading anything. Need to get bank statements? Don't worry, just login with chase through the Rocket Mortgage page and they'll grab them for you. Need a real estate agent for the home you're getting pre-approved for? Great, we'll have one call you. The whole \"click button, get mortgage\" thing is real, and its kind of nuts.   \n\n\nAnd before you claim \"oh the housing crisis is going to get worse because of this and RKT will die with it!\". No, that's not a thing. \"click button, get mortgage\" doesn't mean everyone who clicks the button gets a mortgage. It goes through the same steps, and requires the same documentation and verification as any other lender, but Rocket Mortgage can do it all automatically in a matter of minutes on a computer, rather than hours on the phone talking to an MLO.   \n\n\nTrust me, if there's any mortgage company that plays it safe and follows the rules, it's QL. There's a reason that they are the only non-bank lender to come out of the last crash. They don't fuck around when it comes to mortgage regulations. I've seen top MLO's walked out because they tried to get away with something small to make a sale. \n\nOne other piece of DD to throw in there is how big the market is for mortgages. QL is the largest originator of retail mortgages in the country right now and they only take up about 9% of the market. So much room for growth.",

Their client base \"only\" represents 26 million employees. The entire workforce is 150-160 million people. Typically 26 million is a pretty good sample size of the total population, but in an unprecedented event like this if their sample has any sort of bias its going to suffer. They try to use a couple alternative sources to correct for the shortcomings of their dataset, but those sources are only measured once per year and if something changes, like it did this year, those means of correcting their data are completely useless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; they've put footnotes on all their recent reports \n\nWell this is true I guess, but at least they are upfront about it. They give you the raw values, seasonally adjusted values, etc.   \n\n\nWhat I don't understand is why the official unemployment numbers don't include people on federal unemployment assistance. They keep publishing headline numbers of \"10% unemployment\" or \"850k new applications\" but really its much higher if you include federal unemployment, which they do in the reports, but practically nobody in the general public look through the details or even know where to look. I don't understand why they aren't lumping them together and publishing the total number.",

        "body": "No don't put emergency funds into the stock market!  I get your logic, I'm heavy into stocks for dividend these days.  But IME investing your emergency fund only works when you have huge sums of money - large enough that if you lose your job, your dividends are meaningful enough to help pay the bills.  But if we're only talking about a few thousand dollars, that money will be much more valuable in cash.  If you hate the no interest, maybe shop around for a CD that will lock you in and have  a penalty if you take the $$ out early?  Those usually pay actual interest, and you'd probably just need to give up a couple of months' interest if you cash it out for an actual emergency, such as unemployment.\n\nBut investing any new savings in an ETF is great.  Everyone here will tell you to do a tech ETF, but if you invest long enough you'll realize it's best to buy things when they are on sale and wait when they are not.  Right now, tech is overpriced, AATH, or at the very least, most definitely not on sale.\n\nGo for all of the non-tech names on sale.  I highly recommend the Vanguard high dividend ETF symbol VYM which includes all of the companies you'd buy if you were into individual stocks.  And they pay a dividend so you'll get $$$ to reinvest:\n\nVerizon, JNJ, Merck, Intel, JPM, Bank of America, Pepsi, Walmart, McDonalds, Abbvie, Coca Cola, Next Era Energy, Texas Instruments, UPS, IBM, Bristol Meyes Squid, Colgate-Palmolive, Gilead, Raytheon, ADP, Duke Energy, Kimberly Clark, 3M, Lockhead Martin........the list goes on and on\n\nThe more $$$$ I have, the more I'm just putting into this fund since it has all of the solid companies I used to buy individually anyways. Also, it's on sale now, unlike tech!",

CEOs are free to engage in insider trading so long as they file the appropriate paperwork.\n\nAnother case of insider trading is how hedge funds have access to data that's not public. An example of this is credit card data. Banks and credit card companies sell your credit card purchase history to hedge funds through companies like Yodlee, and hedge funds can use your purchase history to estimate revenue for companies like Apple based on historical trends (i.e., curve fitting). Another example of this is credit bureaus which harvest your data and sell it to hedge funds (and other entities), and also payroll companies like ADP.\n\nThe practice of buying these datasets is not considered insider trading because anyone with enough cash can buy the data for themselves. Some hedge funds (notably Renaissance) are known for buying data from vendors with exclusivity. They'll pay the vendor extra for the data provided nobody else can have it. Let that sink in.\n\nSome data is easily acquired publicly (census data, Fed data, BLS), but juiciest most profitable data usually comes from private vendors.",

        "body": "Yes, but I do not think this is a big issue. Here is why:\n\n1. FRA is a infrastructure company, high levels of debt are very common in this field\n\n2. 50% of the stock is held by local governments (30% state Hesse 20% City of Frankfurt). This stake has been held for a very long time, which stabilizes the stock price. \n\n2. A lot of the debt comes from recent acquisitions and the expansion of the Frankfurt Airport, which should be beneficial for future earnings.\n\n3. Fraport made good use of the Kurzarbeitsgesetz, currently most wages are paid for by the government, which lowers overhead during the crisis.\n\n4. Fraport basically has a monopoly in the area and I feel that they will not suffer from competition as much as airlines, when the vaccine finally arrives.\n\nIt would surprise me, if FRA did not already secure a line of credit until mid next year.\n\nStock might drop short term, but it is good dividend stock. Fraport has made a lot of acquisitions in the past years, so there is even room to grow, especially in emerging markets.\n\nEdit. just compared it to Groupe ADP. Fraport has a better debt to equity ratio.\n\nFRA: Debt 6,33b \u20ac Equity: 4,29b \u20ac\nADP: Debt 9,41b \u20ac Equity: 5,10b \u20ac",

        "body": "I don\u2019t have any experience with that company at all, but at a minimum you should get statements regarding your investments. \n\nStart with those. They should include information on what funds are available. How those funds return on investment - ROI - have been over the last 1, 5, &amp; 10 year period. See where your funds are invested. See what the ROI has been for comparison. \n\nI manage my own 401K &amp; IRA. I use ADP &amp; TD Ameritrade. My 401K choice is because that\u2019s what the company I work for chose. Before Covid-19 I averaged about 20% growth. Now it varies a bit more - 8 - 18 % - but the last year still shows a 10% growth. I moved half my funds into safer funds while keeping the other half in riskier but higher performing funds. \n\nSo essentially check your fund ROI, check their fees for the fund, check to see your yearly growth, and finally see how much your investment company charges you for managing your fund. Some companies do a poor job of managing your funds but still make out well on the fees you pay them. So check them out.",

I stopped putting money in my account around then, and most importantly stopped trying to trade every day, just for the sake of it, because of greed. Patience is as essential as comprehending the greeks and IV. Thanks for the advice and, maybe more importantly, thanks for showing me what not to do 80% of the time. About to cash out of some NVDA, AAPL, RKT, and FDX and chill for a minute. May the tendies be with you all!",
