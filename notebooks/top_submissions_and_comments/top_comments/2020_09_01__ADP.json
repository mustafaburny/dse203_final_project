The wealth spread around to the Russell 2000 (+1.1%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%), too.\n* Today's key moves were Apple (AAPL 134.18, +5.14, +4.0%) rising 4% after JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock to $150 from $115, and Zoom Video (ZM 457.69, +132.59, +40.8%) surging 40% after it crushed Q2 earnings expectations.\n* Apple was a major factor in today's index gains given its 7.3% weight in the S&amp;P 500, while Zoom provided the fuel for other growth stocks like Netflix (NFLX 556.55, +26.99, +5.1%) and DocuSign (DOCU 268.80, +45.80, +20.5%). Another supporting factor was the ISM Manufacturing Index for August increasing to 56.0% (consensus 54.5%) from 54.2% in July.\n* The manufacturing data helped lift the S&amp;P 500 materials (+2.8%) and industrials (+1.0%) sectors into positive territory with the information technology (+1.9%), communication services (+1.0%), and consumer discretionary (+1.1%) sectors. Each advanced at least 1.0%.\n* Conversely, the utilities (-1.1%), health care (-1.0%), and energy (-0.9%) sectors underperformed and declined around 1.0%.\n* Recapping some other mega-cap moves, Walmart (WMT 147.59, +8.74, +6.3%) climbed 6% after officially introducing its Walmart+ membership program. Tesla (TSLA 475.05, -23.27, -4.7%), however, was a notable holdout after the company disclosed plans to sell up to $5 billion in stock.\n* U.S. Treasuries ended the day higher after reclaiming overnight losses. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.11%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 92.34 after being down 0.4% in the morning. WTI crude futures increased 0.3%, or $0.14, to $42.76/bbl.\n* Looking ahead, investors will receive the ADP Employment Change Report for August, the Fed's Beige Book, Factory Orders for July, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, and auto and truck sales for August on Wednesday.\n\nIndex Summary\n\n**S&amp;P 500 :** (+0.94%);  **NasDaq :** (+1.72%);  \n**Russell 2000 :**(+1.15%);  **Dow :**(+0.88%);  \n\\*\\*Vix :\\*\\*26.12 -0.29 (-1.1%)\n\nSector Summary -\n\n(1-day %), \\[5-day %\\], {10-day %}\n\n***Currency -***  \n\\*\\*USD Index :\\*\\*92.131 (-0.31%); \\[-1.24%\\]; {-1.5%}; \\*\\*BC :\\*\\*11835 (+1.77%); \\[+4.92%\\]; {+2.99%}\n\n***Precious Metals -***  \n\\*\\*Gold :\\*\\*1978.6 (+0.94%); \\[+2.91%\\]; {+3.23%} ; \\*\\*Silver :\\*\\*28.594 (+1.91%); \\[+6.23%\\]; {+9.1%}\n\n***Farming -***  \n\\*\\*Soybeans :\\*\\*953.5(-0.29%); \\[+1.44%\\]; {+5.55%}; \\*\\*Corn :\\*\\*357.75(-1.12%); \\[-1.12%\\]; {+3.74%};  \n\\*\\*Coffee :\\*\\*129.05(+2.36%); \\[+7.44%\\]; {+9.99%}\n\n***Industrials -***  \n\\*\\*Crude :\\*\\*42.61 (+1.17%); \\[-0.65%\\]; {+1.82%}; \\*\\*Nat Gas :\\*\\*2.63 (-1.03%); \\[+5.77%\\]; {+6.33%}  \n\\*\\*Copper :\\*\\*3.0615 (+0.18%); \\[+3.63%\\]; {+5.27%}\n\nOptions Fast Facts\n\n***CBOE Put/Call Ratio - 0.45***  \n***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** GOGO with 4263x the ADV of 72004.

If you work for a company that uses Square's payroll thing, get your paycheck deposited into your Cash App bank account and pay people with your Cash App bank account, that's one entity holding all the money without paying interchange fees and other bank related garbage.  Right now my money goes from Employer to ADP to Bank Account to Credit Card and every time someone else is making money there.  Everything in one spot?  Only one company is making money.  Square processed the payment putting the money in the employer's account, the employer keeps the money in the Square ecosystem to pay people, the people getting paid keep the money in the Square ecosystem until it's time to pay other people and even then with P2P using Cash App it's a decent shot that money makes a few more rounds inside the Square ecosystem.  \n\nI don't know if there are any other systems like that in existence other than that scam where Walmart tried to justify paying employees in walmart giftcards or cashing checks out to walmart giftcards at a higher balance than their base pay.  \n\nSquare I guess charges for the use of payroll services and instant thing fees while holding on to cash so it sounds like a good double dip that everyone else sorta can't do since they have to divest the money rather than hold on to it.",

AAPL on the other hand is up 40% from pre-corona levels. \n\nThis extends to all the standard physical blue chips as well. That money left and moved into covid resistant tech.

ADP\u2019s client portfolio almost certainly has nuanced but important biases that skew it away from being a statistically significant representative of the entire US employment landscape. \n\nThis was an issue I first came to terms with when I worked in TV advertising. Nielsen is the trusted source of ratings even today, despite having a tiny sample size (I think less than 100K panelists). Compare that to a service like Rentrak, which reads data straight off of set-top boxes giving it a panel of 10s of millions of viewers. \n\nYou would think that Rentrak would have the better data. Yet it doesn\u2019t, and for good reason. It turns out that the type of person that would have a set-top box to begin with is skewed towards certain demographics, such as higher-income, whiter, older people. Which makes sense: you don\u2019t get cable tv if you can\u2019t afford it (low income), you don\u2019t want it (cord cutters), or can\u2019t get it (rural areas). Nielsen can have a small panel because it meticulously strives to make it representative of the entire country. \n\nADP is probably like Rentrak: it skews towards certain types of employers and therefore is blind to important segments of the US labor market.",

CEOs are free to engage in insider trading so long as they file the appropriate paperwork.\n\nAnother case of insider trading is how hedge funds have access to data that's not public. An example of this is credit card data. Banks and credit card companies sell your credit card purchase history to hedge funds through companies like Yodlee, and hedge funds can use your purchase history to estimate revenue for companies like Apple based on historical trends (i.e., curve fitting). Another example of this is credit bureaus which harvest your data and sell it to hedge funds (and other entities), and also payroll companies like ADP.\n\nThe practice of buying these datasets is not considered insider trading because anyone with enough cash can buy the data for themselves. Some hedge funds (notably Renaissance) are known for buying data from vendors with exclusivity. They'll pay the vendor extra for the data provided nobody else can have it. Let that sink in.\n\nSome data is easily acquired publicly (census data, Fed data, BLS), but juiciest most profitable data usually comes from private vendors.",

        "body": "Speaking for a PE shop as well as a friend's FICC Sales and Trading experience. One of us works out of NY and the other out of Toronto.\n\nLike many of the others mentioned here, we using citrix to remote into our desktops at the office or on the trade floor. They also sent us a couple of extra monitors and gave us $500 to buy whatever we need to work from home.\n\nTheoretically, this should get us up to speed, but it's a complete quagmire. First, there is always going to be latency from using a remote connection. When the internet is slow, it might take a good 2-3 seconds before what you type actually appears. When you're dealing with a million emails a day, that adds up quickly. Also, there are tons of bugs with our software. I've lost track of the number of times my mic/webcam wasn't detected or our stupid screen share stopped working. Also, even 6 months into WFH, not everyone has all the privileges yet (screen share, file transfer over webex, etc).\n\nThe problems go beyond the technical issues. Things that took 10 min to resolve face to face now take 30 min to solve using WebEx (assuming no technical issues, which are common. If you have some technical issue, good luck). It is damn near impossible to read the room or read between the lines of what is being said on the call. It's just a slew of ppl taking at once followed by silence followed by \"go ahead\", etc, etc ,etc. My calendar is such a clusterfuck right now from all the calls. Our hours were already long before COVID (not as long as IB, but he works from 6AM - 7PM. My hours are about 8AM - 7PM), and now they are even longer. To make matters worse, having remote access means people are more likely to send you emails on the weekends.\n\nTLDR: It fucking sucks. Happy to answer any questions",

        "body": "It's quite bad that a company in 2020 is so unprepared for sudden work from home change; You mentioned a lot of technical issues, which aren't necessarily due to remote access, but more like CTO/COO not stepping up to 2020. I mean mic/camera issues, come on (buy **decent** camera+mic; hard enforce stable driver versions, make IT check each laptop before shipping to employee,etc.). Dealing with the lag with the likes of citrix is more complex, but 3 seconds delay is unacceptable and can be deal with. \n\nThe disruption in communications is more difficult to deal with, however most companies flat out suck donkey balls in their efforts to handle this. Let's take the \"random\" team huddles, which happen in the morning near the coffee machines or in the smoking area. Anyone would agree those were extremely useful. Yet not single company I know implemented a solution to mimic those. The solution is simple - have a voice chat rooms in which people can just join and chit-chat, they always open, like discord channels; name those \"smoking break\", \"coffee corner\", \"chitchat\" - etc. Yet nothing like that is present in any company I know and have friends working in. There are the only Teams meetings, which are definitely not the same thing. Because it's a meeting, you need to join exactly at some hour and it just sucks. Have you heard of a company which implemented such discord-like voice-chat rooms to re-create team-bonding over coffee/smoke, where one can join at like 10am and already find 2 people talking over a cigarette, then another girl might join at 10:07 when she has done her coffee and wc duties, no meeting deadlines, no official start and end time? I haven't. and that's a pretty simple solution. \n\nMy point is that I believe that with right attitude towards technology and organizational practices working in the office 2 days a week and from home 3 days a week can be a real win-win.",

Those are *not* my recommendations, just my top performing holdings.\n\nI'm self taught and ignorant about a lot, but try to learn. But I do have an investing philosophy. One of the big investing mistakes I think we all make is believing that how things are now is how they will always be, so I try to buy for a better future. And along with fundamentals I buy what I believe in, and what I've seen and used.\n\nI do socially responsible self-directed investing. So I try not to buy anything that makes money directly from fossil fuels, war, harming people or animals,, prisons, poor treatment of immigrants, refugees, or asylum seekers, or, predatory financial industries, or any other industries that cause people, animals, or the environment harm. I think there's a fair argument to make that I'm breaking this rule to include tech companies like Facebook and some biotech, so that's my failure to work on. But my investments since the early 2000s have beat all the markets, and all the funds, just by choosing to have principles and trying to invest in companies that do good.\n\nI also own other green energy, tech, grocery, railroads, data/commercial real estate, biotech. In the early 2000s I bought the companies that have become big tech, right now I'm buying transportation, biotech, 5G, AR, VR, and green energy companies along with companies I think will do well during the upcoming COVID-19 repeat. Despite the awful world we live in, I believe a better future is possible.",

I was checking it out earlier last month. \n\nI took some AMD and NVDA stock a while back no regrets. I like the idea of investing on the innovators and future tech for my mains. TSLA comes to mind but its really hyped, i think it is overvalued right now even though I like what the company is doing. Opted for some AAPL instead.",
