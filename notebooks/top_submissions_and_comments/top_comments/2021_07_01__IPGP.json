I emailed the ceo to ask him exactly how many warrants were outstanding and his reply was:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t discuss our share structure.\u201d LOL. Even though I can dig through and find this information if I take the time, what kind of ceo tries to hide this info from his shareholders? Total turd. He does this because he knows how crappy it is and how many 5 cent warrants he issued on financings that were done at 5 cents with the full warrant",
