One of the easiest ways to prove that there is duplicate voting is for vote counts to come back incorrectly. This would certainly be the case if everyone voted!\n\nQ: How can I vote?\n\nA: Your broker likely has a specific tab or interface for proxy voting materials in general, which is where you should find the GME vote. Many brokers will email you as well!\n\nQ: What should I vote for?\n\nA: Vote however you would like, but do know that the board unanimously suggests you vote \u201cFOR\u201d on all options.",
