        "body": "I used to use E\\*Trade, but I very quickly ditched them for Fidelity when I started taking account security seriously.  Both of them use Symantec VIP for 2FA (which is kind of a pain compared to a generic code generator, [but luckily you can hack it onto a Yubikey so you don't need a dedicated device](https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/yubikey-symantec-vip-access/)), but E\\*Trade is really stupid about how they implement it.  You have to append your auth code to your password in the same box.  This is really annoying if you have a password manager, because it will always think you've changed your password, and also pasting a code into the end of a filled password box is kinda glitchy.  Fidelity doesn't have quite as good a UI as E\\*Trade, but as an actual broker their order fulfillment and fees are slightly better, and they implement 2FA in a sane way, with its own box after you've entered your password.",

You know the people that are at the top of Scorpio Tankers, Star Bulk, and Danaos.  ($STNG, $SBLK, and $DAC) Get your head out of your ass and consider the fundamentals. J Mintzymer is going to be the moderator there, he is also well known on Twitter alongside Calvin Froedge who is also in the panel. To answer your question I'm a student who helped run my family business. Last summer when I was back home we were able to import furniture from China at a very reasonable price. Now container rates are so high it's no longer profitable to even import any of it. You are now better off buying domestically produced furniture. Don't believe me? The Harpex set an ATH so has the Contex. Want to know why I called bullshit on your statement? I have first hand experience in dealing with imports, before you call something a pump and dump look into it. Shipyards in China are booked, ports are backed up, not enough ships on the water, fleets getting old, and new regulatory crackdowns.",

As someone in the cybersecurity field and tracks that space, there is nothing to reflect. BB bought up a mediocre antivirus tool (Cylance) busted their butts to get it on the same playing field as other EDR products (endpoint detection and response, think AV software amped up and without all the false positives) but they are still bottom of the pack (review the Gartner quadrant [here](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/11/gartner-names-microsoft-a-leader-in-the-2021-endpoint-protection-platforms-magic-quadrant/)).\n\n&gt; Similar companies in the industry are priced around $40-60 mark but I think they have a lot more potential imo. \n\nEDR vendors that be competitors to Black Berry are as follows:  \n\n* CrowdStrike - $216\n* SentinelOne - Private Company\n* Microsoft Defender - $245\n* VMware Carbon Black - $159\n* Broadcom Symantec ATP - $23\n* Malwarebytes - Private Company\n* Cisco AMP - $54\n\nWhoever you are listening too on BlackBerry and \"cybersecurity\" needs to do some basic research. The Cylance product (and the functions it brings) they bought is basically dead and has zero room for growth. That is 1/3 of their entire offering. Other services and capabilities by BlackBerry aren't used by large firms any more. Companies like FireEye, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, etc have better IR and forensic services.",
