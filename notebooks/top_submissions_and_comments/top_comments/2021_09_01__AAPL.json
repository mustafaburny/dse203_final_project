Here is what\u2019s different. \n\nLast year 54% of all Apples revenue was the iPhone. 10 years ago, it was 82%. \n\nLast year Apple cleared 50 billion in revenue for services (i cloud services, Apple Music, Warranties etc). 10 years ago that revenue was 7 billion a year. \n\nLast year Apple cleared 25 billion in wearable, home gear and accessories (Apple TV, WiFi routers, Apple Watch, AirPods etc). 10 years ago that was 3 billion a year. \n\nBasically, Apple has found 65 billion a year in new revenue sources since Jobs died, and make more money (in real terms) on iPhones than they did 10 years ago. \n\nThey will be fine.",

There are a lot of trading videos by random people on YouTube, but some of them are a bit sketchy IMHO.\n\nDon't YOLO, unless you want to treat the market as a casino.\n\nTrade small until you can prove that you can trade successfully. It usually takes a while and expect to pay some tuition along the way. Be patient.\n\nYou don't have to trade everyday. Cash is a position. Wait for a good opportunity. Be patient.\n\nBe humble. Understand that you don't know more than the market. Best to trade with the market.\n\nDon't blindly follow anyone else. They might talk a lot, but they might not know more than you do. (This includes me) Better to know enough to make your own trading decisions. It's your money...\n\nTo begin, stick with well known tickers like SPY and, uh, AAPL. (How the heck did you mess up AAPL...). Stay away from meme stocks, at least for now. WSB is for amusement only, at least until you know enough to separate out the pump and dumpers.\n\nDon't try to swing for the fences. Many small wins add up faster than you think.\n\nIf you are going to buy options, the expiry should be 3 months or longer. Mr. Market wants your money. Don't just hand it over.\n\nSelling puts is a good place to start. Check out the theta gang. Selling puts on AAPL have worked well for me, but this might not be the moment.\n\nAt least 1000 more tidbits out there... Options are way more complex than most noobs realize. Like I said, be patient.\n\nAnd, ok, if you want to trade AAPL, here is a high probability set up... Wait for a pullback (earnings miss, maybe), allow the pullback to stop, AAPL may go sideways for a while. Then when it starts to go up, go long. \n\nIn particular, AAPL has a product announcement next Tuesday. The stock has been on a recent tear. To me, this seems like it might be a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" story. I am on alert for a possible pullback after the announcement. If there's a pullback, wait for the drop to stabilize. It will probably go sideways a bit and then start an earnings run. You go long when the up draft starts. Long calls should have Jan or longer expiry. Sell before earnings.",

But I can't afford to take it all out and put it in GICs either because my goal is to have 2-3x the amount when I actually do want to retire. \n\nI could lose 20-30% in a given year and it's not going to change my day-to-day lifestyle today. So maybe that's a better qualification. Investing shouldn't be gambling - if you're going in with the mindset that you could lose everything, you are betting on penny stocks or derivatives - investments with binary outcomes. \n\nIf you invest in Apple, Tesla, Berkshire, Walmart etc and they go to zero - that means it's probably the end of days and you'll need horses and guns to survive.",

It's probably been compared to Tesla's stock chart at least a dozen times in the last couple years.\n\nIf you have *any* stock that has a period of very good returns, that aren't straight up (and they never are) you're going to be able to find some part of the chart that matches up with this. That doesn't mean anything, for a few obvious reasons:\n\n* Not every stock follows this trend, in fact most don't. Look at the chart for any stock that's had a great run over a couple years (or more) like Amazon, Apple, Google, FB, MS, etc. And then zoom in and crop it so that it roughly looks like this shape. You'll easily be able to find a number of different spots that fit the \"pattern\". And in almost all those cases the stock just keeps going up afterwards (because of selection bias), but if you zoom and crop creatively enough you can find this general shape in nearly any stock that's had a long history.\n* This specific pattern isn't supposed to be for any arbitrary point in a company's lifecycle, it's for when a company first goes public. Smart money gets in, then institutional money, then the general public gets over excited and then it sells off and goes back to \"normal\"\n\nFor reference here's what TSLA's chart [looked like](https://i.imgur.com/JDEmqyp.png) for the appropriate period in the first couple years after it's IPO. It's kind of tough to tell which of the dips is supposed to be the initial \"bear trap\", but I suspect if I played with the scale and margins a bit I could make it fit perfectly.

        "body": "I'll give you an easy to follow beginner friendly guide. Forgive the formatting, I'm on my phone.\n\n1) Start with familiarity, write down a list of companies you see or use during your daily life. These could be Apple, Samsung, McDonald's, Starbucks, Target, Walmart or Tesla. Try to only put companies you are actually familiar with so you have some understanding and confidence in their business. \n\n2) Look at each companies annual earnings for the past 5 years. Specifically look at their EPS numbers. \"Earnings per share\" This one number can tell you if the company is profitable or not. Net income/Outstanding Shares = EPS. Now is this one metric trending up or down?\n\n3) Pull up the chart of the good companies from your list that have an EPS that is trending up. Put a 200 and 50 SMA \"Simple Moving Average\" on the chart. If the 50 is above the 200, the stock is trending up, if the 50 is below the 200 the stock is trending down.\n\n4) Think about your how long you want to be investing. If you plan to be long term investor \"5 to 20 years\" then there's no point trying to catch the highs or lows, just invest in a company that is profitable and trending up both financially and technically. If you plan on being a swing trader \"1 to 6 month\" you'll need to have more specific technical analysis.\n\nGood luck.",

Look at every good stock ever, chipotle comes most prominently to mind, with the series of diarrhea related news. Same thing with Facebook (can they monetize on ads as world browses on mobile), Netflix (competition from everyone going streaming), Apple (Steve jobs dead, revenue reliance on iPhones as innovation slows) and Tesla (production hell). Markets always underestimate the ability of a seriously good company to dig them out of troubles. I suppose one could look at Sears and blockbuster and ask how they failed but those are not comparable.",
