Here is what\u2019s different. \n\nLast year 54% of all Apples revenue was the iPhone. 10 years ago, it was 82%. \n\nLast year Apple cleared 50 billion in revenue for services (i cloud services, Apple Music, Warranties etc). 10 years ago that revenue was 7 billion a year. \n\nLast year Apple cleared 25 billion in wearable, home gear and accessories (Apple TV, WiFi routers, Apple Watch, AirPods etc). 10 years ago that was 3 billion a year. \n\nBasically, Apple has found 65 billion a year in new revenue sources since Jobs died, and make more money (in real terms) on iPhones than they did 10 years ago. \n\nThey will be fine.",

That doesn't mean anything, for a few obvious reasons:\n\n* Not every stock follows this trend, in fact most don't. Look at the chart for any stock that's had a great run over a couple years (or more) like Amazon, Apple, Google, FB, MS, etc. And then zoom in and crop it so that it roughly looks like this shape. You'll easily be able to find a number of different spots that fit the \"pattern\". And in almost all those cases the stock just keeps going up afterwards (because of selection bias), but if you zoom and crop creatively enough you can find this general shape in nearly any stock that's had a long history.\n* This specific pattern isn't supposed to be for any arbitrary point in a company's lifecycle, it's for when a company first goes public. Smart money gets in, then institutional money, then the general public gets over excited and then it sells off and goes back to \"normal\"\n\nFor reference here's what TSLA's chart [looked like](https://i.imgur.com/JDEmqyp.png) for the appropriate period in the first couple years after it's IPO. It's kind of tough to tell which of the dips is supposed to be the initial \"bear trap\", but I suspect if I played with the scale and margins a bit I could make it fit perfectly. At least if we ignore the last bit of the \"prediction\".",

Forgive the formatting, I'm on my phone.\n\n1) Start with familiarity, write down a list of companies you see or use during your daily life. These could be Apple, Samsung, McDonald's, Starbucks, Target, Walmart or Tesla. Try to only put companies you are actually familiar with so you have some understanding and confidence in their business. \n\n2) Look at each companies annual earnings for the past 5 years. Specifically look at their EPS numbers. \"Earnings per share\" This one number can tell you if the company is profitable or not. Net income/Outstanding Shares = EPS. Now is this one metric trending up or down?\n\n3) Pull up the chart of the good companies from your list that have an EPS that is trending up. Put a 200 and 50 SMA \"Simple Moving Average\" on the chart. If the 50 is above the 200, the stock is trending up, if the 50 is below the 200 the stock is trending down.\n\n4) Think about your how long you want to be investing. If you plan to be long term investor \"5 to 20 years\" then there's no point trying to catch the highs or lows, just invest in a company that is profitable and trending up both financially and technically. If you plan on being a swing trader \"1 to 6 month\" you'll need to have more specific technical analysis.\n\nGood luck.",

I answered someone about this last week when an OP asked about avoiding rookie mistakes.     This is the one that gets me every time.    \n\nAs a beginner your goal should be making every attempt to get a DELTA  of 1.  Not just the actual delta, but IV, gamma, theta all in sync to make you profit.   \n\nAs a beginner you should do paper trading first.   The get rich quick bullshit from WSB isn\u2019t going to get you  there.   Memes have their day but not every day.  \n\nI am not a CPA or financial advisor but I can tell you what I did many years ago.  I read a book called \u201cOptions as a Strategic Investment\u201d in my spare time.  I bought silly short term options and got burned on all but may be two.  Like a gambler I kept doing it so that the wins were just covering up the losses.  \n\nAfter I woke up I then went to Leaps.  Apple leaps to be specific and found over the years, that with every option that I buy it must be at least 3 months out.   If I can afford it I will buy them in the money.  OTM options I will need 6-12 months out.  WHY?   The easiest answer to this is that you neglected gamma and vega in your calc.  That pesky calculus BS that everyone hates.  The low theta was interesting but I\u2019d never trust that with the time frame given.   I prefer not to think about all of this and get rid of a lot of it by buying at least 3 months out.   As a beginner your goal should be to eliminate as many Greek issues that you can.   Buying OTM should be 6-12 months out so that you don\u2019t lose 50% of your investment when the stock drops less that 50 cents.   \n\nAgain I don\u2019t want to be rude, these are lessons that we learn as we go.  I hope you didn\u2019t lose too much on thsi play.  If you insist on doing this though you might want to look at SPY options, a lot of short term adrenaline junkies play there.   Good luck.",

What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",
