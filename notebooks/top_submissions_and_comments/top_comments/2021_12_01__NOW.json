You should also look at international stock funds, small cap and mid size funds too. Twenty or thirty years from now you'll look back at the advice that you have been given and hopefully be smiling. Make sure to read a lot on the topic of investing, and read periodicals like *Barron's* for some great info. All the best in your investing journey.",

Now that companies are doing better, getting strong revenues... it doesn't really matter if the market does a hard correction. It isn't needed for there to have been a \"mistake.\" They communicate what is necessary to try to keep people calm, until the time comes for a change, and then the change is made. There is nothing in \"promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\" about stonks always going up. If they had tapered a year ago, as you seem to be suggesting, before employment had recovered then companies might not have done the same amount of hiring. That was the goal all along, and they've been saying that all along. If you've been listening to them. A lot of people have been responding with continuous cynicism, instead of listening, and those people are less prepared to rotate their investments on time.\n\nIt is up to each of us, as traders and investors, to be prepared for things like this, and to make sane choices.",

Although that's making the assumption the company will resolve those issues. Takes severe optimism imo.",

        "body": "While the general consensus is that the average taxes will increase, we don't know which taxes. They could increase sales taxes and lower income taxes for example, making a Roth a bad investment now.\n\nAnother possibility is maybe in the future there will be a basic income since lots of jobs could get automated and income taxes could be reduced to 0 to incentivize work for those who want to live on more than the basic income.\n\nThat's why it's prudent to diversify with taxes and have both Roth and traditional accounts. I personally contribute only to Roth because company matches to Roth 401k are considered traditional so if you have a Roth 401k you're already diversified. Your contributions are post-tax but the company's are pre-tax.",

I think they're in an awkward spot where they share ownership of Hulu until 2024 with Comcast where they can then buy them out for fair value. I wonder the exact details, it sounds like Disney is hesitant to go all in on Hulu because it will cost them more in the end to own it. That's actually what Comcast is legally feuding with them now about, they're saying that Disney is sandbagging with slow expansion of Hulu in foreign markets so they won't have to pay Comcast as much. I wonder if that's limiting how much Disney wants to invest in Hulu original content right now as well.",

I would like to sell my units in this to buy  individual stocks and ETFs. My time horizon is 29 years.\n\nMy investing strategy is to buy and DRIP stocks/ETFs/etc that pay consistently growing dividends and also provide good long-term total returns (10% per year or better). I am also trying to diversify by having equal weighting in every sector.\n\nThe diversifying part is where I am having trouble. Right now, the sectors I don't have exposure to are: Energy, Consumer Discretionary, Basic Materials, and Healthcare. I have yet to find an individual company in these sectors that I like enough to buy stock in. I have found energy to be a particularly tricky sector.\n\nIs there an ETF that has equal-sector weighting, and has performed well over the long-term? Or would I be better served by buying an S&amp;P 500 or TSX60 ETF?\n\nThanks!",
