You've wrongly assumed they're the same company and deserve the same valuation.\n\n2013 - $4130\n\n2014 - $4681 (13% growth)\n\n2015 - $5010 (7% growth)\n\n2016 - $6910 (38% growth)\n\n2017 - $9714 (40% growth)\n\n2018 - $11716 (20% growth)\n\n2019 - $10918 (-7% growth)\n\n2020 - $16675 (53% growth)\n\n2021 - $26671 (60% growth)\n\nAs you can see they used to be a low-mid growth company with the exception of the crypto boom years which was considered a one-off benefit.\n\nHowever they've transformed into a super high growth company. \n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 13% deserve?\n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 50% deserve?\n\nTo answer that, look at how different growth rates affect a company after 5 years\n\nCompany @ 50% growth after 5 years = 7.6x revenue\n\nCompany @ 13% growth after 5 years = 1.84x revenue\n\nIf NVDA actually achieves 50% for 5 years, which I think is too high, their profits would be over 60bn which is what MSFT earns now, and they're a 2.5T company.\n\nEven at 35% growth for 5 years, they become more profitable than FB is today.\n\nInvestors seem to have trouble on assessing growth valuation. That's why the investors who just throw money at growth stocks without evaluating financials do well, because they don't shoot themselves in the leg.\n\nIf you think NVDA will grow at less than 30% avg. then you have a point. However, the consensus is closer to 40% growth.",

        "body": "I posted this comment on a couple of other Disney related threads over the last week so I'll post it here again too. You've touched on a lot of problems, but for me Bob Chapek is a walking disaster that seems to fuck up everything he touches.\n\nNote that he took control at the end of last year if I remember correctly, and I don't think it's any coincidence that they're down 18% since then.\n\nHe's actively pissing off his creators (including Kevin Feige, the golden goose of Disney right now) and Bob Iger which are the people that made the brand what it is today. He's reported by insiders to be nickel and diming every single issue, which shows when you look at what happened with the ScarJo situation. There was no need for that to be as public as it was and it was handled disastrously. It's simply a situation that wouldn't have happened under Iger. He's actively taking away the control of the likes of Alan Horne and Feige and giving it to middle managers who don't know the industry because their experience is in banking, not entertainment. This has led to stupid decisions regarding Dinsey+ Premier access movies which have harmed industry relations as well.\n\nMore on the PR side, he was supposed to turn up at D23 (an event that was booked months in advance), however he bailed at the last minute because of \"scheduling conflicts\". What scheduling conflict comes up at the last minutes that prevents you from attending what is one of the most important dates in the Disney diary? Well, according to insiders, he was afraid of being booed off stage, because of how deeply unpopular he is.\n\nThen there's slightly more minor things which are indicative of the type of leader he is compared to Chapek. Such as the fact that he hasn't turned up to a single movie Premier since he has been CEO. Chapek went to every single one because he led from the front and wanted to support his creators. You can find pictures of him beaming with smiles along with them at practically every Premier. Chapek? He has \"scheduling conflicts\".\n\nWith regards to Shang Chi, when asked about the movie, all he said was \"it's an interesting experiment\" because of the fact they were releasing it with the 45 day theatrical window. That's literally all he had to say about the single biggest event film that had come out that year so far. One that had the potential to be another Black Panther level success (both commercially and culturally) if it weren't for COVID.\n\nThere's a whole host of other things I could go into (like why on Earth they continue to employ Kathleen Kennedy as Head of Star Wars), however it's easier if you just look at how the Disney Parks fans view the guy (seriously look it up). He managed the parks for years and those guys absolutely *loathe* him, and for good reason apparently.\n\nFull disclosure as well btw, I was fully bullish on Disney earlier this year. I liked the direction the company was heading in and felt confident it was going to stick around. Everything above made me pull out in Summer.",

It isn\u2019t a matter of just designing the jet engine but then innovating and improving that design.\n\nHave you forgotten about the Space Race between USSR and NATO?\n\nCompetition between sports teams has led to amazing developments in nutritional science and how we see our bodies.  Sports medicine has also developed new techniques and dramatically reduced recovery time for injuries that used to leave people crippled. Analytics has been dragged forward by sports teams and companies looking for that edge.\n\nWhat about having a single supplier vs multiple suppliers of a critical part as we are learning now with semiconductors?\n\nThe competition between the amd and nvda and other semiconductors to surpass Intel right now is transforming the way that we can use computers to solve problems.\n\nCompetition is what causes humans to take the information in those research papers and bring them to the masses in an affordable fashion.\n\nLack of competition is how we end up with complacency and apathy in our end products(again see Intel and their being left behind)",

You then think well that was just bad luck and take the rest of what's left over and buy more contracts.  The market moves against you again so now you've reached the end game of well fuck it I'm just gonna buy the scratch off equivalent of options and hope they land with the couple hundred bucks ive got left.\n\nI've done this cycle twice before I learned my lesson.  At least take half of what you make in profit and stick it in shares yeah it's not sexy to only make 2% in a day when you can get a 10 bagger if you look right but there's also a reason 90% of people who fuck with options end up broke.

They will keep generating a boatload of cash and will do more buybacks and dividend growth. They are also putting capital into the fintech space so those will take time to show up on the income statement. They are tech in their heart so they will reinvent along with the times. They were on the cusp of acquiring Plaid but that was blocked by the authorities. I just think this will take a while to play out but I expect PE compression similar to what American Express faced along the way after the financial crisis. American Express only recently exhibited some PE expansion. Having said that, Visa went down from a close to half a trillion dollar market cap to 400B in market cap. So they really have to deliver to expand market cap. So a lot hinges on reopening in the short to medium term.",

The product is then sold to storage companies like Intel, Kioxia, Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, Western Digital and YMTC.\n\nFair question on securing enough supply. Management seems confident they can get enough supply to generate strong sales growth in 2022.\n\n[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/28/silicon-motion-technology-corporation-simo-q3-2021/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/28/silicon-motion-technology-corporation-simo-q3-2021/)\n\n&gt;Our order book remains strong and continues to be well in excess of $1.5 billion for next year. We are seeing, however, some adjustment in our order book with the softening of orders for channel market products and strengthening our product for OEM customers. For example, we are seeing demand for SSD by global PC OEM continue to strengthen. While client SSD for retail markets, especially in China, softening. **Since we are supply constrained, we have been looking at our revenue run rate for annualized sales targeting. In the third quarter, we delivered $1 billion in revenue run rate a quarter ahead of when we had previously communicated and expect our revenue run rate to increase further in the fourth quarter** as we focus on managing our product mix, customer allocation and pricing. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022. That is incremental to what we have this year, and **we are confident we can grow ourselves next year toward our $1.5 billion order book**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**We believe demand will continue to exceed supply next year. But even under this scenario, our revenue growth next year will still be very strong.**",

I just quickly scanned AVY and it took on a lot of debt during its last report while CERN had a significant drop in net income as some examples. \n\nMPX does not have positive FCF over the TTM, so that one dropped out. \n\nXLNX left because its earnings yield is not greater than the treasury. \n\nSo it's definitely a mix between the scores, but primarily debt related this month. \n\n\\---\n\nThis is the third time I've run the list, so I don't have a way other than scanning the older lists and seeing the outcome.
