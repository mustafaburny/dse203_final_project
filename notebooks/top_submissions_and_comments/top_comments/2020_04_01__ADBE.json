        "body": "Things to love about Apple as business:\n\n* Other worldly return on invested capital going back a decade plus (which is downstream from everything that comes after)\n* Smartphones is a massive, stable market with an incredibly high ROI to their users: Apple derives $150bn+ of annual revenue from iPhones, most of that from North America and Europe. Despite how expensive smartphones are, tell me how much would I have to pay you to go back to using a Brick? $3000 per year? $5000 per year? The $350 / year of hardware + $500 / year of data that seemingly everyone gleefully pays is a function of just how amazing it is to have a computer / phone / camera in one, that fits in your pcoket, all with ubiquitous broadband speed internet.\n* Absurd brand premium to their products: Hardware assembly is infamously commoditized yet Apple's gross margin on its smartphones is 65% (compared to say 18% for HPQ); part of it is the pricing power Apple gets from the loyalty of its customer base, part of it is the sexiness of the design of their products. Android user = poor in New York, Los Angeles and many of the other cultural capitals of the world.\n* Customer lock in: Despite the designed obsolescence of its products, despite the high prices, despite the fact that many iPhone users (myself included!) don't even like the interface, almost all of us pony up the $700 every two years because a) the damn phones are in our palms 24/7 and it would be a nightmare to refamiliarize ourselves with a new OS, b) we'd lose the trade in value of our existing phone (though there is something of a secondary market so this isn't too crucial a factor as much as it was 5-10 years ago) and c) we've all bought so much other crap (cases, chargers, etc.) that we'd have to repurchase on top of the hardware if we switched to a different ecosystem\n* Network effect from ecosystem: the massive amount of users begets app developers, the app developers create apps that are specific to iOS which in turn begets users, Apple builds its own stuff (namely iMessage) that add to the ecosystem and is able to push services (see Apple Music) into that ecosystem, driving incremental revenue\n* Closed system = they own the ecosystem: Unlike the WinTel (+ Adobe) ecosystem of PCs in the 20 aughts or the Android ecosystem, Apple has a closed system with proprietary OS and processors.\n* Their suppliers are dependent on them / they are not dependent on suppliers: When it looks like Apple might be dependent on a supplier, they in house the capabilities, often driving the supplier bankrupt.\n\nBesides how great a business Apple is, the stock is valued much more rationally (usually mid to high teens P/E) and on current metrics than any other Tech giant therefore it makes sense that Buffett chose them and not say Facebook.\n\nEdit: fixed the size of iphone market",

        "body": "No although you\u2019re very invested in technology\nWhich isn\u2019t a bad thing.  \n- AAPL is great, their market value will always go back to what it was even if they don\u2019t release the new iPhone. Don\u2019t be afraid of a drop just average costs if it drops dramatically. \n\n- Adobe should do well with this stay at home. School is requiring the use as well as businesses from home. \n\n- Amazon is essentially showing its untouchable currently. I\u2019m large into amazon as well. \n\n- Disney is another powerhouse that you\u2019ll never need to worry about. The lost revenues over the following 8 months could cause a dramatic drop, in this scenario don\u2019t panic and average your cost. \n\n- Enph - energy, I\u2019m not familiar with this company. \n\n- Facebook is another powerhouse good pick. \n\n- Google - Great pick. \n\n- MasterCard is also a good pick, hold this. Average if it comes down to although you shouldn\u2019t have to they trade rather high. If you\u2019re at a major loss with their recent decline. Average in the next 3 months when there\u2019s a better understanding how financials will deal with crisis. (You shouldn\u2019t need to) \n\n- Microsoft - I love microsoft. They are on a tear currently. Teams daily usage is up 12 million users in the last month, this is major. Their competition is \u201cwork\u201d slack technologies who I am also Long. \n\n- Netflix has been great good pick. \n\n- Nike is a great pick. I could expand but they\u2019ve always done well. Constant increase throughout the life of their stock. \n\n- Nvidia is a powerhouse as well. Great pick. \n\n- Starbucks is great. I haven\u2019t followed them through the virus but they\u2019re a strong company large capital, their profits are also great. Good pick. \n\n- Square I like square a lot. Square has major potential in different avenues. Cash app, lending (they just got approved to lend during this time). Prior to the virus square was on a tear. I\u2019m long on this I got in early and am very big on square. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in diversification:\n\nAll that being said you really are big into tech, I would suggest diversification. \n\n\u201cOxy\u201d - occidental petroleum is a good long term stock. They\u2019re trading extremely low currently due to oil wars, corona virus, issues on the board and the purchase of anadarko. (This scares a lot of investors but you seem to want long term investments) it\u2019s a steal at 15$ a share. \n\n- Johnson and Johnson is a powerhouse. \n\n- Jet blue &amp; Delta - long term great investments. Short term extremely risky. \n\n- Walmart: trading high but they\u2019re only going to go even higher when this is over. \n\n- AT&amp;T and Verizon: AT&amp;T trades fairly low with a large dividend. GREAT LONG TERM. Verizon has been extremely strong throughout the years.  \n\n- Ford on the long term has a lot of upside trading around half of its average price. Ford pays dividend and  history has proven America will never let ford fail. \n\n- USO is an ETF that tracks United States Oil, It\u2019s trading extremely low, no reason not to diversify with this. ( The oil war between Saudi and Russia is coming to an end, this should do well in the long term) \n\n- Have you put any though into mutual funds to also diversify ? A good managed funds typically has large returns and low risk. \n\nReach out to me if you\u2019d like.",

Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

        "body": "Hey there--happy to give some feedback. I think your portfolio overall looks pretty decent, provided that you genuinely understand these companies and bought at reasonable prices. A good number of these companies have sustainable competitive advantages and good management, so you're off to a great start. Time is on your side, and since you're in your early 20s, there's no problem with being 100% in equities. In fact, if there was a time in your life to do so, it'd probably be now while you can afford the risk. \n\nOne point of contention that I'd like to mention is the equal weighting. Is that purposefully done? Personally, I think it's unnecessary. There's definitely a few companies in that portfolio in which you have much better understanding and conviction. Turn up the exposure on those (if they are at least fairly valued). For me, that would be DIS, MSFT, NKE, and ADBE, but for you that could be different.\n\nTo answer your question is \"14...too many to hold in a portfolio?\" I think no. Personally, I believe it's pointless to fixate on how many stocks you own. If you've got even 3 or 4 great holdings, what's holding #5 really going to do for you? Diversification for the sake of it, especially in these current market conditions, is irrational in my view. Great companies are really rare, and that's something I've come to appreciate over my investing journey. Spend time finding the truly exceptional organizations and run with them. Good luck!",

So you're looking at 4 years min for federal legalization then how ever long it takes the states to all get their rules in place. So I see 4 years worrying if things like this virus will push pot companies into insolvency with little reason for a pump. Its literaly the biggest month for pot ever and its cancelled instead of it being a month of pumping.\n\nPlus right now a whole shit load of good companies with decent financials are at a value. You'll in my opinion make more upside putting your cash in bluechips and waiting the virus out. Just my 2cents. I'd stick to shit like googl, msft, ttd, adbe, fb, wm, rtn, lmt, adp, apd, ma, v, etc. These should get you returns and some even yeild a lil dividend.\n\nIf your heart is set on pot stocks the only one I'd put money on is iipr. As pot companies need funds they sell their realestate to iipr and then iipr rents it back to them. As pot companies struggle it should leave opportunity for iipr to grow and profit. They are a reit so they pay a decent dividend. Only caution is if banking becomes available it could act as competition but shouldnt be a big deal or even a concern for a while as congress is too inept to handle even just this pandemic much less a pandemic while performing normal business. Hell without the pandemic the senate/McConnell was still useless. So yeah I'm not worried about congress actually acting on anything really ever unless it involves lining their own pockets.\n\nI am as long as I need on iipr and I dumped all my pot stocks early on in this mess for reinvestment capitol.

Overall, I think this portfolio is certainly on its way, but I'd really need to know your age-range, risk tolerance, and personal investment goals. That said, you are perhaps a young, growth-minded, and relatively risk-tolerant investor, based upon your holdings. I think the roughly 50% weighting in a large cap growth index fund is adequate. At that point, I think it's certainly acceptable to branch out into individual equities (again, this is only if my previous assumptions are correct).\n\nThat said, I would personally drop FTEC. Why? Because technology is a broad sector with lots of real, discernible winners in there. Instead of picking all of them, I'd load up on those winners. To me (and to you), MSFT is one of those winners. They dominate. They're well managed. They've got growth in the form of public cloud--a long-term secular tailwind. I'd also throw ADBE and CRM in there as well.\n\nAs for TSLA, I don't like the financials or dynamics of the auto business. Sure, they're not just an auto company, but that's a significant portion of their operations. Management-wise, Musk is an incredible innovator, but I don't see him as an equally incredible CEO. That's just a terribly brief version of my 2 cents, but if you know better, go on right ahead.\n\nAs for COST, I think it's a real winner. Sure, the valuation is rich, but it is seriously one of the best businesses around. I'd go so far as to say I like it even better than AMZN. Hope this helps. Good luck!",

Now with the 1-2 punch of oil layoffs and corona virus some people are fucked and panicking. I have the following comments to support a decline in Calgary specifically: \n\n\\-Job losses in oil and layoffs from COVID\n\n\\-The market hadn't fully bounced back since 2015\n\n\\-There's already a huge influx of fully furnished apartments hitting websites like RentFaster. People's investment properties that run on Air BNB are now empty and burning holes in their pockets. The market can only absorb so many of these rentals hitting the market at once. Few people want to move apartments in this environment, so its quite plausible these units will have to be put up for sale. Then you have even more folks forced to sell, without an increase in buyers. \n\n\\- Using a specific example. There was a 1 BR+den unit in Mission (Young but nice area, within walking distance of downtown Calgary) for $293K. It was being used for short term rentals. This week the priced dropped $75K to $218K. \n\nI'm expecting some more fire sales out of desperation (job losses and empty investment properties) which will drag down the price of most sales. Long term though there could be 1 last boom in AB oil and gas. Should TMX, KXL and Enbridge Line 3 replacement all be executed and put into service, the mid 2020s could provide 1 last big hurrah for Canadian Oil.",

Its ignoring that, certain events can trigger a change. events that we arent aware of.\n\nJust like the big stimulus package.\n\nFor this extreme bear market to happen, youd need a  pretty big catalyst which would lead to extended unemployment,reduced spending, reduced foreign investment.\n\nI dont think the US govt would let it get to that level. Look at the past two bail outs.\n\nYes we the US could be like japan, but it may not br an apples to apples comparison, if you look at 90s US vs 90s japan. At this point, the US is the biggest developed \"free market\" with a highly educated , highly diverse work force...so if investors are seeking returns, where else would they put their money? their bed? 1-2% bonds? investors could have left japan and put their money in the US. without the US market, where will investors put their money?",

BR no longer lists an up to date form and Questrade doesn't make any commission, so they may or may not help out. But you can try. They do DRIP too.\n\nOther than that, WealthSimple Invest, this is what you pay them for, fully automatic from deposit, purchase,   reinvest dividends and rebalancing.\n\nIf there is something else, I want to know too.",

        "body": "Very very bad company. I went from HP to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to DXC Technology, and the whole time we were employed at DXC there was a feeling of death around with no morale and a very sad feeling around the fact that most were told they should just be happy they have a job. Although I literally sat and watched as person by person around me all inevitably got laid off. They'd come in on Thursday and be told the next day (Friday) would be their last day and they'd be lucky to get severance. I eventually left the company because of anything could be better, and I was looking to grow and not be held down. \n\nNo raises or bonuses for years, layoffs left and right, vile environment, etc. I wouldn't own it, but then again I don't track the stock price and I see it from a perspective that would never interest me in looking.",
