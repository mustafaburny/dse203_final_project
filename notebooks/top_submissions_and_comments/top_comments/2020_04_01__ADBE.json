Don\u2019t be afraid of a drop just average costs if it drops dramatically. \n\n- Adobe should do well with this stay at home. School is requiring the use as well as businesses from home. \n\n- Amazon is essentially showing its untouchable currently. I\u2019m large into amazon as well. \n\n- Disney is another powerhouse that you\u2019ll never need to worry about. The lost revenues over the following 8 months could cause a dramatic drop, in this scenario don\u2019t panic and average your cost. \n\n- Enph - energy, I\u2019m not familiar with this company. \n\n- Facebook is another powerhouse good pick. \n\n- Google - Great pick. \n\n- MasterCard is also a good pick, hold this. Average if it comes down to although you shouldn\u2019t have to they trade rather high. If you\u2019re at a major loss with their recent decline. Average in the next 3 months when there\u2019s a better understanding how financials will deal with crisis. (You shouldn\u2019t need to) \n\n- Microsoft - I love microsoft. They are on a tear currently. Teams daily usage is up 12 million users in the last month, this is major. Their competition is \u201cwork\u201d slack technologies who I am also Long. \n\n- Netflix has been great good pick. \n\n- Nike is a great pick. I could expand but they\u2019ve always done well. Constant increase throughout the life of their stock. \n\n- Nvidia is a powerhouse as well. Great pick. \n\n- Starbucks is great. I haven\u2019t followed them through the virus but they\u2019re a strong company large capital, their profits are also great. Good pick. \n\n- Square I like square a lot. Square has major potential in different avenues. Cash app, lending (they just got approved to lend during this time). Prior to the virus square was on a tear. I\u2019m long on this I got in early and am very big on square. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in diversification:\n\nAll that being said you really are big into tech, I would suggest diversification. \n\n\u201cOxy\u201d - occidental petroleum is a good long term stock. They\u2019re trading extremely low currently due to oil wars, corona virus, issues on the board and the purchase of anadarko. (This scares a lot of investors but you seem to want long term investments) it\u2019s a steal at 15$ a share. \n\n- Johnson and Johnson is a powerhouse. \n\n- Jet blue &amp; Delta - long term great investments. Short term extremely risky. \n\n- Walmart: trading high but they\u2019re only going to go even higher when this is over. \n\n- AT&amp;T and Verizon: AT&amp;T trades fairly low with a large dividend. GREAT LONG TERM. Verizon has been extremely strong throughout the years.  \n\n- Ford on the long term has a lot of upside trading around half of its average price. Ford pays dividend and  history has proven America will never let ford fail. \n\n- USO is an ETF that tracks United States Oil, It\u2019s trading extremely low, no reason not to diversify with this. ( The oil war between Saudi and Russia is coming to an end, this should do well in the long term) \n\n- Have you put any though into mutual funds to also diversify ? A good managed funds typically has large returns and low risk. \n\nReach out to me if you\u2019d like.",

Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

        "body": "Hey there--happy to give some feedback. I think your portfolio overall looks pretty decent, provided that you genuinely understand these companies and bought at reasonable prices. A good number of these companies have sustainable competitive advantages and good management, so you're off to a great start. Time is on your side, and since you're in your early 20s, there's no problem with being 100% in equities. In fact, if there was a time in your life to do so, it'd probably be now while you can afford the risk. \n\nOne point of contention that I'd like to mention is the equal weighting. Is that purposefully done? Personally, I think it's unnecessary. There's definitely a few companies in that portfolio in which you have much better understanding and conviction. Turn up the exposure on those (if they are at least fairly valued). For me, that would be DIS, MSFT, NKE, and ADBE, but for you that could be different.\n\nTo answer your question is \"14...too many to hold in a portfolio?\" I think no. Personally, I believe it's pointless to fixate on how many stocks you own. If you've got even 3 or 4 great holdings, what's holding #5 really going to do for you? Diversification for the sake of it, especially in these current market conditions, is irrational in my view. Great companies are really rare, and that's something I've come to appreciate over my investing journey. Spend time finding the truly exceptional organizations and run with them. Good luck!",

It includes payment processing as well as part of the monthly fee.\n\nFrom my experience, people are very slow to cancel subscriptions tied to their websites, especially when it\u2019s not breaking the bank. This is how Shopify retains its business and continues to grow.\n\nIt\u2019s competition has never and will likely never catch up. I\u2019ve used platforms like BigCommerce, Magento, and even dated a gal that worked at Volusion in Austin and none of them stack up with what Shopify offers.\n\nShopify is right up there with Adobe and Salesforce as a great growth stock to own with all subscription based revenue. However, I would not buy a ton right now until the market takes out its March lows given the current circumstances in the economy. We definitely have not hit bottom yet in the market and have a ways to fall.",

If anything, they are the go to solutions for Enterprise.\n\n2) Shopify has a lot of exposure to VC backed D2C companies, many of which are now struggling for life. The room to growth becomes very questionable when a lot of these e-commerce companies have been burning cash, the whole model is now under question. VC funding has stopped, completely.\n\nDropshipping is likely to be another casualty in post COVID world - cheap stuff from China, which is mostly consumer discretionary, isn't going to grow 50% a year with unemployment rising, if anything businesses will see declining sales of these. You might see unemployed people starting more of these business, but they'll not offset decline in merchant solutions revenue (dependent on sales).\n\n3) Unlike Amazon, Shopify doesn't control it's destiny. It relies on its sellers to be successful. I do like the fulfilment aspect but again, Shopify relies on its sellers to be successful selling through their own marketing- it doesn't bring organic traffic to its customers the way Amazon does. Amazon has achieved the unthinkable - no one foresaw AWS for example.",

        "body": "I think Calgary and Edmonton will take a trim (might be small, but could be a big trim). They never did have a strong bounce back from the 2015 debacle. Now with the 1-2 punch of oil layoffs and corona virus some people are fucked and panicking. I have the following comments to support a decline in Calgary specifically: \n\n\\-Job losses in oil and layoffs from COVID\n\n\\-The market hadn't fully bounced back since 2015\n\n\\-There's already a huge influx of fully furnished apartments hitting websites like RentFaster. People's investment properties that run on Air BNB are now empty and burning holes in their pockets. The market can only absorb so many of these rentals hitting the market at once. Few people want to move apartments in this environment, so its quite plausible these units will have to be put up for sale. Then you have even more folks forced to sell, without an increase in buyers. \n\n\\- Using a specific example. There was a 1 BR+den unit in Mission (Young but nice area, within walking distance of downtown Calgary) for $293K. It was being used for short term rentals. This week the priced dropped $75K to $218K. \n\nI'm expecting some more fire sales out of desperation (job losses and empty investment properties) which will drag down the price of most sales. Long term though there could be 1 last boom in AB oil and gas. Should TMX, KXL and Enbridge Line 3 replacement all be executed and put into service, the mid 2020s could provide 1 last big hurrah for Canadian Oil.",

I remember in 2012 it had a P/E over 3500. At around 250 it would that would have been a great investment. \n\nCOST just reported 1.5 billion YOY revenue increase for March.

You are vastly under playing the business required for this. Home based networks can make confidential information more vulnerable. PAWN and CSCO both stand to benefit from this. (Carbonite mcafee, etc). There is also additional companies that help provide a safe portal (NTAP, CSCO, MSFT) to access the infrastructure. The servers networks need built (INTC, AMD, NVDA) and then stored (DLR). Then maintained (JNPR CSCO). \n\nBeyond al of that Stock market is speculative.

This has been making me hesitant to continue buying in, because I thought prices would keep falling. Am I making a mistake by not continuing to buy in weekly? Do you think prices will get back down to those levels? I\u2019m worried that next week we\u2019ll have another \u201cbear market rally\u201d and prices won\u2019t get back down to where I\u2019m hoping.

It has also directly bounced off the 200MA which is good to see as well.\n\nMarket EOD was $18.xx or so, but VWAP is around $15\\~. Perhaps a good entry tomorrow for a long position will be if it returns to VWAP, but regarding the explosiveness and nature of the stock I'm also debating just buying ASAP with expiry for next week.\n\nAs for the strike price I'm looking at, I'm looking at around $25/26, which is where it peaked last time in early march.\n\n**Sentiment** \\- Talks about Americans getting used to the idea of having to wear masks. The thing is 3M, DuPont, etc. make PPE (personal protection equipment) but really APT has been sort of the front man of that for a while now. \n\nWith fear going to spike up again this week, I think it'll be good to get in and take a long. Plus volume was only 20 million today, so hasn't been \"discovered\" by the media yet. \n\nAny tips/advice for a newbie would be very beneficial.",

        "body": "Reasonable options, but they all have notable downfalls.\n\nOne of the big ones is that a centralized blockchain will never suffice to replace something like Visa.\n\nThe current international transaction rate of credit cards peaks around 25,000 per second (christmas eve of 2019) combining major brands (visa, mastercard, etc)\n\nCash is probably significantly higher than that worldwide.\n\nFor a currency to \"replace\" money or credit cards or banks, as the long-term stated goal of crypto enthusiasts, it has to scale to numbers on the order of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nBitcoin, Zcash and Monero as they are designed, are all fundamentally centralized public blockchains that implement various forms of anonymization for wallet transactions.  \n\nHowever, in reality, it's probably not practical for all nodes to know about all transactions everywhere in the world at all times.   That requirement fundamentally means that every node everywhere has to constantly consume 5-20mbps of incoming transaction data, 24/7/365 and that's assuming no significant growth in transaction volumes.\n\nEven with aggressive pruning of transactions, the volume of data to accurately summarize the net worth of 7 billion people plus their various businesses, teams, organizations, accounts and otherwise would be extraordinary (trillions of transactions, at least - possibly a petabyte of data).\n\nIn the current blockchain concept, any transactions that have any significant notable value to the network have to be recorded on this chain, or they can't be verified.  Concepts like lightening network on bitcoin can \"shard\" some of this off, but these side transactions are fundamentally unverified, and the money used in them is fundamentally locked out of the main wallet of anyone using these channels, making them practical for certain activities (say, buying some gum), but impractical for something like transacting your rent, or any other dollar value that you value.\n\nSome concepts of more broad global sharding of the main chain exist, but under \"proof of work\" that doesn't really work well without establishing \"trusted nodes\" to referee the sharding and that doesn't make the decentralization proponents happy.\n\nIt's probably possible to design something, maybe using a proof of stake system with stakeholders pooled into smaller shards, but that runs a greater risk of having network takeovers, unless you have a referee system that patrols for large movements of stakeholders into shards in order to pool stakes and subvert the voting system for monetary gain.\n\nIt's not a solved problem and no platform currently exists that could plausibly take over world currency transactions, or even a smaller credit card player like Discover, in terms of size and volume.\n\nProof of work, in my opinion, is a poor tech and while I play in crypto as a speculative instrument, I view it like a penny stock in a worthless industry from a true fundamentals perspective.\n\nBut that's just my educated opinion.",
