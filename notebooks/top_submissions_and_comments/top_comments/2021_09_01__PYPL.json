        "body": "Here is the funny thing. Alipay/Ant Group grew up within Alibaba and became China\u2019s largest payments processing company (think Mastercard, Visa, Paypal, and Stripe all in one). It was for many years one of the most valuable parts of Alibaba. Then, in 2011, **Alipay was stolen** from the US and European investors in Alibaba\u2019s VIE structure when the founder and CEO Jack Ma unilaterally transferred 100% ownership of Alipay into a different company controlled solely by himself.\n\nOne of the shareholders hurt was Yahoo who were a big early investor in the Alibaba VIE, amassing a 43% stake. Yet, despite that very substantial ownership, Yahoo did not even find out about the transaction until months later. When they discovered what had happened, they were of course outraged and launched into legal proceedings.\n\nHowever due to the VIE structure, Yahoo (and other shareholders alongside them) were powerless to do anything. They had no legal recourse. Yahoo owned 43% of the Alibaba VIE (BABA stock), so it did not technically own any portion of Alipay at all. What Yahoo legally owned was 43% of a shell corporation listed in the Cayman Islands that had some (unfortunately illegal) contracts with Alibaba. And when it came time to enforce those contracts. they were unsurprisingly unenforceable. Let us be very clear about exactly what happened: Jack Ma took a company worth billions of dollars directly from under the nose of thousands of US and European investors in the VIE, and there was nothing anyone could do about it.\n\nYet, despite this recent, brazen, and high-profile theft, along with many others like it, investors continue to invest in the Alibaba and other VIE stocks to this day. This is even though there is absolutely nothing preventing the same happening again. Western investors continue to eagerly invest billions in the very structure that has been proved to offer them no protection in the past. Do people never learn?!\n\nFrom: https://gci-investors.com/chinese-vie-structure-wall-street-continues-to-ignore-the-risks/",

As it gets easier and more common to pay by other methods (Venmo, zelle, PayPal, digital wallets, other forms of direct bank debit) the appeal of accepting credit cards decreases.\n\nIt\u2019s great to pay on a card and get rewards, by the merchants accepting those cards pay an interchange % (which is a bit more than your rewards in most cases). So from the merchant perspective they would much prefer a direct payment from your bank account or digital wallet and not have to pay interchange. The reason so many places accept credit card is because they would lose so much business if they didn\u2019t as there was no other convenient way to pay. However as that continues to change credit cards need to start thinking about fundamentally changing their business model or risk losing a big market share.",

        "body": "Yes great long term hold. \n\nSome people don\u2019t realize companies like PYPL/SQ still utilize V/MA as their payment networks partner. I look at FinTechs more so as partners with V/MA and not competitors. Unless one of these companies wanted to start their own payment network directly. \n\nBNPL (like Affirm) could take some of the credit card business but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some companies could start letting you even make installment payments via CC instead of direct ACH. I\u2019m sure people even use their debit cards, which are V/MA branded\n\nMy biggest concern is more regulation around payment networks and potential allowance of smaller networks to gain a piece of the pie. I read an article the other day how Australia may mandate low-cost debit card system for payments, which would allow banks to potentially utilize cheaper payment networks as opposed to V/MA (which are more expensive). I\u2019m still not overly concerned with this yet to make me back off my stance that both V/MA are great long term holds, but something to watch. \n\nOnce international travel comes back some post COVID, V/MA will shoot up as this is their bread and butter. That segment has still not really recovered yet from COVID and will be one of the last things that does.",

If there's a \"bug\" in the contract then the judge will say, \"well, that's fucking ridiculous - it was obviously not the intent of the parties forming the contract that the service be provided for free under these weird and specific set of conditions\" and order a sensible resolution. \n\nIn the real world, distributed trust isn't useful because it takes away the ability to assign blame or sue. Most people want a centralised authority to whom they can complain and get their money back. You see this every day with conventional banking, and with PayPal and eBay arbitrating disputes.

For example, did you know that options gains on spy are entirely short term and taxed out the ass, but if you are making a slightly bigger bet then use options on spx, which are taxed at 60% long term, 40% short term that\u2019s a big diff. little things make a big diff in your gains and over time can be the diff of 6 figures\n\nAlso, prob obvious but make your riskiest bets in tax sheltered accounts like a Roth, again the compounders over that time frame will save you a mind blowing amt on taxes. Think the hyper growth long term buys like shop, or Tsla over the last few years. These gains woulda been entirely tax sheltered\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget to build a solid long term portfolio and forget about it so you can retire early\u2026 Ma, Amzn, nvda, msft, v, now, unh, jpm, sq, pypl, hd, shop, tmo, adbe, pins\u2026 is the entirety of the fund I manage and I\u2019m comfortable holding each for minimum 2-5 years, many I\u2019ve owned for 5-10 years\u2026 Godspeed gents",
