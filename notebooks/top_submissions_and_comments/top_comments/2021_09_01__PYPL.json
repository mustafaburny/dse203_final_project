I put everything I care about in a separate watch list manually everyday. Gives me a chance to look at them as I do it. All green except LCID which is good as that is my lone short. And PTLR a little red. \n\nI did sell my PYPL shares and got a 1/23 $250 LEAP $66.58\n\nSold my Z shares and got 2 1/23 $90 LEAP $25.83 each\n\nWith some leftover funds, Said fuk it and got SDC 150 sh and 4 1/23 $5 LEAPS @ $2.50 each. \n\nplaying SKLZ. first time in long time I am in on meme and I usually just play them like I am this one w 250 sh and selling a couple 9/10 $15 CCs. \n\nForget who it was in here, but I did hop on w them PSFE w 150 sh and sold 2 $8 CSPs. \n\nPlaying LMND for earnings did 5 11/17 80/85 Call debit spreads since I was learning those. \n\nI posted all plays real time and added these today. Will pick up more NIO somehow. So easy to make money on that one under $40. \n\nThat\u2019s all I got today.\n\nGood luck!",

Big takeaway from the last 8k Form was his \u201cCorbett Clause\u201d. This company has so much potential. OTC stocks need P/R in order to survive. No volume almost guarantees the stock will regress negatively. That\u2019s been the case since April. $IPSI has invested in a P/R according to one of their early 4-K Form so hopefully that comes into fruition. He put his daughter on IPSI chair board as a high ranking member. The kiosks deployment has been delayed but the blame is due mostly to covid. One thing I can see Corbett did well is eliminate all the toxic debt. I\u2019m just worried he runs this stock up and dips. $IPSI has the potential to be the next PayPal and having William Corbett at the helm has raised more questions than answers in the shareholders eyes. Not to mention spelling mistakes on the website. This company is very early which is a good thing, they just need to clean up their errors",
