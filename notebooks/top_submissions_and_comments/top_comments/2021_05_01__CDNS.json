        "body": "So, I've been commenting on a lot of VG threads trying to get people to avoid throwing money away or at least try to do the math around the numbers, but have mostly failed. So I'm a huge VG bear and I have high conviction that they will go bankrupt or liquidate or sell for peanuts, but here are some possibilities:\n\n* If you look on their website, they clearly state that 250k was for early birds and if you sign up for waitlist, you most likely won't get that price. So 1.5 mil is a lower bound on revenue per flight.\n* They have 2 spaceships (Unity -- tested and Imagine -- untested) and have 2 more under construction. Burt Rutan's Xprize winner was able to relaunch in 2 weeks, it is plausible that 2 space ships can do 50 launches a year after they get the kinks out and 4 space ships can do 100 launches. Maybe more. I personally would be concerned about market size if they can get to that cadence. 100 launches per year at 2 million revenue per flight is 200 million per year. Not enough to justify current valuation and still not profitable -- especially considering that many launches will add to costs. They'll have to launch a lot more often or somehow cut costs or charge a lot more.\n* Their long term pivot business plan is point to point hypersonic transit. Good luck with that. They do have an advantage with their mothership-spaceship model in that they can launch from a population center without causing sonic boom issues in populated areas -- something Starship point-to-point has an issue with. Starship has to kludge it by saying there is going to be a transfer to an offshore platform. The problem with the mothership-spaceship model is it doesn't scale to larger ships and to get good margin, you need more passengers. Look at Stratolaunch and the size of that mothership -- largest plane in the world, it can't carry that big of a rocket -- no way of sending &gt; 100 people at a time.",

They could just return all the money to shareholders, but have you ever seen an organization do that? It isn't that simple. Board members that don't think they can accomplish the task would make more money by liquidating their stock at the current price -- which some have.\n\nRebuttal #2: You are right that SpaceX is in a different market. They can go orbital, which is cooler and lasts longer than 5 minutes -- but currently costs 10s of millions per seat. They will need starship to bring that down but if they can -- at similar prices, SPCE has no way of competing against that.\n\nBO is on the trajectory of doing orbital, but they currently have a comparable suborbital experience to SPCE and it's going to happen roughly at the same time (first paying customer in the summer). The existence of this will reduce SPCEs margins and market share.\n\nI'm not quite sure there will be enough people interested in a mid-6 digit cost 5-minute experience. Everyone is handwaving here. Even if there is, SPCE has an uphill battle in getting the cadence and margins up because of it's 6 passenger-per-flight model an hybrid engine. And it's not easy to scale for the future given SPCE's mothership-spaceship design.",
