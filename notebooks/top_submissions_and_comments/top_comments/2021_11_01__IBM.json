Thanks for the write up and you rightly point to the need for excellent commercial execution\n\nI think we should be very clear on who the peers are for $PLTR.  \n\nIn no way is $SNOW a peer. Snowflake is a next generation, true cloud database . It\u2019s a full SAAS model and it\u2019s extremely strong at data analytics (though it can do true database work in a pinch).   It\u2019s a general purpose tool that\u2019s very simple to start using and requires zero setup and almost zero support.  Competitors include Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery etc\n\nCompare this to $PLTR which is really an analysis / data integration platform that\u2019s highly customized to users (so far mostly government) and has historically had a huge consulting requirement to setup.  \n\n$Ddog is also not a good comparison as it is an application, stack and now database monitoring toolset.  \n\nSo, who are the good comparisons /competitors? IBM Watson springs to mind.  But probably the best i can think of that\u2019s publicly traded is Alteryx $AYX.  However Palantir is much \u201cheaver\u201d even that Alteryx\n\nAnyone have some better comp ideas?",

It\u2019s great you\u2019re seeing this trend, but it is nothing new, is fundamental to successful business at scale and is important to understanding both competition and the deflationary effects of technology.  \n\nLook at almost any business and you will see how it has been incrementally automated over the last 100 years.  It is necessary (not sufficient) to maintain as much automation or more than your competitors in order to scale and meet inevitable price deflation/\u201ccost efficiencies\u201d.  Think about the printing press to automate writing copies of books, IBM digital computers automating human \u201ccomputers\u201d (brilliant subplot of Hidden Figures movie), Xerox machines automating rapid copying of documents in the 70s/80s, email automating the postal service, industrial factory automation over the last 70 years, etc.\n\nThe rule for companies is they must adapt/evolve or die.  No other option unless you have a government-enforced monopoly (eg, patent protection or regulated utility).  \n\nWorkers face the same pressures, and their continually improving standard of living depends on it.  \n\n\nSource: am advisor to various Fortune 500 and tech companies, and my IP specialists help these companies find innovations used by competitors and other industries to stay ahead of the curve.",

        "body": "Hedge funds shorted gamestop. Hedge funds shorted gamestop to a degree where there were more shares out short than existed. This was problem number one. \n\nWhen you buy shares in your brokerage account like interactive brokers or ameritrade, you are technically buying from your broker. If your broker doesn't have the shares, he has to buy them from the market. This is usually fine, because whatever price your broker pays, your broker will charge you, for those shares. If you want to buy 100 shares of gamestop, and your broker doesn't have the shares, he will check the acquire the shares (with your money) from the national best ask. However, your broker now needs to wait 3 days for whoever he bought them from to deliver them. They are allowed up to 3 days to deliver the shares they sell you. \n\nAt the same time, huge volume of options were being traded in Gamestop. Tons of wsb apes bought options to the tune of 250 million shares. Only 50 million shares actually existed. Market makers and options sellers sold options to buy tons of shares because these market makers usually make tons of money selling options that expire worthless. Options brokers like Citadel sold tons of calls that they expected to expire worthless. If those calls expired in-the-money, Citadel (and others) would need to deliver 250 million shares to the people who purchased those options. Only 50 million shares existed. So now, not only did you have too many shares short (where everyone who was short was fucked), you also had options sellers effectively short (because the promised to deliver 250m shares that they didn't have).  \n\nThe options sellers needed to find 250m shares, Only 50m existed. The options buyers (normal folks on robinhood or ameritrade) were therefore owed 250m shares, but only 50m existed. If the options sellers could not deliver those shares, your broker (robinhood / ameritrade) would have been forced to go buy the shares on the open market. Remember, when you buy a call option, your counterparty is your broker. But your broker goes and gets it from somewhere else. Their counterparty is the options seller or the clearing house or somewhere else. If you buy a call option, you give your broker the $200, and he is your counterparty. But he takes your $200 and goes to citadel, and says \"Citadel gimme that option\" and Citadel says \"Ok, gimme the money\". Then it goes to the clearing houses for a few days for the trade to clear. \n\n money. Your broker (Robinhood) owes  you 100 shares. The options seller (Citadel) owes your broker (Robinhood) 100 shares. But they're trading through a clearinghouse, who has guaranteed the trade. So, if Citadel does not deliver the 100 shares to your broker, your broker has to deliver 100 shares to you anyway. He will need to go to the market and pay absolutely any price to get it. Your broker will then go to the clearinghouse and say \"You were supposed to give me 100 shares. You didn't. So I had to go buy it myself, again. You have to pay my bill\".  The clearinghouse will go to Citadel and say \"I was supposed to give 100 shares to Robinhood to give to Jimbob, but you never gave me the shares. Jimbob wanted his 100 shares. Robinhood had to pay $1000 for them. Robinhood wants me to cough up $1000. I just did. Now you need to cough up that $1000 to me.\"\n\nThis is the cascade. But remember, 250 MILLION shares were due to be delivered, and only 50 million existed. If the above situation happens on an IBM or a MSFT, it's probably not a big deal. The stock may rise 5-10% or something, but ultimately it's not an issue because there are plenty of shares available. But what if there are no shares available, and the people who own the shares refuse to sell at any price, and the options sellers MUST deliver the shares to teh clearinghouse so that they can deliver them to the brokers who can deliver them to the customers? What if the shares simply do not exist? \n\nNow you have a problem. Jimbob wants his shares. Robinhood tries to buy from the market, but there's almost zero available, and they sell for $10,000 per share. Robinhood cannot deliver the shares to their customers. Robinhood goes bankrupt, and goes to the clearinghouse and demands a solution. The clearinghouse goes bankrupt. The clearinghouse sues every counterparty to help deliver the shares. The counterparties go bankrupt. Citadel now can't repay any of their normal business operating debt, so the big banks lose billions. Stocks start tanking as everyone sells everything just so they can have cash to try to buy gamestop shares form the wsb apes who refuse to sell at any price. The market tanks, leading to any leveraged funds to go bankrupt. Etc etc etc.",

So all bad debt now going to that spinoff company\n\nThe real problem is that IBM has a longstanding, very successful managed IT services division. 30 years ago that was high margin, but now it is low margin. And now they're more focused on cloud services. These units are directly competing. And it creates confusion for existing customers. By spinning off the old-school part of the IT consulting services, they clarify things a lot. It can be awkward to negotiate contracts when you're competing with yourself. And the industry has moved strongly to \"hybrid cloud,\" with multi-vendor support, so they can get more money from the managed infrastructure clients in the spinoff, where those clients might choose some other cloud provider. And IBM can stay focused on being a cloud and AI provider.\n\nKyndryl isn't full of debt it is just low-margin and contains a lot of harmful redundancy that may thrive separately.\n\nIBM has been doing major partnerships for almost 100 years, they're not the sort of company that creates a bunch of debt they can't pay and have to stuff in a suitcase. Check their credit rating.\n\nThe Palo Alto deal sounds really good, that could be a big winner for both. The Cisco deal will likely be irrelevant unless Cisco finds a better angle for a 5G play. The Boston Dynamics thing may be pretty good, but it is always hard to tell with BD if it is just going to result in nice videos. The Raytheon thing is good for Raytheon in the short term, and in the very-unlikely event that quantum computing actually impacts computer security in the next 100 years, it will help them both to have a working relationship in place.\n\nIBM has a lot of other stuff going on too. They recently signed a deal to take over Honda's European finance and procurement operations. They've been \"global allies\" with Deloitte for over 20 years are going to offer a new AI-backed anti-fraud service to governments, for example to identify tax fraud.\n\nMost of what they do flies under the radar, but they've got a lot going on, and the extra free cash flow they'll get from spinning off the legacy IT will really help them.",

Maybe the name Howard Hughes says something to you.\nI realize that it looks fantastic now, but at one point we've also thought that about Microsoft, and all of a sudden Apple and Google have overtaken them left and right for making some failed decisions. \nBatterywise their competitors are already at their level. And Waymo is strong too. It's really just the car companies that need to get there shit together.\n\nThey look good, cause the other car manufacturers were old dinosaurs. Like what MS or Apple were to Compaq and IBM. But new players are always joining the market and change things too.",

        "body": "These are both risky because they have a lot of expectations built in. For example, the price rise that NVDA got out of the ARM acquisition announcement presumes that they intend to behave in a monopolistic way, and can squeeze that market without vendors switching to RISC-V. And that the won't receive any significant regulatory response. Otherwise, the acquisition price makes no financial sense at all, it is just tossing money out the window. \n\nINTC has similar problems. People are bullish because they're building a fab. When they tried to contract out use of their existing fabs in the past, they did very poorly at it; they were greedy, they were unwilling to offer competitive prices. And when people wouldn't pay a premium just to have the honor of being their customer, they discontinued the service instead of lowering prices. And they made a lot of excuses about what had happened.\n\nBasically none of that is going to find its way into either technical or fundamental analysis. That is why I don't touch either of these stocks, and I prefer companies like AMD, AMAT, and even IBM. (What I like about IBM is that the bear case has been very popular, everybody can say something bad about them, and yet they're doing a great job of integrating their AI tools with the cloud and providing quality APIs to developers; and they're doing that while maintaining high margins and large revenue)",

This one is a good overview but it focuses more on futures but the stuff is generally applicable to stocks as well: \"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications\". Use z-lib or some other book pirating sites\n* Try and stay away from price action because that's the most suspect of all technical analysis. On the other hand, algorithmic/system trading is arguably the most rigorous of technical analysis based strategies.\n\nIf you want to learn about fundamental analysis\n\n* Learn about multipliers and other fundamentals e.g. P/E, EBITA, EV.\n* Learn how to make financial models e.g. Here's Martin Shkreli teaching how to build a financial model with IBM as an example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fASInVKShnM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fASInVKShnM) (disclaimer, I think this particular valuation turned out to be wrong so focus more on the techniques/models used rather than specifics about the companies) and here's DeepFuckingValue valuing GME [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U). I think they make this type of dry stuff more \"accessible\" for the average person?\n* Read some books. I've heard intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham is good, although I haven't read it so see what the others here think\n\nBut honestly, just buy ETFs and save enough to retire.",

        "body": "We are talking multiple years here if not decades. Companies like Exxon. a.) They are in a dying industry and have been unsuccessful in pivoting away from fossil fuels to alternative sources of revenue. b.) They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",
