        "body": "&gt;Quantum computing in the near future will usher in huge advances in technology and perhaps transform how we go about our daily lives for the better. The unfortunate part of our quantum future is that when quantum computing arrives, current encryption methods keeping all of our information safe, will fail. This is not a question of if, it is of when. The Global Risk Institute released a report titled \"Quantum Threat Timeline\" in 2019 which polled 22 leading data scientists on the forecasted timetable for a quantum computer to break current encryption standards. The consensus at the time was around 15 years, or 2034. Since that report was released, the quantum computing market has experienced a massive surge of investment with incredibly fast progress reported from companies around the globe, several, such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Rigetti Computing and Honeywell (HON) already have broken past 100 qubits, with a rapid doubling of capability shown.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;For reference, a recent article from Cornell University shows that PKI encryption (the current industry standard) may require as little as 2,000 logical qubits to break, making the timeline for current encryptions' obsolescence disturbingly close, likely in the 2025-2030 time frame, with governments such as the USA, UK, China and Russia likely well ahead of that date. A troubling trend noted recently by nation-state actors is to \"harvest now, decrypt later\" which is the term for stealing encrypted data from hardened sources today and then store the data to decrypt when the technology is available.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;It has even been theorized that the entire blockchain that cryptocurrencies depend on may be at risk of total hijack or collapse once quantum computers reach maturity. This trend makes it critically important for nations to migrate away from PKI encryption as soon as possible to symmetric encryption keys. The biggest problem currently with symmetric key encryption is that you need to have a way to get the key to the other party with whom you are sharing the data. Arqit believes that it has a solution for this critical problem that is completely computationally secure, which means it cannot be broken by any current or future machine, along with a delivery system that cannot be intercepted via the quantum cloud. The key to this entire technology's eventual adoption is that the algorithm used is already the global standard (AES), meaning that it is operable with current systems, giving users no logical reason to not adopt the technology.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;The technology Arqit invented is covered by over 1,400 patent claims making this company and its technology potentially protected from copycats looking to set up similar business models for some time to come. The commercial strategy also appears to be very well thought out, with the software downloaded by customers and used automatically. Billing events are created by usage via commercial customers with key creation events being metered. The brilliance of this strategy is the incredibly low capex Arqit has to expend once the core infrastructure is in place, as the software needed is basically zero touch.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;With current systems operating on a compatible format, ultimately every connected device is a potential customer of Arqit without the need of the company building any further infrastructure as the 2 planned and paid for satellites used are able to generate two quadrillion unique keys per year. To get an idea of the explosive potential of this company, please keep in mind that the below pipeline and business development was accomplished all in 2021, with only 2 dedicated salespeople, one being the CEO [himself.To](https://himself.to/) land executed, recurring and framework contracts with the likes of the British Government, British Telecom (OTCPK:BTGOF), Sumitomo Corporation (OTCPK:SSUMF) ESA and Dentons in addition to an \"unnamed\" major payment network, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Iridium (IRDM), Verizon (VZ) and BP (BP) accomplished pre hard rollout is unbelievably impressive and gives credibility to the massive potential ahead for the company.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;During recent analyst conferences before the de-SPAC event, the CEO has reported massively increased interest in the product well before any ramp up in sales and marketing efforts by the company. Generally I do not like to discuss financial projections generated from the SPAC process as many companies simply throw hopes and dreams into a blender to come up with these. However, given the solid and proven pipeline of customers Arqit has signed already and the fact that the service is already live give me enough confidence to share the company's 2025 projections.With Arqit, I really have to control my enthusiasm a bit, not only does the company appear to have a scalable solution to a massive problem affecting nearly every sector around the globe, but the company also has a way of doing it that is low capex and very high margin.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;In addition, the company having expended basically zero sales effort to date, has secured $130 million in guaranteed revenues from A list customers with a high probability of closing a $1.1 billion backlog pipeline already. The CEO indicated in the recent investor day that in his 30 years of sales experience, he has never had any product like Arqit's and that his closing percentage is nearly 100%. If Arqit even comes close to the financial projections they have presented, which the CEO notes is a very conservative projection, then the company could be worth many multiples of the current $2.1\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;billion market cap. It also would appear, counter to many of the recent SPAC IPOs, that dilution should not be an issue going forward. In the SPAC transaction, the company has received $376 million in cash to the balance sheet, to which the CEO recently commented that the deal brought it \"twice the money that we need to fully fund our business\" and that \"We don't need to raise any more money, ever,\" he told CNBC. In late August I purchased a moderately sized speculative position in the SPAC. My only hesitancy in purchasing more is that generally, when a company seems to have a no-brainer, hugely profitable solution to a massive problem, red flags tend to appear.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;So far, I have not found any true red flags with Arqit, but as I am not a cybersecurity expert, I will be keeping my position moderately sized until at least a few quarters have run off and I gain a greater comfortability with the progress of the technology and management. I am very excited to see how this company develops as it would appear they may have solved a truly massive problem that nearly all NATO countries have been losing sleep over for years, before it actually existed. If they are successful in the product roll out, shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely.

        "body": "Hedge funds shorted gamestop. Hedge funds shorted gamestop to a degree where there were more shares out short than existed. This was problem number one. \n\nWhen you buy shares in your brokerage account like interactive brokers or ameritrade, you are technically buying from your broker. If your broker doesn't have the shares, he has to buy them from the market. This is usually fine, because whatever price your broker pays, your broker will charge you, for those shares. If you want to buy 100 shares of gamestop, and your broker doesn't have the shares, he will check the acquire the shares (with your money) from the national best ask. However, your broker now needs to wait 3 days for whoever he bought them from to deliver them. They are allowed up to 3 days to deliver the shares they sell you. \n\nAt the same time, huge volume of options were being traded in Gamestop. Tons of wsb apes bought options to the tune of 250 million shares. Only 50 million shares actually existed. Market makers and options sellers sold options to buy tons of shares because these market makers usually make tons of money selling options that expire worthless. Options brokers like Citadel sold tons of calls that they expected to expire worthless. If those calls expired in-the-money, Citadel (and others) would need to deliver 250 million shares to the people who purchased those options. Only 50 million shares existed. So now, not only did you have too many shares short (where everyone who was short was fucked), you also had options sellers effectively short (because the promised to deliver 250m shares that they didn't have).  \n\nThe options sellers needed to find 250m shares, Only 50m existed. The options buyers (normal folks on robinhood or ameritrade) were therefore owed 250m shares, but only 50m existed. If the options sellers could not deliver those shares, your broker (robinhood / ameritrade) would have been forced to go buy the shares on the open market. Remember, when you buy a call option, your counterparty is your broker. But your broker goes and gets it from somewhere else. Their counterparty is the options seller or the clearing house or somewhere else. If you buy a call option, you give your broker the $200, and he is your counterparty. But he takes your $200 and goes to citadel, and says \"Citadel gimme that option\" and Citadel says \"Ok, gimme the money\". Then it goes to the clearing houses for a few days for the trade to clear. \n\n money. Your broker (Robinhood) owes  you 100 shares. The options seller (Citadel) owes your broker (Robinhood) 100 shares. But they're trading through a clearinghouse, who has guaranteed the trade. So, if Citadel does not deliver the 100 shares to your broker, your broker has to deliver 100 shares to you anyway. He will need to go to the market and pay absolutely any price to get it. Your broker will then go to the clearinghouse and say \"You were supposed to give me 100 shares. You didn't. So I had to go buy it myself, again. You have to pay my bill\".  The clearinghouse will go to Citadel and say \"I was supposed to give 100 shares to Robinhood to give to Jimbob, but you never gave me the shares. Jimbob wanted his 100 shares. Robinhood had to pay $1000 for them. Robinhood wants me to cough up $1000. I just did. Now you need to cough up that $1000 to me.\"\n\nThis is the cascade. But remember, 250 MILLION shares were due to be delivered, and only 50 million existed. If the above situation happens on an IBM or a MSFT, it's probably not a big deal. The stock may rise 5-10% or something, but ultimately it's not an issue because there are plenty of shares available. But what if there are no shares available, and the people who own the shares refuse to sell at any price, and the options sellers MUST deliver the shares to teh clearinghouse so that they can deliver them to the brokers who can deliver them to the customers? What if the shares simply do not exist? \n\nNow you have a problem. Jimbob wants his shares. Robinhood tries to buy from the market, but there's almost zero available, and they sell for $10,000 per share. Robinhood cannot deliver the shares to their customers. Robinhood goes bankrupt, and goes to the clearinghouse and demands a solution. The clearinghouse goes bankrupt. The clearinghouse sues every counterparty to help deliver the shares. The counterparties go bankrupt. Citadel now can't repay any of their normal business operating debt, so the big banks lose billions. Stocks start tanking as everyone sells everything just so they can have cash to try to buy gamestop shares form the wsb apes who refuse to sell at any price. The market tanks, leading to any leveraged funds to go bankrupt. Etc etc etc.",

AMD kicked their buts with their CPUs.

They could turn it around and become an amazing company again, but my sense is that they need to really innovate very quickly in order not to lose any more market / relevance.\n\nHappy to be challenged on my thoughts.\n\nFor the last 20 years or so I have been jumping between Intel and AMD CPUs.\n\nBefore 2004, Intel probably.\n2004 - 2008 AMD\n2008 - 2018 Intel\n2018 - AMD\n\nAMD were dead around 2014 and they turned it around.

I think $130-$170 is a realistic P.T. for DOCN over the next few years unless they have some blow out quarter.\n\nCloudFlare is uniquely positioned among cloud with a unique product line, including leading on serverless / edge computing.\n\nDigital Ocean is competing on VMs which is a margin business. The question is, how large is the niche for an easier-to-use cloud for hobbyist and smaller scale web applications? They already have a million users. How many developers are out there?

So all bad debt now going to that spinoff company\n\nThe real problem is that IBM has a longstanding, very successful managed IT services division. 30 years ago that was high margin, but now it is low margin. And now they're more focused on cloud services. These units are directly competing. And it creates confusion for existing customers. By spinning off the old-school part of the IT consulting services, they clarify things a lot. It can be awkward to negotiate contracts when you're competing with yourself. And the industry has moved strongly to \"hybrid cloud,\" with multi-vendor support, so they can get more money from the managed infrastructure clients in the spinoff, where those clients might choose some other cloud provider. And IBM can stay focused on being a cloud and AI provider.\n\nKyndryl isn't full of debt it is just low-margin and contains a lot of harmful redundancy that may thrive separately.\n\nIBM has been doing major partnerships for almost 100 years, they're not the sort of company that creates a bunch of debt they can't pay and have to stuff in a suitcase. Check their credit rating.\n\nThe Palo Alto deal sounds really good, that could be a big winner for both. The Cisco deal will likely be irrelevant unless Cisco finds a better angle for a 5G play. The Boston Dynamics thing may be pretty good, but it is always hard to tell with BD if it is just going to result in nice videos. The Raytheon thing is good for Raytheon in the short term, and in the very-unlikely event that quantum computing actually impacts computer security in the next 100 years, it will help them both to have a working relationship in place.\n\nIBM has a lot of other stuff going on too. They recently signed a deal to take over Honda's European finance and procurement operations. They've been \"global allies\" with Deloitte for over 20 years are going to offer a new AI-backed anti-fraud service to governments, for example to identify tax fraud.\n\nMost of what they do flies under the radar, but they've got a lot going on, and the extra free cash flow they'll get from spinning off the legacy IT will really help them.",

This can be fixed by spending a bigger share of the profits on capex and buying a lot of these advanced EUV machines themselves and that is exactly what they are going to do and what pissed of some investors. Intel announced they will be the first to receive the next iteration of even more advanced EUV machines soon.\n\nBy being a foundry Intel can use all their IP for their customers. This will give them an advantage over TSMC and Samson for a sizable chunk of the market. Simply because they can throw in this IP so customers can design product only intel can make. Their packaging techniques are not the same as those of TSMC and at least a sizable share of the market will benefit from these. I'm not going to claim they will steamroll TSMC but they will be able to take market share. It's a new market. It will be the same as AMD doubling their data center business by taking a few percentages of market share from Intel. In the foundry business TSMC will be like Intel and Intel will be like AMD.\n\nAs a foundry you can make whatever the client designs. Intel clearly stated they will go for a mix and match strategy where clients can combine external IP like ARM with Intel IP like packaging or networking. X86 will always have a place but Intel clearly accepted that it's not only x86 anymore and they are adapting.",

With dividend and buybacks combined they return aboud 7% per year if their revenue of profits wouldn't increase which they almost certainly will.\n\nSamsung makes most of it's money from it's foundy business and retail electronics. If it's foundry business' orders decrease they can fill up the remaining space with their own needs. (same as intel)\n\nTsmc is the real leader in the industry with customers having reserved all capacity for years ahead.\n\nFor price targets i would recomend [this DFCF tool](https://tracktak.com/dashboard).

Everyone else in this thread is advising to buy more meme stocks, id say take any profits you've made and walk away, eventually people will need their money that's tied up in those and you don't want to be a bag holder. MSFT is probably the safest and most solid tech company right now with the best credit, and tons of cash, etc, etc basically hard to find weak spots. If this person really wants serious advice I'd say count your blessings and get out of the meme stocks and into lower risk, maybe some etfs. There are a lot of sectors that were ignored that are poised to do well. If you really want individual stocks maybe NOK or RYAAY. Those are in a similar risk/reward range to their current portfolio but with a little more stability.",

        "body": "If you don't understand the risks, you don't understand the company. I'm not getting  spoon fed my opinions from online articles, I'm a software developer intimately familiar with Intels problems over the last few years.\n\nWe can ignore that they've fallen so far behind in process, and assume new CEO PatG is going to fix that by throwing tens of billions in new capex at it. So higher PP&amp;E costs but hey, they have the cash flow to support it. \n\nAnd we can ignore that TSMC and others are investing even higher amounts in maintaining their process lead, including in US based (Arizona) manufacturing.\n\nLastly lets ignore that AMD has been eating market share over the last decade and is positioned to maintain or grow x86 market share in the future.\n\nBut it's hard to ignore that Intel is losing probably their best PC customer, Apple. Apple never bought from AMD, always Intel, and always Intels higher end CPUs where it makes it's best margins. Last year Apple was likely close to 10% of Intels PC CPU business (not counting chromebooks which buy super cheap shitty CPUs).\n\nThis is only starting to show up in Intels financials. Apple moved their lowest end Macbooks and Mini to Apple Silicon in December of last year, just moved low end iMacs this summer, and now is moving all high end MacBooks to Apple Silicon right now. High end iMacs and Mac Pros get their Apple Silicon by mid next year and it's over, Intel permanently loses over 20M higher end CPU sales a year.\n\nBut worse is that Apple's M1x is not only faster than the fastest of Intel's new Alder Lake CPUs, its offering that performance at  roughly 1/3 the power draw and less than half the cost. Each of those new high end MacBook Pros would have had $500 Alder Lake CPUs (actually they would have been delayed till 2022 till Intel had volume) but TSMC is building Apple's M1x Pro and Max for $150-$250.\n\nYou might say, who cares? Apple was only 8% of PC market by units, even though those were all high end. Microsoft cares. Dell cares. Lenova cares. Now they have to go toe to toe with Apple MBPs that aren't just as fast or faster at the same price points, they are offering double the battery life, and run super cool.\n\nMicrosoft already sells the Surface X using an ARM processor. Their ARM processor sucks, but Apple Silicon has just given them the blueprint for fixing that. They are working on their \"Microsoft Silicon\" higher performance PC ARM processor as I write this. As is Samsung, Qualcomm, etc, etc. They can't sit buy and bleed sales to Apple because Intel's CPUs are too hot, too expensive and use too much power.\n\nSo these things are going to take a while, and unless Intel figures out how to take the cruft out of x86 to make it run far cooler and with lower power at the same performance levels, the ARM trend will continue to pick up speed and market share. Catch x86 up in process size is only one aspect of the ARM lead, on equal process sizes x86 is still at a big disadvantage in power consumption, maybe 2 to 1 instead of 3 to 1, but still big.\n\nBut the even bigger near term threat is to Intels' dominance in servers. Amazon's ARM based server architecture has huge advantages. It doesn't offer anywhere near the same level of single CPU performance, but that matters little to the vast majority of server customers. Instead it offers far more performance per dollar and because it uses so much less power it generates far less heat, meaning more can be packed into server rooms. This has led to some of the highest growth rates the industry has seen in decades, and it's already at 10% in one measure of cloud computering.\n\n[https://www.techpowerup.com/275971/aws-arm-based-graviton-processors-sees-the-biggest-growth-in-instance-share](https://www.techpowerup.com/275971/aws-arm-based-graviton-processors-sees-the-biggest-growth-in-instance-share)\n\nIt's a real risk that ARM based server architectures could have over 50% of cloud server installs in 5 years. That would gut Intel's biggest CPU market.\n\nSo no catch phrases, just some very real, and some very likely risks.",

Chip shortages are already starting to subside and the new fabs won't be in production for another year or two and the US govt is going to be throwing a bunch of money at it as well.",
