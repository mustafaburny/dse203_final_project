This is to achieve greater speed. And all of this is being driven by the slow-down of Moore's law. Xilinx (XLNX), on the other hand, is making a contrarian bet here, betting that eventually programmable standardized chips will gain market share over app-specific chips. \n\nAnother big item right now is that chip makers are combining their product with software to create platforms. There was one great IEEE article on this.\n\n \"\\[\u2026\\] the flood of new AI chips, each one faster and more specialized than the next, will also seem like a throwback to the rise of enterprise software. We can expect cut-throat sales deals and software specialization aimed at locking developers into working with just one vendor. Imagine if, 15 years ago, the cloud services AWS, Azure, Box, Dropbox, and GCP all came to market within 12 to 18 months. Their mission would have been to lock in as many businesses as possible\u2014because once you\u2019re on one platform, it\u2019s hard to switch to another. This type of end-user gold rush is about to happen in AI, with tens of billions of dollars, and priceless research, at stake. Chipmakers won\u2019t be short on promises, and the benefits will be real. But it\u2019s important for AI developers to understand that new chips that require new architectures could make their products slower to market\u2014even with faster performance. In most cases, AI models are not going to be portable between different chip makers. Developers are well aware of the vendor lock-in risk posed by adopting higher-level cloud APIs, but in the past, the actual compute substrate has been standardized and homogeneous. This situation is going to change dramatically in the world of AI development. \\[\u2026\\] As specialized AI chips come to market, the current chip giants and major cloud companies will probably strike exclusive deals or acquire top performing startups. This trend will fragment the AI market rather than unifying it.\" \n\nThere really is a ton of money being thrown into start-ups. Looking at those companies can give you a good idea of where the technology is heading. Just take a look at the chip being offered by Cerberus.",

        "body": "People are going to talk shit because this is wsb and half the retards here are bored 18 year olds trading in their middle school bedroom as their fall semester eventually kicks off from home. \n\nBut you're 100% right. I've been in wsb since 2014. First as a lurker and then I used to spend hours here daily. It became a big distraction for me throughout medical school almost causing me to drop out. Even this past year I'd stopped trading as I got married, graduated and started working as a medical resident, and in Feb dumped 3k in as markets tanked , yoloed it into 80, and tried yoloing it more losing a good most of it. Made me laugh. Some things never change. Couple years I took square/mu calls from 2k to 80 in a week. Did I withdraw? Ofc not. No lessons learned. \n\nI've also seen wsb turn into what used to celebrate losing culture as much as winning into a win-only forum that barely glorifies/pretends losses exist anymore. Anything that gets wsb publicised is wins, half the posts are fake or guys with mega accounts posting their play money Tesla calls so they can jerk off as college kids drool at their portfolios. What got me into wsb was that kid who made 50 grand back in 2015. We have ppl posting those plays every ten minutes here now. \n\nFrom March -may I spent a lot of time here and felt myself getting sucked back in as markets swayed but decided to kick the habit again and check out wsb a couple times a week, and remember why I'm not as into it as I used to be. I've talked to others much smarter than me who made millions, used to post here, got bored felt incomplete and found meaning elsewhere. \n\nAt the end of the day my stupid bets paid off like almost 200k of med school but the amount of money I had to hide/pretend I didn't have (which was complicated because unfortunately my parents had to be involved in my tax filing for certain reasons), and how desensitized I got to losing 10-20k in minutes opened my eyes to how I was changing negatively here and needed some introspection. While it helped pay for school, it almost lost me relationships as I prioritized trading over friends/family. Trading hours turned into checking when futures opened turned into checking Eurasian markets before bed turned into waking up to checking premarkets..... If you have an addictive personality like me, Just be careful. This community is humorous, supportive, and often welcoming when you feel others don't understand you. But be aware.  \n\nAs a medical resident now I'm making like 55-60k a year working 80 hour weeks, my schedule fucks me, my life is a constant stress, but I have meaning and happiness in treating patients that I never had before despite the laughable like $5 per hour salary.  Just encourage you to find meaning in something you do separate from this. \n\nTldr: no one will read this it's too long.",

They all have room to run. (Maybe 10-20%) \nI\u2019d put a gigantic sum into MSFT (like 15-20% of my portfolio) and then throw the rest into runners. \n\nReddit darlings are: SPOT, PYPL, ADBE, SE, NET, FSLY, LVGO, DDOG, BABA, MU, AMD, CRWD, V, M, JPM, INTC, NVDA, SPLK (splunk idr the exact callsign), AVGO, MELI, CRM, TTD, DOCU, SHOP, etc. all pretty pricy shares but I believe in all of those companies. AMZN is a near must buy but it\u2019s something like $3000 now lol. \n\nSome smaller cap stocks I\u2019m bullish on are DKNG, AVCT, APPS, KLR, maybe get yourself an EV they\u2019re all the rage now idk \n\nAlso look into a REIT possibly. \n\nThat\u2019s if you want to be active investing \nIf you want to be passive just go 60/40 ETF/Stock and throw it all into an array of ETFs and then MSFT or whatever",

There is no way, any of your calculations put MU under a fair price of  60$. And even others elevate that number.\n\nMay be it takes 1 month, may be one year. But MU is gonna be at 60$ soon.

Now, that's in a very small controlled environment which has super high airflow you can feel it blowing on your face when you work in it. Whole rooms are much harder to keep clean. We have trouble keeping out ISO 7 room at that level and they don't even test down to 0.1 microns. Testing stops at 0.5 microns for a whole room environments where we are concerned with bacterial/fungal contamination of drugs that will be directly injected into humans. \n\nwe've got retards spouting technical specifications designed by manufacturers to give the best number possible so they can tell consumers how good their filters are. in the real world, nobody uses HEPA filters for that purpose because they don't work. no medical professional thinks their hepa filter stops viruses. we aren't retarded regardless of what a manufacturer says we also have the data that shows they are full of shit because we are required by law to know these numbers.",

I think NVDA will hit saturation unless they show a real compelling reason for their ARM product.\n\nFor manufacturer I only know TSM.

I\u2019ve been holding ever since, but it has barely been discussed on /r/stocks since. I\u2019m still about 10% in the hole from my initial investment. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if this company still has the fundamentals and growth potential that was once seemingly guaranteed in these forums.",
