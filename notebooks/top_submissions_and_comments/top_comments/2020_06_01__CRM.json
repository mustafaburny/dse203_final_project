So here is the story I want to share with you all.\n\n-80% to +40% lifetime swapping from mostly bear to mostly bull recently.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Q3xvUK7](https://imgur.com/a/Q3xvUK7)\n\nI joined both WSB and Robinhood a little over 3 months ago during the  whole SPCE TO THE MOON!!! period and made some modest gains (that teeny  tiny bump at the start) and proceeded to baghold too long and sell for a  loss. Then after a series of bad plays (again, holding too long) and  mistimed puts,  I started pouring more and more money in to try to  recoup the losses but kept losing. What started as a deposit of my \\~$600  tax return to play around with became a $13k nightmare.\n\nAnyway,  eventually I went full bull at the bottom, and was able to recover it  all much quicker than I lost it. At peak, I was down -80% all time and  from yesterday to today alone, I went from -38% to +40%. I'll be cashing  out my initial investment + a bit extra so it's all play money from  here.\n\nPositions that won big:\n\nRTX, SPY, FB, ACB, DKNG, NAT **calls**\n\nPositions that lost big:\n\nUSO, NAT, AL, CHGG **calls**\n\nSNAP, AAPL, GILD, CHGG, CRM, SPY **puts**\n\nWhat I learned:\n\n\\- Don't chase dips you aren't VERY confident about\n\n\\- Usually but not always inverse WSB\n\n\\- Don't bet against America",

        "body": "TL;DR: As an investor, here is what you are betting on if you decide to invest in Snowflake.\n\n  1. Data analysis is going to be important more than ever to get competitive advantage as a company. Data is the new oil as they say.\n  2. Big companies spent and continue to spend billions to build their data analytics platform (and now selling these to other big names and SMEs)\n  3. Other big names and SMEs will need to spend some of their revenue on analytics to better understand their customers and improve their products/services\n  4. They will look for a cheap, easy to use analytics platform that integrates well with known apps, tools, technologies and platforms that they have been using, such as Google Sheets/Excel, relational databases, text files, salesforce, you name it.\n  5. Snowflake will be the go-to platform for these needs and my investment will grow fast with the company.\n\nNow read the rest if you are bored and want to get bored even more.\nSome facts first:\n\n  * There are two major types of databases: transactional and analytical. Analytical data often comes from transactional data after it is transformed, enriched, joined etc.\n\n  * Snowflake is an analytical database.\n\n  * Amazon and Microsoft provide both types of databases on their respective platforms, AWS and Azure. \n\nSo, as a company if your enterprise apps are hosted on AWS it makes sense to use their transactional database, called Aurora, for your apps. If you are on Azure, the equivalent would be SQL Server. **Snowflake replaces neither of these.**\n\nNow, if you also want to invest in data analysis as a company (because this is where you get competitive advantage), then you hire a few data engineers/analysts/scientists and provide them an analytics platform. The database component of that platform has to be an analytical database and that is where Snowflake shines. \n\nAs stated in the quote you shared, your data engineer pulls large amounts of data across multiple cloud platforms (mostly transactional databases but also other online services like SAP, Salesforce, Google Analytics etc) and puts it in an analytical database. Then your analyst/scientist analyzes it. For a company, if they are already using AWS or Azure it makes sense to get the analytical database from the same platform (for compatibility, support etc), namely Redshift in AWS and Data Warehouse (what a boring name) in Azure. \n\nThis is another area where Snowflake continues to shine. See, they built their platform on the shoulders of giants: AWS and Azure. Behind the scenes, they actually use these platforms to store and process your data. This is a very wise decision because:\n\n  * it enables them to scale without any additional work\n  * it makes it easier for companies to switch to Snowflake as if it is a native component of those platforms. \n  * it makes the service very cheap from the day 1\n  * they pose as an ally to the giants rather than a rival that needs to be crushed before it steals too much of their share. It is win-win-win scenario.\n\nOn top of all these, they have built an excellent platform which any data engineer/analyst/scientist would be pleased to use.",

A little more reading on Snowflake led me to a podcast called Rise of the Data Cloud where the CEO of Snowflake was talking about how all these tech companies collect obscene amounts of data, but all that data is kept in each individual's company's realm. Snowflake developed or is working on a platform to make all that data compatible and interchangeable between companies or individuals. Pretty interesting stuff. I started looking to see what kind of funds were holding Salesforce stock, and that led me to Information Technology sector funds. The same funds that hold Salesforce also  hold Apple, Microsoft, VISA, Mastercard, Adobe, and other very large companies. I bought some VGT at Vanguard.",

I\u2019m around the same age, like having MSFT, AAPL, etc as a solid base to anchor my portfolio but it could be said that you may just take that money and invest in QQQ instead of even owning the individual companies.  Personally, I think you have opportunity to add more companies like SQ to your portfolio.  Growth companies that are already established but still growing exponentially.  They don\u2019t carry the risks of INO or SPCE but I would say probably more upside over the next 5 years.  Get rid of any old tech like Intel or Cisco etc and add some of their newer counterparts.  \n\nSome decent ones to add to the watchlist that i like: AYX, TTD, CRM, DT, GH and i believe PINS and ROKU have pretty significant upside from here as well.

Good known quality companies that have a chance of growth still. In this case, maybe the impending 5G stocks, any medical related to tele-medical work, tech companies that operate largely in the remote technologies. \nExamples: Verizon/ATT/Nokia/Livongo/Teladoc/Cisco/Disney/.. companies like that. You could even take a few grand from your savings account and throw it into a growth stock that has a dividend (which would return more per year than your pitiful savings account). Could always try emerging technologies too, like green energy, electric cars (Nikola) as growth stocks.\n\n2. Pennystocks for the \"pump and dump\" like you read here as well. Cheap stocks that run anywhere under $5 or so.. usually in this subreddits case, $2 and under, hope i hits $2.20+, and you have a few hundred shares, sell, and take your profit. Do not look for a $2 stock to hit $100 and make you richer than Richie. That happens over a real long time, and hardly ever. Dont hold too long.\n\nI've been taking my pennystock profits and putting them into longer term growth stocks. So far so good. \n\nBy the way - almost every hyped up stock I have seen posted about here in the last few months immediately dropped. When this thread was posted the stock was approx $1.24 .. it's now trading at $1.12",

It happened to own through acquisition a company called Palm, which made the original Palm Pilot and was developing the world\u2019s first smartphone. \nI knew a lot about Palm and bought 3Com calls. \n\n3Com decided to spin Palm off and goes to Goldman, who tells them to just release 30 million shares and keep the rest to keep demand higher than supply. This is at the top of the tech bubble. I keep buying calls. The Palm roadshow goes great and it\u2019s one of the hottest IPOs ever because Goldman is keeping most of the shares locked in  3Com, probably doing the same play I am.\n\nThe first week in March 2000 my calls rise $200,000 in three days Monday to Wednesday. Palm goes public on Thursday and by 11 o\u2019clock the embedded value of the Palm stock in 3Com is worth more than 3Com, which is logically impossible. \n\nAnyhow, I\u2019m a millionaire for the first time and realize shit, if I sell these calls I\u2019ll be paying $200,000 in taxes, maybe I can exercise and convert.

This is going to dip closer to a dollar and be between the $1-$2 range for awhile until their cash flows go up.

Your point is spot on - CTS goes after small and medium size enterprises while IBM will go after the Fortune 500. It is purely a reseller model...but the company's main focus is converting these clients into more software. \n\nA lot of the targets they acquire are usually product specific - they end up selling a ton of Cisco or a ton of Dell without much overlap. But if they are selling Cisco, it's not as if their clients aren't buying Dell products also. That's the value prop that they pitch when they acquire targets - we are going to give you the tools to sell everything your clients want and need and your clients will love that they will not have multiple vendors. So effectively cross-selling is a huge selling point for the targets. \n\nWith respect to Red Hat, IBM is actually giving Converge market development funds to pursue these markets effectively throwing their full weight behind them. \n\nAnd yes, 700m and still on the Venture...not something you see every day. I am pretty confident they will uplist to the TSX within the year and will aim to go after NASDAQ later this year if not early next year.",

It's now a global economy.  \n\nTLDR on GDP; it only counts products/services produced DOMESTICALLY.  Thats right, where have ALL of tech been produced for the past 5-10 years?  This doesn't include things such as AMD, Cisco, Alibaba, Aliexpress, literally any type of tech mfg., \n\nChina has tripled GDP in last 10 years.  To rely on a US GDP graph vs. value of the market is:\n\nRETARDED.\n\nIf companies that produce all of their products in china are taken out of the stock market valuation, I will stand corrected.  Also, are companies like BABA, JD, etc. taken out too?",

It's not worth spending time if you don't look at growth stocks at all, imo.",

        "body": "Sure, but it's not just the amount of data you have that matters \u2014 it's the quality and fidelity of it, what you do with it, and how you leverage it against existing datasets. How the algorithms themselves are told to look at the data is also incredibly important. \n\nSo, for instance, Tesla has a lot real-world data coming in, but the fidelity of that... isn't very good. It's just camera data, speed data, etc. -- and [Tesla's cameras are black and white](https://electrek.co/2017/05/16/tesla-autopilot-2-0-can-see/), so they're likely not using much in the way of things like.. colour information to identify stop signs, instead relying on looking for octagonal shapes and text that fits the standard idea of what a stop sign looks like. \n\nTesla's data also has a lot of overlap \u2014 there are plenty of Tesla drivers on the 504, contributing the same data over and over every day. Meanwhile, there aren't so many Tesla drivers taking back roads, or driving in cities where Tesla simply isn't that popular. So every day, you have ten thousand Tesla drivers mapping the same section of the 504, and not much else. \n\nCompare that to Waymo, which, through Google can leverage StreetView car data \u2014 which has the core aim of mapping *every road* at least *once*, in high fidelity 360\u00ba full-colour. Google already knows how to, for instance, read text via their work with *Captcha* \u2014\u00a0which means that when Tesla is looking for an octagon with squiggles in it that look like what we recognize as an \ud835\ude82, a \ud835\ude83, an \ud835\ude7e, and a \ud835\ude7f... Google is looking for an red octagon with the word **STOP** on it. \n\nThis is one very basic example, and there are thousands of others from recognizing pedestrians to understanding how to find an address, identify populated areas, understanding roadworks, and so on and so forth \u2014 each one of those requires another attempt at either training the algorithm or training a set of algorithms to help train each other. \n\nThere's a saying in the industry \u2014 [\"garbage in, garbage out\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out) \u2014 meaning it's not just the data you have that is important, but the quality of it and what you do with it, and that's especially important when it comes to something like self-driving cars. \n\nWaymo has proven they understand this, and while Tesla is still leagues ahead of most of the other players in the market, they've still yet to prove that they're doing considerably good work with the (yes, vast) amounts of data they've accrued.",
