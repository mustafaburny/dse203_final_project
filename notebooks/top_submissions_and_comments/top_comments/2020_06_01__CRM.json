Then after a series of bad plays (again, holding too long) and  mistimed puts,  I started pouring more and more money in to try to  recoup the losses but kept losing. What started as a deposit of my \\~$600  tax return to play around with became a $13k nightmare.\n\nAnyway,  eventually I went full bull at the bottom, and was able to recover it  all much quicker than I lost it. At peak, I was down -80% all time and  from yesterday to today alone, I went from -38% to +40%. I'll be cashing  out my initial investment + a bit extra so it's all play money from  here.\n\nPositions that won big:\n\nRTX, SPY, FB, ACB, DKNG, NAT **calls**\n\nPositions that lost big:\n\nUSO, NAT, AL, CHGG **calls**\n\nSNAP, AAPL, GILD, CHGG, CRM, SPY **puts**\n\nWhat I learned:\n\n\\- Don't chase dips you aren't VERY confident about\n\n\\- Usually but not always inverse WSB\n\n\\- Don't bet against America",

        "body": "TL;DR: As an investor, here is what you are betting on if you decide to invest in Snowflake.\n\n  1. Data analysis is going to be important more than ever to get competitive advantage as a company. Data is the new oil as they say.\n  2. Big companies spent and continue to spend billions to build their data analytics platform (and now selling these to other big names and SMEs)\n  3. Other big names and SMEs will need to spend some of their revenue on analytics to better understand their customers and improve their products/services\n  4. They will look for a cheap, easy to use analytics platform that integrates well with known apps, tools, technologies and platforms that they have been using, such as Google Sheets/Excel, relational databases, text files, salesforce, you name it.\n  5. Snowflake will be the go-to platform for these needs and my investment will grow fast with the company.\n\nNow read the rest if you are bored and want to get bored even more.\nSome facts first:\n\n  * There are two major types of databases: transactional and analytical. Analytical data often comes from transactional data after it is transformed, enriched, joined etc.\n\n  * Snowflake is an analytical database.\n\n  * Amazon and Microsoft provide both types of databases on their respective platforms, AWS and Azure. \n\nSo, as a company if your enterprise apps are hosted on AWS it makes sense to use their transactional database, called Aurora, for your apps. If you are on Azure, the equivalent would be SQL Server. **Snowflake replaces neither of these.**\n\nNow, if you also want to invest in data analysis as a company (because this is where you get competitive advantage), then you hire a few data engineers/analysts/scientists and provide them an analytics platform. The database component of that platform has to be an analytical database and that is where Snowflake shines. \n\nAs stated in the quote you shared, your data engineer pulls large amounts of data across multiple cloud platforms (mostly transactional databases but also other online services like SAP, Salesforce, Google Analytics etc) and puts it in an analytical database. Then your analyst/scientist analyzes it. For a company, if they are already using AWS or Azure it makes sense to get the analytical database from the same platform (for compatibility, support etc), namely Redshift in AWS and Data Warehouse (what a boring name) in Azure. \n\nThis is another area where Snowflake continues to shine. See, they built their platform on the shoulders of giants: AWS and Azure. Behind the scenes, they actually use these platforms to store and process your data. This is a very wise decision because:\n\n  * it enables them to scale without any additional work\n  * it makes it easier for companies to switch to Snowflake as if it is a native component of those platforms. \n  * it makes the service very cheap from the day 1\n  * they pose as an ally to the giants rather than a rival that needs to be crushed before it steals too much of their share. It is win-win-win scenario.\n\nOn top of all these, they have built an excellent platform which any data engineer/analyst/scientist would be pleased to use.",

A little more reading on Snowflake led me to a podcast called Rise of the Data Cloud where the CEO of Snowflake was talking about how all these tech companies collect obscene amounts of data, but all that data is kept in each individual's company's realm. Snowflake developed or is working on a platform to make all that data compatible and interchangeable between companies or individuals. Pretty interesting stuff. I started looking to see what kind of funds were holding Salesforce stock, and that led me to Information Technology sector funds. The same funds that hold Salesforce also  hold Apple, Microsoft, VISA, Mastercard, Adobe, and other very large companies. I bought some VGT at Vanguard.",

        "body": "\"However, if we really sit down and think about what has already happened and what is on the way for the rest of this year, I truly can't see this momentum going through 2020 and into 2021\"\n\nPeople said that in March and April too. I think that there will be a rotation out of growth (I know there's part of this sub that hates to hear this because it doesn't go with their \"everything is awful\" narrative, but there are things that are doing quite well during this and those are growth stocks; Druckenmiller discussed this, there have been multiple conference calls discussing growth being pulled forward by \"years\" (such as Microsoft) and even the Salesforce call discussed how this situation has resulted in an unusual situation of companies that are very impacted and others not so much. \n\nI do think that there will be a rotation and probably a moderate correction would be healthy but I thought that in early May. You got a rotation out of growth that was swift last week and it lasted for about a day and a half before people piled back in again - the dip buyers were out n full force for things like TWLO.  \n\nI do think that things aren't sustainable short-term. If I could have the kind of investment performance I've had for the first 6 months of the year repeated in the back half I'd be thrilled but I think that's highly unlikely unless this time is really awfully different. That said, long-term I think I've never been more excited about the prospects of the companies that I own. \n\n\"3) \"Unlimited\" QE can only do so much:\" \n\nJohn Hussman has fought the Fed for over a decade now and his \"market neutral\" fund has lost more than half its value and most of his AUM has fled. He has written countless, lengthy bear letters for years. Maybe he's eventually right, but which comes first, him being right or his fund closing? There has been this continued proclamation that \"the Fed can't do anything more!\" for years and then this happens and Powell basically goes, \"Now witness the power of this fully operational and armed battle station.\"  The Fed cannot do everything, but they can do an awful lot and perhaps for longer than you think.\n\n\"How sustainable is it really?\"\n\nPart of this sub has been asking that for the last 40% or so. I've read what feels like a hundred \"list of bad stuff that nobody seems to be paying attention to but me!\" threads on here. This sub spent a month in a pointless debate about whether this was a \"bull trap.\"\n\n\"I'm shorting the market using inverse ETFs. Who agrees?\"\n\nJust take profits and build some cash into strength. There have been a lot of very dismaying stories about people who have lost a lot shorting this and I do feel genuinely badly for the people who have lost a lot doing this. Maybe you will be lucky and time it right or maybe not but I'm not seeing what you feel is the catalyst to turn the market now.\n\nAdditionally, I genuinely do feel that this is a market of winners and losers and I do think that people should read conference calls and see what companies are saying rather than going on broad headlines but (shrug.) Additionally, some of the sectors that are impacted by this were already in decline before it and this pulled forward what might have been years of further slow decline into one or two. \n\nI don't agree with the selling everything (although I don't even know what you own) or nearly everything and piling into shorts (want to gradually sell some into strength and raise money to patiently wait for a better opportunity? fine) but good luck.",

My company was a partner of Avalara's for years.\n\nI'm not familiar with AVLR's financials so I can't speak to how efficiently they are being run, but they are virtually guaranteed to continue their strong revenue growth. As it relates to the US ecommerce market, it's been the wild west since online shopping's inception. AVLR automates key tax processes &amp; compliance by State, which as most would imagine differs significantly from one State to another and is a real pain in the ass for online retailers to keep up with changes/nuances/requirements/regulations. Up until the last few years, there hasn't been any governance around taxes for online shopping (even for large online retailers like Amazon). It sounds crazy, but a lot of online transactions haven't been taxed properly/correctly. That's starting to change and be monitored by Government, State by State and Avalara offers a great solution for this. With ecommerce adoption being further accelerated thanks to COVID, it stands to reason that an already growing industry (ecommerce) will continue to grow and AVLR stand to benefit nicely from this.\n\nThey are not the only players in this space (they do have lots of competition), but are easily one of the leading solution providers and have been for some time. One of the big keys to me for software like this is integration into other core ecommerce systems like payment processors/systems, ecommerce platform (ECP), order management (OMS), CRM/ERP/and more. AVLR do a really good job here.",
