Their recent demo for autonomous through the streets of Tel Aviv dealing with pedestrians, construction sites, turning etc is very impressive. \n\nMost recently I heard that Tesla seems to have trouble with things like bus ads and stop signs sitting in truck beds, and I wouldn't even try autopilot on the PCH or anything windy, just watched a video from yesterday where it wasn't able to stay within the lines for most of it. Long way to go in any case.",
