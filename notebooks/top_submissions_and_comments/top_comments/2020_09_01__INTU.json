If you want to create wealth, own growth companies and concentrated portfolios.\u201d - Nancy Zevenbergen of the Zevenbergen funds\n\nMy investment style mirrors this. I focus on 8-20 companies and I just catapult growth through those companies. Many people on this sub will argue, but I\u2019ve presented a portfolio with 3 companies that has [beaten](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=true&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=MSFT&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=INTU&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=WM&amp;allocation3_1=34)  the SPY for 27 years and counting. This is absolutely achievable with a concentrated portfolio (MSFT, INTU, WM, in my simple example)\n\nI really appreciate your write up. People think that indexing is safe or something, but in my investing experience, you leave lots of money on the table through diversification. You end up missing so much money that even if you suddenly get a 40-70% drawdown while focusing on a concentrated portfolio that you\u2019re still ahead of someone who indexed.  \n\nThe most important thing is portfolio construction. I say this not from theory, but rather as someone who has a \u201csafe\u201d withdrawal rate of 15% per year. Concentrated growth portfolios lead to much better outcomes. The problem is that there\u2019s no advice for people who want to build these portfolios, and you\u2019re usually dealing with a bunch of ambiguity as you create them. What I\u2019ve found that works for me is focusing on Sharpe/Sortino ratios, maximum drawdowns, alpha and beta, while also targeting specific arithmetic returns.",

        "body": "My opinion. Most of the market has already crashed or is at fair value.  Consumer stocks are mostly fairly valued.  Energy/oil is at 30 year lows or bankrupt.  The bubble is mostly in Saas/Cloud stocks/Biotech/Nasdaq.  Many of these stocks are trading at 20-30xs sales with no income.  Look at something like OKTA, they have a $25B market cap and make only $200M rev per quarter with no profits.  That's the case across the board with cloud.   They need to come down and that crash is starting as of last week I think. \n\nFANG/mature tech (ADBE, INTU, ORCL, MSFT) will just continue to dominate and kill competitors or buy them out.  At most I could see Nasdaq going back to 8-9K, Dow maybe 25k, but not much lower?  \n\nI guess we'll see but I think its dumb to cash out, youre not going to pick a bottom, its impossible.   I sold about 15% of stuff in Feb before the crash and mostly missed the March lows or bought the wrong things so this time Im just not selling and will average down on SPY and major holdings if it happens.",
