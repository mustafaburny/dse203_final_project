        "body": "I have GM because I think they are the best suited to take advantage of the electric car market going forward. People love Tesla because they don't have unions and so can make vehicles a bit cheaper, but at the end of the day, Tesla just doesn't have the capacity or infrastructure to actually distribute vehicles and service them on a wide scale. But the bigger thing is, after shopping for an electric vehicle recently, and actually exploring the options, Tesla came out way, way on bottom. Expensive and expensive to repair, easy to damage. Tesla is on top of the electric vehicle market right now in the west because the people who can afford them are well off, usually highly paid programmers (like 90% of tesla owners I know are software developers). I don't think they will be in 10 years when the majority of vehicles sold are EV in America. Most will be Chevys, a better vehicle, and a brand that most americans already know.\n\nWestern Digital over Seagate because they have more of a foothold in the SSD space. WDC has had negative profit recently only because they bought Sandisk, an expense which they have been writing off. Western Digital has 2x revenue, but 4x the net income of Seagate, yet has a lower market cap than seagate does right now. So yeah, I expect WDC to outperform it in the short and long term.",
