Also more traditional companies like Visa are still dominant in global payments and will benefit from the trend. Conviction buys on SQ PYPL especially \n\nAI/Robotics/automation: my main AI buy was c3.ai right at IPO open. Companies like NVDA IBM google and twilio have AI units but they\u2019re not pure play AI. ServiceNow (enterprise software) has been acquiring AI firms too. I like alteryx for AI but not as much these days. There just aren\u2019t many pure play AI public tickers so I do lean on ETFs here. For robotics: intuitive surgical is the gold standard but has cooled off recently, but teradyne is my conviction buy there. Automation ADSK is #1. Rockwell automation. Most of these companies are somewhat involved in more than one of the sectors I mentioned so the lines get blurry. \n\nTelemedicine: TDOC more sustained value, M3 for potential rocket \n\nGenomics: CRSP, EDIT, NTLA (this last one hasn\u2019t popped as hard yet so good time to enter, room to run)\n\nCybersecurity: NET, CRWD\n\n3D printing: stratasys \n\nIoT I don\u2019t really have a good single ticker.

The U.S. eCash solution is powered by the Vanilla Direct\u2122 payment network of [InComm Payments](https://www.incomm.com/), a leading global payments technology company.  \n\n\nWith the ongoing U.S. issue of financial inclusion and cash\u2019s enduring importance in the market, Americans not able, or wanting, to make credit or debit card payments online can now access [Paysafecash](https://www.paysafecash.com/en-us/)\u2122, which was first launched in 2018 and is now live in almost 30 global markets.  \n\n\nThe solution will particularly appeal to the 22% of U.S. households that are either underbanked or unbanked, according to [research](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-banking-and-credit.htm) from the Federal Reserve[\\[1\\]](https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-launches-paysafecashtm-in-us-to-enable-online-cash-payments/?fbclid=IwAR2qN1MNQfs6hbRs4hpYo1h5sLMTlllQVwF-m4ui00_YcMSbrxXFMIhprF0#_ftn1). With no need of a bank account or to share sensitive financial information over the internet, Paysafecash\u2122 allows all Americans to transact online, including to pay their rent and government bills, access a diverse range of other digital financial services, and engage in eCommerce.  \n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further increased demand for eCash solutions, enabling consumers to avoid long wait-times to make in-person payments at crowded federal, state and municipal facilities, among other benefits. Uptake has been significant, with 14% of Americans using an eCash product at least monthly in 2020, according to [Paysafe\u2019s Q2 research](https://www.paysafe.com/en/blog/how-covid-19-is-impacting-consumer-payment-preferences/). Simultaneous cash loyalty \u2013 the same research reveals 75% of consumers would be concerned if they could not access cash \u2013 suggest this will likely trend higher.  \n\n\nConsumers favoring cash can use Paysafecash\u2122 at participating websites by simply selecting the brand as the payment method at the online checkout, producing a barcode that can be stored on their mobile device or printed.  \n\n\nCash payments can then be made at brick-and-mortar stores in InComm Payments\u2019 [Vanilla Direct\u2122](https://pay.vanilladirect.com/) network, encompassing more than 60,000 [U.S. retail locations](https://www.paysafecash.com/en-us/) including 7-Eleven\u00ae, Dollar General, Family Dollar, and a range of other branded convenience stores and pharmacies. Once the consumer\u2019s barcode is scanned and the balance paid in cash, the payment is completed. No Paysafecash\u2122 customer account is needed to make a transaction.  \n\n\nUdo M\u00fcller, CEO of paysafecard, the team behind Paysafecash\u2122 at Paysafe, said: \u201cAgainst the backdrop of the converging trends of cash loyalty and a rising need to transact online, we feel there is strong consumer demand in the U.S. for our Paysafecash\u2122 solution. We\u2019re proud to bring to the market an eCash product that will allow underbanked and unbanked Americans to participate in the digital economy and prevent financial discrimination against the cash consumer.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0  \n\n\nTim Richardson, Senior Vice President at InComm, commented: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Paysafe to expand our financially inclusive cash-in solution.

So I think COST doesn't have much upside from here.  BUT might payoff on the downside IF earnings fail to surpass expectation.  So, for a lottery play, maybe something like a 355/350 put spread could pay off considering how cheap the options are at that level and getting a nice payout.\n\nThe Less successful retailers have been getting big boosts like SNR, TCS, BBBY, JWN, DLTR all because people expected the worst and they weren't so bad.  So GME?!?!  LOL.  This trend, plus all the shorting involved in the stock may actually present some huge upside / limited downside because all the shorters will have to buy back to cover.\n\nLULU - I'd love to bet against this one, but if you look at Nike earnings last Q, they did surprisingly really well.  I'm not sure I want to take a risk here.\n\nDon't expect any surprises with ADBE or AVGO and you can probably sell Iron Condors and make good money from either of those\n\nSHORT COUPA! lol.  We'll see, but there's nothing magical about this company.  It's a tool business use to track how much they spend with third parties.  It works alright and it's better than the IBM tool by miles, but I doubt they can keep up with earnings estimates.\n\nShort CHWY too just because it has run too high.\n\nTLDR: Cheap puts on COST, long shares of GME since options are too expensive, Sell Iron Condor on ADBE and AVGO, Short COUP and CHWY since options too expensive.",

        "body": "&gt;  The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. \n\nI don't think you meant this badly but its based on an antisemitic meme that overstates this family's importance.  The family was founded in the 16th century. The word Rothschild is Yiddish for \"red coat\". Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744 as the son of a minor artisan for the Prince of Hesse. Both of Mayer's parents died when he was 12 of smallpox. While he wasn't a destitute orphan he was not that screaming rich either. He became an apprentice of Simon Wolf Oppenheimer a banker and court Jew for the Electorate of Hanover. After 6 years Mayer was knowledgeable enough to take over his father's business. Mayer was extremely talented and grew the family business extraordinarily quickly. In 6 more years he became the official court Jew for Crown Prince Wilhelm of Hesse (his father's old patron) and then soon thereafter banker for Crown Prince Wilhelm (Wilhelm IX when he later assumed the throne). He lent heavily to the British during the various Napoleonic wars and made a lot of money. He used quite a bit of leverage borrowing from German nobility to lend on these risky ventures and kept the profits. Napoleon was not a bigot so when he got control of Hesse he decided to leverage not kill the most talented banker of his generation allowing Mayer to make money importing goods and taxing the proceeds. By 1798 Mayer Rothschild sent his sons abroad to setup their own divisions of the banking house inventing \"international finance\". His contribution got him the #7 slot on Forbes top 20 all time businessmen between Thomas J Watson (IBM) and Walt Disney.\n\nMayer died in 1812. His 5 sons kept the money in the family by marrying cousins and nieces like European nobility. The sons became known as the the \"five arrows\" of banking. Eldest son Amschel Mayer took over the Frankfurt bank which Salomon another son expanded to Vienna. Nathan turned the London branch into one of Europe's most powerful banking institutions ( N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons today Rothschild &amp; Co). Calmann set up a branch in Naples that was moderately successful. While Jacob opened de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res becoming a giant of finance in Paris.\n\nAnd that's about it for their importance in finance. Like most rich families the later generations discover that spending money is more fun than making money. So the genius petered out in the 3rd generation. By the later 19th century the Rothchild family was mainly into politics and charity work.  Rothschild &amp; Co is a pretty good merger and acquisitions investment bank in England. Queen Elizabeth used to keep her personal money with one of their financial advisors Sir Evelyn Rothschild. Its about 1% of the size of JPMorgan Chase. The French branch evolved into the Edmond de Rothschild Group which runs another investment house (primarily infrastructure investing) that isn't worth noting plus some rather spiffy luxury products (racing yachts) worth about $70b total split among a zillion owners. The other branches faded. The Rotschild family today has about $25b in liquid assets. They likely have other holdings like fine art and rare artifacts passed down in rather nice mansions and apartments many own worth another $10b or so.\n\nSo none of them are going to starve anytime soon. And certainly Mayer's great great great great great great great grandchildren are happy European (mostly) rich people because of his and his son's talents. I'm sure American billionaires will be quite happy if their fortunes hold out this well unlike say the Vanderbilts who managed to blow all the money in 5 generations. But they are not by any stretch of the imagination incredibly powerful players who own 1/2 the world's wealth nor are any trillionaires. In fact among all the member of the family in the entire world there is only one Rothchild billionaire: Benjamin de Rothschild, head of the Edmond de Rothschild Group. And that one billionaire just barely makes the list coming in around 1400th in the world for richest person.\n\nWhile these were interesting people in Napoleon's time this family is well past its prime. Anyone telling fantastic stories about them you should dismiss as an idiot.",

I invest pretty heavily in networking technology and the idea of Fastly selling to Cisco does not really make sense. \n\nThe explosiveness of this rumor is a result of Fastlys inherent volatility and somewhat of a mixture that a lot of investors don't really understand CDNs that much.\n\n\nIf it were acquired, I would not be surprised to see it acquired by Google, given Fastly's history and how they're already integrated by Google Cloud (using Firebase hosting is a Fastly integration). They are also aligned in serverless computing visions and they just recently acquired Signal Sciences.\n\nIf it were to go to a legacy provider, I would imagine that both Oracle or IBM would factor in before Cisco does.",

You could leave at noon take work home for the afternoon.\n\nFor sure after we invented the telephone, surely after we invented the PC and absolutely certanely after we invented Intranet and IRC type remote messaging, not to mention the proper Internet.\n\nTo give you an idea Microsoft had their first tool for conference calls as a default program in Windows 95. Gates predicted WFH back when he made his first book in 1996\n\nStill WFH had so many chances and never made it. Those who tried such as IBM and AT&amp;T rolled it back.\n\nAlso the science tells us that all the improvements after the telephone might perhaps be sent straight to the bin because it's really uncanny to see a pixelated face without body and a slight lag and blur  so it's much better to communicate via telephone/email or IRC/slack. At least you don't get the uncanny feeling which , just like videogames ends up being counterproductive",

Still, if you're interested I'll give my thoughts.\n\nIf you're holding a diversified index fund then there's a good argument to make that holding and never selling is generally the best strategy. But given that most business will fail with enough time investors in individual stocks (especially those likely to be disrupted) should be constantly rebalancing, selling and buying.\n\nFor example I personally invest in a lot of smaller tech stocks. Small tech stocks will typically do very well for a few years then when something better comes along the stock price will tank and will rarely recover. This even happens to larger tech stocks too, although their decline is typically over decades rather than months or years (IBM, CSCO).\n\nI understand that the market *should* always go up so I have a very strong bias to maintain exposure to the market regardless of market conditions (time in the market), but with individual stocks I don't maintain exposure because it would just be dumb \u2013 the market as a whole trends up, but individual stocks (with enough time) trend to 0. However, /r/investing doesn't seem to understand this and always accuse me of \"timing the market\" when I sell a stock I feel no longer has an attractive risk/reward to buy another that I think will offer better returns.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that this whole conversation is pointless. Yes, maintaining a board exposure to assets is generally a good idea, but owning a stock and assuming it will just go up forever is a bit silly. I think you kind of touched on this with your point about how buying hyped stocks with the intention of holding long-term isn't really what is meant by \"time in the market\", but you probably shouldn't hold any stock long-term unconditionally \u2013 hype stock or not. Stocks like KO are in my opinion very very rare exceptions because they're so unlikely to be disrupted, that just not true for most stocks. The reason I tell a lot of people looking for \"buy and holds\" to invest in KO is because although unlikely AAPL, GOOG and MSFT can all be disrupted, but you can't really disrupt taste with technology. KO will only fail if everyone who loves drinking Coke today decides they don't like the taste of Coke anymore and that's probably not going to happen.\n\nPersonally I wish people just stopped saying \"time in the market\" and instead something more useful like, \"it's generally a good idea to invest as much as you're able in assets and have a strong bias to maintaining exposure to the boarder market even when you feel tempted to sell\".",

Not by a lot but still...\n\nNow I'm not saying that voice can substitute Slack/email/IRC but even if the workload is 50% voice and 50% text based live communication it would still means trillions of men hour and billions of dollars wasted for a result which is uncanny and can only be used for televised type events or when addressing a virtual or proper auditorium\n\n&gt; After that into the 2000s and especially 2010s our world has drastically changed\n\nIBM was still remote in 2017, then they decided to call people back to the office. Whatever they used internally in 2017 for sure trumped whatever we retail are using now. During the period in which IBM was remote they went into free fall and now are used as the reference for a  fallen angel or a \"has been\" company.",

We'll see, but there's nothing magical about this company.  It's a tool business use to track how much they spend with third parties.  It works alright and it's better than the IBM tool by miles, but I doubt they can keep up with earnings estimates.\n\nShort CHWY too just because it has run too high.\n\nTLDR: Cheap puts on COST, long shares of GME since options are too expensive, Sell Iron Condor on ADBE and AVGO, Short COUP and CHWY since options too expensive.",

        "body": "&gt;  The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. \n\nI don't think you meant this badly but its based on an antisemitic meme that overstates this family's importance.  The family was founded in the 16th century. The word Rothschild is Yiddish for \"red coat\". Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744 as the son of a minor artisan for the Prince of Hesse. Both of Mayer's parents died when he was 12 of smallpox. While he wasn't a destitute orphan he was not that screaming rich either. He became an apprentice of Simon Wolf Oppenheimer a banker and court Jew for the Electorate of Hanover. After 6 years Mayer was knowledgeable enough to take over his father's business. Mayer was extremely talented and grew the family business extraordinarily quickly. In 6 more years he became the official court Jew for Crown Prince Wilhelm of Hesse (his father's old patron) and then soon thereafter banker for Crown Prince Wilhelm (Wilhelm IX when he later assumed the throne). He lent heavily to the British during the various Napoleonic wars and made a lot of money. He used quite a bit of leverage borrowing from German nobility to lend on these risky ventures and kept the profits. Napoleon was not a bigot so when he got control of Hesse he decided to leverage not kill the most talented banker of his generation allowing Mayer to make money importing goods and taxing the proceeds. By 1798 Mayer Rothschild sent his sons abroad to setup their own divisions of the banking house inventing \"international finance\". His contribution got him the #7 slot on Forbes top 20 all time businessmen between Thomas J Watson (IBM) and Walt Disney.\n\nMayer died in 1812. His 5 sons kept the money in the family by marrying cousins and nieces like European nobility. The sons became known as the the \"five arrows\" of banking. Eldest son Amschel Mayer took over the Frankfurt bank which Salomon another son expanded to Vienna. Nathan turned the London branch into one of Europe's most powerful banking institutions ( N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons today Rothschild &amp; Co). Calmann set up a branch in Naples that was moderately successful. While Jacob opened de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res becoming a giant of finance in Paris.\n\nAnd that's about it for their importance in finance. Like most rich families the later generations discover that spending money is more fun than making money. So the genius petered out in the 3rd generation. By the later 19th century the Rothchild family was mainly into politics and charity work.  Rothschild &amp; Co is a pretty good merger and acquisitions investment bank in England. Queen Elizabeth used to keep her personal money with one of their financial advisors Sir Evelyn Rothschild. Its about 1% of the size of JPMorgan Chase. The French branch evolved into the Edmond de Rothschild Group which runs another investment house (primarily infrastructure investing) that isn't worth noting plus some rather spiffy luxury products (racing yachts) worth about $70b total split among a zillion owners. The other branches faded. The Rotschild family today has about $25b in liquid assets. They likely have other holdings like fine art and rare artifacts passed down in rather nice mansions and apartments many own worth another $10b or so.\n\nSo none of them are going to starve anytime soon. And certainly Mayer's great great great great great great great grandchildren are happy European (mostly) rich people because of his and his son's talents. I'm sure American billionaires will be quite happy if their fortunes hold out this well unlike say the Vanderbilts who managed to blow all the money in 5 generations. But they are not by any stretch of the imagination incredibly powerful players who own 1/2 the world's wealth nor are any trillionaires. In fact among all the member of the family in the entire world there is only one Rothchild billionaire: Benjamin de Rothschild, head of the Edmond de Rothschild Group. And that one billionaire just barely makes the list coming in around 1400th in the world for richest person.\n\nWhile these were interesting people in Napoleon's time this family is well past its prime. Anyone telling fantastic stories about them you should dismiss as an idiot.",

Still, if you're interested I'll give my thoughts.\n\nIf you're holding a diversified index fund then there's a good argument to make that holding and never selling is generally the best strategy. But given that most business will fail with enough time investors in individual stocks (especially those likely to be disrupted) should be constantly rebalancing, selling and buying.\n\nFor example I personally invest in a lot of smaller tech stocks. Small tech stocks will typically do very well for a few years then when something better comes along the stock price will tank and will rarely recover. This even happens to larger tech stocks too, although their decline is typically over decades rather than months or years (IBM, CSCO).\n\nI understand that the market *should* always go up so I have a very strong bias to maintain exposure to the market regardless of market conditions (time in the market), but with individual stocks I don't maintain exposure because it would just be dumb \u2013 the market as a whole trends up, but individual stocks (with enough time) trend to 0. However, /r/investing doesn't seem to understand this and always accuse me of \"timing the market\" when I sell a stock I feel no longer has an attractive risk/reward to buy another that I think will offer better returns.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that this whole conversation is pointless. Yes, maintaining a board exposure to assets is generally a good idea, but owning a stock and assuming it will just go up forever is a bit silly. I think you kind of touched on this with your point about how buying hyped stocks with the intention of holding long-term isn't really what is meant by \"time in the market\", but you probably shouldn't hold any stock long-term unconditionally \u2013 hype stock or not. Stocks like KO are in my opinion very very rare exceptions because they're so unlikely to be disrupted, that just not true for most stocks. The reason I tell a lot of people looking for \"buy and holds\" to invest in KO is because although unlikely AAPL, GOOG and MSFT can all be disrupted, but you can't really disrupt taste with technology. KO will only fail if everyone who loves drinking Coke today decides they don't like the taste of Coke anymore and that's probably not going to happen.\n\nPersonally I wish people just stopped saying \"time in the market\" and instead something more useful like, \"it's generally a good idea to invest as much as you're able in assets and have a strong bias to maintaining exposure to the boarder market even when you feel tempted to sell\".",

The steak is the actual Bell system break-up, which was certainly opportunisticly authored by AT&amp;T when they realized they were not going to win the case.  \n\nMy take on /u/exe_virus's comment was not that they were saying the FB case is the same as the AT&amp;T case, which it seemed you were arguing.  Antitrust actions are not just about market pricing and the fact that the FB case now exists means that it will create market opportunity for other players, even if it doesn't result in breaking up FB. FB operates several \"businesses\" but the issue to watch is that almost all of it revolves around data collection and selling it to others.

Because they are the absolute leaders when it comes to quantum computation, and they enjoy a gigantic moat over everybody except IBM. Many other startups don\u2019t have the scale, the promising ones like Rigetti or Xanadu will probably be bought over by big companies in the near future. It\u2019s not priced in yet, the long term horizon is about 10-15 yrs before they take over the profit calculations. Microsoft is going the better route imho, topological fault tolerance is gonna be the way long term. But google is more aggressive over the intermediate term, so if your investment horizon is &lt;25 yrs, probably alphabet is a better investment. Then again, any first gen quantum computer would likely be cloud based, and azure &gt;&gt; google cloud. Btw, wait around for IBM\u2019s new IPO which would be a big player in this. \n\nOne upshot is, I\u2019m not sure NVDA is a good buy now. They rose to the moon on the assumption that all machine learning requires graphics cards. But that\u2019s already priced in for the next decade (even before going into Fed printing money stuff and possibility of a big correction), and once new gen quantum processors act as co-processors (I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll replace classical processors entirely, except in very very niche applications) - they\u2019ll take over machine learning tasks far more easily. \n\nImho, AMZN and AAPL have run their course technologically, don\u2019t think they have the radical vision necessary to grow. Yeah, Buffett holds apple, but in the same way he holds Coke, solid dividend, established player, safe but boring. \n\nBABA and Baidu, if they can get over their govt woes, are actually wonderful opportunities, especially Baidu.

You think regular people don\u2019t care about electric cars? \n\nYou guys are so focused on attacking Tesla that you\u2019re inventing reasons to defend the rest of the auto industry. IBM and GE are certainly still in business. But the auto industry will change, even if you don\u2019t like Tesla\u2019s valuation. New and arising EV makers will come and won\u2019t carry the bloated management of their auto industry predecessors.",

        "body": "Couple of things: people who don\u2019t work in manufacturing are also not tied to auto manufacturing. CEOs of companies like GM and Ford and Volkswagen are. That means that while certainly those individuals understand their business very well, they\u2019re not well equipped to see how their business is just no longer the business. Second, restricting R&amp;D doesn\u2019t seem like a sensible move here given the speed at which Tesla operates. I think you\u2019re mistaking \u201cbeing sexy\u201d with a bit of engineering hubris that\u2019s backed by reality, and frankly it comes off as just as emotional as any Tesla fanboy. You\u2019re right that auto manufactures *choose* to not build electric vehicles, with feature, software updates, a charging infrastructure, etc. But that looks a whole lot like GE/IBM strategy.",
