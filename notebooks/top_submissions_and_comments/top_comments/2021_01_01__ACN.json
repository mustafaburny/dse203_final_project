I don\u2018t work on it, but I\u2019m employed at one of worlds biggest consumer goods companies, we work on SAP and switched all Sales matters to Salesforce last year because of their cloud based system (Real-time Data) we also got a new Online Shop for hundreds of brands. View months ago we added Palantir Sofware to bring together all data from SAP, Salesforce &amp; Onlineshop and get finished Analyses of all Sales &amp; Supply Chain matters. Palantir runs behind the online shop an give you every Data and Analyses of Customer behavior. So you can build out Offers and everything you want on your Onlineshop out of its analyses. You also can track the whole logistic with it... So believe me if one of worlds biggest retail companies implement Palantir to run their Data and Analyses, we want be the only one! And if there would be a better software to bring together Data from different Systems we wouldn\u2019t have bought it. By the way Accenture as Worlds leading Business Consultant Company is driving Digital Transformation at the most of the Fortune 500 companies &amp; Governments and if they recommend this software there is a reason... and as I sayed before, there are a lot of Big Groups already using it, you just don\u2018t read it on the newspaper... And there\u2019s also a reason why all government\u2018s use it for the vaccine distribution from Europe to USA... why would the  EU Use it if it\u2018s just bound to US Government? See it from another perspective, Government Contract run long, so they have secured Sales and adding much more with the sales the most people think they don\u2018t do... wait for the Earnings Call and you will see! \ud83d\ude80",

Closing in on $1 Billion in annual revenue, making the right moves to continually improve margins (lower interest debt, consolidation of backoffice), uplisting to TSX for greater access to institutional investors, possible expansion into other markets geographically. There's a lot to look forward to.\n\nThere's not a lot of competition for the niche segment (small to medium enterprise technology solutions) they have targeted. Usually growth is a concern with rather niche segments, but their revenue numbers demonstrate they have done well in that regard. Also, don't mistaken them as strictly resellers, they also provide consulting services which offers higher margins (not as great as Accenture or DXC given scale). \n\nOverall, an awesome value play.",

IT consultant firms include very large ones like Accenture or CGI Inc. from Montreal - from what I can see they trade at 1-4X sales depending on the quality.

So I think Palantir will deliver you more returns \ud83d\ude05 no I\u2019m joking I don\u2018t know the Dundas software but I checked the hp. Looks nice but at first sight there are view Sofware Company\u2019s who tell their software is the best. I know some Global Retail companies who are using Palantir and I think it also speaks for itself that Governments across the globe using it. Accenture- worlds biggest business consultant company is recommending &amp; selling it. So Palantir has something others don\u2019t offer, otherwise everyone would use another software to drive their data... so This tells me next earning call will be Great.",
