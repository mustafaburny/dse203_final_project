        "body": "Imagine basing this months price action on TA when everything is going to be driven by the news cycles around 2 events. I'm waiting for AMD moon this month because their 2 significant product launches are not sufficiently priced in.\n\nWhy do I say that? Look at any \"investing\" comments section on AMD and all they will talk about is how AMD is overpriced because their P/E is 160 lol or AMD is just another overvalued tech company like Tesla. Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like &gt;2X and &gt;3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that. Last weeks action was all about the 5800X AotS benchmark leaks - without knowing when future leaks are coming I don't see how we can predict any specific movements.\n\nMarch 21 95C, 100Cs",

        "body": "I see a lot of mentions of AMD, and a bunch of Nvidia, but almost nothing about ARM. Sure, AMD is competitive with Intel for x86 and Nvidia is getting a lot of attention for GPU-powered machine learning, but don't sleep on ARM. We're probably on the precipice of a huge shift to ARM in the datacentre that's being driven by public cloud providers.\n\nConsider AWS which have been rolling out ARM \"Graviton2\" virtual machines all year:\n\n1. Compared to their x86 counterparts, the Graviton2 are faster for many workloads, are more thermally efficient, and cost less for both Amazon _and_ their customers. AWS instances are billed by the second and usually autoscaled, meaning customers will launch and destroy dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of VMs every day. Servers are not hand-configured one at a time and named after Star Wars characters -- you can't launch a thousand servers a day that way -- instead they're built through automation. This isn't just for speed, it's for repeatability so that when you boot up a server, you don't have to second-guess that it's going to be precisely configured already. So, if you already have the automation in place, and only needed to adjust one variable to start launching ARM machines instead of x86 for less money and more performance, why wouldn't you?\n\n2. \"That's not fair -- the software all has to be re-compiled or even rewritten to work on ARM!\" That's true! I'll get to that in a moment. Here's a type of server you can use right now without rewriting _any_ software: managed database instances. One of the hardest things to do well in a tech org is to run \"stateful\" workloads like databases, which is why all the major cloud providers offer fully-managed database services of many flavours of SQL, caching, and NoSQL databases. Click a few buttons and get MySQL, with patching, backups, and auto-failover managed by the cloud provider. Postgres already runs on ARM, and the data stored by Postgres doesn't care whether the CPU architecture that stored it was ARM or x86 or PowerPC. Replace your managed database instances powered by x86 with the ARM version and start getting that better (and cheaper) performance without having to rewrite anything, _and_ keep all your data. No migration, just shut it down, and turn it back on again with new CPUs. The public cloud providers are going to make a killing on this and they know it.\n\n3. Ok, so what _about_ the apps the tech org writes to power the business? The things that have to be recompiled and maybe even heavily rewritten? Pipelines rebuilt? And the servers underneath them, won't the management software also need to support ARM? Yeah, that's going to take some time and effort, but maybe less than you think. Workload management is becoming increasingly commodified. Orgs that have existing IT assets and tooling will have to make investments in converting their pipeline if they think it's worthwhile (and it may not be in the short term). New startups or new working groups within existing organizations though have no such baggage. They probably won't even run their own servers. Fully-managed containerization platforms or partially-managed platforms powered by something like Kubernetes (think GKE, EKS, AKS) mean that the cloud provider deals with running the servers, and you just ship them the workload. Are you in a golang shop? Target ARM and push.\n\nA tailwind to all this is Apple's shift to ARM, and while it may not have an outsized effect on the datacentre, it doesn't hurt.\n\nLong story short: AMD and Nvidia will make things interesting for Intel in the coming years, but if you want to know where the industry is going, look to ARM.\n\nEDIT: Lot of comments pointing out Nvidia's ownership of ARM. Yep, I get it, this is an investing sub and readers are going to be looking at this at a business perspective. ARM is a major _architectural_ change in technology though, which is typically a hard sell, but is being made not only possible but desirable due to the commodification of the datacentre. If you want to buy the winner then buy the winner, but no one is asking why ARM is all of a sudden positioned to succeed in the datacentre now when the chips have been around for decades.",

He was kinda like cool but I dunno and didn't mess with it.

He's like Jesus fuck, how much did you make? \"I can't tell you it would make you sick, more money than you could ever spend.\" My mentor estimated upwards of 100mil based on continual investment and holding through multiple splits.\n\nSirius XM comes out, hasn't even launched any satellites yet and mentor is like naw I'm not missing out this time. Tells me to take his advice and dump anything I can. It's at like $0.25 a share. Sadly he passed so I never learned his gains, and didn't put money into it. While he or I wouldn't have MCI money, he would also never have to worry about money again.\n\nWhen I was poor as shit, but involved in tech, I told everyone I knew to do the same to amd at $3. And Nvidia at $22. I was living in the negative and just couldn't.\n\nRIP. I've got $13.85 in my bank account.",

Don't read this so I can tell you I told you so.  \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44 \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD is hotter then Mugatu right now and with the latest news i'm sure a bunch of you fucks were also wondering what might happen if this buyout occurs. I have studied in the hyperbolic time chamber and return with wisdom of ages. Behold.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD cash on hand for the quarter ending June 30, 2020: $1.775B (1)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nXLNX has a market cap of ~25B (2)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nClearly, AMD does not have anywhere near the amount of cash on hand for the acquisition and will have to resort to doing it with shares. Generally speaking, acquisitions like this seem to add a premium onto the shares to make it compelling for the company being bought out to take their offer. As XLNX has a market cap of 25B, seeing something like 29-30B in shares offered isn't unreasonable.\n&amp;nbsp;\nHere's what looks like will happen if the offering is 30B in shares when AMD is trading @ 90 to make math easy. AMD will issue something like 333,333,333 new shares, you read that right, and exchange them for all of XLNX's shares. As of right now, that's over a quarter of how many shares are currently outstanding. If the market seems certain the buyout will happen, XLNX will fucking moon and trade near 2x what AMD trades at theoretically until the buyout happens as shareholders of XLNX will receive multiples of AMD if i'm not mistaken. Do your own DD.\nSources:  \n\n\n(1) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/cash-on-hand  \n\n(2) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XLNX/xilinx/market-cap\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPS: I'm only posting it in this thread and not it's seperate post so I can be a greedy little fucking gremlin and keep the mad gains to myself whilst simultaneously being able to say \"Technically I told you so\".\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",
