        "body": "Imagine basing this months price action on TA when everything is going to be driven by the news cycles around 2 events. I'm waiting for AMD moon this month because their 2 significant product launches are not sufficiently priced in.\n\nWhy do I say that? Look at any \"investing\" comments section on AMD and all they will talk about is how AMD is overpriced because their P/E is 160 lol or AMD is just another overvalued tech company like Tesla. Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like &gt;2X and &gt;3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that. Last weeks action was all about the 5800X AotS benchmark leaks - without knowing when future leaks are coming I don't see how we can predict any specific movements.\n\nMarch 21 95C, 100Cs",

Don't read this so I can tell you I told you so.  \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44 \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD is hotter then Mugatu right now and with the latest news i'm sure a bunch of you fucks were also wondering what might happen if this buyout occurs. I have studied in the hyperbolic time chamber and return with wisdom of ages. Behold.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD cash on hand for the quarter ending June 30, 2020: $1.775B (1)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nXLNX has a market cap of ~25B (2)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nClearly, AMD does not have anywhere near the amount of cash on hand for the acquisition and will have to resort to doing it with shares. Generally speaking, acquisitions like this seem to add a premium onto the shares to make it compelling for the company being bought out to take their offer. As XLNX has a market cap of 25B, seeing something like 29-30B in shares offered isn't unreasonable.\n&amp;nbsp;\nHere's what looks like will happen if the offering is 30B in shares when AMD is trading @ 90 to make math easy. AMD will issue something like 333,333,333 new shares, you read that right, and exchange them for all of XLNX's shares. As of right now, that's over a quarter of how many shares are currently outstanding. If the market seems certain the buyout will happen, XLNX will fucking moon and trade near 2x what AMD trades at theoretically until the buyout happens as shareholders of XLNX will receive multiples of AMD if i'm not mistaken. Do your own DD.\nSources:  \n\n\n(1) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/cash-on-hand  \n\n(2) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XLNX/xilinx/market-cap\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPS: I'm only posting it in this thread and not it's seperate post so I can be a greedy little fucking gremlin and keep the mad gains to myself whilst simultaneously being able to say \"Technically I told you so\".\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",

        "body": "AMD, TSM: Adding AMD in anticipation of their CPU Zen 3 release on the 8th, and adding TSM for the pinball effect and both have earnings this month. Both semiconductors have been doing extremely well in the rebound, not to mention TSM holding extremely strong during September amidst the major market selloff with mild volatility. TSM manufactures AMD's chips as well as AAPL and many other major chip companies, and they have a solid dividend for investors looking to hold. \n\nRKT: RKT has been pretty cheap and hasn't been rebounding as quickly since the selloff until today, but the future is extremely promising and they're disruptive in the housing loan market by decreasing friction in mortgages through simplified technology. Housing for the next couple years with low fed rates will be promising with millennials looking to make first time home purchases. Looking to see how it does tomorrow and may start a position next week.\n\nZ: Looking to add to the position if there is a pullback next week. Another housing market play, but combines tech as well.\n\nNKLA: Puts. It went up too much today lol. It is extremely speculative and controversial so it will continue its volatility. Will definitely consider puts if it keeps going up tomorrow into the weekend. \n\nI am currently long AMD, TSM, and Z.\n\nEdit: grammar",
