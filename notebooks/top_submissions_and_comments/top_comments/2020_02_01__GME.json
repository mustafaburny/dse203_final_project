Text 20 of your friends and tell them Gamestop is running a Counter Strike tournament tonight and see how many would go.\n\nGamestop probably could have survived in this small scale model you're thinking of purely off of nostalgia if they didn't piss off every single one of their customers with their shitty business practices but they did thinking they were too big to fail and then digital media happened.

The reason is that when shares are sold short, the purchaser of the shares is free to lend them to another short seller. The current estimate of short interest from IHS Markit is based on international reported borrowing of shares. It stands in contrast to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners, which shows Peloton short interest at 86% of float.\n\n\u201cSome of the possible reason for borrowed shares to exceed the reported short interest include the presence of non-U.S. dealers or off-shore short sellers on the stock,\u201d Pierson said. Meanwhile, other reasons might include, transactions where one party is borrowing from one source as one transaction and then lending to another party, counting as a separate transaction.\n\nLast year, [GameStop Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US) saw more than 100% of its stock shorted in December, around the same time when it reported third quarter earnings and [cut its full year guidance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/Q2BFOET0G1L1).\n\n[READ: Bullish Peloton Options Point to Post-Earnings Surge to Record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/Q58QJGDWRGG1)\n\nSuch high short interest has also led to a higher cost of borrowing shares for Peloton. Pierson said investors could be anticipating that Peloton may later announce it has moved up its IPO lockup expiry from the end of March, which can then \u201cpull forward demand from short sellers and lead to further increases in borrow costs,\u201c Pierson added.\n\nPeloton fell as much as 5.5% on Wednesday, bringing its total gains since its public debut in September to 11%.\"",

They are cheap for a reason (i.e. on their way out).\n\nI echo the advice of other comments - Low cost index funds for the vast majority. Live below your means. Don't spend aggressively. \n\nIf you must pick individual stocks, make it only a small piece of your pie and diversify your picks (15-25 names is sufficient diversification). And remember that the stocks that do the best are not the \"low multiple names that will mean revert\" but rather the stocks earliest on the S-curve that can take market share and grow at a high rate for a long period of time. So if you must pick individual stocks, I suggest you gravitate more toward those (i.e. the businesses that will certainly be bigger in 1/3/5/10 years rather than the value investing cigar butts whose future is seriously in question like GME/JCP/LB/etc).",

        "body": "So full disclosure that I own this stock at these levels and have some bias, but I guess I\u2019m not incredibly clear on what the thesis is here. I\u2019m also just rattling stuff off as I wait for my work computer to be fixed.\n\nIt seems like the point is the company will stop growing as fast, supported by the preannouncement; but I didn\u2019t see a mention of the MSD to LDD % sales growth being in-line with consensus growth expectations even prior to the preannounce. So after the cut in the share price, why do you believe that the market hasn\u2019t factored this?\n\nI noticed you touched on contracting operating margins, but gross margin has expanded this quarter when adjusting out the inventory write down. Is the assumption in margin contraction solely based off looking at the trends? Interestingly, the company\u2019s penetration into mass retail was the reason margins declined, so that cost spend was fueling the expansion. Prior, the company was very nimble with a most variable cost structure to ramp up production of toys. And that penetration in retail customers actually drove the miss since these retail partners who faced a tough quarter (there\u2019s no shortage of articles on retail stores missing on comps for the holiday season) limited their orders, which caused the company to pull back shipments. That being said, it seems very plausible that the online channel may see more volume going forward, as pre orders appear to be selling out online. Maybe that could also drive margin expansion.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m curious as to why GME has dedicated section. Yes, it\u2019s 9% of revenues, but I\u2019m curious as to why you don\u2019t think they could shift that to another B&amp;M store. From what I\u2019ve seen, places like Hot Topic, Barnes &amp; Noble, and the branded calendar store stock Pops.\n\nThen for the valuation: in regards to a 3x EV/EBITDA multiple, the stock has generally traded at a 4.5-5x. It\u2019s also traded at a premium historically to other toy companies. Why do you believe the multiple significantly contracts? Just because of lessening growth? Then for the WACC, I believe these US toy companies have an industry WACC of ~7% so what\u2019s driving 11%?\n\nThen with a sell, I\u2019d assume the action is more short than sell if you hold. What\u2019s a catalyst here? Earnings despite preannouncement?\n\nThe downside risk of of license losses also doesn\u2019t seem particularly relevant considering the company has never lost a license in its history despite holding a huge breadth.\n\nThe biggest bear case I\u2019ve heard is that Funko Pops are a commodity product, which will cause them to stop growing. But at such low levels, running my fast DCF seems to imply both no growth and significant margin contraction to hit the market price. As for a commodity product, I don\u2019t believe most people are buying Pops because they just want every Pop. It seems like it\u2019s a nicely packaged product to display fandom for a license.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m just word vomiting here so take everything above with a grain of salt, too.",

I care about business fundamentals and buying stuff that is cheap that will grow.  Everything else is just noise.  In 3 years it won't matter.\n3. A stock is only as safe as your understanding of risk.  If you're asking the question, you don't know how to measure risk yet.  If you must buy something, buy an index fund or broad based etf with a low expense ratio so you get an understanding of the process.  A few good books..Dhando Investor by Monish Pabrai, The Education of a Value Investor by Guy Spier, and The Rebel Allocation by jake Farnham.\n4. Put some time into reading some 10-K's.  A company will tell you what they are going to do, see if they follow through and actually create value.  Check out Focused Compounding on Youtube.  They have a recent video where they walk through a 10K of Gamestop on screen and talk about it.  Will help you understand what to look for.  There are many ways to value a business depending on the type so the answer, unfortunately, is \"it depends\".  I invest mostly in value, so I start with EV/EBIT then use financial distress metrics to weed out bad seeds.  Check out [koyfin.com](https://koyfin.com).  It's free, and it's a great tool to get basic information on most stocks.  You can setup some pretty nifty charts and watch lists.  Until you fully understand what goes into valuing a business, using a tool that just hands you an answer that can't actually justify can lead you to think something is under or over valued when its not.  They are great once you know what they are doing, but in the mean time just hop on Investopedia and learn about what the ratios mean and what they represent on the earning reports.  Then look at some stocks that you know, and look at how they've changed the last 10 years and what they' done (invested in new technology, bought back shares, increased dividends).  Look at how those changes impacted the ratios over time.  It will start to make sense. \n5. The more you understand how to value a business, the more you will realize that other people's opinions are just opinions.  The Rebel Allocator by Jake Farnham is a great story that will explain the basics, I highly recommend it for someone just starting out.  I actually look for companies that aren't covered as much as it's easier to find undervalued companies that way.  The market is not rational.  I hate stocks that jump around due to sensationalist headlines when no fundamental change in the business occurred.  It's just noise.  You can understand and assign probabilities about what direct a stock is heading in using technical analysis and momentum metrics.  They are complex and far from foolproof.  It takes years to master and even the best are often wrong. \n6. This is a question even the greats cannot answer.  There are many different successful strategies that would have different criteria.  Check out The Investors Podcast with Preston Pysch and Stig Broderson.  Start from Episode 1, and go in order.  It's a free education on how to invest from a value perspective.  You don't have to invest that way, but it covers basic fundamentals on things that have been very successful historically.  The only thing that will make you truly better is committing to the practice.  You need to have a passion for it as the learning never ends.  You will constantly learn new things and tweak your process to something that works for you and your risk tolerance.  It takes time, but it's worth it to be in charge of your own destiny.  \n\nSorry and I can't dive into detailed specifics.  There is no right way to do this.  The right way is the one that works for you.  You have to invest the time to figure it out for yourself.  Check out a few of the resources I mentioned, I promise you won't be disappointed.  Best of luck.  Hopefully this was somewhat helpful.",
