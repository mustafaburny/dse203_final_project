I'm trying to gain as much cash as possible Right now for the climb up. So far I'm mainly using invers ETFs like SQQQ but I think I'll switch to the DOW inverse because of how powerful Microsoft is on NASDAQ. I'm going to try some puts on health insurance companies on Monday as I believe a big hit will come when Bernie gets the nomination.

Yes they disrupted the taxi industry but they left the door open for any other competitor.

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

        "body": "A) I think you underestimate the impact this virus had on the \\*global\\* supply chain. Saying it is priced in is retarded because we don't even know what the exact impact is yet. We know it's very bad; we just don't know if it's bad or horrible yet. But consider this. Stock market is down around 25% now. Almost an entire quarter (so far) has seen, based on current estimates, somewhere between a 60-80% reduction in supply chain. Since we don't know what the future holds, I think 25% down is pretty accurate. If this continues even more and further disrupts the supply chain, well then the market will fall even more.\n\nB) You are forgetting that the market was already **waaaaaaaay** overvalued. I cannot stress the word \"waaaaaaaay\" enough. Even for the best performing stonks which can't go tits up both short and long term (MA for example) was severely overpriced. And even after their 20% reduction in price, they are still overvalued by **a lot**. Maybe you are right and the market goes up on Monday but over the next 1-2 months the probability of it continuing its overall downtrend is pretty high (fuck off **\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b**s).\n\nC) Black swan event as another Redditor mentioned already. We can't predict these things but when they happen, falls tend to be much more than your usual \"correction.\" Add in the fact this is not only an economic problem (supply chain) but a medical one as well with no vaccine/shot as of yet (and still no understanding of how to combat it), and it's not a pretty situation.\n\nDonald Pump and the medical community are trying to downplay this by comparing it to the regular flu, where roughly 80K people/year die from it. However, beervirus has a 2-3% death rate while the regular flu has a 0.1% death rate. Additionally and more importantly, the flu doesn't spread like this new one. When have you EVER heard of someone in California getting the flu and people in bumblefuck Latvia are worried about that person in Cali? Never. This IS something different than the regular flu. Again, you may be right about Monday specifically, but I don't see how the market recovers over the next 1-2 months (at least).",

        "body": "Hey guys, \n\nI don't know if this is the right place, but we own a facility that manufactures n95 masks (and on approx. March 15th, we'll also produce surgical masks) in China (Zaozhuang, Shandong specifically). We have a 500,000sq ft facility with a dedicated ISO class 5 Cleanroom for our 300,000 daily n95 production capabilities (and 1MM masks a day for surgical masks once it's at full operation) and we are taking bulk orders (10,000 pc minimum) for shipment within China, our clients are usually in charge of export as there simply isn't enough time for our limited employees to deal with exports. We supply to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in China called XiuZheng pharmaceutical group \u4fee\u6b63\u96c6\u56e2 and have sold millions of our n95 respirators to them. We also supply millions of n95 respirators to Xiaomi \u5c0f\u7c73, the phone company. We've had clients export to Russia, HK and US, though I'm not quite sure the exact logistics they went through. Some clients use freight forwarding companies.\n\nThe material costs have tripled in the last month alone so our masks are currently more expensive than usual, but people are nonstop purchasing due to the shortages. Hopefully we can help you get what you're looking for.  \n\nOur current pricing for n95 mask is 14rmb ($2 USD equivalent) for smaller orders of 10,000pcs+, 13 rmb ($1.86) for 50,000+, 12 rmb ($1.72) for 100,000pcs+, 11rmb ($1.57) for 1,000,000+ and 10rmb for 10,000,000+. This does not include shipping cost by SF Express which will be Cash on Delivery. It also does not include 10% taxes if applicable. Please keep in mind that material prices are constantly shifting so this may be out of date when you see this. Just two weeks ago (2/12/2020) our price per N95 mask was 18rmb while our prices in January was 4rmb! Once materials run out we cannot purchase them unless we pay a crazy amount for example, one ton of raw material used to cost 20,000 rmb, now for the same ton of n95 material costs 380,000-800,000 rmb, which is literally up to 40 times the cost for the same exact material. There is a global shortage of n95 grade materials.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me on Wechat or Whatsapp if you want to place orders. \n\nMy Wechat ID is: franktsaur and my WhatsApp ID is +16269916596. I am based in Los Angeles, but I work with the Asia team remotely. \n\nSincerely, \nFrank T.",

I'm trying to gain as much cash as possible Right now for the climb up. So far I'm mainly using invers ETFs like SQQQ but I think I'll switch to the DOW inverse because of how powerful Microsoft is on NASDAQ. I'm going to try some puts on health insurance companies on Monday as I believe a big hit will come when Bernie gets the nomination. I've never done puts before, just did a couple hours of research on them so I feel comfortable now to try it out even if I lose a few hundred dollars.",

Made 20 grand long on Tesla shares and then Tesla puts end of day today on some quick whatever trades. \n\n And then one of my covid patients died. It was expected, but sad. Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day.

In 2008, I was too young to fully grasp what was going on, in 2020 and one business/economics degree later I am now consciously riding this batshit insane rollercoaster and its breathtaking.\n\nOn the one hand I am terrified of the prospects, on the other hand its just too fucking exciting to stop. Holy shit, I mean Germany and the UK just each pledged literally UNLIMITED money to prop up the economy and the indices dont even flinch. \n\nIt's addiciting and terrifiying at the same time.

Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle.

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",

Massive blowouts and all the subjective things were in their favor.  Low China exposure, check.  Where is the sales strength?  The lucrative data center, check. How's the pipeline? exciting new product is imminent, check.  They're better diversified now, unlike their last breakout which was fuelled by shaky cryptocurrency speculation. \n\nSeeing the stock drop after we already know how the business is doing can sometimes be like a free look into the future.  \n\nThat said, Nvidia was pretty casual about corona/China.  So maybe it will emerge that they haven't been conservative enough.  If so, the stock will be punished.  \n\n\n\nContrast that with MSFT who sells digital bits and has little sales exposure or supply chain exposure, yet they gave themselves a pass with their statement.\n\n\n\nHowever what's your risk/reward?  I held in through ER with a target of $330.  Even if it were magically achieved this week, is $275 to $330 the best reward for the risk?  I'm looking more at VMW which is down from $206 to $120 and only 7.5 P/E compared to NVDA 60 P/E, which will likely be rising as some sales will be deferred due to corona virus.",

I\u2019m not arguing against science, but predictions masquerading as hard science are driven by the outcomes the person wants people to believe while reinforcing their own status as expert. Sometimes that\u2019s conscious, sometimes not. \n\nBottom line - predict the worst and it turns out better - \u201cofficials\u201d worked hard to avoid that scenario. Great work team! Worst case happens- well, you predicted it and are an Oracle. There\u2019s nothing to be gained by a tempered estimate if you\u2019re an official in any capacity. I don\u2019t think anyone can argue the fact that most news right now is just a repurposing of political axes to grind.",

That's only because if you start (and continue) to invest because you somehow believe \"I should start investing\" or \"I should be consistently investing\" (what brokers would have you believe, to ensure their survival) rather than \"I have found a good investment\" then you will always invest an inopportune moments. Buffett invests on very long timelines, using historical trends and ratios as a guide, whereas many investors look at more recent information, and only start investing at the point where recent history shows good returns. I'd say when recent history shows poor returns but long term history shows good, and the particular company you're looking to invest in has some kind of difficult to emulate competitive advantage (be it financial, operational, market, or some combination thereof) then go and invest. Otherwise, keep your money on the sidelines (and let it pile up) whilst you observe the market/industries/companies and wait for a great opportunity to buy. This is what the Oracle does, I think.",

        "body": "Great question. \n\nCompanies have been developing a new model for delivery of their services. Traditional IT is considered on-prem or on premise technologies. That can range from servers to applications. Technology vendors have been developing \u201ccloud\u201d technology for years and have been pushing this to market. However, because true cloud or \u201cpublic cloud\u201d is hosted in a vendors data center people are skeptical of using vendors because they don\u2019t control everything. This means all the responsibility is on the vendors to secure everything. \n\nSince cloud is the new way of deploying IT solutions and people are starting to accept the model more governments want in on the benefits of cloud. \n\nBut since the government won\u2019t be in full control of the cloud (see Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Oracle gov data centers) they need a way to ensure security, deployment, and capabilities are met. This is called fedramp. There are multiple levels in getting certified for usage from the government.",
