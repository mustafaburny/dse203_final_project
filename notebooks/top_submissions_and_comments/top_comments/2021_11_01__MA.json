That the Belt and Road initiative is just neo colonialism to steal resources and strategic ports from poor nations. That the Uighurs face slave labor and genocide by controlling birth rates and harvesting organs like Falun Gong practitioners. \n\nChina is not a free, fair, or open market. Ask Jack Ma who got disappeared by them. Look at their national security laws, and how they annex neighborhoods and force their will on them. How they alter maps and globes to include the 9 dash line and pretend it is part of Chinese territory like the Scarborough shoal despite court rulings.\n\nSo tell me how elections matter when China can decide who is on the ballot to prevent a true opposition and use the national security law to disappear opposition?\n\nCall me a typical American, but my eyes are open to the actions of the CCP.",

What I do for one company normally takes 3-5 hours, and I try to do it quarterly for any company I own.\n\nI will usually start by collecting the company's past, current and future valuation metrics.  Things like price to sales, price to earnings, price to forward earnings, debt ratios, etc.  I compare the 5 year averages to what they currently are.  I also do for their competitors and companies in the same financial space (for example, I'd look at Visa, Mastercard, and other card companies together).  I look at past growth and projected growth to see if I think the valuations are justifiable where they currently are.\n\nI look through the financial statements and try to spot trends in cash flow, debt, margin, and many other things to see how the company is performing yoy and qoq.\n\nI look at how the company is engaging with the industry and where they are projecting their growth to come from.  Are the expanding market share, is the sector growing, etc.  I need the company to justify why it can achieve or surpass their growth estimates.\n\nI listen to their most recent conference calls and look though any articles I can find, but I heavily discount opinion pieces.  I actively seek out reasons why this company will fail.\n\nAfter all of this, I try to put together a balanced view of where the company is valued now vs historically and also vs their competition.  It requires a lot of projection and assumptions and I only do it for companies that I can understand their business model.  You have to go into the process without bias, and to be honest the majority of companies that I do this for aren't buys at the time.",

Not many of the basic electronic components everything else is built from are made in the US. American companies like Vishay, Microchip, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx either operate factories in China or contract foundries in China or Taiwan. Other large supplies of ours are not even American such as Yageo and TE Connectivity aren't even headquartered in the US and manufacturer the bulk of their product in their home country. It's been a big issue for my portion of the defense industry the past couple of years because these factories in China are also sourcing a large portion of counterfeit electronic components on the market.\n\nI know we're not the only defense manufacturer using Chinese components because I've seen several news articles and reports from the DOD claiming this is a problem.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/10/us-military-reliance-china-foreign-suppliers-expos/\n\nPanasonic and Murata (Japanese) used to produce critical components of our products, but have since stopped selling to us because they don't want their products used in munitions. When that happened the government fronted a lot of money to a couple American companies to produce an alternative since none existed.",

Instagram is being replaced by Tik Tok with younger users. Nobody young wants to be on facebook anymore now that it's filled with geriatrics, so FB is much more instagram heavy than in the past for younger users, and reliant on some really politically controversial groups to extract money out of facebook. Yes, they currently have a stranglehold on social media advertising, but I think their \"moat\"  is nonexistent compared to companies like Amazon, Apple,  Google, and Microsoft. Apple, Amazon, and Google especially-those are three exceptionally innovative companies compared to FB.",

MSFT is probably the safest and most solid tech company right now with the best credit, and tons of cash, etc, etc basically hard to find weak spots. If this person really wants serious advice I'd say count your blessings and get out of the meme stocks and into lower risk, maybe some etfs. There are a lot of sectors that were ignored that are poised to do well. If you really want individual stocks maybe NOK or RYAAY.

I have three kids, aged 14, 12, &amp; 10. About 7 years ago they were each given 10k from their grandpa to open an investment account. I opened an account for each them here in Australia trading on the ASX. I\u2019ve only purchased blue chip shares that pay 4-10% returns year in year out, and all those dividends are reinvested back in to those stocks when issued. Each birthday I give them $1000 to add to their portfolios, and $1000 each at Xmas. The eldest two are sitting on almost 75k each, and the youngest is just under 70k. \n\nBy the time they\u2019re 21 and have access to their accounts, they should have around 150k perhaps more if the bank of mum and dad don\u2019t raid it\ud83e\udd23. It gives them a leg up to start their lives. They\u2019re not allow to blow it on cars etc, they can use a bit for travel, but I\u2019m hoping it can get them in to the property market and or keep the portfolio going until they\u2019re much older. They\u2019ve had one really lucky break with one share which has doubled and makes up good slice of their portfolio and pays big dividends each year. That aside it\u2019s been pretty basic investments. If it was the US market it would stocks like MSFT, CRM, TSLA, AAPL that I\u2019ve tipped money in to. So relatively low risk and just playing the long game and I\u2019ve not sold a single share in that time. \n\nChrist I wished my parents had done a similar thing for me and my sisters when I was young.",

But there's more to it, it's a mommy-dominated social media platform and it's the 14th largest in the world at that, with 454 million monthly active users. The user base is there, the influence is there, the potential is definitely there. There's a reason why Microsoft was willing to pay a premium of roughly 86 per share to acquire the company.\n\nWhich leads us to why the stock is falling, they didn't get acquired, which means that they believe they can grow it better than the 86 per share valuation, but then in a span of less than a year, the management managed (pardon the pun) to drive the stock price down to half or less than half of what Microsoft originally offered due to their management.\n\nWith the reason you mentioned, bad guidance attributed to covid reopening, and the disappointing earning reports over the last 2 quarters.
