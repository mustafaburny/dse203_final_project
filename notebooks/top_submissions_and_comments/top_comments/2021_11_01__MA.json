You integrate it into your site, and it\u2019s like 3 redirects to pay for something and it always prompts users to create a PayPal account for some reason, and when you can just embed an iFrame from Mastercard for virtually the same commission there\u2019s no point. It costs the same for an annoying clunky interface. Integrating it as a payment provider made sense when there were limited alternatives, but now it sucks compared to the competition.",

Don't forget that the CCP decided overnight to decide ANT wasn't a thing, taking a quarter of BABA's value down by a quarter, because Jack Ma said something they didn't like. It's not really a \"free market\" over there. I'm not saying that will happen, but there is a fundamental and huge element of risk investing in Chinese stocks that you don't have to take into account in the US market, and I think it's important to be aware of that. A Chinese company can have the best financials in the world and you can still lose everything you invest with them. You could make a pile of money too, but the \"unknown\" element in China is way bigger than many people account for, and the more heavily invested people are in the Chinese market the more their confirmation bias will tell them that the risk isn't real.

        "body": "ill do a bear case. i was looking at pypl as a btd opportunity when it happened. i researched and found a few key points worth considering. firstly, a good thing pypl has is a good ecosystem. they have multiple products and services that covers a wide variety of needs such as p2p thru venmo, ipos systems through zettle and obviously b2c transactions through pypl. this ecosystem is good for pypl as attracting 1 user through 1 product will likely get them onboard the other products as well. management also seems to be focused on acquistions to grow market share, some ppl view that to be a good thing, i personally dont really like that approach. it is also an inflation hedge since it is a % of transactions so as product prices go up, so do their transactions. alls good and well so far, but looking at growth prospects is what drove me away. they have multiple big companies going after the same market which is payment services. (V, MA, SHOP, AMZN etc). some of their competitors have 1 key edge over pypl which is an integrated business model. this wld mean online platforms will begin to stray away from paypal as they start to use their own payment services to cut down on costs. furthermore, there are multiple (over 20k) bad reviews on paypal, which is sizeable considering the good reviews are like 5-6k. this made me less bullish so i had to factor that into my growth model. as such, i used a more modest financial analysis. a 10% growth rate till 2026 and a 14% discount rate gives me a fair value of $124 for 2021. perhaps i should have given a higher growth rate or a lower discount rate because the longer tjme goes on the lower my fair value will be since discount rate&gt;growth rate. i just cannot increase my growth expecrarion since i beliece that pypl will lose market share although it is in a growing industry",

They grew less than 20% in 4 years, which translates to less than 5% YoY.\n\nAnd yeah, SQ and PYPL don't even come close, but they are growing at a much faster rate, along with other fintech solutions.

When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term.

My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.",

Everybody that matters in the market knows what it is, and they all knew it was going to pass the house. Remember, it had strong support by both parties in the senate months ago when it was passed. People have mentioned buying related ETFs (I.e PAVE) and construction companies (like CAT) for that entire time for this reason. Basically, it\u2019s priced in.\n\n2. Besides allowing for news,  speculation and possibly improved forward guidance (all priced in imo) this bill isn\u2019t going to make these companies more valuable overnight. It will take a long time for them to get these projects/money, and even longer for them to report their financial improvements from this, which does have an impact on stock prices. Even then, this is probably priced in.\n\nI hesitate to say this is 100% priced in right now because there are probably retail traders buying in, but the term \u201csell the news\u201d exists for a reason. In general, retail traders tend to buy the top and sell at the bottom, and this event will (probably not) be an exception.",

So you can sell it and take what the contract is worth right now. Or exercise it. Exercising means you'll be purchasing 100 shares at the strike price of which you bought the option for, you pay per share the strike price. So you bought .03 cent option strike price. You pay .03 cents for each share of 100. You then own 100 share of Said company, this is for going long on a company. There's much to option but it really isn't that hard to understand once you begin learning and understanding. Cause when you purchase a option contract your buying the \"rights\" to 100 shares of said company. Options are a tricky game but is a good game when played strongly. If you knew a stock was going up and you purchased many calls you can profit more for calls than buying said stock. Puts are like shorting, when you expect a stock to go down. Again man, I'm sure I'm making it confusing but YouTube it and read about it. Took me a minute to understand and then took me like months to understand completely across the whole options playing field",

It's been a fun ride but the operational mishaps surrounding the iBuyer segment have been disappointing. Not to say that COVID hasn't dogged the model but the whole model was really predicated on executional excellence from the top down but that has clearly failed to come to fruition. And if the $Z can't do it then i'd venture to say that the other iBuyers are likely having a tough go of it as well, but only time will tell whether this is $Z specific or if the model fundamentally needs to be rethought.  \n\n\nIt's been a fun ride $Z, but i'm out.

From what I understand, they're looking at starting a stock trading platform which should see revenues grow in the future. And, with their acceptance of cryptocurrencies, I imagine there might be deals being signed elsewhere for them to be a payment provider on more platforms. That's just my speculation though.\n\nI got in at $212. Will stop looking at the charts for now, and check back in a few months. For now, it's a long-term hold for me.",
