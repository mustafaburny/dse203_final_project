During the same time Robinhood was down on that high volume day this past spring, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and several others were down as well, or restricted trades to phone based trades only (which have an additional fee).  \n3) This most recent news has nothing to do with Robinhood.

Anyone can stream nearly anything for free or very cheap subscriptions. 30 years ago you had to spend 10-20 dollars to buy one album, nowadays that seems like an absurdity to the average consumer. Ease of access means there is now a panoply of genres and bands. Artists have bypassed large studios and large labels because technology now allows them to record at home with a little investment in equipment, self-publish and promote their work through sites like bandcamp, soundcloud and social media in general. Labels used to be the great gatekeepers and help fund recording sessions; that's not how the industry works anymore. I love music, but I don't think the future of the industry will be as profitable as it used to be, by a long shot.",

        "body": "A company splits its stock to increase liquidity.\n\nConsider Berkshire Hathaway, with a share price north of $250K. If a shareholder needs to liquidate enough stock to raise $100K, they can't do it without selling more than twice that value of BRK-A. So maybe they'll pick something else to sell instead that's more right-sized for the amount of money they need. Now consider an individual investor with \"only\" $100K to invest. That person can't buy even one share of BRK-A. In both cases, the high share price discouraged investors from trading the stock -- it inhibits liquidity. If BRK-A did a 3-for-1 stock split then those two investors could work out a trade with each other.\n\nThere are three reasons companies don't split stock:\n\n1. They feel it's prestigious to have a high per-share stock price.\n2. They prefer having lower liquidity because it causes the population of investors holding your shares to trend toward being wealthier and trading less frequently. That can provide greater stability for the stock price in normal times.\n3. Splitting the stock isn't free. It requires you to pay lawyers, publish notifications to shareholders, and so on. Companies prefer not to incur expenses without a clear payoff.\n\nEDIT: I guess I'll also explain why a company might like a more liquid stock. A more liquid stock will track more closely to its true market value. A low-liquidity stock can drop in price very sharply if it's hard for buyers to purchase it. Go back to that investor who needed to raise $100K. Now suppose that guy **ONLY** has BRK-A and he **HAS** to sell it. Because of the high share price, there's a smaller pool of investors who have the money to buy it from him. Desperate seller + small buyer pool means that seller can get screwed. Maybe in desperation he'll sell for $200K instead of the $250K+ the stock is worth... well then the market sees **ALL** of those shares as worth only $200K and the share price plummets. Now of course the price isn't really determined by what one guy does, but in a crisis a lot of sellers can find themselves in the same boat and it can happen.\n\nThis kind of liquidity problem is why the US Fed recently started buying up bond ETFs -- desperate sellers + small buyer pool would have put the price of those bonds through the floor *even though the bonds are actually still valuable* had the Fed not stepped in. Because the Fed has the money to buy anything, it can buy those bonds at a normal market price from anyone and let the price decline in a less terrifying way for everyone involved. When analysts talk about the Fed \"providing liquidity,\" this is what they mean.",
