        "body": "Sure, but it's not just the amount of data you have that matters \u2014 it's the quality and fidelity of it, what you do with it, and how you leverage it against existing datasets. How the algorithms themselves are told to look at the data is also incredibly important. \n\nSo, for instance, Tesla has a lot real-world data coming in, but the fidelity of that... isn't very good. It's just camera data, speed data, etc. -- and [Tesla's cameras are black and white](https://electrek.co/2017/05/16/tesla-autopilot-2-0-can-see/), so they're likely not using much in the way of things like.. colour information to identify stop signs, instead relying on looking for octagonal shapes and text that fits the standard idea of what a stop sign looks like. \n\nTesla's data also has a lot of overlap \u2014 there are plenty of Tesla drivers on the 504, contributing the same data over and over every day. Meanwhile, there aren't so many Tesla drivers taking back roads, or driving in cities where Tesla simply isn't that popular. So every day, you have ten thousand Tesla drivers mapping the same section of the 504, and not much else. \n\nCompare that to Waymo, which, through Google can leverage StreetView car data \u2014 which has the core aim of mapping *every road* at least *once*, in high fidelity 360\u00ba full-colour. Google already knows how to, for instance, read text via their work with *Captcha* \u2014\u00a0which means that when Tesla is looking for an octagon with squiggles in it that look like what we recognize as an \ud835\ude82, a \ud835\ude83, an \ud835\ude7e, and a \ud835\ude7f... Google is looking for an red octagon with the word **STOP** on it. \n\nThis is one very basic example, and there are thousands of others from recognizing pedestrians to understanding how to find an address, identify populated areas, understanding roadworks, and so on and so forth \u2014 each one of those requires another attempt at either training the algorithm or training a set of algorithms to help train each other. \n\nThere's a saying in the industry \u2014 [\"garbage in, garbage out\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out) \u2014 meaning it's not just the data you have that is important, but the quality of it and what you do with it, and that's especially important when it comes to something like self-driving cars. \n\nWaymo has proven they understand this, and while Tesla is still leagues ahead of most of the other players in the market, they've still yet to prove that they're doing considerably good work with the (yes, vast) amounts of data they've accrued.",

I bought a few shares of this a while back and I've been pleased with the results. It seems to be less susceptible to the ups and downs of the market than SPY/VOO, and the growth rate has been decent. (This has been around less than 10 years, so not a long track record)\n\nTHNQ: This one is more speculative; An ETF focused on AI/robotics. Also mostly small and mid-cap companies involved in robotics and AI.  Top holdings include iRobot, VEEV, WIX, TWLO, MDB. (This has also been around less than 10 years; no track record)\n\nYou can go wrong with a Technology focused ETF from a company like Vanguard or Fidelity. These companies have been around a long time and they basically know what they are doing.  Generally speaking, you are right; the technology sector has outpaced most (or all) other sectors over the past 20 years or so, and there is good reason to think it will continue to do so; although the health care sector has also done quite well. I'm a fan of the Clean/Renewable energy sector, which I think is only going to get bigger as time goes on, but it doesn't have much of a track record to go on.",

For larger projects contractors buy this glass to put it in buildings they are building.\n\nPPG doesn't even make glass anymore. They only make paint. Their glass sector looks like it was bought by Vitro and is traded on MXN.\n\nYou literally have corning in there.
