        "body": "Yea that's a good question (tldr at end).  For some stocks it can be like 5+ years.  For sure, Tesla won't realize it's fundamentals until like 5+ years, and even then, it can pull a MSFT in which it goes from a blue chip to a blue chip + growth stock (with Azure), in which case, it still may not fully realize that part of it's fundamentals until we know how big cloud will be.\n\nBut when I invest, my target is always like 2+ years for all my stocks and for the stock market as a whole.  That's why I've always been buying this entire time, since even though we can definitely sell off short term back to say 240, I know long term, the stock market will be better than 280.  More importantly, I am confident the individual stocks I pick will be better than what they are currently longer term.  That's why a DCA approach is a fairly standard and safe approach.  Of course, you can adjust this DCA approach to be way more aggressive on drops and less aggressive on up moves (like buy way less on a day like today, if today was your set buying date).  I don't worry about the market going down short term for my long term investments.  Plus, if you look, so many tech stocks, like MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, NFLX, etc. are all up for the year despite this!\n\nNow, for trading, you can also trade the fundamentals in the short term - which would be months here.  If you believe the economy will be slower to return to work, if the Q1 and Q2 earnings will be bad, if the vaccine will take longer than normal, if social distincing in a way still continues even after we open up, if consumer demand is less, if the credit problem comes back, etc., or some combination of that, you can trade that.  So for example, you can buy like a 3 month 15% OTM put or something.  Perhaps you believe QQQ &gt; IWM (that's what I believe), so in that case, maybe if you are long QQQ, you can short IWM as a market hedge.  So many ways to trade that.\n\ntldr: \n\nTrading should be on either short term TECHNIALS (days - weeks) or short term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be months)\n\nInvesting should be on long term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be years).  I'm a believer in the US Economy and particularly the tech sector and a few non-tech stocks like COST, so I will always invest when I have the chance to do so, without having to always try to predict the bottom.  Predicting the bottom or the top is best used in the above trading section.",

Buffet evaluates what he thinks a company should be worth before looking at the stock price and sees how it compares. The guy in the big short saw systemic flaws in the mortgage industry and traded on that. Both are frequently wrong short term, but usually right long term. If you think Microsoft (just picking a company) has the management, products, vision, and capabilities to double their income in 10 years, you should buy them regardless of what their stock price is or does over the next year.

        "body": "Jesus H Christ. There is so much conspiracy theory in here that it would be impossible to maintain if this was even remotely true. The fact of markets is that its driven by 80% financial institutions who are not barred from holding short positions. The market is irrational in the short term, but its never irrational long term. \n\nTake a look at the VIX, its at 42. This implies that SPY can move 12% up or down as driven by premium prices. This means that the underwriters of options (the guys you buy options from) are pricing in this movement. Now lets look at SPY's movement the last 2 weeks, gee what do you know? its moved up 12% well within the expected volatility of the market. \n\nThis means that the SPY index can swing up or down 12% within this month, and it will mean absolutely NOTHING. It would be considered random noise.\n\nNow during the last 2 weeks we've had 2 uncertainties become certain.\n\n1. PPP was activated and disbursed\n2. Fed commited to buying Equity based securities\n\nThese were the 2 big driving factors of the gains.\n\nNow if you scrutinized the winners and losers of the last 2 weeks of gains, you can notice a theme. Companies like MSFT/AMD/NVDA/Netflix are rewarded. Can you think of a rational reason why that is? Compared to say BA? This is proof the market is evaluating companies rationally corp to corp.\n\nNext, I want all the bears to understand that in the history of 100 years of equity movement, the stocks only moved down 4% of the time ( vs 96% of the time up) and in addition, bear markets only lasted 200 days on average. With the way algos reacted and the fed, you can expect this bear market to be compressed at LEAST by a factor of 2. Lets say 100 days. Now we've had market reaction for over 60 days now. this means, we are likely already halfway through this market correction statistically.\n\nKnowing the above quantifications, how many are actually brave enough to continue to short? It makes no sense logically given the above.",

As many of you know, 90% of our work force has been working from home, jiggling the mouse every 15 minutes to appear active in Microsoft Teams, while beating their dicks raw to porn and day drinking in their underwear for the past 45 days.\n\nThe remaining 10% of our work force has been designated as essential employees, and have been in the office compiling reports about which of these dick beaters will be the first that we let go upon the grand re-opening of the US economy.  Laying off at least half of our dick beating workforce will save us enough cash to be able to start buying back shares of our stonks again, boosting EPS by {UNREASONABLE\\_PERCENTAGE}.\n\nThanks to the free money printer, we haven't had to outlay much working capital to continue to pay our work from home employees, as JPOW has been cranking that money crank till his eyes started bleeding and he had to hire an intern to take over.  In addition, team JPOW has been buying up our high yield bonds that we've been issuing, further preparing us to continue our very efficient stonk buyback program.\n\nWhile we can't issue guidance at this time, we all here at {COMPANY} want you to know that we are very excited about what 2021 is going to look like.",

        "body": "For anyone wondering about the reserve build they speak to, I'd like to add a couple of points;\n\n- It includes the impact of adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard (CECL /ASC 326). \n\n- Key difference between old GAAP and new GAAP is that you must now estimate the lifetime expected credit loss for your loans adjusted for forecasted conditions. **So as of these 3/31 results, the increase in expected credit loss from the current portfolio over its entire life is $6.8B - to the extent of the capability &amp; accuracy of JPM's model, this is as bad is it gets.** \n\n- Day 1 (1/1/20 no COVID) impact goes through retained earnings (i.e. no income statement impact), but subsequent measurement (i.e. 3/31/20 big COVID) goes through income. Hence the massive pop in reserves.\n\n- They're likely using a multi scenario weighted model and would have shifted the weightings to reflect the COVID environment; think something like 80-10-10 of most stressed economic environment:moderate stressed economic environment:baseline\n\n- Subsequent Q's won't see as big an income statement impact as the delta between prior Q provision (officially Allowance for Credit Losses) and current Q provision shouldn't be as vast.\n\n- You effectively had a black swan event for this adoption where 1/1/20 (it's effective date), you wouldn't have weighted a stressed economic environment as heavily (if at all, we nearly had the tip in 30,000 DJI almost as recently as Feb), versus 3/31/20 the remeasurement date where you have to account for, well virtually total cessation of normal economic activity.\n\nSo when they speak to building reserves (FASB will have a conniption at that language btw), they've assessed their entire portfolio for lifetime expected credit loss. You see the numbers pop particularly in cards, which are unsecured and your loss given default would to all intents and purposes be 100% vs mortgage loans where you've collateral. \n\nAlso important to bear in mind that since ~2018 the bigger lenders have been keeping higher quality mortgage loans on the books (basically they aren't selling top quality 800 FICO stuff to FNMA FMCC much if at all). Those ratings factor into the modeling which leads me to believe that their +$6.8B is pretty accurate.\n\nJPM are very well placed to weather this, as they were in 2008. It's a well run shop under Dimon.\n\n**TL;DR: The EPS miss is due to new accounting rules &amp; watch out for any bank who chooses to defer implementation (CARES relief) as it likely means their numbers on the 3/31 run were pretty bad**",

        "body": "I'm just gonna jump in here because it isn't the first time I've seen \"short squeeze\" seemingly used incorrectly and I feel like maybe some of you don't really understand what it is. The chart we are seeing now cannot be a short squeeze nor can it be a \"short squeeze in reverse\".\n\nShorting a stock means you're borrowing shares from your broker and selling them to someone at the current price. The idea being that you think the price will go down and then you can buy them back at a lower price. So if you short XYZ today at $100/share and buy them back tomorrow at $90/share, you've made $10/share. If, on the other hand, the stock goes up to $110, you've lost $10/share.\n\nNow the tricky thing about shorting a stock is that there is no limit to the upside (of the stock price). When you buy a stock, the maximum you can lose is 100%. You buy it at $100 and it goes to zero, you've lost $100/share and can't lose more. That's it. But if you short a stock, your losses are theoretically unlimited. If you shorted TSLA at $300 you'd be in a world of pain when it hit $950 because that means your losses are $650/share at that point. Your downside (on the trade) is unlimited but your upside is limited to 100% (and that's if the shares go to zero).\n\nFor these reasons, you don't want to short a stock and hold on to it forever like you might if you were long. The pain of holding onto it as the losses mount become too much to bear, but also because you don't have an unlimited amount of money in your account. At some point, you will be FORCED to buy back the stock before the losses outstrip your funds.\n\nSo a short squeeze occurs after a stock has run up considerably and reaches a point where everyone who has shorted the stock is essentially forced to buy it back before it goes too high. At this point, you'll see a huge spike on top of a run up.\n\nThere is no real opposite to a short squeeze because when you hold stocks long, your max loss is 100% and no one is ever forced to sell. You can just hold on until zero. In real life, however, you will often reach a point where people just don't want to lose more money and get out anyway. When everyone is running for the exits and sells their stock at the same time, you'll see a huge downward spike after a run down. This is usually called capitulation and often signals a reversal to an uptrend.",

        "body": "For everyone wondering why the big miss (&amp; you're going to see this with every bank btw).\n\n- It includes the impact of adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard (CECL).\n\n- Day 1 (1/1/20 no COVID) impact goes through retained earnings (i.e. no income statement impact), but subsequent measurement (i.e. 3/31/20 big COVID) goes through income. Hence the massive pop in reserves.\n\n- Key difference between old GAAP and new GAAP is that you must now estimate the lifetime expected credit loss for your loans adjusted for forecasted conditions\n\n- They're likely using a multi scenario weighted model and would have shifted the weightings to reflect the COVID environment; think something like 80-10-10 of most stressed economic environment:moderate stressed economic environment:baseline\n\n- Subsequent Q's won't see as big an income statement impact as the delta between prior Q provision (officially Allowance for Credit Losses) and current Q provision shouldn't be as vast.\n\n- You effectively had a black swan event for this adoption where 1/1/20 (it's effective date), you wouldn't have weighted a stressed economic environment as heavily (if at all, we nearly had the tip in 30,000 DJI almost as recently as Feb), versus 3/31/20 the remeasurement date where you have to account for, well virtually total cessation of normal economic activity.\n\nSo when they speak to building reserves (FASB will have a conniption at that language btw), they've assessed their entire portfolio for lifetime expected credit loss. You see the numbers pop particularly in cards, which are unsecured and your loss given default would to all intents and purposes be 100% vs mortgage loans where you've collateral.\n\nAlso important to bear in mind that since ~2018 the bigger lenders have been keeping higher quality mortgage loans on the books (basically they aren't selling top quality 800 FICO stuff to FNMA FMCC much if at all).\n\nJPM are very well placed to weather this, as they were in 2008. It's a well run shop under Daddy Dimon.\n\n**TL;DR: Watch out for the banks who elect to defer CECL implementation because it likely meant their models adjusted for COVID gave them numbers they didn't want to push through Q1 earnings**\n\n**TL;DR of the TL;DR = Accounting rules fucked EPS in the ass but it shouldn't be as volatile going forward**",

Before 2019, I lost 120K in my lifetime)\n* After Iran bombing in Jan, I entered SPX puts expiring March 17 (lost 200k during  this time)\n* I bag held them until Feb 19 and exited for 520K account ( I got scared as all the dips are being instantaneously bought by bulls on the same day like previous COVID scare for 2 days from china, mysterious intraday drop on Feb 18 and several other days like that)\n* Immediately from the next week of Feb20, the market was in the toilet like crazy turmoil. I kept watching for a couple of weeks beating myself that I missed by 8-10 Million gain by closing my position on Feb19\n* To avoid stress I went leaps on deep 30% ITM BA(at 260), RCL(at 66), LYFT(at 38) calls for 2021 thinking they have super beaten already and deep ITM is safe but to my luck, they went further in the toilet.\n* my position is such that for my leaps to make any money all tickers should actually more than double in price.  so I thought why to bother with options and sold them and just bought shares in BA, Lyft, SAVE at their bottom. By now my account is 160k.\n* Waited a week for pop and exited all these 3 tickers shares for 35% gain and ended the account for 256K\n* Went all in on RGS shares for avg cost of 5.60 (averaged over 3 days but unable to catch bottom as later it went further to 4.20). However, I felt reasonably confident that it will at least $7-8 in 3-4 months considering just the franchise fees.\n* JPOW brrrrr...ing helped for the past week and this morning closed all the stock for avg price of 9.70. Now the account is 450K\n* Maybe making &gt;100% percent on just shares in the past 2/3 weeks feels better even though I still lost over 220kthis year. However, the main kicker is that I will feel worst forever for missing 8-10M gain as I waited so long and exited right before dumping on SPX puts. After missing this kind of once in a lifetime trade, I kind of lost appetite for riskier options thinking I may never beat that missed out trade odds.",

Anyone that's been here for awhile knows that the big subs are basically just a collection of the same jokes or reposts, with almost the same verbatim top comments posted every time. The news section and politics subs are widely considered cancerous, so I stay away from those. I've unsubbed to basically everything except investing related subreddits and r/buildapcsales and r/hardwareswap.\n\nBeing subbed to this small amount of subs has made me realize that even the investing subs are generally pointless too. It's just a collection of the same hive mind posts day after day, with a few actual news or interesting posts every once in awhile. Don't even get me started on WSB, which has devolved into yet another sub where the same 5 jokes have been run into the ground for years. In the months that I've limited myself to these subs, I can't say I've really learned much or bettered myself as an investor. I can only read \"my case for the bear market\" so many times, clearly written by an 18 yr old with limited experience. Am I being pessimistic for wanting to get out of this place?",

        "body": "Yea that's a good question (tldr at end).  For some stocks it can be like 5+ years.  For sure, Tesla won't realize it's fundamentals until like 5+ years, and even then, it can pull a MSFT in which it goes from a blue chip to a blue chip + growth stock (with Azure), in which case, it still may not fully realize that part of it's fundamentals until we know how big cloud will be.\n\nBut when I invest, my target is always like 2+ years for all my stocks and for the stock market as a whole.  That's why I've always been buying this entire time, since even though we can definitely sell off short term back to say 240, I know long term, the stock market will be better than 280.  More importantly, I am confident the individual stocks I pick will be better than what they are currently longer term.  That's why a DCA approach is a fairly standard and safe approach.  Of course, you can adjust this DCA approach to be way more aggressive on drops and less aggressive on up moves (like buy way less on a day like today, if today was your set buying date).  I don't worry about the market going down short term for my long term investments.  Plus, if you look, so many tech stocks, like MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, NFLX, etc. are all up for the year despite this!\n\nNow, for trading, you can also trade the fundamentals in the short term - which would be months here.  If you believe the economy will be slower to return to work, if the Q1 and Q2 earnings will be bad, if the vaccine will take longer than normal, if social distincing in a way still continues even after we open up, if consumer demand is less, if the credit problem comes back, etc., or some combination of that, you can trade that.  So for example, you can buy like a 3 month 15% OTM put or something.  Perhaps you believe QQQ &gt; IWM (that's what I believe), so in that case, maybe if you are long QQQ, you can short IWM as a market hedge.  So many ways to trade that.\n\ntldr: \n\nTrading should be on either short term TECHNIALS (days - weeks) or short term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be months)\n\nInvesting should be on long term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be years).  I'm a believer in the US Economy and particularly the tech sector and a few non-tech stocks like COST, so I will always invest when I have the chance to do so, without having to always try to predict the bottom.  Predicting the bottom or the top is best used in the above trading section.",
