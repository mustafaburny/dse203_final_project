I don't know who is in the lead in this sector, but Neuralink scares the poo outta me. Like that's an idea straight out of the book of revalation... also has a detailed YouTube video if you want to see legit mind reading brain chips.\n\nThese are things I just see as inevitable outcomes in a further corporatized world that is constantly seeking to hedge against liability and produce greater efficiency from an increasingly distracted workforce.

Don\u2019t be afraid of a drop just average costs if it drops dramatically. \n\n- Adobe should do well with this stay at home. School is requiring the use as well as businesses from home. \n\n- Amazon is essentially showing its untouchable currently. I\u2019m large into amazon as well. \n\n- Disney is another powerhouse that you\u2019ll never need to worry about. The lost revenues over the following 8 months could cause a dramatic drop, in this scenario don\u2019t panic and average your cost. \n\n- Enph - energy, I\u2019m not familiar with this company. \n\n- Facebook is another powerhouse good pick. \n\n- Google - Great pick. \n\n- MasterCard is also a good pick, hold this. Average if it comes down to although you shouldn\u2019t have to they trade rather high. If you\u2019re at a major loss with their recent decline. Average in the next 3 months when there\u2019s a better understanding how financials will deal with crisis. (You shouldn\u2019t need to) \n\n- Microsoft - I love microsoft. They are on a tear currently. Teams daily usage is up 12 million users in the last month, this is major. Their competition is \u201cwork\u201d slack technologies who I am also Long. \n\n- Netflix has been great good pick. \n\n- Nike is a great pick. I could expand but they\u2019ve always done well. Constant increase throughout the life of their stock. \n\n- Nvidia is a powerhouse as well. Great pick. \n\n- Starbucks is great. I haven\u2019t followed them through the virus but they\u2019re a strong company large capital, their profits are also great. Good pick. \n\n- Square I like square a lot. Square has major potential in different avenues. Cash app, lending (they just got approved to lend during this time). Prior to the virus square was on a tear. I\u2019m long on this I got in early and am very big on square. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in diversification:\n\nAll that being said you really are big into tech, I would suggest diversification. \n\n\u201cOxy\u201d - occidental petroleum is a good long term stock. They\u2019re trading extremely low currently due to oil wars, corona virus, issues on the board and the purchase of anadarko. (This scares a lot of investors but you seem to want long term investments) it\u2019s a steal at 15$ a share. \n\n- Johnson and Johnson is a powerhouse. \n\n- Jet blue &amp; Delta - long term great investments. Short term extremely risky. \n\n- Walmart: trading high but they\u2019re only going to go even higher when this is over. \n\n- AT&amp;T and Verizon: AT&amp;T trades fairly low with a large dividend. GREAT LONG TERM. Verizon has been extremely strong throughout the years.  \n\n- Ford on the long term has a lot of upside trading around half of its average price. Ford pays dividend and  history has proven America will never let ford fail. \n\n- USO is an ETF that tracks United States Oil, It\u2019s trading extremely low, no reason not to diversify with this. ( The oil war between Saudi and Russia is coming to an end, this should do well in the long term) \n\n- Have you put any though into mutual funds to also diversify ? A good managed funds typically has large returns and low risk. \n\nReach out to me if you\u2019d like.",

Our clients want renewable power, and we make it happen for them, sending out RFPs to developers and getting their project bids. We get a fee from our clients for brokering these projects.
