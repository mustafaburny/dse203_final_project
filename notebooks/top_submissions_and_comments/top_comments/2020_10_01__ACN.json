But more importantly: if you check your positions at exactly market open or exactly market close, you'll see some really wild price fluctuations, I assume driven by algos, that might unfavorably trip your limit/stop orders. For example, I have an ACN leap for 2022 that for a brief moment either skyrockets or craters at market open - I'm talking by quite a lot - and if I had a limit/stop order set for it, it would trigger at that astronomical price but probably wouldn't execute until the very next second, when it reset to a normal price. My brokerage has no way of discerning between algo bullshit and legitimate price fluctuation when it comes to this so it would cause more asspain than it's worth.\n\nJust pick stocks you believe in and let the LEAPs ride.",

They just provide unstructured or structured storage of data (respectively). \n\nData lakes allow you to accumulate all different types of data into a centralized location regardless of how the data was originally sourced/formatted. Warehouses convert data into a certain format/schema which allows users to more easily parse through it.\n\nSo effectively, lakes/warehouses are step 0. Palantir, given the fact that for most of their years in business has employed talented ass data scientists and senior engineers, must have some data storage system/template dependent on each client - could be composed of a number of different lakes/warehouses, maybe some hybrid structures, who knows... that's part of their IP.\n\nThe real interest is *how* they analyze the data. They're using models and algorithms that none of us will understand to find discrepancies across all that information and then make business decisions off it. Splunk, Cloudwatch and other data monitoring services don't even come near that degree of computational work. \n\nAnd I promise you one thing - Accenture does not and will not have even nearly the talent in workforce required to compete with Palantir.",

        "body": "&gt; I'd have thought the Indian giants or someone like Accenture might have still wanted that business.\n\nNewCo's revenues are twice Accenture's.  If anything NewCo might buy one of the Indian giants to get into places that IBM/NewCo aren't in.  They'll be an interesting player in the market though. \n\n I do like the core idea of splitting the value stock part off from the growth stock part.  They quickly attract different kinds of investors and those different kinds of investors allow for management to have an easier time on focus.  NewCo its all about generate lots of free cash flow.  IBM gets to focus on leading business technologies and growth.",
