        "body": "I agree with all your points. In terms of business similarity (not at all investing prospect similarities) I think of tech companies as:\n\n- chip/components/data center hardware: NVDA, AMD, INTC, QCOM, TXN\n- fabrication: TSM (I don't follow anything else sorry)\n- PaaS: MSFT, AMZN, IBM/RedHat, GOOG (trying aggressively)\n- SaaS/Software: MSFT, GOOG, ORCL, IBM/RedHat, ADEB, FB, AMZN\n- Consumer Electronics: AAPL\n- Ads: GOOG, FB\n\nobviously there are many other companies that I don't follow, and the categorization isn't 100% clean either. AAPL's services (music, icloud, etc) are forms of SaaS. FB is technically ads, but they are also a complete marketing SaaS especially globally where many businesses rely 100% on FB for their entire online presence. Ads also depends on your reach. Both GOOG and MSFT have consumer electronics, but I don't use that to drive investment. I won't be surprised if GOOG or MSFT cancel a major line of their hardware any time.\n\nThere are many other consumer electronics companies but nothing as fully integrated as AAPL in that area, including MSFT and GOOG.\n\nRedHat is active in the datacenter space and probably why IBM acquired them. IBM is more of a global tech projects coordinator, and manages a lot of banks infrastructures, but are feeling the pressure from other PaaS providers. I don't have any investments in it though. \n\nTech companies always have their toes in many businesses because of the nature of software. I can't think of one with more toes than MSFT (maybe GOOG second), which could be unfocused waste depending on their management. It certainly feel like it was for MSFT for most of the 2000s.\n\nTo answer OP's question though, I think any of these companies are probably fine with equal chances, though you will introduce yourself to company specific short term volatility. Who knows when a random bad news for AAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, etc might hit affecting the stock price in the short term. Balancing (depending on the amount) or using an etf like others mentioned is a good idea, though I don't think any of your picks will be bad in the long run either.",

Not necessarily a bad thing, and you've picked two of the best in that sector. It has been a volatile sector lately, so I would be cautious. In that sector, the only additional holding that I have currently is ET (Energy Transfer) and it has been doing quite well. The upside is both for growth and dividends.  Also, Tesla might be considered an energy stock, a tech stock and a car company stock.\n\nI'd say you have a solid start as a long term investor.

        "body": "I agree with all your points. In terms of business similarity (not at all investing prospect similarities) I think of tech companies as:\n\n- chip/components/data center hardware: NVDA, AMD, INTC, QCOM, TXN\n- fabrication: TSM (I don't follow anything else sorry)\n- PaaS: MSFT, AMZN, IBM/RedHat, GOOG (trying aggressively)\n- SaaS/Software: MSFT, GOOG, ORCL, IBM/RedHat, ADEB, FB, AMZN\n- Consumer Electronics: AAPL\n- Ads: GOOG, FB\n\nobviously there are many other companies that I don't follow, and the categorization isn't 100% clean either. AAPL's services (music, icloud, etc) are forms of SaaS. FB is technically ads, but they are also a complete marketing SaaS especially globally where many businesses rely 100% on FB for their entire online presence. Ads also depends on your reach. Both GOOG and MSFT have consumer electronics, but I don't use that to drive investment. I won't be surprised if GOOG or MSFT cancel a major line of their hardware any time.\n\nThere are many other consumer electronics companies but nothing as fully integrated as AAPL in that area, including MSFT and GOOG.\n\nRedHat is active in the datacenter space and probably why IBM acquired them. IBM is more of a global tech projects coordinator, and manages a lot of banks infrastructures, but are feeling the pressure from other PaaS providers. I don't have any investments in it though. \n\nTech companies always have their toes in many businesses because of the nature of software. I can't think of one with more toes than MSFT (maybe GOOG second), which could be unfocused waste depending on their management. It certainly feel like it was for MSFT for most of the 2000s.\n\nTo answer OP's question though, I think any of these companies are probably fine with equal chances, though you will introduce yourself to company specific short term volatility. Who knows when a random bad news for AAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, etc might hit affecting the stock price in the short term. Balancing (depending on the amount) or using an etf like others mentioned is a good idea, though I don't think any of your picks will be bad in the long run either.",

Not necessarily a bad thing, and you've picked two of the best in that sector. It has been a volatile sector lately, so I would be cautious. In that sector, the only additional holding that I have currently is ET (Energy Transfer) and it has been doing quite well. The upside is both for growth and dividends.  Also, Tesla might be considered an energy stock, a tech stock and a car company stock.\n\nI'd say you have a solid start as a long term investor.

Right now Intel is in process of taking on nvidia's graphic cards with their XE project. if the high end XE GPU can trade blows with Nvidia's quadros and tesla cards things would look really good for Intel but only time will tell.",

You are ITM if the stock had moved 0.5 in either direction (the stock actually closed almost ITM).  The expected move in QCOM was about 4.4% ($3.5) with the average move from earnings (over the past 10 years) of 4.6%.  In other words, your strikes are set in an extremely aggressive manner giving you a low probability trade and really high gamma exposure.

QCOM was trading at 78.5 so I felt like this was a no brainer given that both QCOM and AAPL have their earnings (AAPL earnings usually affect QCOM). Both my options were down yesterday.

I've been looking into ERI, MGM, BOYD and Penn already but never really gave any attention to DKNG, Penns also probably been on the bottom of my list as well for gambling stocks, but I can definitely see the room for growth in online gambling via a phone in the future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Looking for companies working 5G infrastructure as it pertains to cloud computing, as I think the future of consumer networks is wireless, with only larger commercial pipes needing to be hard\n\nI've been trying to find a good 5g play as well. Right now I'm looking into qualcomm and MU.\n\n&gt; I think Azure will win the cloud war for the majority of government and large caps so also looking for companies on the forward development side of that, especially in business intelligence, how it's used, etc. \n\nAnother industry I know nothing about haha. I'm looking to get into microsoft if we see another dip and I'm already invested in Amazon which is currently the leader in cloud. I know microsoft is much better at marketing their products to big caps though which will further their revenues a lot. From what I read earlier (on reddit to be fair..) is that as of right now Amazon undeniably has the better cloud services (apparently microsoft is slightly lacking in their quality) but microsoft has been making up for this with their hard line  marketing towards big caps so I can see that being beneficial for them too. I think everything cloud is going to be big in general, so investing in anyone doing cloud is a good investment in the long run probably. \n\nI'm also invested in Alibaba which is investing HEAVILY into their cloud service and will probably be the biggest cloud service in China and likely surrounding nations within their sphere of influence so I definitely think they're great as well.",
