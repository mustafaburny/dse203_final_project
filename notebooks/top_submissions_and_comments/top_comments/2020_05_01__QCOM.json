TSLA usually has a big swing in one direction. I have always lost money on TSLA, so didn't want to take much risk here. Should have sold the call spread when it was at 850 but yeah well. Sold the put spread today for a slight profit. Phew. \n2. QCOM 79C/78P at 3.5$ (3500$ worth). QCOM was trading at 78.5 so I felt like this was a no brainer given that both QCOM and AAPL have their earnings (AAPL earnings usually affect QCOM). Both my options were down yesterday. But AAPL earnings pushed QCOM down and the 78P was ITM. Sold it at a slight loss.",

I've been looking into ERI, MGM, BOYD and Penn already but never really gave any attention to DKNG, Penns also probably been on the bottom of my list as well for gambling stocks, but I can definitely see the room for growth in online gambling via a phone in the future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Looking for companies working 5G infrastructure as it pertains to cloud computing, as I think the future of consumer networks is wireless, with only larger commercial pipes needing to be hard\n\nI've been trying to find a good 5g play as well. Right now I'm looking into qualcomm and MU.\n\n&gt; I think Azure will win the cloud war for the majority of government and large caps so also looking for companies on the forward development side of that, especially in business intelligence, how it's used, etc. \n\nAnother industry I know nothing about haha. I'm looking to get into microsoft if we see another dip and I'm already invested in Amazon which is currently the leader in cloud. I know microsoft is much better at marketing their products to big caps though which will further their revenues a lot. From what I read earlier (on reddit to be fair..) is that as of right now Amazon undeniably has the better cloud services (apparently microsoft is slightly lacking in their quality) but microsoft has been making up for this with their hard line  marketing towards big caps so I can see that being beneficial for them too. I think everything cloud is going to be big in general, so investing in anyone doing cloud is a good investment in the long run probably. \n\nI'm also invested in Alibaba which is investing HEAVILY into their cloud service and will probably be the biggest cloud service in China and likely surrounding nations within their sphere of influence so I definitely think they're great as well.",
