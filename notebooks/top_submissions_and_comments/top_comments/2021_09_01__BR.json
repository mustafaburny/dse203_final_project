I highly recommend reading Betting Resource's quarterly outlook. They have been spot on. To summarize, do not short the market yet because the melt up phase is not complete and the big vertical melt up is yet to come. Multi year bear market will come but not yet.  Don't listen to any noise. I highly recommend following Aswath Damodaran, Mark Meldrum and Betting Resource to get the best market guidance. Don't be fooled by the sports content of BR, their quarterly outlook and ticker suggestion for stocks and option are priceless.  Tesla bullish, don' let any quick pull backs shake your hands. Tesla to test all time high and form double top by or just after next earning and if volume picks up we will see 1k easily.

And most of the increase is just in the last few months. But it takes a year for most leases to actually expire. So it will take a year for that all to show in CPI data.\n\nConsider where we were just in June, per:\n\nhttps://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/apartment-guide-annual-rent-report/\n\nYear over year:\n\n    -3.1% 0-BR\n    +5.2% 1-BR\n    +4.8% 2-BR\n    -1.4% 3-BR\n\nThat reflects data only through the end of May. But as of then, some apartments (both studio and larger apartments) were actually still down year over year.\n\nSo even if new leases increased 8% in the next two months, if that only impacts ~ 1/6 of apartments, that might only cause overall rents to increase by ~ 1.35%.\n\nEventually you will see higher increases in the CPI data though, there will just be a little more lag there. Recent increases haven't actually impacted most renters yet.",

When the TA switched from Broadridge to Computershare and the price fell a bit, I decided to buy more. \n\nUnfortunately, a USD account of some kind is necessary, or at least it was when I last bought. I personally have a US account with RBC Bank (a wholly owned subsidiary of RBC, but based in the US). It's technically a different bank, but under the umbrella of the RBC family. I'm not sure whether CS would accept a USD account from a Canadian institution, although I assume they would, but it may be worth a phone call to their help line to get confirmation before looking to open a US account. I don't want to give any incorrect advice. \n\nThere are a couple of forms that are worth filling out too. The W8-BEN form should reduce the foreign resident withholding tax from 30% to 15% (once DIS reinstates the dividend), and I would certainly consider the DRIP as well. At a 1-1.5% yield some people don't bother, but I do it because I'd rather have fractions of shares added to my account than a $10 deposit to my bank.\n\nCS usually has good customer service, and DIS is a solid long-term hold.

You can also consider VTI (for mid and small cap exposure) and VT (for international exposure), and QQQ (a slightly more aggressive approach with just 100 top companies, but lately performing very well)\n\nThen start to delve into stocks from companies that are established and whose charts have historically gone up over the years. I like to call these \u201csteady gainers\u201d, these are your FAAMGs, V, BX, etc. Consider cutting out the ones that have underperformed the S&amp;P500 significantly for years unless you have good reason to believe there\u2019s going to br a breakout. Buy the ones that consistently beat it. No stock only goes up, but some come surprisingly close. DCA into these as well.\n\nAfter this you can think about more complicated plays (stocks that have been down for years but may reverse, newer/less established companies) but understand thats inherently more risky.\n\nGood luck.

Global foundries failed to develop high end chips after they abandoned their rnd, but they hold a 15% market share(at last check) in markets which use lower grade nodes. Best part is, that they are supposedly going public in 2022.

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",
