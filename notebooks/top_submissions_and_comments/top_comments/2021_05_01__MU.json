        "body": "I hate the GME/AMC short squeeze crowd.\n\nNot because they're new, or because they spam the daily threads with unoriginal bullshit all week long, but because they're supporting the antithesis of wall WSB means to me.\n\nYou see, classic wallstreetbets was a place for autistic burger flippers and office workers to engage in extremely speculative high-leverage stock gambles. It was a place where regular internet trolls could come to engage in hard-core ruthless capitalism for the chance of making tendies. Regular people could cosplay as a coked up 80s stock broker.\n\nPart of the beauty of the community was the ruthlessness of it all, and the solidarity behind that ruthlessness. We were all well aware that we were communicating with other autists who were also trading super leveraged options positions, sometimes on the other side of the same stock. The bears teased the bulls on red days, and the bulls called the bears gay every other day. We all knew what was on the table, and everyone was competing against each other.\n\nThen these GME kids flooded the sub. They don't want to take highly leveraged positions on random companies. They just want to hold shares. They don't want to take a gamble in the market, they want to take a strategic position on a specific company to guarantee a short squeeze for profit.\n\nNow putting aside all of that boomer shit, the real major offense is the desire to work as a collective. These guys just want to have a common enemy in \"the hedge fundsl\".\n\nThe beauty of the WSB community was that we don't make enemies or work together or work against each other. IDGAF if anyone else's MU calls print, as long as mine do. And if your MU puts print, I can celebrate your gains while you celebrate my losses. The tendies aren't in the profits you take, they're in the risk you take.\n\nWu Tang Forever. Short $SQ till the day I die.\n\nAlso someone remind me tomorrow morning to never drink vodka again.",

        "body": "Look, just because a stock is \"undervalued\", it doesn't mean its being manipulated. You do basic analysis, and the stock is \"undervalued\" compared to the market yes. But its about fairly valued. Also shorting can bring a stock down, but it doesn't manipulate it necessarily.\n\nThe gaming market is highly cyclical and given the reopening of the economy, less people are going to be sitting around playing games. I mean look at $HEAR. You can see almost the tops and bottoms over a long chart. I think CRSR is a great company and are way more diverse. But to say that it is undervalued because it's got a forward P/E of 12 is wrong. The company could be peaking right now and earnings are all down hill for the next few years.\n\n2020 was the gaming year. 2021 is going to see tailwinds coming from that, but not extreme growth. I do like them, and they have awesome brands within their company portfolio. I am considering adding them to my portfolio. But there are still some things that could make companies \"undervalued\". RKT has a forward P/E ratio of 11, but everyone knows from here on out the mortgage market won't be as hot. They could be wrong though. I could be wrong.\n\nIt just reminds me of back in 2017-2018 when I bought MU, cause their P/E ratio was 4.\n\n4!\n\nThen they kept going downhill from 48 to low 30s because everyone knew that the dram industry would be cooling off. And they were right. Looking back I should've held. So long run, CRSR will be great as the gaming industry grows overall. But COVID pulled that forward a few years.",

Whatever the cost, it\u2019s cheaper per month than losing $2800 due to connectivity issues.\n\n2. You\u2019re now going to have two modem-type devices, one from each provider\n\n3. You\u2019re going to get a LOAD-BALANCING and/or FAILOVER, \u2018DUAL-WAN\u2019 device.\n\n4. This is going to allow you to have redundant internet connectivity; if Provider1 goes down, you will have automatic, no-intervention-required failover to Provider2, or vice-versa. In MOST applications you will see an increase in speed as well, as you will \u2018bond\u2019 these two channels together, such that, more-or-less, the speed of the two providers combined is ADDITIVE.\n\nIf you like your current router setup, or price is a consideration, and/or you want to keep your networking hardware in the basement, and/or only have one cat5 cable drop from your basement to your wifi ap/router, I\u2019d get something like this:\n\nTP-Link Multi-WAN Wired VPN Router | Up to 4 Gigabit WAN Ports | SPI Firewall SMB Router | Omada SDN Integrated | Load Balance | Lightening Protection | Limited Lifetime Protection (TL-R605) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QTXNWZ1/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_YFWYFMY77RD5BVTAE9MK?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1\n\nIf money\u2019s not a problem, I\u2019d go with with a single device solution (dual-wan router and wifi router in one) such as this: TRENDnet AC3000 Tri-Band Wireless Gigabit Dual-WAN VPN SMB Router, MU-MIMO, Wave 2,Internet Router, Whole Office-Home Wifi, Pr-Encrypted Wireless, QoS,Inter-VLAN Routing, Black, TEW-829DRU https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D5W2FGQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_6RGT6KJJPKG6C7WQ288T?psc=1\n\nYou get this up and running, and you\u2019ll probably never notice an internet outage again. \n\nHappy to answer questions.",

        "body": "Except your analysis is fundamentally flawed - BB is valued at a far lower P/S for many many reasons. It hasn't got anywhere near the revenue growth of a company like crowdstrike. BB revenue between FY20 - 21 dropped 10%, Crowdstrike grew 80%, Zscaler grew 46%, PNW 18%, Sailpoint 27%. You're comparing a declining company with booming companies and expecting them to share the same valuation.\n\nNot to mention - you're either unaware, or not mentioning the **actual** competitors to BB. Blackberry's Cylance/UEM is more comparable to VMware, or Cisco. Both of which have P/S of around 5, like BB. Companies like Zscaler and SPT don't really have endpoint management or security software, and Crowdstrike's tech blows BB out of the water. Tbh most UES/M companies tech blows BB out of the water - Microsoft, Symantec, VMware etc. PNW UES isn't the best - but they've got a myriad of fantastic enterprise security products besides that, and they don't trade at multiples like Crowdstrike. Don't just lump all companies at the same valuations because they're in the cybersec space - that shows a serious lack of information about the nuances of the industry.\n\nAnd BB isn't really a serious company when talking about cybersec. This is popular misinformation spread around this sub - when companies are talking seriously about enterprise security, at the top of their minds isn't BB.\n\nAlso it's a plain lie to say BB has a moat on all its products. They're barely a competitor on UEM/S. The only moat is QNX, which is an incredibly low revenue product - literally like 4$ or less per car per year.\n\nSaying Chen takes his compensation primarily in stock is also stupid. Most CEOs take their compensation primarily in stock - it's how boards and shareholders enforce that share price is a priority to CEOs. Chen also has sold millions upon millions of stock - he's clearly not forseeing some huge price increase.",
