So perhaps they believe $4.50 (just an example) is realistic, and $5.50 could only happen if he was really kicking ass. That being said, it gives him a target and you know the saying \u201cshoot for the moon and you\u2019ll land among the stars\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, the CEO has a pretty solid background in which he led another PCIe tech company to success and an acquisition. They were purchased by Broadcom (a very large chip manufacturer of processors, SoCs, and connectivity chips). So yes, I believe that down the road there could be an acquisition in play, especially nvidia so heavily involved. Only time will tell on that part though.\n\nThanks for the questions.",

If you started 20 years ago, advice like MSFT would be like advice to buy Ford (20 years ago). 20 years ago it would have been better to buy MSFT, and not particularly risky either.\n\nHere's what you should do.\nNCNO IPOs tomorrow.\nSit at your computer or phone or whatever, and watch for this stock to start trading.\nPut all your money into it the minute it starts trading.\nNow you can either hold it for a couple years while it booms, or take an exit in the next day or two when it for a quick 20-30% or more.\n\nI own MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, PYPL, and many others that have produced 100-200% gains for me, but I bought them in 2016, not now.\n\nKeep putting your money into your account and buy 40% boring stable stocks like MSFT, but really now is kind of a questionable time to be buying stocks like NET or SHOP... these things have a LOT of room to cool off. More important than what you buy, is developing a strategy and learning to follow stocks.\n\nIf anything, I'd wait for the next dip (which I think will hit this week), and take some positions in stocks that haven't fully broken out yet, but have pretty solid long term growth in front of them (I'm looking at you AMD, EDIT, SNCR, RAMO, CRNC, ADPT).\n\nFor long, low-risk, my next investment will be FISV.\nMy most recent high-risk play was OSS bought last week... 30% up from there.",

While also participating in every single possible chargeable service in payment processing and using their extensive platform to cooperate with MasterCard and other card networks to create a unified payment processing ecosystem.\n\nFor Square, their big services are their merchant aquiring + gateway services and cash app(big Bitcoin volumes exchanged here), while also offering payroll and banking services.  Their value will be dependent on Cash app utilization, their ability to poach merchants from existing providers, and their ability to build new technologies while implementing existing ones into their suite of services. \n\nFiserv is another interesting mover, they are helping to allow for the acceptance of Ebt transaction online, a big deal for American grocery retail with the transition to online ordering. They also are now the acquiring bank for Aldi as of July 3 and this added over 2k locations to their customer base. \n\nAlibaba is popular to most because we all know the online store, but they also are a FinTech provider and have Ant financial/Alipay under their belt. And they heavily invest in new technologies. \n\nEven PayPal is still highly profitable with potential for further growth. Using app based tech like one touch, and the overall simplicity of their process is fantastic. But it is yet to be seen how negatively they will be impacted by the universal checkout standard the big 4 card networks are set to release.\n\n\nCheck out FINX for a FinTech ETF and compare it's performance by % to Spy.

I'm a cable cord cutter, but family wanted entertainment. So I compared mainly Netflix with Amazon, but research led me to study Roku.....and only for the remote control ability! I had a great experience with Seagate, and this Roku was giving me a similar vibe. So I took a gamble and bought 150 shares in one of my \"forget-it-about\" brokerage accounts. $10K is usually my starting investment, and I got it around $72 back in March. Again....TOTAL speculation and totally forgot I owned it! And if it weren't for some chatter about it yesterday, I would never had known how much it had appreciated. Lol, my PT was only $100, but when I saw that it was $150, I sold it all! Doubled my money in just a few months on something I wasn't expecting much. Might get back into it, but ROKU is not something I \"love\" so will have to think about it.",

I cant even recall any new bollywood music they have produced. \n\nI enjoyed watching the Eros entertainment banner when I was younger, but the scene is alot more competitive than it used to be in India in the 80s and 90s. All the top actors have launched their own production houses and tseries basically rules the music rights. \n\nI'm not sure how the STX merger will pan out. STX is more of a indie based company and  Indians enjoy over the top extravagant movies. Most indie productions don't bring in the box office numbers.",

All the top actors have launched their own production houses and tseries basically rules the music rights. \n\nI'm not sure how the STX merger will pan out. STX is more of a indie based company and  Indians enjoy over the top extravagant movies. Most indie productions don't bring in the box office numbers.",
