So perhaps they believe $4.50 (just an example) is realistic, and $5.50 could only happen if he was really kicking ass. That being said, it gives him a target and you know the saying \u201cshoot for the moon and you\u2019ll land among the stars\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, the CEO has a pretty solid background in which he led another PCIe tech company to success and an acquisition. They were purchased by Broadcom (a very large chip manufacturer of processors, SoCs, and connectivity chips). So yes, I believe that down the road there could be an acquisition in play, especially nvidia so heavily involved. Only time will tell on that part though.\n\nThanks for the questions.",

They also have a highly paid and hugely motivated workforce selling \u201c the dangers of investing yourself\u201d. \n\nSure you need to diversify somewhat. But that\u2019s going to happen anyway through a sensible investment process.\n\nRight now I have about 260k which was 200k before corona.\n\nI\u2019m keeping 150k in cash for the upcoming correction in the next 3-6 months\n\nI have about 50k in undervalued high div yield stocks aviva, m&amp;g, l&amp;g if they don\u2019t come back up I\u2019ll get the divs and if they do I\u2019ll get a double win.\n\n25k in tech stocks that seem cast iron like google, Broadcom, skyworks, quorvo\n\n30k in synairgy who have just made a drug that sends 79 out of 100 sick corona patients home early - no way that\u2019s not going to the moon shortly, someone just needs to let Trump know and he\u2019ll be trying to buy the company. Yes it\u2019s a speculative play to some particularly as it\u2019s gone up 450% already but what else can do that right now and where is all the worlds attention right now? Besides it\u2019s dipped and it\u2019s on its next surge now or I\u2019ll eat my iPad. \n\nAbout 20k in some volatile speculations cineworld, afc, itm \n\nWhen I buy back in with the cash it will be split between:\n\nAutonomous vehicle\nAi\nCloud\nOnline services\n5g\nGreen energy\n\nIf there isn\u2019t a correction i\u2019ll buy back in when corona is just another vaccine appointment rather than risk a massive hit right now.

I want to retire early and every 50k I can generate is going to bring in 5-10k a year extra.\n\nMotley fool do a very good book on why you shouldn\u2019t trust the financial services industry with your money. \n\nMy biggest regret in life is not fully realising how easy it is to invest yourself and that the key is not trying to pick the next big winner which is not impossible but too risky as a growth strategy, but picking the very obvious and staring you in the face next big winning sectors, then getting a sensible basket of successful and profitable stocks within a few of those industries and you will succeed. \n \nMy last point would be that most of us when young do not realise how little we need to invest when we have a very long life ahead. I could have bought amazon, Microsoft, google etc after the .com bubble and done very well on some very small investments, doing so would probably have led me to Netflix and maybe even Tesla but I didn\u2019t because the big crash gave me such a financial hammering I turned away from stocks.",

For some officials to say, \"we will not go back into lockdown or close businesses\" and then a couple days later close down businesses, they must be receiving enough intel/pressure to know they're going to lose far more tax revenue in the long run if they try and keep everything open through a huge holiday weekend and just shut everything down on Monday 7/6.

AMD and Intel are both widely available in basically every single OEM's product lineups. I'm sure there's a few random OEMs out there that only use one chip manufacturer for accidental reasons - they got a good wholesale deal, or they have a limited lineup of models and it was easier to use a single chipset - but in general AMD is equally available from all the big OEMs.",

With a significant performance increase, you'll be able to get a 2nd tier GPU from the new generation, which will outperform the 1st tier from the previous generation, giving them an even more sizable lead over AMD.\n\nSomeone mentioned in a post here that the future could be APUs - essentially you wouldn't need a GPU becuase the computer's CPU is so powerful it runs all the graphics requirements. And at the moment AMD and Intel do offer some APUs, but right now they are no match for having a dedicated GPU. We're probably 10 years or so away from APUs taking over, if they do.\n\nI personally hold a position in Nvidia.",

With a significant performance increase, you'll be able to get a 2nd tier GPU from the new generation, which will outperform the 1st tier from the previous generation, giving them an even more sizable lead over AMD.\n\nSomeone mentioned in a post here that the future could be APUs - essentially you wouldn't need a GPU becuase the computer's CPU is so powerful it runs all the graphics requirements.

For some officials to say, \"we will not go back into lockdown or close businesses\" and then a couple days later close down businesses, they must be receiving enough intel/pressure to know they're going to lose far more tax revenue in the long run if they try and keep everything open through a huge holiday weekend and just shut everything down on Monday 7/6.

The Ambani family which controls Reliance is THE most politically connected in India - to the extent they can dictate ministers (secretaries to Americans) to the government. They just need to ask and policies turn on a dime to their advantage.\n\nThe mobile phone services in India were dominated by two companies - Vodafone and Airtel. The moment Reliance launched Jio, things went south for those two. Telecom regulations suddenly changed to the exclusive benefit of Jio and to the detriment of others. A new tax law came into being and Vodafone was assessed massive taxes with retroactive effect. They were ultimately hounded out by the government.\n\nSo, the core competencies of Reliance are massive government influence and the ability to get big investors onboard. They do not have technical know-how and this is where companies like FB and INTC come in. Bring the knowledge and get a piece of exclusive action in a vast market.",

Semi-custom is not a big market -- PS5/XBOX can only give you few dollars.  But their cycle is 2yrs.. year end you will see this number go up because of their release.\n3. Only possibe domain it can grow is Server.  It currently has 8% market share but Intel has 90%.  If AMD valuation needs to go high, this is the place they need to make money. AMD recently made a huge deal with CRAY -- this is AWESOME.  If they develop integrated solutions on top of which you can run 3rd party software -- you've a winning product!  Imagine running all CUDA on top of AMD servers.\n\nSo it's possible but there are several roadblocks.  I missed on the graphics market, but it has similar problems.

        "body": "The difference in price and margins would be huge yeah, buying the silicon from TSMC would probably be around $30 per chip + Apple's development costs. \n\nI saw rumors about them having double the cores of the iPhone SoC, which would help multi-thread, but single thread will always be the most important thing for basic workloads, ie what you would do on a laptop. It wouldn't even need good multi-thread, the current low spec MacBooks are dual-cores. With that single thread performance and 11 other fast/power efficient cores it will just end up being crazy good for laptops. \n\nI don't really care that much about GPU, the big thing about switching to Arm is freeing yourself from Intel and AMD's patent duopoly on x86 processors, which powers all desktop/servers in the world. For Arm processors anyone can just buy a license to use them, same thing with GPUs, anyone can make a GPU. Being free from x86 you have full control of the silicon so you can just licence or create whatever GPU you want and add it to the same silicon as the CPU. AMD just licensed out their GPU IP to Samsung for mobile SoC.\n\nBuying a x86 processor from Intel They own the silicon, they send you a finished chip and you get to connect whatever your shit is to it. With Arm you can get all your shit together and just put it all on one chip. AMD isn't as protective of their GPU stuff so if you license it they just give you their design and you get to copy paste the transistor layout over onto your chip, you also have the option of just picking how many of AMD's compute units you want in your design. The cost will also be way lower, because AMD would just be giving you the design, you would be responsible for shipping the design to TSMC to have it fabricated. \n\nMac Pro and server? I don't think it will ever happen, x86 is just too entrenched for professional use. Windows only runs on x86, plus everything Nvidia/Intel/AMD really cares about is server, they wouldn't let it slip. The one way in would be like through Amazon AWS you can offer Arm server for cheaper to anyone who doesn't care about x86. The thing everyone can make Arm, Amazon is already doing that with their own developed Arm processors, and nobody cares about them. A lot would have to change. \n\n [https://www.toptal.com/back-end/arm-servers-armv8-for-datacentres](https://www.toptal.com/back-end/arm-servers-armv8-for-datacentres) \n\nThis was written 4 years ago, zero progress.",

It will have helped to increase the stock price over time, but there won't be a huge jump when the PS5 and Xbox Series X One X Series Boxx comes out.\n\nOne of the reasons AMD is strong, and will become increasingly stronger, is that they produce excellent price to performance ratio CPUs and GPUs. They are smashing Intel at the moment. Sure Intel produce the ultimate best performance CPUs out there, but generally gamers right now are buying AMD in their droves becuase they can get almost as much power for significantly less cost. If you look at the gaming market as a whole, it's not dominated by super rich gamers who are dropping $2k on their rigs, it's full of lower end custom builders who are looking for the best price to performance ratio.\n\nIn some cases the AMD CPUs outperform Intel counterparts for a lot less money. Intel is really dragging it's heels at the moment. And in the top tier CPUs, AMD currently offer a Ryzen 3390x CPU, which is a mind blowing 64 core, for just $4,000. The Intel equivlent costs $20,000 and doesn't even have as many cores!\n\nAlso the APU market is still in very early days, and something AMD can capitalise on in the future - some say that APUs are the future, and AMD could even de-throne Nvidia if they made APUs powerful enough.",

Apple only has a limited amount of devices it needs chips for and they have plenty of margin to cover the cost so they're fine. \n\nSwitching from x86 to arm, it should be a performance loss, but arm chips are like real good now. The chip in the latest iPhone gets 1327 points single thread in Geekbench. Your full on \"best gaming\" processor is like 1,720 points. Multi-thread can be a lot worse, but what kinda of big simulation will you be running on a MacBook?\n\nMeanwhile the Apple's chip uses 6 Watt, while the desktop part uses 105 Watt.

And as you pointed out, the Geekbench single core score is 1327. If we keep apples to apples and go with the fastest mobile processor Apple uses, the i9-9880H in the 16\u201d MacBook Pro, it scores 1265 single core on Geekbench. [And for the coup de grace, Intel sells it to OEMs for $556.](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/192987/intel-core-i9-9880h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-4-80-ghz.html) Get the leading processor in mobile single core performance for $399, get the screen, battery, cellular modem, software, and profit margin all for free. Or pay $556 for a slower chip and still have to build the rest of the computer around it. \n\nNow obviously the i9 doubles the multi core performance, but on the other hand, only doubles? For that much of a price difference? And the GPU built into the i9 nearly quintuples the GPU built into the phone. But these aren\u2019t traditional strengths for Intel. Right now if you want multi core or GPU, you go to AMD. Intel stakes it\u2019s claim in the industry on being *the* fastest single core performance, for the smoothest gaming/microfinancial trading/what have you. And Apple is catching up in a phone for a fraction of the price. It feels like a steamboat being outpaced by a rowboat. \n\nAnother note on GPU, if you want more GPU performance, it scales really nicely with area. You just make a bigger chip. Now it\u2019s harder to cool and more expensive, but those are two of Apple\u2019s greatest strengths here already. Obviously the same is true of multicore. Apple just needs to make it bigger. I know their chip design people know that. The processors coming in Apple Silicon Macs are coming to dominate. Within two years they expect to have a chip that\u2019s a replacement for the freaking Mac Pro. From there? What if they bring back Xserve and make another go at the server market? At that point it\u2019s a matter of interest, not a question of capability.",
