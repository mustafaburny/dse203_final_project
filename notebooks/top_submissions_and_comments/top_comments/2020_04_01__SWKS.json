        "body": "Disclaimer that I'm not an investing guru/work in the field etc. I just have an interest in investing in general but I, and I'm pretty sure most people, would recommend diversifying. By diversifying you're spreading your exposure to risk.  Currently I have Stock, GICs, and Savings.\n\nHopefully someone else can give you some direction in where to invest your money but to give you a personal example of why diversification is a good thing:\n\nCut to circa Jan of this year I had stock in SWKS, KO, and BMY, as well as a few others. Before the chaos my portfolio was doing okay, SWKS was up a couple dollars per share, BMY was stagnant, and KO was up 4 dollars per share, so was motoring along.\n\nThen everything took a nose dive and I was around -30% return altogether. Then GOLD (Barrick, not the commodity) presented an opportunity to buy at $16.3. Bought some stock and now up over 30% on that stock. So while the other stock have recouped some of their loses, they're still not near where they were, and purchasing Barrick helped bolster my portfolio and recoup some losses. I'm at a -5% return right now which a lot higher compared to if I didn't diversify. \n\nBuying a range of stock can help you recoup losses if one of your stocks tank. Having all of your money tied to one stock leaves you open to having your net worth wiped away. Not an analyst and I'd say AAPL is pretty strong, but anything can happen.\n\nDiversify and spread your exposure to risk across multiple financial instruments!",

        "body": "Here is what is on my watch list and why:\n\n1. Google --- (Obvious choice with TONS of cash, tons of free cash flow and, more importantly, a business model that will survive the test of time). Premarket, it looks like the price is about $1,126.00. (I like to see this one at $1000, or below, but I've been nibbling on down days. \n\n2.  Amazon --- (Another pick where they have a solid balance sheet and continue to do business is in this tumultuous environment. I think bricks and mortar retail, outside of pharmacies, grocery stores, auto parts stores and few others, are going to be in big trouble unless there is a bailout --- Amazon will benefit from this and I've been buying on down days WHEN the stock is sub $1750. (It hit below this number twice since we have been having these crashes)\n\n3. Facebook --- (Another one with an unreal balance sheet, like Google. I've been adding to this name when it dips below $150.00 BUT at $162 premarket, I may add some more today)\n\n4. Skyworks / Qualcomm --- Both are solid, necessary companies, especially in mobile / 5G. I've been buying Qualcomm at below $70 and Skyworks below $80. Skyworks has ZERO debt and Qualcomm, as we all know, is a powerhouse of a company that most phone companies use: (LG, Samsung, Google, Oppo, Nokia, Apple (Verizon phones), etc...) this company isn't going anywhere and I would start to nibble on what looks to be a red day today!\n\n5. CVS Pharmacy --- This company has huge potential stock growth because they just acquired Aetna health insurance. They also have the brick and mortar CVS stores, along with the minuteclinics AND they have a PBM (Caremark) which negotiates lower drug prices for consumers and large companies. They are well diversified and have serious stock appreciation potential, even during these tough times, because there really is nowhere else to shop for goods, outside of Amazon and Grocery stores, PLUS everyone needs health insurance, which CVS offers through the recently acquired Aetna arm!\n\nGood luck today and happy investing --- for the long term!",

Rn my criteria for picking stocks is picking mostly undervalued large cap companies with recent troubles (due to covid, etc) that have high market share in industries with high growth potential in the next decade. I'm 20; jobless student; objectives is to make as much money as possible off compound interest over many years; nearly risk neutral (play poker regularly at casino, as long as the risk is justified with logic and positive roi in long run I can take on as much risk as needed); first portfolio so no holdings rn; no assets, live with parents; want to put every penny I have and will make in stocks and dont need the money for at least the next 10 years.\n\nStarting with 19k CAD (the max amount for my Canadian TFSA account). Summary of portfolio.... SPY - 6k...  Skyworks - 3k... Baidu 2k... Boeing 3k... Southwest Airlines 2k... Virgin Galactic 3k. Buying into airlines to get corona virus gains, buying Skyworks for its strong balance sheet compared to competitors and trying to get a piece of long term 5G and AR growth; looking into Qcom too and will buy that when it drops below 70. Baidu is profitable and huge market share in China but going through a lot of trouble recently so I assume its undervalued. Virgin Galactic is the first and only option to get into the space tourism race.\n\nI also have quite a few basic questions. If Boeing or Southwest gets bailed out, what will most likely happens to stock holders. Is SPY at a high point as of right now? I'm expecting it to go down even though generally timing to market is a bad idea. Its concerning how the Canadian dollar is very weak right now, I will buy into SPY asap but should I wait till the Canadian dollar recovers to buy into the other stocks that Im not expecting to change anytime soon? Is there a best time or lowest price to buy during to day, or best day of the week? Thanks for your time.",

Anyway welcome to dividend investing.\n\nPersonally what I watch like a hawk atm is the debt of companies and how hard/easy it is for them to service said debt. I mean who knows where we will be a month from now? Surely having a healthy balance sheet can\u2019t hurt though can it?\n\nSo here are a couple stock I like:\n\n-\tSWKS Hardly any debt, supplier of 4g and future 5g equipment.\n-\tMSFT Well diversified, debt covered nicely by cash and Cashflow.\n-\tTXN Quite the market leader, good balance sheet.\n-\tAAPL Quite expensive atm, but good candidate to buy in a couple shares here and there. 60 billion free Cashflow is ... yeah.\n\nThat\u2019s tech. Aka the bubble as some call it. Here are some interesting stocks that are going through even more interesting times:\n\n-\tJNJ Good stock, safe ship.\n-\tMCD Not about the burgers, it\u2019s a play on real estate.\n-\tDIS Some fairly large brands, Star Wars, ESPN, Disney itself, more likely to become bigger than smaller.\n-\t3M &amp; CAT Necessary stuff.\n-\tXOM Most competitors seem on the cusp of bankruptcy, long term good. Maybe wait for a cut, or not.\n-\tBRK.B Not a dividend payer ... yet.",

I am in an almost identical situation to yours (Though I wish I had the equity that you do currently)\n\nI believe that the best suggestion I can make, would be to invest in a few dividend aristocrats to add some more stability to your portfolio. Love seeing Exxon, I would recommend JnJ, KO, MMM, T, and WBA. \n\nYour portfolio is mostly aimed at high growth potential in the tech sector, similar stocks I am currently considering are Qualcomm, Apple and Skyworks Solutions, due to their possibility to grow very rapidly with the 5G tech boom in 2-5 years. (Qualcomm is also another stellar dividend payer.)",
