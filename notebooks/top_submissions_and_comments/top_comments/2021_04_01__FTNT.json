I knew Fortinet when they went public from personal experience and knew they had a superb product and a really good corporate structure. So I bought at IPO and hung on. \n\nCompanies like Amazon and Netflix I used personally and saw their potential for almost infinite growth. With companies like  that people are always scared by the valuation.  So buy a little and look to add if the price goes down. A lot of times it never does and just keeps going. The key is to find these companies early on when they have a lot of potential runway left.",

Biggest risk is from ROKU, CRWD and TTD, but there\u2019s an argument to made that FTNT, ZBRA and even ETSY are actually well positioned for recovery as far as tech stocks go.

Their firewalls were ditched because of a NSA backdoor and Fortinet is nowadays the popular choice. No one uses Cisco WiFi, don't choose a course on that.\n\nIf you wonder how Cisco is still relevant, it's because everyone is still using/recognizing their training courses and certifications.\n\nThe education solution isn't just a way to expand, it can be the most important thing for long term survival.",

He has mentioned this in past updates but I am not sure why he didn't include it in this update. But he did say that he will have 10 stocks. 1 more in the cyber security, 2 in automaker, 2 in infrastructure and 2 in commodity. Out of the 8 I can only guess 1, FTNT, other 7 have to wait and see.",
