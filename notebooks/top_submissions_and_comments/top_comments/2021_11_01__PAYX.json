But he wasn't really an agent, although he obviously helped them.  He was a \"journalist\" but his job description was mostly to \"entertain\" American visitors.  These Americans were carefully vetted before being invited to Russia and upon arrival he did things like get them drunk, make Russia look really good, and try to get them in slightly compromised situations.  Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.  That was the majority of KGB \"spy\" operations.\n\nWhen it comes to Evergrand, cui bono? China.  So whether intentionally carrying weight for China or just useful idiots victimized by CCP intel operations, NYT is carrying water for the **CCP who desperately wants to unload assets before the rest of the world catches on**.

Jobs from July on were just revised up by almost \\*700,000\\* jobs. In these earnings reports, there's some mention of inflationary troubles for some companies, but there's also significant news about how companies are starting to bring prices down to move volume, which is expected... inflation, it turns out, likely is actually transitory... just not \"transitory is like a month\" like all of the ADHD newb kids think.  \n\n\nOil's going down. At the port, shipping container backlog is down 25%. There's just a TON of great macroecon data.  \n\n\nFor retail, margins suffering in the short term doesn't result in market insolvency in the long term, and the big drag on the market was V... Visa has a ton of issues, almost none of which have to do with retail or inflation and everything to do with the fact that their business model is being disrupted by BNPL and Visa's starting to lose vendor interest.  \n\n\nIf you actually zoom out the graph, the market's actually still on a very strong upward leaning bullish streak for the month... these Bear theses need major work.",

        "body": "It is an overreaction, in my opinion. Visa has almost the same fees as MasterCard but somehow the ban is to be placed on V only. Moreover, this change will not affect debit cards, in Europe credit cards are rarely used. I might be wrong, of course, but I believe this is an opportunity. I will buy the dip and hold for the next couple of years. Even with such harsh restrictions (from just one merchant) , I don't see it as a possibility that Visa will suffer for very long.",
