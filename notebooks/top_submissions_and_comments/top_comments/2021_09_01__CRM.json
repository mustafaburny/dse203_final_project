Then I launched my own consulting company - quickly figured out that services work doesn't scale well - pivoted the business to a product startup and used the consulting to finance it.  All told, it took 20 years to get a really big exit - like net of over $200M.  \nThere is no shortcut that I know of - education, skills, experience,  lots of hard work for years and then luck.\nNow I get to do whatever I like, I am typing this from a private jet on the wifi coming back from vacation... I know, wtf. I pinch myself too.\n\n\n2) How can I invest like you?\n\nWell. I have a lot of money so I can make risky bets.  I don't do options though, only stocks. I put $50k into GME on a whim at $65 and sold when it hit $350.  That was a laugh.  \n\nBut seriously, I invest in stocks that I feel like I know. I use HUBS - they are in a great space and really appealing to SMB. I see them as the most viable competitor to Salesforce - go look at Salesforce's market cap. Classic Clayton Christensen - you will be eaten from below.\n\nI am not really much of an investor - just see things that make sense. I bought Amazon at $350 - should have put in more...\n\nI typically invest in tech stocks because I feel like I understand the business.\n\nMy stock account is just my plaything. My real investing is much more structured and done with my wealth advisor at a large brokerage.",

I\u2019m not a technical analyst, and I\u2019ve only been investing for about 4 years (I am 26). Everyone\u2019s a genius in a bull market anyway so I\u2019m sure a monkey could\u2019ve performed similarly anyway - but you asked so I\u2019ll share. \n\n1) only invest in companies you use and enjoy\n2) only invest in companies who have forward thinking leaders with proven track records\n3) only invest in companies who are building products/services for the future and don\u2019t base your investment on historical performance \n4) don\u2019t buy meme stocks and no one on the internet has the answers I learned this the hard way and am bag holding stocks below. \n\nI did not lose money on any meme stock. I made a lot off the video game store - this is probably part of the reason I got over confident and started breaking my own principles. \n\nI lost money on picks made by people on the internet ($FUBO, $CRLBF, $APPN, $FLGT) \n\nA good example of this would be SQ. I bought SQ back in 2017 when I first started investing. I\u2019ve used their product at the barber, at the coffee shop up the road, at a farmer market. I thought to myself. \u201cWow, a mobile phone credit card reader for any small business, I only use card so this just made my life a whole lot easier - who made this?!?\u201d \n\nJack Dorsey obviously created twitter, and scaled one of the most popular social networks to billions of people and billions of dollars. I believed in him, and he\u2019s a very\u2026. \u201cpassionate\u201d individual about the future. \n\nWith the rise in SMB\u2019s (I work for a tech company that serves SMB\u2019s and realized how easy it is to start a biz now a days, I realized that this little mobile credit card processing company was only just getting started, and I bought a couple dozen shares of $SQ (wish I had more money back then). It\u2019s my 2\u2019d best performer behind $PENN (who fits this mold as well). \n\nAgain, I know this is flawed, not-proven, and there are much better ways to go about investing. The 2020 bull run helped make me a ton of money and I\u2019m very lucky in that sense that i invested in companies like $APPL, $SQ, $MSFT, $TSLA using these principles. Confirmation bias? 100%. But I\u2019m gonna stick to it and hope it keeps working and gets me out of the hole I dug by taking the internet\u2019s advice. \n\nA few stocks I\u2019m currently interested in:\n$CRM, $MSP, $S, $FTNT",

So yeah, I\u2019d say ~5% returns in a few days is probably fine. But who knows where things will go.\n\n&gt; He will do worse as time moves on.\n\nHard disagree. With a broad portfolio of largely successful businesses, the long term is more favorable than the short term for this investor. That\u2019s just how the market has worked. I\u2019d be more inclined to agree with you if his portfolio was full of penny stocks and high risk assets.\n\n&gt; He is not mostly invested in blue chips.\n\nI said blue chips and successful businesses. You just can\u2019t read or didn\u2019t bother to. Google, Amazon, salesforce, amd, capital one, etc. These aren\u2019t failing companies.\n\nLike I stated before, the only thing of value that you contributed is advocating for index funds.
