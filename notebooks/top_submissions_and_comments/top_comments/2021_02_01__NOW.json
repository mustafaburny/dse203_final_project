        "body": "Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.\n\nThen that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan. \n\nThat then accelerates the selling. \n\nWhich then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what to do ? \n\nIf you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do. \n\nWhy ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work. \n\nI have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.\n\nI know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.",

Its an agency built by and for lawyers to be lawyers and win cases rather than do the right thing\n\nIf the SEC gave a shit about ANYONE other than Wall Street you would be able to go there right now and read bright line guidelines about insider trading, shorting, what is a pump and dump, what are the rules for cutting off the purchase of stocks like happened with GME et al\n\nBut they wont. They would rather litigate to regulate, which means they love to sue people in order to create new legal precedents.\n\nAll you need to know about the SEC and how badly they want to fuck the little guy is that they have the option of using JUDGES THAT WORK FOR THE SEC when they sue you rather than you have the option to have jury of your peers in front of a judge that is independent . Thats how bad the SEC is.  If you want fair markets that doesnt benefit Wall Street call your local politician and show them this",

The hard part is ask yourself if what you believed in has actually changed. \n\nBTC HODLers are a great example to follow.  Many bought at the highs in 2017 and watched it fall by 2/3 or more.  But they held on because they believed in the asset. \n\nThe same applies to stocks.  When I buy a stock  I make sure i know why Im buying it. Then I HODL until till I learn that something has changed.  THe price may go up or down, but if i still believe in the logic that made me buy the asset, I dont sell. If something changed that I didnt expect , then I look at selling.",

What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\n\nIn the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!\n\nThe corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!\n\nWhat they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.\n\nPeople, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!\n\nThey will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.\n\nThey are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!\n\nHERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;\n\nNo matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...\n\nTHEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It\u2019s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.\n\nThey can\u2019t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!\n\nEveryone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own.\n\nWe are winning here. It really is that simple. If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.\n\nPlease upvote, share etc. Don\u2019t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what\u2019s necessary and finally get ours. We\u2019ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It\u2019s time for change.\n\nGME &amp; AMC are the main focus.

I work 70 hour weeks sometimes and I'm in graduate school. They show up at 11 and look at cars on Craigslist all day.\n\nI can barely afford my apartment, and I have to carry groceries up three flights of stairs every week in the snow.\n\nThe closed my bank and are charging me $75 to move my money, even though my account is closing and I have no other option.\n\nI pay $100/wk for health insurance that refused to pay anything at all when I had a bad reaction to medication they approved.\n\nI've been slowly getting my dental work done over the last three years because I can't afford to do it all at once and the dental insurance pays so little it's negligible.\n\nI touch $2.5M/yr at my job in engineering support and technical drawing and I still can't afford to furnish my tiny apartment. My mom's TV stand broke and I'm trying to figure out a way to replace it for her.\n\nMy SO's place is so cold in the winter that I wake up shivering and also sweating from all the blankets we use.\n\nI'm holding off on new jeans for work, even though they're on sale right now, because I'm not sure how this month will fall yet. It's my busy season, but will I get enough overtime?\n\nI work 300 hours of overtime a year on average, which accounts for just over 12% of my income.\n\nI just want to take a week off work, and maybe buy a bookcase and new shoes for the gym. I don't want a yacht or a Lamborghini or to live in Hawaii.",

This is simply enforcing its own rules against naked shorting. WSB honorary mod and legend status if he gets the SEC to commit to a date of enforcement. \n\nWhat would he do about the FTD and short interest. No company should be shorted over 100%. So obviously the HFs/MM know where the shares are at, right? It\u2019s curious this can\u2019t be resolved. \n\nMy suspicion is these hedgies are committing securities fraud or something else nefarious that they are attempting to cover. But what do I know. \n\nDoes he think they are trading counterfeit shares, cooking books or tricking the algos to show a false downward pressure. There are some excellent threads outlining a strong case for share counterfeiting. \n\nWhat does he think GME\u2019s share price is going to? It was trending to the 700-1000+ easily before intervention, the gamma squeeze was happening before everyone\u2019s eyes. Investors are holding long, sentiment is extremely high and positive, a huge user base still can\u2019t buy, shorts continue to bleed; that doesn\u2019t sound bearish. SI is still likely &gt;100%. The only thing that truly changed was the inability to buy.\n\nWhat does he think of the conflict of interest of Citadel bailing out Melvin who has a massive short on GME? And possibly leaning on RH to prevent buying of these securities. Questionable ethics and backgrounds of MC, citadel, Point72 and RH. Obviously we don\u2019t know the full story for some reason since the SEC is nowhere in sight. \n\nWhat should happen to Robinhood? Thoughts on the way they generate income with Citadel, and further conflicts of interest that seem fairly obvious? Is RH done to him?\n\nWhat should happen to citadel, a company exploiting data, in this case to drive prices down? Likely by coordinating short ladders attacks while working in secrecy; operating in non available hours (ah trading, during halts) to manipulate people sentiment, limiting volume through brokerage leans. \n\nWhat does he think about the obviously discoverable short attacks and market manipulation against retail investors that have happened for the last 3 days and driven the price down artificially on no trading volume! This includes the continued prevention of purchasing? \n\nHow do we regulate/remove hedge funds as they provide no value to society. \n\nWhat part of this situation upset you the most? What grabbed your attention first?\n\nWhat are shareholders owed at this point? How does this come to a resolution now?\n\nWhat does he think of the wallstreetbets community?\n\nWhat does he believe the future of investing looks like?\n\nWhat sauce do you eat with your chicken tendies?\n\nWill you take a position in GME for the boys? YOLO in true WSB fashion.\n\nMC answer truthfully and you\u2019ll have access to 8 million new girlfriends. Or maybe we\u2019ll all be rich with your help and our wives won\u2019t need a boyfriend anymore since we can afford Tesla\u2019s and Mavs season tickets . Cheers! \"*",

This happening globally.\n\n\n- Why the giant influx of bots trying to persuade you not to buy GME?? \n\n\n- Why the constant distractions to other stocks??\n\n\n- Why keep trying to paint the picture everything got taken care of with the short situation?\n\n\nWe have seen patterns forming.

Then went to a coffee shop where they had msnbc on a tv, they were interviewing the co-founder of Reddit and giving him credit for what he unleashed on wallstreet.  So there\u2019s this man in his sixties with his phone out looking at a stock graph while he\u2019s watching the tv.  I mention that it\u2019s odd they are asking the reddit founder what\u2019s next for wsb.   The guy looks at me and smiles, says, \u201cwell now they are moving to silver.\u201d  \n\nI was like, wait, what?  I hadn\u2019t seen even a blip about silver.  I didn\u2019t say anything because maybe I missed it.  So a couple hours later, I\u2019m back on wsb and no... it\u2019s all GME, AMC, BB, NOK.  Nothing about silver.  But then by the next day... silver silver silver..\n\nIt really seemed like the attempt to manipulate wsb into silver got traction outside of wsb first where they believe anything the MM says.  Back here in the actual wsb, the attempted posts about silver were getting downvotes.  \n\nIs it a mystery that we have millions of new subscribers?  They needed to be able to upvote their own narrative here.  So now there\u2019s five times as many bots and sock puppets as real wsb subscribers.",

        "body": "Good post. Ended up here trying to find the rational side of Reddit after a buddy got me swept up in the WSB madness. Don't get me wrong...I'm still in it. Still hoping for a paradigm shift, still seeing plenty of reasonable-to-intelligent sounding vloggers, bloggers and Redditors making a case for GME. Not willing to throw in more then I already have (which I am OK, if a little sad) about losing.\n\nThe rational side of me sort of assumes this will flame itself out, but that's exactly what my rational brain would have said before the 2008 crash if a handful of people online started screaming about the impending subprime mortgage crisis months before 'everyone else' seemed aware of it.\n\nThis is addictive, though. The rage, the vulgarity...the perception of having power you probably don't actually have. Must feel quite a bit like what those Q-Anon loonies went through on their descent down the rabbit hole.\n\nI see things like the VIX moving in seeming correlation with GME, Goldman's alleged warning (though I can't see that anywhere but ZH and have no idea what was actually said), a bit of a big tech selling off (so desperate shorts can cover, of course!) and my gut says these brokers messed up...they're still bleeding...still desperate, and the squeeze thesis remains valid if shares remain out of their reach.\n\nEven the Citadel news above; their verbiage seems confusing...graf says retail were net buyers Monday and sellers the rest of the week. But then it references the number of buy orders and sell orders, which if I'm not completely insane with conspiracy right now, seems like a different figure. If buy orders averaged 10 shares per trade and sell orders averaged 3 - which would kind of be in line with what I'm doing myself to lower risk while staying engaged - there might be a 50/50 split in the number of orders but considerably more shares would be staying in retail hands.\n\nTL;DR: This is insane and out of an abundance of caution anyone going all-in who isn't at least considering an exist strategy should be.",

They think they are sharks, but they've been caught with no pants by a bunch of retards.\n\nHere is what they are going to do, they are going to keep the price around current levels by manipulating it(remember only 22b market cap, they can do whatever they want with the price, Melvin alone worth like 12.5b). When HFs will think hype is died down they are going to drop news that short interest went from 140% to 20%(remember, there is no official data on shorts, so they can tell whatever the fuck they want without any repercussions) in hopes that panic will make our hands paper and we sell, profiting on us.

        "author": "Tarsupin",
        "body": "Everyone should also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:\n\n1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.\n\n2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, misinform, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't, and there are likely attempts to hype up other stocks that don't realistically have anywhere close to the same potential. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done because we are holding GME.\n\n3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative to cover up things going much deeper. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens (or hundreds?) of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\n\n4. Hedges might lie about their short positions and the data is extremely difficult to access, which is why we're in this situation. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Some places (like iborrowdesk) are no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\n\n5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\n\n6. Setting your shares with limits means there are less shares to short, which increases the fees that those shorts have to pay. This helps with the squeeze. The selfless act is to avoid low limits (at least at first), but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it. Otherwise institutions holding might sell at higher rates than you do, which defeats the point.\n\n7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts to hurt their bottom line. However, during transfer you'll be unable to trade, so you have to decide if that's worth it to you in this moment. Some have suggested doing partial transfers. Consider moving to SoFi. Like all brokers, it's tied into the system, but Chamath is entering the game and is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and probably offering the best option.\n\n8. There's a lot of talk about Robinhood going insolvent. I can't tell if this is FUD or not, but the market value of GME even now is miniscule compared to everything else they cover. So I don't follow the logic how they're supposedly in financial trouble. If it DID go insolvent (not saying it will), people might only be compensated for up to 250k or 500k. The medium guys will get screwed if RH becomes a sacrifice to avoid much bigger losses. I don't know what to do with this information yet, but it should be on your radar.\n\n9. Be prepared to join a class action lawsuit if you owned any GME, AMC, etc, but let some more information feed in first. We're uncovering more of this each day. A lot of focus has been Robinhood, but it goes deeper as well. Robinhood and other institutions' actions were blatant market manipulation. Document evidence of owning the stocks (it will be in your broker's history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, consider joining as a Named Class Representative for financial returns specific to your case (rather than just what everyone gets). These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud.\n\n10. Be cautious about buying at times when institutions can anticipate it and control how they handle your buy orders, such as market open. It's a major gamble if you're not setting limits. Consider letting the stock dip before you buy because we can expect a lot of attempts to make that happen. It's better to us all if you get more stocks, but the institutions are notoriously hard to beat at this game. They are, generally speaking, much better at this, and they cheat to imbalance everything.\n\n11. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over or how deep this goes. There's new information suggesting there might be a lot of counterfeit stocks, which has historical precedent with Fannie Mae. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) for the full report. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand investigations and REAL consequences for these criminal behaviors. This matters.\n\n12. It's also worth investigating the other grossly unfair (some technically legal, some illegal but easily concealed) attack vectors they use against us: flow orders, hidden data, AI algorithms, etc. They always win because the game is rigged. Shorting should be illegal. Please remember that this is more than about making money, it's about a movement. Demand these things be changed.\n\n13. For everyone saying hold until zero, that is a potentially dangerous sentiment. Holding may very well expose a lot of corruption, but those in financial need should not be risking their life savings. The goal is to distribute wealth to the PEOPLE, which means some of you should have an exit strategy or the institutions just win 100% of it.\n\n14. Absolutely ESSENTIAL reading: [What is Counterfeit Stock](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html), [if the institutions counterfeited GME stock, it explains Wallstreet's terror](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/). We need to be paying close attention to the Depository Trust Clearing Corp (DTCC) and how strongly they resist allowing ANY data to be seen and how they resist investigation.

(UPDATED)  \n\n\n1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.  \n\n\nPATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.  \n\n\n2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying \"lets get this to $30\" or \"let get this to 100\". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.  \n\n\n3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video &gt;&gt;&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)  \n\n\n4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)  \n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.  \n\n\n\\- They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.  \n\n\n5. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.  \n\n\n6. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.  \n\n\n7. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.  \n\n\n8. What is short selling: &gt;&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)  \n\n\n9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)  \n\n\n10. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.  \n\n\n11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.  \n\n\n12. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.  \n\n\nI hope this helps many.",

There's like... no upside to $AMC as a company once the pandemic is over, especially compared to the grand plans $GME is making. Saying to buy $AMC is a fucking scam.\n\nSilver, AMC, and (to an extent) Nokia are suspicious as fuck. At least Nokia had some DD behind it, even if the DD was flawed.",
