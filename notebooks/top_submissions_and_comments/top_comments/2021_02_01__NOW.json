        "body": "Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.\n\nThen that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan. \n\nThat then accelerates the selling. \n\nWhich then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what to do ? \n\nIf you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do. \n\nWhy ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work. \n\nI have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.\n\nI know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.",

They would rather litigate to regulate, which means they love to sue people in order to create new legal precedents.\n\nAll you need to know about the SEC and how badly they want to fuck the little guy is that they have the option of using JUDGES THAT WORK FOR THE SEC when they sue you rather than you have the option to have jury of your peers in front of a judge that is independent . Thats how bad the SEC is.  If you want fair markets that doesnt benefit Wall Street call your local politician and show them this",

But they held on because they believed in the asset. \n\nThe same applies to stocks.  When I buy a stock  I make sure i know why Im buying it. Then I HODL until till I learn that something has changed.  THe price may go up or down, but if i still believe in the logic that made me buy the asset, I dont sell.

Fuck yes! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\n\nIn the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!\n\nThe corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!\n\nWhat they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.\n\nPeople, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!\nThey will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.\n\nThey are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!\n\nHERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;\nNo matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...\n\nTHEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It\u2019s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.\n\nThey can\u2019t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!\n\nEveryone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own.\nWe are winning here. It really is that simple.\n\nIf everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.\n\nPlease upvote, share etc. Don\u2019t care about karma or anything this is far more important.

What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\n\nIn the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!\n\nThe corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!\n\nWhat they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.\n\nPeople, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!\n\nThey will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.\n\nThey are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!\n\nHERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;\n\nNo matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...\n\nTHEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It\u2019s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.\n\nThey can\u2019t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!\n\nEveryone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own.\n\nWe are winning here. It really is that simple. If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.\n\nPlease upvote, share etc. Don\u2019t care about karma or anything this is far more important.

This is simply enforcing its own rules against naked shorting. WSB honorary mod and legend status if he gets the SEC to commit to a date of enforcement. \n\nWhat would he do about the FTD and short interest. No company should be shorted over 100%. So obviously the HFs/MM know where the shares are at, right? It\u2019s curious this can\u2019t be resolved. \n\nMy suspicion is these hedgies are committing securities fraud or something else nefarious that they are attempting to cover. But what do I know. \n\nDoes he think they are trading counterfeit shares, cooking books or tricking the algos to show a false downward pressure. There are some excellent threads outlining a strong case for share counterfeiting. \n\nWhat does he think GME\u2019s share price is going to? It was trending to the 700-1000+ easily before intervention, the gamma squeeze was happening before everyone\u2019s eyes. Investors are holding long, sentiment is extremely high and positive, a huge user base still can\u2019t buy, shorts continue to bleed; that doesn\u2019t sound bearish. SI is still likely &gt;100%. The only thing that truly changed was the inability to buy.\n\nWhat does he think of the conflict of interest of Citadel bailing out Melvin who has a massive short on GME? And possibly leaning on RH to prevent buying of these securities. Questionable ethics and backgrounds of MC, citadel, Point72 and RH. Obviously we don\u2019t know the full story for some reason since the SEC is nowhere in sight. \n\nWhat should happen to Robinhood? Thoughts on the way they generate income with Citadel, and further conflicts of interest that seem fairly obvious? Is RH done to him?\n\nWhat should happen to citadel, a company exploiting data, in this case to drive prices down? Likely by coordinating short ladders attacks while working in secrecy; operating in non available hours (ah trading, during halts) to manipulate people sentiment, limiting volume through brokerage leans. \n\nWhat does he think about the obviously discoverable short attacks and market manipulation against retail investors that have happened for the last 3 days and driven the price down artificially on no trading volume! This includes the continued prevention of purchasing? \n\nHow do we regulate/remove hedge funds as they provide no value to society. \n\nWhat part of this situation upset you the most? What grabbed your attention first?\n\nWhat are shareholders owed at this point? How does this come to a resolution now?\n\nWhat does he think of the wallstreetbets community?\n\nWhat does he believe the future of investing looks like?\n\nWhat sauce do you eat with your chicken tendies?\n\nWill you take a position in GME for the boys? YOLO in true WSB fashion.\n\nMC answer truthfully and you\u2019ll have access to 8 million new girlfriends. Or maybe we\u2019ll all be rich with your help and our wives won\u2019t need a boyfriend anymore since we can afford Tesla\u2019s and Mavs season tickets . Cheers! \"*",

Because they see the giant impact we AS INDIVIDUALS have, and want others to follow suit in the wrong direction.\n\n- Why are they CONSTANTLY doing short ladder attacks? You wouldn't do that if you weren't worried!\n\n\n- Why the buying restrictions?? This happening globally.\n\n\n- Why the giant influx of bots trying to persuade you not to buy GME?? \n\n\n- Why the constant distractions to other stocks??\n\n\n- Why keep trying to paint the picture everything got taken care of with the short situation?\n\n\nWe have seen patterns forming. Yes, it's a roller coaster. This is not a news flash!\n\nKeep your head focused on the end goal. \n\n- Why were a ton of $800 calls bought the other day for March, with a stock that has been shown to be unstable and maybe headed downhill?? \n\nNothing is for certain. BUT wouldn't it seem something BIG is on the horizon?\n\nIt's an instant gratification society. Practice patience.\n\nYou need to do what YOU have peace about. Everyone has their own moon.

        "body": "So, let\u2019s just rewind a few days. \n\nThursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\n\nIn the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!\n\nThe corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!\n\nWhat they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.\n\nPeople, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!\n\nThey will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.\n\nThey are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!\n\nHERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;\n\nNo matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...\n\nTHEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It\u2019s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.\n\nThey can\u2019t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!\n\nEveryone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.\n\nIf everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.\n\nPlease upvote, share etc. Don\u2019t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what\u2019s necessary and finally get ours. We\u2019ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It\u2019s time for change.\n\nGME &amp; AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.\n\nLETS DO THIS!!! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb",

        "body": "Someone just posted this but it instantly got deleted so I\u2019m reposting it. \n\nOff the bat with my GME bros we have seen massive losses. I have seen a lot of people panic and that is not good. So a little recap, we saw prices drop from 115 to 78 very quickly. I think that a lot of short sellers doubled down and shorted even harder than before.  In effect, their mission was to drop the price of gme as fast as possible. NYSE then announced that they could no longer short shares of GME for 30 days. Now, that tells me a whole hell of a lot of shares were shorted and we will not know until the 15th with exact numbers. That needs to be a take away, the hedge bros risked it all to kill the price, and it worked, but the method of shorting even harder to kill the price is no longer on the table. NYSE said nope. So now the short percentage could be huge, we do not know. We have all the leverage, we own the shares in cash. So if you are currently panic selling, may I ask why you are not calm? The hedge bros sent their worst, all they can do now is PUT OPTIONS. Let me repeat PUT OPTIONS. They shorted so hard today they are no longer allowed to short. We own the shares, why are we panic selling? The battle should be over by now. I am currently at a loss, but I am calm and I believe if everyone take a step back at what happened today they will realize that we are not losing. In fact we made them double down on shorts. Ya know the same thing that hurt them the first time. So drop a comment, let me know why you feel the need to contribute to the hedge bros needs. The line is only as strong as you are.\n\nTake the time to consider, this needs to be put in light",

Don\u2019t look for it. **Be happy with what you got**. Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, **the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions**. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. **They own everything**. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They\u2019ve long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. **They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want**. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don\u2019t want: They don\u2019t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. **They don\u2019t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking**. They\u2019re not interested in that. That doesn\u2019t help them. Thats against their interests. Thats right. **They don\u2019t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly they\u2019re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago**. They don\u2019t want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they\u2019re coming for your Social Security money. **They want your retirement money**. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They\u2019ll get it. They\u2019ll get it all from you, sooner or later, 'cause they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you ain\u2019t in it. You and I are not in the big club. And by the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted folks. The game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. Good honest hard-working people -- white collar, blue collar, it doesn\u2019t matter what color shirt you have on -- good honest hard-working people continue -- these are people of modest means -- continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don\u2019t give a fuck about them. **They don\u2019t give a fuck about you**. They don\u2019t give a fuck about you. They don't care about you at all -- at all -- at all. And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. That's what the owners count on; the fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes everyday. Because the owners of this country know the truth: it's called **the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.**\n\n**George Carlin**",
