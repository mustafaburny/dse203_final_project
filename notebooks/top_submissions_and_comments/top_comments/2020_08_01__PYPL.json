        "body": "Listen up you clown, maybe you'll understand better if I present all the times he's had to deal with setbacks. This is the transcript of my presentation in school, so don't mind the diction.\n\nIn 1995, Musk, armed with prestigious degrees in physics and economics from UPenn, applied to the then-popular web company Netscape. Not only did his application go unanswered, but he was ignored during his in-person visit to the company. At around this time, he had enrolled in Stanford University to pursue a PhD in energy physics, but he found the idea of the internet so promising that he dropped out 2 days later, and started his own company which came to be known as Zip2. However, when Mohr Davidow ventures acquired Zip2, Musk was demoted to the role of CTO because the VCs thought he wasn\u2019t fit to be a leader. Fast forward to 1999, CompaQ bought Zip2 for $307 million, out of which Elon got roughly $20 million.\n\nImagine this. You\u2019re 28 years old, you\u2019ve got 20 million dollars and a girlfriend. That\u2019s probably not going to happen, but just imagine. Anyway, this is exactly where Elon found himself in 1999. But, instead of buying a fancy, expensive sports car and retiring in a 10 bedroom mansion on the greek islands, he bought a fancy, expensive sports car and set out to start another company, this time in the finance industry.\n\nElon then founded an online banking service (one of the first of its kind) called X.com. (Yeah, peculiar name, but whatever) X.com soon merged with another financial startup called Confinity. Just months later Musk and his newly-wedded wife, Justine had landed in Australia for their honeymoon, when Musk got a call saying he was ousted from the company and being replaced by Peter Thiel as ceo. Musk took the next flight back to Palo Alto and tried convincing the board to let him stay, but it was of no use. Even though Musk was visibly upset, he showed incredible restraint and accepted the role of an advisory on the board. Soon, he became the largest shareholder in PayPal, a move that would pay off extensively in the future.\n\nNow, Musk had always fantasized about traveling to Mars, and over the years, this fantasy had turned into what he viewed as a necessity in order for the human race to survive. As Musk\u2019s role at PayPal began to fade, he started to involve himself in the space business - something he was very interested in but knew little about at the time. He utilized whatever time he could find to teach himself literal rocket science. He would bring old soviet rocket manuals to investor gatherings and devour himself in them. He soon found himself forming a small team to work on realistic space travel plans and unsuccessfully trying to negotiate deals with Russians for rocket parts. Musk\u2019s price expectations were absurdly low, and the Russians didn\u2019t take him seriously. They even went as far as spitting on his shoes to show their disapproval. An infuriated Musk stormed out of the conference room, boarded his aircraft, and decided that if he wanted to get something done, he had to do it himself. On his flight back home, he realized that he could substantially reduce costs by manufacturing as much as possible in-house. And this is how Space Exploration Technologies, or Spacex, for short, was formed.\n\nJust a few months into SpaceX\u2019s life, Elon\u2019s first son, Nevada, was born. And just weeks into his life, Nevada was suddenly gone. He\u2019d died from a sudden infant death syndrome. Musk was understandably devastated, but he didn\u2019t show it, not even to his wife. Musk held his ground, shook it off, and went on with his work at SpaceX immediately. He expanded the company\u2019s goals and announced the introduction of the Falcon 1 - which he hoped would be the first privately developed liquid fueled rocket to go into orbit around earth. In fact, he became more productive and focused than before. It\u2019s as if setbacks inspire him to push harder. Today, SpaceX manufactures nearly 85% of the products they use, which, along with other ingenious strategies, makes them by far the most cost-effective and efficient aerospace manufacturers in the world. The Falcon 1 has retired, and they currently operate the falcon 9 and the falcon heavy on a regular basis. Musk\u2019s plan for SpaceX is to bring down launch costs to 10 million dollars a launch and commercialize space travel, another step in his ultimate goal to occupy Mars. He started all of this not because the space industry was booming, but because it wasn\u2019t, and he felt that that space exploration was and is one of the most important ventures that would lead to the progress of mankind.\n\nAs if trying to start a rocket company isn\u2019t enough work, Elon participated in the funding round of an upcoming electric car company called Tesla Motors. With an investment of 6.5 million dollars, Musk became the largest shareholder and chairperson of Tesla. Tesla\u2019s first car, with the chassis of the Lotus Elise, was the roadster. Musk\u2019s original plan was to sell the Roadster at a relatively high price of around 85,000, use the small profits to roll out cheaper, more efficient cars in the future, and ultimately achieve Tesla\u2019s goal of granting the mass public access to technologically advanced, state-of-the-art, affordable electric vehicles. However, with individual parts coming in from all over the world, it seemed like each car would cost 200,000 to make. Quoting Musk, \u201cEven in full production, they would have been like $170,000 or something insane. Of course, it didn\u2019t much matter because about a third of the cars didn\u2019t flat-out fucking work.\u201d By this time, all the individual 100,000 dollar payments that customers had made were exhausted, and Tesla was in danger of facing serious legal charges. Even with employees putting in 60 hour workweeks, coming in on weekends and sleeping in the office, the commercial production of the roadster was delayed by almost 2 years. The timing of the production couldn\u2019t have been more unfortunate. It was 2008, the worst financial year since the great depression, and Tesla still hadn\u2019t rolled out their first batch of roadsters. They were running out of cash to produce their vehicles at more than 5 times their initially planned cost, at a time when large automakers were filing for bankruptcy and public demand was slumping.\n\nThings were not looking very good back at the rocket labs either. SpaceX had failed their 2 maiden launches over the course of 4 years, and half of their engineers were still living on the launch-pad cum island near Hawaii, awaiting instructions for the third launch, which would also prove to be unsuccessful. When Musk landed the fortune from the PayPal deal, he could\u2019ve easily retired to the beaches for the rest of his life. Quoting Ashlee Vance, \u201cMusk rejected that logic by throwing $100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, and $10 million into SolarCity. Short of building an actual money-crushing machine, Musk could not have picked a faster way to destroy his fortune.\u201d In early 2008, Musk filed for a divorce. He\u2019d decided to throw whatever money that remained on him into one final launch for the Falcon 1 by selling his assets like his house and his McLaren. On top of that, he borrowed small amounts of money from as many of his friends and acquaintances as he could, liquidated his stocks in various companies and kept Tesla going for a couple more months. Meanwhile, back at spacex, the 4th and final launch of the Falcon 1 was it for Musk. If this failed, SpaceX would be no more. It succeeded. And although this injected loads of confidence back in the team, the bank was running dry. As 2008 drew to a close, Musk was left with a sum total of little below one hundred thousand dollars in his bank. But he wasn\u2019t going to let either company take the fall. Using the falcon 1 as a crutch, Musk approached NASA for a contract to supply the ISS. After a period of uncertainty, SpaceX successfully received a 1.6 billion dollar contract. Meanwhile, Musk dumped in whatever cash he had in Tesla\u2019s debt round, and the investors ended up putting in the rest of the money needed for the company to survive.\n\nComing back to my claim, I feel like it\u2019s justified to say that Musk has the vision, resources, willpower, and endurance to truly advance humanity. He not only heads, but completely understands 4 companies; Spacex, tesla, the boring company and neuralink. The unified goal of all of these companies is simple: to help mankind. As a person, Elon is quite interesting, too. His ideas and his brain makes up for his timid and stuttery appearances on-stage. He personally responds to as many customer complaints as he can on twitter. He objectively has a good sense of humor. He loves memes, and he likes to occasionally spam twitter, just a reminder that he\u2019s a human, just like us. Of course, Musk isn\u2019t perfect. He can be a dominating, cold husband, a ruthless and inconsiderate boss, and a massive jerk. But these flaws can easily be overlooked if you look at the bright side. Musk has shown time and again that he will not buckle no matter what. If he sets a goal, he will achieve it. I like to think that he genuinely cares about humanity. Since there\u2019s no way to prove this, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a fact, and you\u2019re entitled to have your own opinion about it. But overall, if it were up to me, I\u2019d definitely confide in Musk to lead humanity forward.",

        "body": "Fintech companies like SQ and PYPL are a great investment. However, a lot of big companies will (and already did) implement online financial services. MA is able to easily work with multiple of those companies and they're using their global presence pretty well, that's why they're my pick for the fintech industry.\n\nThey launched Mastercard Accelerate last year, implementing those online paying platforms and letting start-ups take advantage of their global presence to grow and transform very fast. Last year they acquired Ethoca (managing e-commerce fraud) and Vyze (platform to connect merchants with multiple renders, giving them the opportunity to get those financial needs for start-ups). MA is basically helping start-ups to grow faster, which will result in more financial transactions in the future.\n\nLast but not least, they like to focus on expanding to countries where there isn't much competition yet. They are expanding their exposure to Middle East and Africa, working with local networks and e-commerce platforms. They are in a strong position to capitalize those regions in the future and take on market leader Visa even more.\n\nThey get compared a lot to Visa, so I'll expand on that subject a bit as well. While V is focussing on performance and speed, MA plays the cyber security card. They are already working on ways to implement cryptocurrency and Mastercard tend to have more growth potential vs stability from market leader Visa. While V is in the lead, MA is more widely used by fintech companies, which shows potential take-over in the future. Next to their credit services, they also own debit service Maestro, which is widely used in Europe.\n\n**Financial**\n\nReturns as high as 150% (ROE) and 60% (ROIC). Very large margins and perfectly stable balance sheet. High EPS growth YoY, 53% and 42% in the last two years. Quick ratio 1.87. V has more assets and even bigger margins, however MA wins in returns and cash. In terms of more growth, I like to focus on those last numbers more.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIt's a blue chip at a $300B market cap. Their growth potential might be limited, although I see them as one of the better picks between blue chips.",

        "body": "This is a very interesting question in defending a position that has gone really bad. If I were in your shoes, I won't sell a naked call. This puts extra risk to the upside. I have been burned with this before. If a reversal happens you will be defending the call side, which is a lot harder to do. \n\nWhat I suggest is to sell a call spread and turn it into a slightly inverted big lizard, something like the 190-210 for $6.65 would be a good choice. This helps your break even to the downside **AND ALSO** removes your risk to the upside in exchange of most of your upside gains. Total credit received in this case would be $13.5+$6.65 = $20.15 so if PYPL skyrockets you still pocket $15. And your break even to the downside is moved by $6.65. If PYPL have a green day tomorrow this would give you a better credit too.\n\nThis is literally a synthetic covered call (long 210C + short 210P =  long 100 shares) and the short 190C is your covered call. You can keep rolling this forever as if it was a Covered Call position. But with less than half the margin requirement. The only downside really is the liquidity of the $210 put if it gets too deep ITM, so far it's relatively liquid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;  Another option is for me to wait till close to expiration and roll down and out \n\nThis is not a bad choice either, you can get a favorable roll or you might be able to close it for a scratch of PYPL moves upwards. If it keeps moving down however, you will be out of options to roll. Remember, the best time to roll is when your put is ATM, the deeper it goes ITM the harder it is to roll since there is very little extrinsic value to collect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoing any of the above options, or even another choice is okay. BUT the most important thing is to **manage your risk**. Put a hard loss limit you will close the trade at no matter what. Otherwise you will be chasing this for a long time with your capital locked. If you are okay with holding PYPL, this is a different story. In this case just take assignment and you can sell covered calls to lower your cost basis.\n\nRemember, if this was a theta play, once it gets deep ITM it becomes a pure delta play just like a stock. There is not enough theta anymore. And your capital is 100% better allocated to another theta play.",
