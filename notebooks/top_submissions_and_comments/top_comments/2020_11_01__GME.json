If anyone on here has more experience with buyouts, please do chime in here.\n\nThe situation has become a huge boom or moderate bust situation. The board clearly isn't listening to Cohen, so the article (and his letter) is bad news if you take it for face value. A big piece of the bull story is that GameStop will indeed implement the ideas / visions of someone who obviously has had massive success in e-commerce.\n\nNow, why would he release this article, let alone his \"letter\", publicly? Why hasn't he sold his stake either? If he had disagreements with the management before, I can assure you that this won't change anything. If anything, this will probably make the management stand their grounds even stronger, wishing to prove Cohen wrong. They won't suddenly listen to him because of this.\n\nThe reason may be to stage a buyout / tender offer in the near future. I can think of no other reasonable explanation to take this public, facing the management head-on. If this happens, institutions will be forced to recall any lent shares for a proxy vote, likely forcing a squeeze.\n\nHaving said so, this is far from guaranteed. I've outlined my logic above, but it may be incorrect, and the risk still remains that he may just sell his stake and bail.",

        "body": "I said it\u2019s unique Becuase you said not even Volkswagen went up that much in terms of %. But whatever. we know that GME has a very low float, most of it is locked up by institutions. 140% of shares are sold short, Literally some shorts own fake shares that don\u2019t even exist. If you want, you can compare it to OSTK, which was 70% short and squeezed from 15 to 130, but that was a longer squeeze, I\u2019m expecting a quick one. If Cohen puts out a tender offer for GME and it\u2019s voted yes by shareholders, all the shares lended out by institutions gotta be recalled, shorts will scramble to cover, but most of them won\u2019t even be able to cover day one, since they don\u2019t even have real shares borrow. There would be a fail to deliver shares, and it\u2019d just be madness. They would be forced to buy at insanely high bids and drive up the price. KBIO was a similar situation, Shrekli bought the company and borrowed shares had to be recalled. That caused a 10k% squeeze, and I believe that was also about 70% short. Also, insane amounts of calls will be bought and MM\u2019s will have to buy more shares to hedge. GME is the most short sold stock in history by a long shot, it\u2019ll do wild things, you can\u2019t gauge the situation, that\u2019s why my PT is unreal",
