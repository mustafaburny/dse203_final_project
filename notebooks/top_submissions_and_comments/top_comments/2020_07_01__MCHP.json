It \"filters\" pollution, bacteria, pathogens, etc to 99 percent by reading the air and adjusting it's capacity accordingly. It runs on the energy of a 30w light bulb. (Where as hepa filters are gross and expensive af to run in large settings). They are transparent with their shareholders, and are signing something ( can't remember what it's called ) that makes them legally and morally obligated to do the right thing for shareholders and the environment. They are also moving their company from China to an 88000 sqft 9 acre warehouse in Virginia. They have sold out of their new products immediately on their website... \n\nIt might drop back down, it might not. When it was at .16 I was waiting for it to drop again to buy more... So... The company wants to list on nasdaq in the next 3-5 quarters and  their stock price target is $45 ( if that even means anything really, idk) but there is huge promise and definitely worth a gamble long term for me.
