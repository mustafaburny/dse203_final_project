Same for P&amp;G.  Not so good at a tech company, where you expect a much higher rate of change.  I'd argue your generalization is broad enough to not be useful.\n\nI have heard a lot of arguments for 'product people', but at the CEO level I don't believe it matters.  Most of the decisions the CEO is going to be making are going to be allocation of capital, managing people, and representing the company to the outside world.  They are not getting down into the really hard technical problems, for that it's going to be the ground level engineers and the middle managers.  The comments about Intel's culture should be more concerning than who their CEO is.\n\nWhile it's possible for an engineer to make a good CEO, it's a very different skill set from designing chips or other highly technical problems.\n\nFurther your comments are very ageist.  I understand it's definitely a thing for older people to not be up on the latest goings on, there are CEO's Swan's age running successful semi conductor companies.  Gary Dickerson (64) of Applied Materials (also not an Engineer), Rich Templeton of Texas Instruments (61), Andy Grove was 62 when he stepped down due to health issues, Gordon Moore was CEO of Intel at 58, Sherman Fairchild was 61 when he founded Fairchild Semiconductor from which Intel drew it's founders.",

If you are in your 20s I think you can take more risk. If you want to play semiconductors look at companies like AMAT or ASML which sell equipment Intel would use.",
