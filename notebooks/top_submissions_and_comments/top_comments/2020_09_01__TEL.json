How do you reach new highs and solidify the current market caps? You correct it slightly. Every bear comes out screaming from the top \u2018it\u2019s all coming down\u2019. This thought in the back of the mind is now at the front, people are panicking, figuring out how they\u2019re going to tel there loved ones except all of a sudden, it stops crashing and markets bottom -10% and immediately bounce. Boom, new bull run. Market caps have been solidified as the low, retail gets massive hard ons because all they see is big green candles and all of a sudden you\u2019ve sparked another massive run.\n\nAnd SoftBank makes billions.\n\nEdit\n\nClearly there\u2019s more to it than that but from a pure psychological stand point, this is just a rekindling of the bull fire.",

And you are 100% dead wrong about describing it as \"military grade AI.\" It is a data integration application that connects different datasets and creates a user interface for humans to comb through and make connections.\n\nThis stock is garbage and extremely overvalued. I believe the catalyst will be insiders dumping their equity first chance they get. The lock-up is until 3 days after the FY 2020 results, but they're allowing insiders to sell up to 20% day 1 tomorrow. Right now I have OTM puts on $SSSS which holds a lot of Palantir shares. $SSSS was pumped up by retail traders looking for an IPO play.\n\nThis is a 17 year old company that has tied a lot of their employee compensation to equity. If you look at the filings, there are 10s of millions of RSUs set to schedule even throughout the next year. These are a huge expense for Palantir in addition to the compensation that has been tied up for TWO DECADES. What people don't understand is that Palantir has been teasing about an IPO for a LONG time. Palantir used to be an extremely hot Silicone Valley destination for Stanford graduates.\n\nThe high-level insiders also have what is described as one of the most aggressive governance structures ever with their class F shares which let them control the company while selling down to 0.5% of the class A shares. They can dump shares tomorrow and still control the company.\n\nThis is not some hot magic data platform provider a la Snowflake, this is a bloated government SaaS contractor. They have a very reliable and niche purpose providing their software to intelligence organizations like the CIA (which was their original purpose, getting their first seed money from the CIA venture capital arm  In-Q-Tel). But they cannot scale that product, \"Gotham.\" They have to hire and train consultant-style employees in order to deploy the application. Hence their massive \"look at this hand!\" magic trick they're trying to pull with their commercial application, \"Foundry.\" I have seen both of these applications and I have seen live demos from Palantir itself. I was impressed with the software, I am not impressed with it from a scale perspective. I genuinely believe that their software is incredibly useful to governments and intelligence organizations that deploy it successfully.\n\nThe magic trick: the majority of their revenue comes from Gotham. Their growth is within existing customers from Gotham. Their revenue from Foundry is a lot smaller and their annual growth is like 25%. Again mostly from existing customers. I can't find the source of the numbers but something like 90%+ of the growth was from existing customers. The reason they want you to focus on the commercial application is because the commercial application is infinitely more scalable than the government application. It's debatable how much easier it is to deploy. But remember that the government application, Gotham, is the majority of their revenue and requires an army of consultant engineers to keep running. It's real glue and toothpick type stuff.\n\nIf you do the digging you will also find numerous stories about corporate customers dropping Palantir, calling it expensive and complicated.\n\nI believe Palantir should be valued at around $6 billion a year, a multiple of around 6x their annual revenue which for the first time in 17 years is rumored to barely eclipse $1 billion.\n\nI firmly believe we are in another technology bubble between these SPAC EVs and tech IPOs. You have this lethargic private software company that's just been in complete zombie mode. 17 years guys. From the private investing perspective this investment needs to be dumped. And now you see their IPO plans go from IPO (roadshow with institutional investors with the bank then setting a price) to a direct listing with a weird lockup. And you see retail traders excited to get in a tech startup direct listing with terrible governance, terrible financials, weird muddled products that most mainstream media outlets can't accurately describe. And don't even get me started on Snowflake.",

From what I remember, they are expensive but do have great products.  If what OP says is true and they're in such high demand, not only will these numbers look good on Q3 and Q4 earnings reports, but these will likely be repeat customers.  Making an instant deposit as we speak, I'm in.\n\nOh, and for what it's worth, the 3.65 GHz band hasn't been utilized nearly as much as the 5.9 GHz band.  Unless you're in the middle of nowhere, 5.9 GHz is becoming very crowded due to no licensing fees and pretty affordable tech.  Fiber is not always feasible, and licensed (11 GHz+) is expensive and a hassle (approved licensing can take up to 90 days).  From what I remember, 3.65 GHz band will be more of a subscription based license, like your cell bill.  I can totally see this ease of use grabbing a large share of the wireless market.  To add to the lack of 3.65 GHz providers, we installed Alvarion radios for a client years ago.  Alvarion has since moved entirely to Tel Aviv, Israel and you cannot even get an English-speaking customer service agent anymore.  Cambium is really all there is.\n\nFeel free to fact check me on the 3.65 GHz info for anyone who could know.  This is a smart play regardless, thank you OP.",

Furthermore, it is a small cap using Tel Aviv Stock Exchange standards. another factor is insiders owning almost 70% of the company, the public float is estimated to value 53M NIS (\\~16M USD). This is a thinly traded and relatively illiquid security.
