Not for me but Goodluck to all. \n\n\nHome-buying startup Opendoor laid off more than 600 employees Wednesday, one of the deepest cuts from a private tech firm since the coronavirus outbreak sent the economy into a tailspin. \n\nThe layoffs amount to 35% of Opendoor\u2019s staff, CEO Eric Wu said in a statement. The company halted home purchases last month, cutting off the home-selling fees that are its main source of revenue. The pause also leaves Opendoor with a number of homes that the firm will likely have to sell for a loss, or pay to maintain as they await sale.",

Not for me but Goodluck to all. \n\n\nHome-buying startup Opendoor laid off more than 600 employees Wednesday, one of the deepest cuts from a private tech firm since the coronavirus outbreak sent the economy into a tailspin. \n\nThe layoffs amount to 35% of Opendoor\u2019s staff, CEO Eric Wu said in a statement. The company halted home purchases last month, cutting off the home-selling fees that are its main source of revenue. The pause also leaves Opendoor with a number of homes that the firm will likely have to sell for a loss, or pay to maintain as they await sale.",
