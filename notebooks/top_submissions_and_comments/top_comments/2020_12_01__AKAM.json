It still hasn't recovered in stock price, though it's probably made up for that through dividends in the last 20 years. It had a PE ratio of \\~200 in comparison to the PE ratio of \\~1200 Tesla has.\n\nWe'll see how it goes, but Tesla definitely has a lot to live up to.",

It just so happens TSLA has rewarded us a lot of the time. Many companies do not reward.\n\nIt reminds me when Tom Leighton's company Akamai went public in the late 90s. AKAM was the next big thing for the internet. Stock price fucking flew and AKAM was doing brilliant things, but what happens to even an innovative company like that when every fly-by-night dot.com was going under and panicked money and leverage was exiting the market?\n\nAlso, fundamental considerations completely ignore psychological and technical reasons TSLA is where it is.
