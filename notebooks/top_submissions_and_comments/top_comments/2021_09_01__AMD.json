Sitting at the restaurant\u2019s outdoor patio, I enjoy my brunch with a glass of wine, my eyes start wandering around. What a beautiful day, the birds, the air, the people. Maybe it\u2019s enough wine for the day, I go in to grab a soft drink. 8 out of 10 drinks on the fountain machine are KO products. Lots people around me are working on their AAPL and MSFT laptops. They are so thin yet very powerful. As a tech geek I know they are powered by INTC and AMD CPUs, and the heavy stuffs are done with NVIDIA GPUs. Gosh people are so productive nowadays! It\u2019s time to leave, I lay my JPM V card to the tray, 5x points for dining baby! 5 mins later I\u2019m on my way. Shit, I\u2019m almost out of gas, pulling into a CVX gas station, tap my BAC MA card because I\u2019ll get 3% cash back on Gas. Damn there\u2019s a line wrapping around that MCD and SBUX drive thru, the food is unhealthy but well business is still booming I guess. \nGetting back into my home, I suddenly remember tomorrow is Oct 1st. I have T, VZ, NFLX bills to pay. \nDamn, I observed a lot from my lazy day today. I wonder what my life would be without all of the conveniences I saw today. \nI log into my Fidelity account and buy 4 more VOO shares. \nFeeling good.",

        "body": "So as a person that\u2019s been an investor for decades AND I have worked in the tech industry for decades, I personally have sold all my Intel stock. I held Intel for about fifteen years but I\u2019m now very convinced that their glory days are behind them. They certainly will be a billion dollar company for decades to come but they are just far too behind the next big race. Here is why. \n\nThe actual architecture and nature of the cpu race has changed. For years it was all about raw performance, we saw this with x86 architecture (which is intels bread and butter) we have seen this for 30 years, higher clock speeds, more cores. But two major shifts happened in the industry that Intel just isn\u2019t prepared for. One is the rise of mobile devices led by the iPhone with android soon to follow. Power consumption became the driving metric for better battery life. Most mobile phones use a cpu architecture called\u201cARM\u201d vs Intels x86 architecture that powers most windows devices. ARM CPU\u2019s use considerably less power then their x86 counterparts and now that the worlds primary computer is their phone, arm has considerable market share. The next thing that happened was ARM CPU\u2019s became incredibly powerful and could rival (and sometimes just destroy) X86 CPU\u2019s in performance while consuming less power. The industry term now is \u201cperformance per watt\u201d This is why Apple is switching out their entire product line to ARM even on Mac\u2019s which over the last decade or so ran Intel CPU\u2019s. \n\nAnother tech shift is cloud computing with the rise of AWS, Azure and Google cloud. Electric costs are out of control for big data centers so these guys are turning to ARM CPU\u2019s for server side work as well. This is a MASSIVE shift in the industry that no one knows about except people that work in the industry. So Intel is being directly assaulted on both the server side and the mobile side in a war that they were WAY late to the party on. I don\u2019t see them recovering easily from this shift. \n\nNow of course none of this happens over night and it will probably take a decade but their hay-days are behind them. Then you look at what AMD is doing and they are actually making decent products after all these years. So even on Intels home turf they have a fierce competitor. Hope that helps.",

If Bitcoin succeeds, mining difficulty will ratchet up and GPUs will not even be considered for mining. If Bitcoin fails, no one will want to mine anyway. And already, most of network's hashing power comes from ASIC rigs, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nFor gaming, NVIDIA does have a pretty good moat in PC gaming, eventhough they have lost the consoles to AMD for now. And AMD is closing in. But, I think the bigger threat is a good game streaming service. If Google Stadia or a hypothetical Apple service becomes good, which I think is highly likely, they won't have any trouble catching a userbase, given their extensive ecosystem. While GeForce Now might be a good subscription model for NVIDIA, IMO it'll be difficult for it to compete against a service that comes with an entrenched ecosystem. While it is possible that NVIDIA chips power those game streaming services, it is also possible that they don't. With AMD closing in, and the larger trend of companies designing their own chips, no telling how that might go.\n\nI welcome critical comments.",

You may turn on to be right, but you've got two Chinese companies amid a period where China is regulating like crazy, basically demanding bribes from companies, and is going to be tough on companies that deal in consumer data.\n\nThen you've got Intel which needs to do some serious innovating if they're going to compete with AMD and Nvidia. I understand their businesses are not exactly the same but I'm assuming they'll move toward that.\n\nAnd finally Foot Locker, an objectively terrible performing stock, very volatile throughout its entire existence, and a store that absolutely sucks.\n\nI'll be very impressed if this goes well for you! Not hating, just observing. To be honest, I've had a bad year in stocks so clearly I'm no one to listen to hahah",

What they are, how to interpret them, how they can help you determine direction of a stock. \n\nStart your screen time learning/experience. Nothing beats actively watching stuff move and unfold right in front of you.\n\nStick to a few stocks. If you really want to be anal about it, just pick 1 stock. Preferably a NASDAQ stock, so take AMD for instance. Watch it every market open for say 30 minutes and see if you can't grasp how it tends to move right at open, 5 minutes into it, how much of a move it's capable of making. Some days it tends to open lower only to cancel out the direction and end day higher, some days it tends to run up for 7 minutes only to give back all its gains. There is a lot to learn from a stock's movement by simply watching it over and over.\n\nThen, have some capital set aside, and start to trade very small (can't get smaller than 1 contract, but you can go as low as 1 share and continually increase it to more if you plan to trade its stock). I personally don't mess with stock for trading. I love options more.",
