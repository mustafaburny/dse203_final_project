        "body": "Some DD, abut outdated because HPQ reached 100 nm particle size\n\nBy MazerRR\n\nPUREVAPTM \n\n\nI could describe the PUREVAPTM process here, but Pyrogenesis does a good job of it on their website. For a description of how the PUREVAPTM works:\n\nhttps://www.pyrogenesis.com/products-services/innovation-custom-process-development/purevap/\n\nWhile the technology for the PUREVAPTM application specific to Silicon may belong to HPQ, all other PUREVAPTM uses are owned by Pyrogenesis. As they said in their first News Release on the technology, from 10/2018, \u201cPyroGenesis\u2019 PUREVAPTM is a disruptive process that has the ability to revolutionize the way the mining &amp; metallurgy industry produces metals.\u201d \n\nhttps://www.pyrogenesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PR-PYROGENESIS-ANNOUNCES-PUREVAP%E2%84%A2-PROCESS-BREAKTHROUGH.pdf.\n \n \n \nHPQ PUREVAPTM for Silicon production\n \nThis section is quite long, however I felt it is appropriate as Pyrogenesis and HPQ are tied quite closely and the efforts in advancing this technology are from Pyrogenesis.\n \nIt all started in 2016, when Pyrogenesis received an $8.26M contract to provide HPQ Silicon Resources (Ticker: HPQ.V) with a PUREVAPTM Quartz Reduction Reactor (QRR) pilot system, aimed at producing Silicon metal directly from Quartz. This is a new process that allows a One-Step production of High Purity Silicon Metal of 4N+ (3N is 99.9% and 4N is 99.99% Si), the key to a green and low-cost metallurgical production of Solar Grade Silicon Metal (SoG-Si), which is necessary for the conversion of the sun\u2019s energy into electricity via solar cell.\n\nSince then, Pyrogenesis has helped build Gen 2 of the PUREVAPTM QRR, and is currently working on the PUREVAPTM NSiR (Nano Silicon Reactor), a modification to their PUREVAP QRR which allows it to produce nano size silicon for Lithium-ion batteries.\n \nHPQ\u2019s website states: \u201cIn collaboration with world-class technology partners, HPQ is working towards demonstrating its unique capacity to be the lowest-cost producer of the advanced Silicon Metal (Si) materials needed for the next generations of Lithium-ion batteries, silicones, and aluminum alloys.\u201d\n \n[Update: the near-term priority of the company has shifted to focus on silicon nanomaterials for the battery space; it appears this is due to the value proposition from the nano silicon market being greater than from the Solar market &amp; them wanting to develop their technology for this without delay. HPQ mentioned in the AGM June 2020 presentation below that perhaps further down the line they would go back to address SoG Si UMG (upgraded metallurgical grade) for the Solar industry.\n\nMr. Tourillon mentioned in the AGM presentation Q&amp;A session (at Timestamp 19:30-20:05):\n \n[06-30-2020]: VIDEO: HPQ AGM 2020 Question &amp; Answer session: https://youtu.be/TlkcRcyedBs\n \n\u201cExpansion of the solar business is going to be limited by the problem related to the energy storage space, so it\u2019s not really a high priority at this moment. The QRR gives us an ace in the hole in the battery space [\u2026] the potential for the market in what we are doing in nano far outweighs whatever we dreamt of at the beginning in the solar part of the business\u201d\n \nThe following corporate presentation clarifies the current plans from HPQ:\nhttps://hpqsilicon.com/presentation/innovative-silicon-solutions-june-2020/ ]\n\n\nFrom this partnership, PYR will receive royalties representing 10% of HPQ\u2019s revenues, should the commercialization of the PUREVAPTM process with Silicon prove successful. They also currently own more than 10% of HPQ\u2019s shares (~14% fully diluted as of 07/03/2020).\n \nThere is lots of interest in industry and academia for the next generation of Li-ion batteries, and especially high-capacity Silicon anode material that can replace graphite. Enter the PUREVAPTM NSiR (Nano Silicon Reactor)\n \n \nPUREVAPTM Nano Silicon Reactor (NSiR)\n \nHPQ and Pyrogenesis are working on the PUREVAPTM NSiR, an upgraded version of the PUREVAPTM QRR Gen 2 reactor, that can transform melted Si metal into spherical Si Nano-powders and Nanowires. They have updated their milestones and by Q4 2020 are expecting to start to produce the nanopowders and nanowire samples for delivery to some battery manufacturers and research institutions, targeting delivery for this year. These key materials are what is needed to produce silicon anodes for the next generation of Li-ion batteries. Impressively, these anodes induce a 20-40% gain in the energy density of Li-ion batteries when using graphite anodes, resulting in a much higher storage capacity! This allows for smaller size batteries for electronic devices and electric cars.\n \nhttps://hpqsilicon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HPQ-NSIR-PUREVAP-RELEASE-FEBRUARY-11-2020-FINAL-VERS-1.pdf\n \nhttps://hpqsilicon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/HPQ-PR-PUREVAP-Battery-Material-VERS_CL7.pdf\n \n \nThe PUREVAPTM Gen 1 NSiR assembly and testing is going on in the next few months, with process validation &amp; optimization expected in Q4 2020. In parallel with this, from Q2 to Q4 2020, engineering design of semi-continuous PUREVAPTM Gen 2 NSiR is expected from Q2 to Q4 2020, with assembly and operation in Q4 2020.\n \nFor all the timeline details of HPQ\u2019s plans with the PUREVAPTM, see their 2020 corporate presentation:\nhttps://hpqsilicon.com/presentation/innovative-silicon-solutions-june-2020/\n \n \nThere are two difficulties that has made using silicon as anode material such a difficult process.\n \n1) Resolving silicon swelling and cracking during the lithiation phase represents a significant challenge in order to achieve a comparable cyclage stability to graphite, the reference anode material of Li-ion batteries [see link of 2020-04 NR above]. According to HPQ\u2019s AGM 2020 corporate presentation, one effective strategy is, if they can get the nanoparticles 150 nm\n \n2) Commercial-scale production of silicon anode materials is prohibitively expensive at the moment, cost reductions are needed to make them viable in the market.\n \nThe issues above are being addressed by HPQ in order to ensure their nano silicon succeeds commercially. HPQ has stated that they are aiming to be the biggest producer of silicon nano materials for industry and not necessarily a producer of silicon anodes; this is their main focus at the moment. With regards to commercializing silicon nano materials, current manufacturing methods used by industry to produce these Si nanopowders are expensive, at US $30,000/kg selling prices, while manufacturing nanowires is so prohibitive that only government funded special projects can afford them. (These statistics cited by HPQ might be slightly out of date, as Mr. Tourillon did mention $2000-$30000/kg in a later interview, but what comes next is what is key). HPQ is working to reduce this down to $30-100/kg at commercial scale. They are looking to supply silicon nanomaterials tailored to the energy storage industry\u2019s requests, with the goal of become the supplier of choice.\n \n[The above paragraph\u2019s information is pulled from the following source: the 2020/02/11 HPQ NR (link is a few paragraphs above) for the current manufacturing costs, 2020 AGM Q&amp;A video below (@Timestamp 11:05-13:20) for their vision with nano silicon production, and the Agoracom 2020/04/15 interview for the $30-$100/kg selling price target (video link is below with the HPQ Agoracom interviews, see timestamp @6:14-8:35)]\n \n[06-30-2020]: VIDEO: HPQ AGM 2020 Question &amp; Answer session: https://youtu.be/TlkcRcyedBs\n \n \nDemand for silicon (Si) based nano powders, in the present state, is estimated to represent an addressable market of US $ 1B by 2022, expanding at a CAGR of 38.9% between 2019 \u2013 2024 (See 2020-04 link above). BloombergNEF indicates that by 2040, energy storage could translate into a demand for 920,000 MT of nano silicon (These statistics are from p.17 of the 2020 Corporate presentation: https://hpqsilicon.com/presentation/innovative-silicon-solutions-june-2020/).\n \n \nPUREVAP &amp; Apollon Solar\n \nHPQ is working with Apollon to develop a manufacturing capability that uses the High Purity Silicon (Si) made with the PUREVAP\u2122 to make Porous silicon wafers and powders needed for solid-state Li-ion batteries &amp; Li-ion batteries.  HPQ stated the first Silicon wafer should be ready to be ship for testing to a battery manufacturer (under NDA) later this year.\n \n \n \nFor those who are interested, the following are recent interviews by Agoracom with Bernard Tourillon, HPQ CEO:\n \n[06-14-2020]: VIDEO: HPQ Silicon Signs 2nd NDA For Its Silicon To Be Used In Energy Storage Application\n \n[04-15-2020]: VIDEO: HPQ Silicon Launches Missile At Graphite, With Potential To Replace Graphite In Lithium-Ion Batteries\n \n02-11-2020]: INTERVIEW: HPQ Game Changing Silicon Process For Lithium-Ion Battery Market Is Just Months Away\n \n[01-30-2020]: INTERVIEW: HPQ Porous Silicon Attracts Lithium-Ion Battery Manufacturer",

        "body": "Part 2/3\n\nThey're not obligated to tell us that they don't actually own the underlying stock certificate and they're paying \"unqualified\" dividends to us to make us think that we do -- oh, by the way, these dividends are taxed as income and aren't eligible for dividend tax rates. Another way they're ramming our ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When settlement failures happen, the shares you buy may not be in your brokerage account regardless of what your broker statement says.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let\u2018s say that your broker gets one of these fails to receive. First of all, they don\u2018t tell you that they got a fail to receive. If you were an institutional buyer or a high-value client, they will tell you that they failed to receive and they will give you some monetary compensation for the delay and inconvenience. They don\u2018t tell individual retail investors. If they did, they would have to share the revenue they earn on investors\u2018 money already paid them for the shares, since brokers don\u2018t have to transfer money for shares they fail to receive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The question then becomes, \u201cWell, how did I get dividends?\u201d You didn\u2018t really get dividends, you got \u201cdividends in lieu.\u201d That means the broker sent money (maybe part of *your* money) as dividends. You will know this if your 1099 from the broker says \u201cunqualified dividends.\u201d They are generally considered ordinary income and not eligible for dividend\u00a0tax rates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sometimes, a large broker with many clients seeking the same stock will receive only part of a particular share order. Some clients get real shares, others phantom entitlements. Trimbath said an investor might ask, \u201cHow did I get picked out for that?\u201d She said, \u201cThe problem is, we don\u2018t know. And they won\u2018t tell us. If you were assigned the fail to receive, then the broker has many options, none of which they have to tell you.\u201d\n\nOh, and they're fucking our voting rights! They're letting us vote and then throwing out the votes they don't like. Legally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Before the 2008 crash, at an annual proxy meeting, Bank of America counted 130% of its shares voted, that is, they received 30% more votes than they had shares outstanding. That\u2018s just the number of people who actually voted their shares! Imagine how many shares were sold beyond what they actually authorized and issued. This violates the voting rights of shareholders and reduces effective corporate governance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath pointed out, Let\u2018s say it\u2018s the merger of Compaq and Hewlett Packard. Let\u2018s say that there are a lot of these extra shares around and they have more votes than shares coming in. And let\u2018s say that your broker/dealer is JP Morgan, who was actually one of the advisors on that merger deal. They stood to gain more in fees if the merger went through than if it was voted down. Do you think that they would be so careful about your vote that if you voted against something they were in favor of that they would not be tempted to only turn in the votes that they thought should be counted, those that were most favorable to their position, as opposed to trying to make sure that everything was done according to the rules. But, there are no rules! They just make them up as they go along.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She said, They can, in fact, throw out your vote and just not count it. They can randomly assign your vote to some real proxy that wasn\u2018t voted. They can vote what shares they actually do have proportionally based on how many phantom votes come in. It\u2018s all done in secrecy. They don\u2018t have to tell you, they don\u2018t have to tell the NYSE, they don\u2018t have to tell anyone. They don\u2018t have to tell the company whose shares they voted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And the SEC isn\u2018t interested. To deal with over-voting, the SEC didn\u2018t say, Stop telling clients they have voting shares when they don\u2018t. It said, Don\u2018t submit more votes than shares you are holding. And brokers could choose which votes they wanted to submit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey even have cutsy little names for their fuckery and fraud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Even a university economist who spent 2004 at the SEC studying fails acknowledged in so many words that the broker-dealers do it on purpose. Leslie Boni (now with a hedge fund in Southern California) attributed the extraordinary increase in settlement failures to investment decisions known as \u201c**strategic failures**.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trimbath noted that in 2007, \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2018s Treasury Markets Practices Group (TMPG) describes several intentionally abusive practices such as **\u201cslamming the wire**\u201d (holding back deliveries until immediately before the close with the intention of causing settlement fails) and requests from traders for settlement operations to \u201c**hold the box**\u201d (a demand to delay settlement of an executed trade). The fact that these practices are colloquially named and described in such detail indicates that they are common causes of settlement failures.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh! Everyone saying it's illegal to naked short? Only sort of. Only for the stock of certain financial companies. That's right, they only made it illegal to drive down the valuation of their buddies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The SEC continued to declare that fails to deliver were not an indication of naked short selling. That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected. Trimbath pointed out that not till the banks/broker-dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short-selling ban in place \u2013 but only for the shares of banks, insurance companies and securities firms, including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, it's a big problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission: In the first two weeks of July 2019, 914,261,864 shares valued at over $17 billion failed to deliver in settlement from the clearing house, an average of about $1.9 billion every settlement day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCon't below...",
