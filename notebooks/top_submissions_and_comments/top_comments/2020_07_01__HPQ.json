AMD keep saying Q3, I have no idea how they will pull that off, that's like now. \n\nZen 4 will be total market dominance in CPU (if not from Zen 3), Huawei got banned from TSMC and AMD joinked their reserved wafers on 5 nm. The smartphone guys usually launch on the new node in like March, AMD will probably need longer, but not that much longer.

For some officials to say, \"we will not go back into lockdown or close businesses\" and then a couple days later close down businesses, they must be receiving enough intel/pressure to know they're going to lose far more tax revenue in the long run if they try and keep everything open through a huge holiday weekend and just shut everything down on Monday 7/6.

The Ambani family which controls Reliance is THE most politically connected in India - to the extent they can dictate ministers (secretaries to Americans) to the government. They just need to ask and policies turn on a dime to their advantage.\n\nThe mobile phone services in India were dominated by two companies - Vodafone and Airtel. The moment Reliance launched Jio, things went south for those two. Telecom regulations suddenly changed to the exclusive benefit of Jio and to the detriment of others. A new tax law came into being and Vodafone was assessed massive taxes with retroactive effect. They were ultimately hounded out by the government.\n\nSo, the core competencies of Reliance are massive government influence and the ability to get big investors onboard. They do not have technical know-how and this is where companies like FB and INTC come in. Bring the knowledge and get a piece of exclusive action in a vast market.",

All the stocks you have just mentioned have had historical runs, a 50% return over the next two years will be difficult, but I see as easily attainable. I would personally put the 10k into an index fund $QQQ this index is a cap-weighted index of the Nasdaq. It\u2019s main holdings are Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, Cisco, and Facebook. It\u2019s up 35% in the past year. \n\nIf, \u201cbig if\u201d stocks continue the trend of the last 8 years, these stocks will give you a ~50% return.\nThis is based on the assumption that easy money continues to enter the market, and the economy reopens quickly. Multiple things could affect this. But in my opinion this is your best bet. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t get greedy and chase \u201chype\u201d companies like NIO, their are 20 NIO\u2019s for every one Tesla.",

The day Intel chips show promise, you'll see that share going down.  So what are they doing to keep that number going high? AMD lacks focused strategy.\n2. Semi-custom is not a big market -- PS5/XBOX can only give you few dollars.  But their cycle is 2yrs.. year end you will see this number go up because of their release.\n3. Only possibe domain it can grow is Server.  It currently has 8% market share but Intel has 90%.  If AMD valuation needs to go high, this is the place they need to make money. AMD recently made a huge deal with CRAY -- this is AWESOME.  If they develop integrated solutions on top of which you can run 3rd party software -- you've a winning product!  Imagine running all CUDA on top of AMD servers.\n\nSo it's possible but there are several roadblocks.  I missed on the graphics market, but it has similar problems.

        "body": "The difference in price and margins would be huge yeah, buying the silicon from TSMC would probably be around $30 per chip + Apple's development costs. \n\nI saw rumors about them having double the cores of the iPhone SoC, which would help multi-thread, but single thread will always be the most important thing for basic workloads, ie what you would do on a laptop. It wouldn't even need good multi-thread, the current low spec MacBooks are dual-cores. With that single thread performance and 11 other fast/power efficient cores it will just end up being crazy good for laptops. \n\nI don't really care that much about GPU, the big thing about switching to Arm is freeing yourself from Intel and AMD's patent duopoly on x86 processors, which powers all desktop/servers in the world. For Arm processors anyone can just buy a license to use them, same thing with GPUs, anyone can make a GPU. Being free from x86 you have full control of the silicon so you can just licence or create whatever GPU you want and add it to the same silicon as the CPU. AMD just licensed out their GPU IP to Samsung for mobile SoC.\n\nBuying a x86 processor from Intel They own the silicon, they send you a finished chip and you get to connect whatever your shit is to it. With Arm you can get all your shit together and just put it all on one chip. AMD isn't as protective of their GPU stuff so if you license it they just give you their design and you get to copy paste the transistor layout over onto your chip, you also have the option of just picking how many of AMD's compute units you want in your design. The cost will also be way lower, because AMD would just be giving you the design, you would be responsible for shipping the design to TSMC to have it fabricated. \n\nMac Pro and server? I don't think it will ever happen, x86 is just too entrenched for professional use. Windows only runs on x86, plus everything Nvidia/Intel/AMD really cares about is server, they wouldn't let it slip. The one way in would be like through Amazon AWS you can offer Arm server for cheaper to anyone who doesn't care about x86. The thing everyone can make Arm, Amazon is already doing that with their own developed Arm processors, and nobody cares about them. A lot would have to change. \n\n [https://www.toptal.com/back-end/arm-servers-armv8-for-datacentres](https://www.toptal.com/back-end/arm-servers-armv8-for-datacentres) \n\nThis was written 4 years ago, zero progress.",

It will have helped to increase the stock price over time, but there won't be a huge jump when the PS5 and Xbox Series X One X Series Boxx comes out.\n\nOne of the reasons AMD is strong, and will become increasingly stronger, is that they produce excellent price to performance ratio CPUs and GPUs. They are smashing Intel at the moment. Sure Intel produce the ultimate best performance CPUs out there, but generally gamers right now are buying AMD in their droves becuase they can get almost as much power for significantly less cost. If you look at the gaming market as a whole, it's not dominated by super rich gamers who are dropping $2k on their rigs, it's full of lower end custom builders who are looking for the best price to performance ratio.\n\nIn some cases the AMD CPUs outperform Intel counterparts for a lot less money. Intel is really dragging it's heels at the moment. And in the top tier CPUs, AMD currently offer a Ryzen 3390x CPU, which is a mind blowing 64 core, for just $4,000. The Intel equivlent costs $20,000 and doesn't even have as many cores!\n\nAlso the APU market is still in very early days, and something AMD can capitalise on in the future - some say that APUs are the future, and AMD could even de-throne Nvidia if they made APUs powerful enough.",
