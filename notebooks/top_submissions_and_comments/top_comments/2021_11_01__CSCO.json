To give you an example every Cisco client I had in late 99 and early 00 were so certain that their stock would hit $100/sh that year that they often would refuse our recommendation to sell some Cisco to diversify away from tech because they all had huge amounts of still restricted options coming due every quarter.  I had one client at the director level (between VP and Sr VP) that earned 50,000 fresh options every quarter.   He did instruct his advisor to immediately sell all CSCO after exercise and reinvest it all away from tech.  By mid 2001 CSCO was at $12.   I had another client that was CEO of one of the tech darlings and had taken over and been given 2 mm shares for doing so.   One Monday I had a meeting with him in his office and he said he had been in LA over the weekend and did a private sale for one millon of those shares at $115 million dollars.  During that meeting he got a call from a member of the BoD that was reaming him a new asshole for selling half his stock.  My client simply told him that he had been hired to bring up the stock price from single digits to its current $115 value and hung up.  Twelve months later the company declared bankruptcy.  So at least he got out with his part.   Remember Microsoft lost 67% and Amazon lost over 90% of its value, so it wasn't just companies with no profits that fell, but everyone.  By the way Cisco still has not regained its $77 price in spring of 2000 and yet still successfully is the backbone of the internet and employes thousands of people.\n\nToday we don't have just a tech bubble as we had in 99, we instead have an everything bubble.",

We ran into this in the 1970s-80s too, where inflation was high, wage growth was low, and economic activity was treading water. Then we had the computer revolution with Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Intel, and about 100 other players that pulled us through the 80s when rates were hiked way up. Then rates came back down to something reasonable (i.e. not 0%) and we had the Internet revolution with Amazon, AOL (lol I know), Google, Facebook, and others.\n\nBut *all of that* was made possible because we made big investments during the 40s-60s in things like computers, transistors, Arpanet, etc. These things take time to pay off, some of them don't pan out, but that's why you:\n\n1. Invest.\n2. Diversify.\n\nOver the last 40 years, the investment in infrastructure and basic research has been whittled away by the Republican party.

As far as I can tell, the only sector that is THAT ridiculously hyped right now is the EV market. I'd like examples of other things that are bad, but that's all that sticks out to me right now.\n\nYes, rising interest rates are going to kill growth stocks in general, and some of those companies are big parts of SPX. Companies that are relying on that easy money for survival are going to have a hard time, some might go under. It's still not even CLOSE to a dot-com situation.\n\n I'd agree that Tesla is FOR SURE the poster child of a dot-com-esque company in 2021. but honestly even the extreme example of Tesla isn't even that bad. Despite the insane valuation, Tesla is a profitable company. A ridiculous number of companies in dot-com era were non-profitable on low revenue, with no pathway to viability EVER.\n\nYahoo (one of the companies that actually SURVIVED), peaked at a valuation of $140 billion. The previous year they reported net earnings of $50 million on $200 million in revenue. That's a P/E of 2800. Tesla right now is sitting at a P/E in the 300s.\n\nMany of the companies in the Dotcom era were in SUBSTANTIALLY worse shape than Yahoo, and they were absolutely everywhere. Pets .com literally spent 20x their revenue on advertising. 90% of an entire sector was legitimately worthless. That's why Microsoft, Amazon, Cisco, etc sold off so hard. Not because they weren't viable businesses, but because they'd ridden the ride up as a secondary member of the Dotcom companies. Amazon actually makes money, and the reason their earnings aren't higher rn is largely because of Capex. If the shitty EV companies go under as a result of high interest rates or whatever, it's not like electric cars won't get made. GM, Ford, etc will be able to make them, preserving much of the utility of the companies that provide materials and infrastructure for the overvalued EV companies to operate.\n\nI'm not saying that everything in the market is fine or that interest rates aren't going to hurt some sectors pretty hard, but I think the post I originally replied to DRASTICALLY overstated companies' current valuations vs the Dotcom bubble. And remember, Yahoo was the google of the era, trading at a PE of 2800. Google, the google of our era, is trading at a PE of 28.\n\nI hope this provides some perspective.",

What I have found is that using a classic valuation approach works very well for investing in mature slow or moderately growing companies with earnings of the kind that you would invest in to provide a dividend income stream--if you supplement analyzing valuation in terms of the numbers reported in quarterly reports and then added a good dash of qualitative common sense--which often, for me at least, involves being more aware of the things going on in the world that might impact the business and the quality of the company's management and the wisdom with which they employ their cash. \n\nBut you can't use that kind of valuation to invest in speculative growth stocks that have no earnings or earnings that are miniscule compared to their shrae prices. They are, and have always been momentum-driven and all about story and dreams of getting rich. \n\nBut this isn't anything new. Speculative growth stocks were like that in the 1990s, too.  And as will happen again, a whole lot of hot stocks with huge share prices and zero earnings took investors' money and crashed, while others have turned into AAPL and AMZN. The problem is back in 1998 you might have had a very hard time knowing which was going to be the superstar AMZN, and which, like CSCO, still wouldn't have gotten back to its 2000 price in 2021.",

My commute went from a crazy 3 hours to Sunnyvale (only 35 miles) to less than an hour between 2000 and 2002.\n\nNow for the youngsters thinking about this, if you are investing for retirement a crash benefits you greatly.  Why?  Your 401k balance goes down, but your 401k investment every paycheck buys you more stock than it would if you weren't in a crash.  And eventually your older investments return and your more recent purchases go up dramatically.  So for a young person looking for retirement in 3 or 4 or 5 decades a crash or two can be a great help.  In 2000 I had substantial 401k assets that went way down, but I was smart enough to leave them 100% in growth equity funds through that crash and also through the Great Recession, so when I retired I was just fine as everything had recovered.  I did also have a taxable account with less long term money that got killed in the bubble crash.  Juniper at $60-113.  Adaptive Broadband at $113.  Cisco at $60.  and so on.

Those terms mean different things to different people, each playing different strategies.\n\nTypically when i hear pundits use the term growth stock, it means a lot of growth is baked into the price, and value stocks are those which have no growth baked in.  Whether one stock beats another is more a function of whether they were priced correctly or not at the time of purchase &amp; the time of sale.  \n\nGrowth stocks are typically priced for perfection, value stocks are priced with a ma rgin of safety.  By definition, it's more likely that growth will not meet perfection as a class, and value should exceed the margin of safety...over time...since we know that in the short term, markets are a voting machine, in the long term markets are a weighing machine.\n\nGE is an example of a company which messed up, so of course it's price should decline to reflect that.  GE in the course of it's existence had been a value stock, and at other times had been a growth stock.  Ideally you buy a value stock which has the potential for growth.\n\nWhen i see people investing in Tesla today, it's now amongst the largest market caps in the world, i just can't help to think that over the long term, it's so expensive that even if everything works out operationally as well as it could go, how can its valuation be justified 5 or 10 years from now, what could the return be?  When i see Tesla today, i think of Cisco in 2000, priced just below $60, largest market cap, and wow, what a great company, everything worked out for them, just as everybody thought, yet it took until 21 years later for it price to bounce back to $60 and finally earn a positive return.\n\nThe price you pay for the value and growth of a stock matters.

        "body": "The big signal that the 1990s tech bubble was over was when Time Warner and AOL merged. The large old world media company desperate to stay relevant merged with the flashiest newcomer without really understanding the new world. Up to then, investors believed that the whole world would go online very quickly but the core infrastructure was not there so any company that was building it could raise lots of cheap money which led to overbuilding because the backbone was not technologically difficult. Every firm that spawned to put fiber in the ground went Chapter 11 and there is still excess fiber in the ground today from all the overbuilding. The network equipment companies that sprung up to manage all the future traffic largely collapsed as well. Cisco bought some of them.  Some pivoted to wireless and survived. \n\nI see a similar pattern in the EV space. Building EV vehicles is not technically difficult. Battery tech is the same for everyone. All the excitement is about design. The same goes for cloud services. There is a race for capacity right now as supply tries to catch up to demand but at some point there will be plenty of capacity and prices will crash. Or privacy concerns will drive data back to the device. That shift - if it happens -  would be a disaster for many cloud service support companies. \n\nThe big difference is that so many of the new tech companies in the 1990s had a long horizon of losses while today, the big winners are all highly profitable or at least wait to go public much longer when their business is well established. This is a healthy difference.",

        "body": "I posted about the McDonalds deal last week, a few people are talking about them.\ud83d\ude09\n\n&gt;most big companies spinoff apart of their business because well it\u2019s to unload all the garbage debt that the parent company (IBM owns). So all bad debt now going to that spinoff company\n\nThe real problem is that IBM has a longstanding, very successful managed IT services division. 30 years ago that was high margin, but now it is low margin. And now they're more focused on cloud services. These units are directly competing. And it creates confusion for existing customers. By spinning off the old-school part of the IT consulting services, they clarify things a lot. It can be awkward to negotiate contracts when you're competing with yourself. And the industry has moved strongly to \"hybrid cloud,\" with multi-vendor support, so they can get more money from the managed infrastructure clients in the spinoff, where those clients might choose some other cloud provider. And IBM can stay focused on being a cloud and AI provider.\n\nKyndryl isn't full of debt it is just low-margin and contains a lot of harmful redundancy that may thrive separately.\n\nIBM has been doing major partnerships for almost 100 years, they're not the sort of company that creates a bunch of debt they can't pay and have to stuff in a suitcase. Check their credit rating.\n\nThe Palo Alto deal sounds really good, that could be a big winner for both. The Cisco deal will likely be irrelevant unless Cisco finds a better angle for a 5G play. The Boston Dynamics thing may be pretty good, but it is always hard to tell with BD if it is just going to result in nice videos. The Raytheon thing is good for Raytheon in the short term, and in the very-unlikely event that quantum computing actually impacts computer security in the next 100 years, it will help them both to have a working relationship in place.\n\nIBM has a lot of other stuff going on too. They recently signed a deal to take over Honda's European finance and procurement operations. They've been \"global allies\" with Deloitte for over 20 years are going to offer a new AI-backed anti-fraud service to governments, for example to identify tax fraud.\n\nMost of what they do flies under the radar, but they've got a lot going on, and the extra free cash flow they'll get from spinning off the legacy IT will really help them.",

Do they do deep packet inspection to understand network based attacks? Do they do quarantining and isolation when a node is compromised?\n\n* Find out partnerships.

Even AMZN took over a decade to recover.  Having a portfolio that includes dividends would make sense to hedge against a market correction.  Twenty (20) years  is a long time to not sell and keep working while you wait for a recovery.  Personally I think I'll be surprised if I'm still alive in 20 years.",

So all bad debt now going to that spinoff company\n\nThe real problem is that IBM has a longstanding, very successful managed IT services division. 30 years ago that was high margin, but now it is low margin. And now they're more focused on cloud services. These units are directly competing. And it creates confusion for existing customers. By spinning off the old-school part of the IT consulting services, they clarify things a lot. It can be awkward to negotiate contracts when you're competing with yourself. And the industry has moved strongly to \"hybrid cloud,\" with multi-vendor support, so they can get more money from the managed infrastructure clients in the spinoff, where those clients might choose some other cloud provider. And IBM can stay focused on being a cloud and AI provider.\n\nKyndryl isn't full of debt it is just low-margin and contains a lot of harmful redundancy that may thrive separately.\n\nIBM has been doing major partnerships for almost 100 years, they're not the sort of company that creates a bunch of debt they can't pay and have to stuff in a suitcase. Check their credit rating.\n\nThe Palo Alto deal sounds really good, that could be a big winner for both. The Cisco deal will likely be irrelevant unless Cisco finds a better angle for a 5G play. The Boston Dynamics thing may be pretty good, but it is always hard to tell with BD if it is just going to result in nice videos. The Raytheon thing is good for Raytheon in the short term, and in the very-unlikely event that quantum computing actually impacts computer security in the next 100 years, it will help them both to have a working relationship in place.\n\nIBM has a lot of other stuff going on too. They recently signed a deal to take over Honda's European finance and procurement operations. They've been \"global allies\" with Deloitte for over 20 years are going to offer a new AI-backed anti-fraud service to governments, for example to identify tax fraud.\n\nMost of what they do flies under the radar, but they've got a lot going on, and the extra free cash flow they'll get from spinning off the legacy IT will really help them.",

Plug their numbers into a DCF (using their non-Gaap earnings, and assume an annual EPS of $0,12). Using 100% growth the first five years and 50% from year 5-10, a PE of 30 and a target rate of return of 15%, we arrive at a maximum price of $216,24.
