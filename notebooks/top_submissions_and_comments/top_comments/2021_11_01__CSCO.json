So all bad debt now going to that spinoff company\n\nThe real problem is that IBM has a longstanding, very successful managed IT services division. 30 years ago that was high margin, but now it is low margin. And now they're more focused on cloud services. These units are directly competing. And it creates confusion for existing customers. By spinning off the old-school part of the IT consulting services, they clarify things a lot. It can be awkward to negotiate contracts when you're competing with yourself. And the industry has moved strongly to \"hybrid cloud,\" with multi-vendor support, so they can get more money from the managed infrastructure clients in the spinoff, where those clients might choose some other cloud provider. And IBM can stay focused on being a cloud and AI provider.\n\nKyndryl isn't full of debt it is just low-margin and contains a lot of harmful redundancy that may thrive separately.\n\nIBM has been doing major partnerships for almost 100 years, they're not the sort of company that creates a bunch of debt they can't pay and have to stuff in a suitcase. Check their credit rating.\n\nThe Palo Alto deal sounds really good, that could be a big winner for both. The Cisco deal will likely be irrelevant unless Cisco finds a better angle for a 5G play. The Boston Dynamics thing may be pretty good, but it is always hard to tell with BD if it is just going to result in nice videos. The Raytheon thing is good for Raytheon in the short term, and in the very-unlikely event that quantum computing actually impacts computer security in the next 100 years, it will help them both to have a working relationship in place.\n\nIBM has a lot of other stuff going on too. They recently signed a deal to take over Honda's European finance and procurement operations. They've been \"global allies\" with Deloitte for over 20 years are going to offer a new AI-backed anti-fraud service to governments, for example to identify tax fraud.\n\nMost of what they do flies under the radar, but they've got a lot going on, and the extra free cash flow they'll get from spinning off the legacy IT will really help them.",

Many of the highfliers went bankrupt or still didn't reach it's high after 20+ years (Cisco, Intel, Microstrategy, Yahoo). \n\nPrice matters and the company has a P/S of 120. Plug their numbers into a DCF (using their non-Gaap earnings, and assume an annual EPS of $0,12). Using 100% growth the first five years and 50% from year 5-10, a PE of 30 and a target rate of return of 15%, we arrive at a maximum price of $216,24.  The company increased revenue 50% a year tho, so using 50% growth for the 10 years, we arrive at a price of $51,31. \n\nLooking at the FAANG stocks, not a single one could increase revenue 50%+ for a decade. \n\nSo even if everything goes perfectly for Cloudflare and 50% growth for a decade, you loose heavily. If they grow 100% a year (which they don't even do now), you have an upside of less than 8%.",
