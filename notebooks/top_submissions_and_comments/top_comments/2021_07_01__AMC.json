That shouldn't be difficult. \n\nFor example, you can have a beer on the couch at home and watch a movie, but you can't smuggle that beer into the sitting room in your undercrackers. It's your home. \n\nYou can finger somebody on the couch watching Frozen, but it's not the same as doing it in a cinema full of kids. \n\nSure, you can sit on the couch and just throw popcorn and hotdogs on the floor, but no teenager is coming by to clean it up after you. \n\nNudderwords, AMC needs to remind people that we don't go to the cinema for the \"magic of the silver screen,\" we go there to act like feral animals.",

This is why many deSPACs companies are target for pump and dump on WSB as well.\n\nSo will CLOV magically pump to $20+ again saving your ridiculous position? Maybe.

Shorts sre running out of ammo while simultaneously coiling the spring back more and more. The last couple weeks of consolidation have set up a nasty bull flag which from a TA standpoint, bodes very well for apes. AMC has been on the securities threshold list for 5 days as of tonight, meaning there is an absurd number of FTDs. I believe it gets to 13 days then they are forced to cover at market price. Lastly, we havent seen any action from the SEC, but theres large number of changes to regulations to prevent abusive short selling like whats been going on with AMC/GME and countless others. Any of these can trigger a spike in the price leading to margin calls and MOASS. Things are all falling into place, just a matter of time at this point",

(ex: Citadel ) The whole fact that a hedge fund or investment institution of any kind can be granted market maker status is wrong. It is an undeniable conflict of interest and the current market status is proof. My idea is to either remove the status/rank or dial back the privilege\u2019s of  market makers. \r  \n \r  \nThis would include:\r  \n \r  \n\\-Ability to produce shares to artificially create liquidity, this has proven to dilute a companies poll which in turn can be abused. There are literally hundreds if not thousands  instances happening at the very moment. Just to name a few companies who have had their pools diluted in a predatory fashion-\r  \n$AMC, $GME, $TRCH now $MMAT, $SPCE, $HCMC, $CUEN, $MRIN, $XELA, $KOSS, $BB and hundreds more. \r  \n \r  \n1.\tRemove the ability to infinitely reset the Failure To Deliver timer. \r  \n2.\tForce collateral requirements to be met with money or physical shares. No using options contracts as collateral, if they want to use options then they must exercise the contracts to obtain the shares to fulfill their requirements. This also goes for shares that are held on margin, since you technically do not own the share when it is held on margin. \r  \n \r  \nIf a company would like to be a market maker then they should be a stand alone entity to avoid any initial conflict of interest. \r  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote this while my pain meds were taking hold, but I think it was straight to the point.",
