I personally don't think TSMC is a good benchmark here as the foundry services offered by ON aren't the / shouldn't be the primary draw and it's not really a \"pure-play\" org. IMO, the competitors I'd be looking at are Texas Instruments, Diodes Inc, Broadcom (to a lesser degree), Infineon and maybe Qualcomm. Unfortunately, due to time constraints I haven't got as good a grasp on this one as I should have. I'll certainly be looking into this as a next step along side just doing more general research on competitors.\n2. Potentially this was poorly explained. Essentially they are selling fabs that have historically been relatively low margin. Yes this reduces capacity (at least short term), however as the new fab they have built is brough up to speed, they expect the capacity to increase overall. Additionally, the new fab promises to be higher margin, allowing them to improve overall FCF / NOPAT. The current expectation is it should be up and fully running by 2023. I think there is some technological advantage to this as well. The fab they're buying is an existing GloFo (Global Foundries) fab that manufactures on 300mm wafers. This new fab will allow them to transition from a number of 200mm wafer fabs to the new one. I think there's also some CMOS technology licensing / knowledge transfer taking place but that's not really been an in-depth focus for me.\n\nUseful reading around item 2:\n\n* [https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2019/05/15/on-semiconductor-and-globalfoundries-both-win-with-its-430m-fab-10-deal/?sh=3f749f561b34](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2019/05/15/on-semiconductor-and-globalfoundries-both-win-with-its-430m-fab-10-deal/?sh=3f749f561b34)\n* [https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/semi-buys-glofo-east-fishkill-fab-2019-04/](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/semi-buys-glofo-east-fishkill-fab-2019-04/)",

However, 3+ years out (and assuming a successful implementation of the current management plan) I think they are actually relatively undervalued. If you look at trailing P/E it's actually lower than those of Texas Instruments and Diodes Inc (among others). For me it's more about the promise / expectation of improvements in financials, upgrades in technology etc. which I think will allow it to gain market share in some growing areas.\n\nPersonally, I randomly picked ON just to work on improving my own analysis skills, but after reviewing I decided to go in with a small sum. The weakest aspect of my DD is definitely my competitive analysis piece, which is something I'm hoping to improve and learn from!",
