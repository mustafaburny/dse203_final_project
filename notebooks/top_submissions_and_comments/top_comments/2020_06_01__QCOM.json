        "body": "On pure performance Intel held over a decade where there was no competition.\n\nToday there is AMD\u2019s new Ryzen architecture which gives Intel a very good run for the money.  This chip is x86 compatible and can run software for Intel CPUs.  For simplicity let\u2019s call this \u201cspeaking English\u201d.\n\nAnd then we have ARM, which Apple and Qualcomm are the largest firms producing those chips.  For our simplistic explication let\u2019s say they speak Spanish.\n\nSoftware for x86 (English) won\u2019t work as is on ARM (Spanish) even if developed against the same operating system.  So it either needs to be recompiled (rewritten in Spanish) or needs to be on the fly translated (which is really slow).\n\nApple has twice now switched CPU architectures that are incompatible with one another and this move to ARM will be switch #3.  It takes a lot of effort to pull off such a major switch and not anger or confuse users in the process.\n\nOnce Apple moves to ARM the only real big use left for Intel is Windows PCs and the data center.  Windows 10 was ported to ARM as well and AMD has a very competitive chip for the data center.\n\nI don\u2019t see Intel having much relevance a few years from now.",

        "body": "You probably should have closed 5 minutes before close but maybe QCOM rockets tomorrow and also has high IV, resulting in you making even more money.  I'll discuss my trade and perhaps my thought process will help you, but keep in mind what I did may not yield the highest profit (i.e., you might make more by holding).\n\nI bought 1 QCOM 12 JUN 20 85c at 0.52 at 11:40 am ET ([proof](https://imgur.com/a/voVXNSz), the times in the trade here are Pacific but I use Eastern in the post so people don't get confused) and closed at 3:55 pm ET at 1.87.  In light of the other activity in the option chain, I was confident that this unusual option activity (UOA) was not an arbitrage play (e.g., conversion or reverse conversion).  That said, the UOA volume on calls doesn't tell you if the \"smart\" money was short or long in the position (i.e., in the 22,000 that resulted from the 35,000 volume yesterday, how many of those 22,000 contracts is the smart money long or short on, it's one or the other).  I did not look at the history to see the skew between calls and puts, but perhaps selling calls might have netted more premium in the event of a decline in QCOM (e.g., instead of buying puts at a higher premium and profiting when the stock declines, maybe they were looking to sell a call at, say, 0.50 and with a market decline, buy to close their calls at, say, 0.25).  But I ultimately concluded that the smart money being short on the calls was highly unlikely in light the QCOM's presence in the 5G arena and then some; and, therefore, I was fairly confident that the smart money was bullish on QCOM and therefore long on all of these calls.  How confident?  1 contract worth, lol...but this more or less stems from me selecting--in a testing type way--UOA to participate in and gauge my analysis of the UOA.  I want to see if I am analyzing things correctly before I go to 5 or 10 contracts.\n\nWith such large activity on the call side, the market maker who is short all of these calls is in a risky situation since they are short \\~22,000 calls at this strike price alone (remember, other UOA was present on calls at other strike prices).  That means the market maker may, but not necessarily, start buying stock to hedge its position against these short calls.  Why does this matter?  If the market maker chooses to hedge, this can cause a rally because the market maker is buying TONS of stock.  Perhaps that's what happened today, or maybe the market maker didn't hedge and the rally is attributable to something else.  To me, it seems like the market maker hedged by buying shares because of the absolutely staggering increase in volume on the stock (not the option) starting at around 2:40 pm.  Who knows, maybe this volume wasn't the market maker.  I welcome any thoughts on my analysis.\n\nNow, why did I close at 3:55 pm?  I looked at one thing (because the position was already doing very well):  The volume on the 12 JUN 20 85c at the time.  It was around 20,000-21,000 (I don't remember exactly).  I interpreted this to mean that the smart money had closed most, if not all, of their long calls.  We'll find out tomorrow morning when we look at OI.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/Pkd9wly) is a picture of the option chain after close (it shows OI and volume).  I'm guessing the OI will be around 5,000 or less.  If the smart money is closing, I wanted to follow suit and so I did.  Why does it matter?  If the rally was indeed a result of the market maker hedging its position on all of the short calls it held, then after it's need for the hedge disappears, so too does its need for the shares and a sell off by the market maker can (but not necessarily) occur.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/viVMkyu) is a picture of the afternoon rally.  I got one of the highest prices when I closed.  Within the last 5 minutes after I closed my position, the premium dropped to around 1.70.  You can see the last trade in the option chain picture is 1.71.\n\nHope all of this helps.  Again, I welcome anyone's feedback on my analysis!  And who knows, maybe I missed out on profits by closing at 3:55pm.  Time will tell.  Regardless, I am very happy with this trade.  Good luck to you all!\n\nEdit:  Another possible scenario I thought of is the smart money wanting to enter a large position in the underlying in a short period of time and so to offset the increased cost of the shares they buy in a vast quantity, they buy calls beforehand to reduce their basis in the stock by selling the calls after their entry causes a rally.",

Some of the old links to letters are fascinating and I have learned a ton just following along. \n\nAnyways, one of the company's I have been researching over the past almost year is Teradyne. While reading their latest 10Q, I come across the below paragraph under their revenue section which describes them selling their accounts receivables to third-parties. I am unfamiliar with the mechanics of this and how the below works, if someone could point me in the right direction for a resource or provide a quick explainer that would be great.\n\nFrom 10Q:\n\n *Accounts Receivable*\n\n*Teradyne sells certain trade accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. Teradyne accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as a cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring agreements were $46.8\u00a0million and $41.7\u00a0million for the three months ended March\u00a029, 2020 and March\u00a031, 2019, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in interest expense and were not material.*\n\nI am looking for a possible reason that they might sell their accounts receivables and if this is possibly any type of red flag? When I peruse Google, it seems that a typical reason that a company would sell accounts receivables is to raise cash, but TER typically has a good amount of cash on hand. \n\nI appreciate any help,",
