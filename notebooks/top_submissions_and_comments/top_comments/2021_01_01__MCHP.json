        "body": " \n\nHello, beginner in the stock market here. I would like some advice on how to make better use of my money. I had started out on April 6, 2020, due to the pandemic with 60.00 USD. as of now, I'm currently at 107.21 USD and made over 47.20 USD since I started. I am 19 years old, unemployed. As of now I still live with my family but I'd like to make some money on the market to set up emergency funds or a way to start out my life going forward. I don't need to make piles of money right away, just at least a fair amount within a year or so. I am very tolerant with risk just as long as I don't lose everything. I've never been in debt. I'd appreciate some advice. Here is some information that may be useful:\n\n\\-\n\nBuying power: 7.02 USD\n\n\\-\n\nStocks | Shares\n\nMSFT: 0.01\n\nWEN: 0.231332\n\nTSLA: 0.0145\n\nAMZN: 0.0007\n\nBABA: 0.02\n\nGOOG: 0.001\n\nSNE: 0.02\n\nMCHP: 0.038265\n\nDUK: 0.06337\n\nGILD: 0.051011\n\nNVAX: 0.11\n\nV: 0.002\n\nBAC: 0.02\n\nRH: 0.002\n\nTRQ: 0.09\n\n\\-\n\nCrypto | Shares (or whatever you call it)\n\nBTC: 0.00054527\n\nETH: 0.003589\n\nBCH: 0.0005868\n\nLTC: 0.00863552\n\nETC: 0.000845\n\nBSV: 0.0197965\n\n\\-\n\n(I TRY NOT TO DEPEND ON CRYPTO, ONLY FOR BUYING POWER)\n\nI request some advice as to what I can invest in, with what I have. Any stock I should abandon or invest in? Any method that can help me make the most with what I have? Any \"must have\" stocks I should be aware of? I don't believe in gambling, so bets are off the table. I'd appreciate any advice I can take. My goal is to get to at least 500-1000 USD (or more) by the end of this year.\n\nThank you!",

        "body": "Some of the issues have been raised below about the key areas of ADI in these posts. The whole analogue and Power converter market is becoming a lot cheaper with other vendors like MPS, Torex, On Semi, ST, and others who play in the Power management market at lower margins than ADI (\\~25-45% vs 70-90%). On the analogue front the acquisition of Maxim will make ADI is a bit unique as they'll command many of the precision analogue components that other vendors don't make, but this market has always been quite small as its focused on industrial customers, not consumer. For consumer applications the analogue circuitry is often a custom ASIC or a highly attuned (readily available) IC for a \"specific task\" and these ICs are made by many vendors. Also Processors have become much more powerful &amp; cheaper over the last 20 years so the maths is done in software not analogue. \n\nPersonally I would invest in component tech stocks that will be riding the EV Market as it is set to grow massively over the next 20 years by focusing on those that make the Power transistors/modules that power the EV vehicle. Terms like \"SIC transistors\" or \"GaN transistors\" as designs move away from IGBT transistors for more efficiency which are only made by a small number of vendors. Every electric car, van, bus, truck will use SICs (currently IGBT in many EV vehicles) for the Power Inverter, and many will use GaN (or SIC) transistors for the Battery chargers (&amp; dc roadside chargers). Also the use of GaN for the step down Power supplies in the vehicle to create the 12/24/48V Bus from the internal Battery which is typically 400-800Vdc. The top Semi companies that make SiC and/or GaN are Microchip, Infineon, ST Microelectronics, On Semi, &amp; Cree (Wolfspeed). Infineon and ST are the top 2.",

I bought Apple stock, it didn't move that much, so I sold it. A year later, it had the 1 to 7 split. It's now a trillion dollar company.\n\n3. Bitcoins, not this week's bitcoins, I'm talking about the first big wave or bitcoins, right around when all that fraud happened and everyone and their aunt was buy ethereum or ripples.\n\n4. Whatever the fannie may thing on WSB that resulted in the term FD.\n\n5. Purple mattress\n\n6. Corsair\n\n7. Covid hit and subsequent recovery, quite a few people I know doubled or quadrupled their money just buying stocks.\n\n8. Oh, and AMD when they were worth like $4 a share. Actually, basically just the whole microchip field.\n\nThese are just a few of the examples I remember off the top of my head there are many many more. Any of these events would have turned your $5000 into 5 possibly 6 figure investments in under a year.\n\nI started investing junior year of college (so probably not much older than you), and I'm 25 right now.
