When I graduated with my undergrad degree  in biotech 10 years ago the cost to sequence a genome was 10x what it is today.. we now do it for 100x cheaper.. we also have single cell and dropnuqsec the microfluidics tech is amazing for targeted therapeutics. Take the current Pfizer bio tech vaccine and moderna tech was initiated in 2005.. it took a global cataclysmic catastrophe to bring the tech to the forefront. While this tragedy exposed weakness, it also exposed strength.. the possibilities are truly endless.. as a scientist who has struggled for funding (we all have) we\u2019re finally getting the recognition we deserve. The momentum of breakthroughs are only accelerating.. immunotherapeutics, personalized care, telemedicine, metabolic modulation.. the future is very bright.. some highlights would be companies like bluebird biotech that are correcting DMD with crispr technologies, sickle cell anemia, deafness.. there\u2019s risk of course but fortune favors the bold. I for one focus on the interplay of metabolism and it\u2019s effect on health and cardiovascular disease.. Americans aren\u2019t getting any slimmer.. we have enormous problems that we have the ability to fix.. though many admittedly so are those of poverty and societal indifference that will take bold actions from world leaders.. however disruptive tech and medicine will bring a more equitable future to humanity vs driving a wedge of inequality. I firmly agree with the Founder of social capital Chamath Paliphaltya (I think that\u2019s how it\u2019s spelled). Humanity has no choice but to understand the necessity of the coming of age of biotech. Otherwise we as a species will inevitably destroy ourselves.. that was a fun tangent.. long story short.. TL;DR risk is inevitable when you deal with disruptive innovation, however the reward is growth and transformation.",

I noticed is that your net margin is much healthier than those forecasts imply - specifically your SG&amp;A forecasts seem low to me. Across the 3 cases you\u2019re forecasting 16-17% of revenue for SG&amp;A whereas I can\u2019t find a historical quarter where GameStop has kept that figure below 20%. Is this because you believe the console sales don\u2019t require the same marketing spend (ie you\u2019re not spending much because the demand is enough to draw customers)? Or does this have something to do with a larger e-commerce mix? I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on this!",

Meaning he only gets paid for all his efforts if the stock does well. \u2022 A company going BK doesn\u2019t typically buy other companies. \u2022 TLSS has successfully dug themselves out of the financial hole they were in when John and Doug and all other new management took over. \u2022 Companies going BK don\u2019t typically have a positive EBITDA. \u2022 I just don\u2019t see a shipping logistics company going BK in the busiest shipping season the world has ever seen.\n\nNot to mention, they\u2019re working to up list to OTCQB and then before October 2021 up list to the NYSE.\n\nCougar Express is the first acquisition they\u2019ve announced... But it is not the only company they\u2019re currently working to acquire.\n\nThey are also in negotiations with a \u201chousehold name\u201d shipping company to add to their current contract with Amazon.\n\nAlso, in Amazon\u2019s most recent 8k they stated, \u201cAmazon plans to restart 3rd-party shipping services in 2021 after putting the program on hold earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d (Which doesn\u2019t specifically mean they\u2019re extending their contract with TLSS. But to me it sure does make sense that they would consider extending their contract with TLSS.)\n\nIf they get the contract with the \u201chousehold name\u201d company and they extend their contract for another few years with Amazon and they successfully up list to OTCQB, AND they successfully up list to NYSE...\n\nI can easily see this company going to a billion or multi-billion dollar company within the next 2 to 4 years. Just in the last month it\u2019s gone from a $20 million market cap to a $41.25 million market cap. Literally MORE than doubling in value... in a month...\n\nJust give it another 24 to 48 months...\n\nThis isn\u2019t a pump and dump because you can verifiably see the steps they have taken and are taking to make all that happen.\n\nI for one, believe they will do it too. Just look at what they\u2019ve accomplished in the past. These guys are brilliant businessmen and I have learned a TON just from watching them work over the last 8 months.\n\nI would absolutely love to have a meeting or lunch with this team and be able to pick their brains.\n\nWhat we are looking at right now, is a phenomenal opportunity.",

        "body": "At risk of pissing off the PSTH pumper fanboys: ***The \"tontine\" structure is a garbage fiction invented by Ackman to benefit himself.***\n\nIt has one purpose and one purpose only - to keep the price higher than the NAV (the $20/share cash money in escrow paid in by the spac IPO buyers) so that there are no redemptions that would mess up Ackman's deal.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with spacs - redemptions only happen when the price of the spac falls below the NAV price - then people will buy for the lower value and trade the shares in for the value of the money they represent in the trust.  So imagine you could buy PSTH for $19 because everyone hated it, and then trade it back to Ackman for $20 of the cash the early IPO investors put into his escrow account.  That's a redemption.\n\nIf the price stays significantly above $20 then no one redeems, they'd just sell the shares to some other trader for the market price, since that's more than they'd get by redeeming.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe tontine structure claims you'll get extra warrants if people redeem their shares, but that's a totally fictional concept because no one is going to redeem, because of the warrants attached to the stock until merger.  Here's where the Ackman magic comes in:  Normally spacs trade as \"Units\" and then they split into warrants and stock.\n\nIn a typical situation it would look something like this: 1 Unit gets split into 1 stock and 3/9 warrants - so for every 3 units you have you get 3 stock and 1 warrant - fractional warrants disappear.  Well what Ackman did is leave 1/9 warrants on the units and move 2/9 of the warrants to the stock.  So the first split only created 1/3 of the warrants that will be available.  The other 2/9 will detach from the stock during the merger with the target company.\n\nThe trick is that those 2/9 warrants now have a much higher value than they normally would because there's demand for warrants and not very many of them - supply and demand drives the warrant prices up.  So now you have $20 NAV in stock, plus $2 in fractional warrants attached to the stock.  ***There's basically no way the price can go below NAV to be redeemed, because the value of the stock with the fractional warrants attached will always be far above NAV.***\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo what's the benefit to the investor?  There isn't one.  The only benefit to \"tontine\" structure was that if people redeemed their fractional warrants would be shared among the remaining investors. But since the price can't go below NAV, no one redeems, so it's a fictional proposition.\n\nThe downside is that it sucks for both serious investors and novice investors. It sucks for the novice investors because they're saddled with 2/9 warrants that they don't understand and probably won't handle in the most profitable way. These aren't free, the novice still has to pay the extra $2/share inflated price of the commons, and there's a risk that the warrants will be worth less when they get them because there will be 3x as many on the market suddenly.\n\nIt sucks for the serious investors because the warrants are overpriced which kills the leverage benefits, and the commons force you to buy warrants you may not want in your trading strategy.  The only people it doesn't suck for are people that want the exact ratio of 9 shares and 2 warrants.  That's a weird target ratio and I doubt anyone specifically desires that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTLDR: Ackman rigged the spac for his own benefit, and it's had the unintended consequence of skyrocketing the price because of a feedback loop between warrant demand and stock price.  The money value of a share is $20, and right now you're going to pay 38% more than that if you want one (28% if you can manage to sell the warrants for $9 later on when they split at merger).\n\nIf you think that premium is worth it then invest, but know that ***you're investing in a pile of cash on the hope that Ackman finds an exciting target and someone is willing to pay you an even higher premium for your shares - shares that Ackman himself has deemed are worth $20.*** (that's the value he will negotiate with the target company, not the current stock price)",

I learned some of this stuff doing DD prior to the PLTR \\*DPO.\n\nICE actually has two completely separate divisions in what they do in terms of business function/responsibility/jackasses running it: \n\n* HSI, Homeland security investigations, they look for foreign criminals and criminal acts.\n* ERO, Enforcement and Removal Operations, they having nothing better to do than deport people who don't have citizenships.\n\nOriginally the contract was only to support HSI.  They were working on breaking up importation violations w/ CBP, Customs and Border Protection (under the DHS umbrella that ICE also exists under along w/ secret service, OIG, Coast Guard, TSA, FEMA, USCIS) and work w/ local LE to identify people in criminal rings in illegal importation of drugs, non-CARB legal Skyline GT-Rs, Silvias, AE86s, and other drift cars, gang/cartel activity including human trafficking.\n\nERO got a hard-on (erection/sexual arousal) when they found out about Palantir's capabilities and walked over to their HSI buddy cubicles and started shoulder surfing PLTR and eventually just taking over by using the platform for their own investigations.\n\nThis all began under the Obama administration.  So I mean, I get that the United States should be developing best in class stuff so we can keep up with foreign governments.  But it speaks volumes that our administration (bipartisan) would do this kind of BS.\n\nLike China has MiningLamp which is supposed to be a data analytics platform comparable to Palantir.  And now w/ the stolen F35 lightning plans, they have their own facsimile (look up the Shenyang J31).  So \"foreign adversaries\" aka \"foreign trade partners\" are on the same or similar level to us, blame foreign espionage, blame globalism, if humanity was equal in terms of tech and trade, there'd be no problem.\n\nIf we're really pissed off about the comings and goings of the United States' actions, we should dump the assholes in Congress, Senate, and Executive leadership to figure out a way that doesn't involve inciting revolution, installing shill gov'ts, and drone bombing people the opposition to keep a hold on oil.  \n\nData analysis platforms are just going to get more important as the years go by.  Data analysis has been the next gold rush for the past decade and a half with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Oracle, AdTech, Medical Research, and other companies using the data to streamline operations, manufacturing, production, research, and sales.  \n\n*Punishing Palantir for witchcraft is akin to fearing doctors because bloodletting used to be a thing.*\n\n**Palantir is going to the moon first** before everyone else cuz they were fucking *tits deep* in this stuff since 2004.  And they'll continue to be tits deep before anyone even gets balls deep.\n\nIt's like Tesla and electric vehicles.  \n\nOnly now is GM (Nikola lol), Ford (Rivian), and other manufacturers trying to get in.  But Tesla's bottom up approach, listening to consumers, is destroying all the other car manufacturers (because traditional big AF car companies do a top down approach by having marketing teams making assumptions of what consumers really care about).\n\nUltimately, we don't need to shill WSB to get people to invest, we're already doing that.  What is important is to help \"Main street\" understand the implications.  Palantir has a bipartisan pass.  AOC is raising concerns, but is doing it for clout.  If she was in a presidential position, she'd be riding the PLTR Train to the moon too.\n\nPLTR doesn't need rockets to get to the moon.  They built the fucking railroad to get there.\n\n\\--\n\n\\*because I keep calling it an IPO by accident when it was a direct listing",

Which you can then ask questions and interact with visually. Google Search, Wikipedia, Facebook, Uber: they all use a KG to some extent. The power of a KG over traditional tabular datasets (think rows and columns) is that a KG allows you to infer information from the data, which you have not made explicit for yourself. Governmental bodies have been using/developing KG's for a longer period of time, and you can see now that commercial companies see the value in it as well. Just go to Youtube and search for 'Uber Knowledge Graph'. It's relatively dry material, but the Uber vids are short and to the point.\n\nThe fact that it is dry material also explains part of the fact that fucknuggets like Jim Cramer don't understand what they do, and what the implied value is of their offering. It's like trying to explain to my parents what a webbrowser is. It's not their fault, they just don't understand.\n\nBut people don't need to truly understand. You don't know how a Ferrari is made, but you know it's a gorgeous, fast, Italian, expensive, and - above all - quality car. You don't truly understand, but the story around Ferrari explains it to you in a way. The same applies to Palantir. You see how they support in making sure the vaccination process is a success. You don't know exactly how, but you know they do. At the end of the day it's very simple: data is raw information, pieced together by context. PLTR offers the best way to distill information out of heaps of data.\n\n**TLDR**: look up 'uber knowledge graph' on Youtube to understand what a KG is. Then imagine PLTR lets you do what Uber does themselves, only in 3 weeks, with 10x the amount of data sources.",

Unlike most commodities, an increased price does not lead to increased supply, so your Econ 101 supply curve is flat.\n\nThe recent bull run has instead been driven by increased demand, with four primary factors:\n\n* Institutional demand is the biggest story. When 150+ year old insurance company MassMutual buys in with a cool $250m, you know institutional acceptance is finally happening. Institutions hold just 15% of all Bitcoin and we should expect to see that increase dramatically this year.\n* New retail exposure. New demographics of retail buyers now have crypto exposure through easy, established channels like PayPal and Cashapp.\n* Payments use case. PornHub going crypto-only is a big deal IMO. Many people globally don\u2019t have credit cards and cryptocurrency holds the promise of actually increasing the reach of ecommerce. The internet revolutionized content delivery but has always been missing the same level of revolution in payments to complete the cycle. Porn has always been an innovation leader on the Internet, and if the PornHub experiment is successful, it could open the door for others.\n* Gold replacement. Investment banks have issued statements saying their clients are shifting their gold allocation to Bitcoin. Also, a survey of Millenials found that they prefer Bitcoin to gold. As fiat currencies devalue globally, Bitcoin gains.\n\nWe are just getting started and this bull run has a long way to go. I\u2019ve been in crypto professionally since 2013 and IMO we are nowhere close to the next top.",

Based on both the All-Weather and Unconventional Success. The allocations should be close to this:\n\nhttps://lowlyinvestor.com/risk-parity-target-allocations-december-2020/\n\nThen all the remaining stocks are my play money/self managed account. Any month that that one outperforms, I shift money over to it from the risk parity account, and vice versa. Been keeping the records I have on my site only since beginning of June and am too lazy to try to backfill, but since then there's only been one month where money moved from my individual picks account back to my risk parity account. As you can see in the Risk Parity account, there's a heavy tilt away from fossil fuels (SPYX rather than the traditional SPY, as well as FAN and TAN). \n\nLots of the holdings in the individual stocks are just set and forget, unless the price gets too high then I sell. There was a LOT more Apple earlier this year, for instance - it was taking up 40% of that bucket, so I had to pare back. Microsoft has been slashed. Facebook has been sold.\n\nHigh dividend stocks like O and T, I'll continue to hold through thick and thin. Preferring low prices so long as the dividend doesn't get cut.\n\nThe latest additions are at the lower end of the capitalization scale. You'll see Upwork, RealReal, Southwest Airlines and recently, Elastic. Also a couple of meme stocks PLTR and GME, because I don't even know. \n\nYou think it odd to own so many stocks, Id find it worrysome to hold so few :) I agree with the notion of getting into ARKG. I may sell a little ARKW, and maybe even my entire FITB position to get into that. You probably have a better chance of striking it rich and hitting 7 figures, I assume I have a smaller chance of catastrophic failure.\n\nOh, and crypto. I have a little Bitcoin that I bought on both CashApp and PayPal, just because. I actually have more BTC, BCH and LTC all on a Ledger wallet. I haven't even looked at that in two years, I honestly forget how much I own. I'm trying not to look, in all honesty, as there are certainly some gains over there. \n\nMaybe I'll pull the balances and add them to my asset list next month :)",

Square is implementing behavioral economics through its card, PayPal is banking on Venmo\u2019s social network. Square is the easy and cheap medium businesses chose to use for physical transactions. PayPal is the established and expensive medium businesses have to use for online transactions.\n\nOne is building for the future, the other is cashing in on the present. The world economy is moving to crypto. Better bet on the one that\u2019s getting ahead of it.",

Totally missed AMD these past 5 years, hats off to you for getting on the train. I'm more of a NFLX guy myself but DIS does seem to be getting good traction with Mandalorian, SQ kicking myself for not listening to gut and buying at 10 but finally got off my ass and accepted defeat to grab it at $60 lol thankfully was in PYPL for basically it's entire time public and got into LSPD right after IPO also. (seems like child of PYPL/SQ) \n\nNIO is such a tough reminder personally, again hats off to you for grabbing it, I saw it in the single digits and thought to myself, china isn't gonna let pappa elon be the only one, but already had so much weighting in TSLA (still haven't sold a single share) just did other stuff with the $ instead. \n\nWhat do you mean by Scuttlebutt method?  Love the Pet sector though, had to use my PETS a while ago as source of funds but great sector to be in, TRUP also seems like it's run by a rockstar. \n\nNice :) yeah I have way too many holdings probably and they're definitely not optimized weightings wise, I kinda just approach the investments with a buy/hold forever type strategy, kills me inside when I have to sell some of a position to use as source of funds, felt so bad after selling off my COST position as source of funds this summer / fall for TWST/PLTR but it was the right thing to do. Such a quality company though, and still feel kinda bummed going there knowing I don't have a piece of it anymore, IMO it's the highest quality traditional retail name there is. Even though I'm doing the longterm stuff I've been checking way too much also haha trying to go a week without checking now, just did like 2 days and it was a nice vacation.",

Bears need to be put into hibernation until it crashes again.\n\nAs for bitcoin becoming a currency, I would not rule it out. Paypal adoption is moving in the right direction.
