A few more companies that aren't quite space pure plays in ARKQ include Raven, Honeywell, Lockheed, Ametek, Kratos, AeroVironment, and Elbit Systems. A couple stocks that come to mind that are not in any Ark ETFs (yet) include NPA, CPSH, MAXR, RTX, and (my personal favorite) SRAC soon to be MNTS. \n\nI could see 90% of these innovative companies being in ARKX with heavy weight on Trimble, Virgin Galactic, Momentus, and Iridium.",

A particular stand alone component of this equity I also like is Trimble (TRMB) which operates largely in the geospatial field with particular prominence in the engineering and environmental fields.\n\nAnd finally a buy and hold stock that I think shares will see long term returns on is Vestas Wind (VWDRY)",
