By the next day the stock had recovered and I missed my window to close thanks to my broker fucking me when I needed to sell, which seems to be disturbingly common.\n\nI remember calling them and telling them I wanted a broker, not a babysitter. The dude sounded completely annoyed like he was my dad and doing me a favor. He wasn't wrong in hindsight. I was like a chimp with a machine gun back then. I'm better now. But damn...let the monkey shoot his load if he wants.\n\nFidelity isn't a bad broker. But they're like strict parents. They're not quick to trust or forgiving if you throw a party and their risk department flags you as a retard. TD is like your friend's cool parents who don't really give a fuck.

If you are buying TSLA now you are up for a hard reckoning.\n\n\"At a time like this, when our stock is reaching new highs, it may seem as though spending carefully is not as important. This is definitely not true.\n\nWhen looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that\u2019s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl\u00e9 under a sledgehammer!\n\nMuch more important, in order to make our cars affordable, we have to get smarter about how we spend money. This a tough Game of Pennies \u2013 requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost, a factory process or simply the design, while increasing quality and capabilities. A great idea would be on that saves $5, but the vast majority are 50 cents here or 20 cents there.\n\nIn order to make the electric revolution happen we much make electric cars, stationary batteries and solar affordable to all.\n\nThanks and great working with you as always,\nElon\"",
