I mean it, this company is a complete tar-pit you dumbass fucktards.\n\nLets take inventory of what that dip-shit of a CEO, Bob Swan is sitting on. Intel's core business of semiconductor fabrication is effectively dead. Their competitor TSMC entered in risk production phase for their 5nm process in Q3 2019 [1]. They are entering 3nm risk production in 2021 [2]. Those sorry shit eating cucks at intel have stated their 7nm process maybe delayed until 2023 [3]. 2023? Are fucking serious right now Bob Swan? AND you wont bring a 10nm desktop CPU to market until Q2 2021 while it was already 4 years late?  Your last earnings call was a fucking joke bobby boy. You tried to play it off like it was all under control. So you went begging to TSMC to let you eat the cum from their sloppy anal seconds. They made fun of you bobby. They even admitted that you're not shit and they are \"rescuing\" you and they\"will not place extra effort to handle the CPU giant's orders\" [4]. You're fucking nothing. From \"CPU giant\" to this?\n\nTSM personally has each engineers cock massaged by a Taiwanese fuck-toy every morning before work. TSM has the backing of the American government [7]. Yeah, a TAIWANESE chip fab is being backed and NOT YOU. What the fuck do you offer bobby? A place so toxic to work that you can't even find a space nice enough keep Jim Keller safe [5]? Go fuck yourself. AMD is already on 7nm [4] and Lisa Su is have her raging cock injected with even more erection enhancers AS WE SPEAK YOU FUCKING PISS DRINKER.\n\nKeep buying Intel stock bobby [8]. Buy another 8,000 shares at $50. Your terrible excuse for an earnings call sent the stock all the way down to the $40s immediately loosing you money. And guess what? I bought put options at 11:46 AM today. Right before the dip. I have already broke even. I'm going to make money off of you losing money because you're a complete idiot and I know more about this business than you. It's so fucking obvious how fucked you are swanny. You might as well stop fabbing silicone wafers and fab a silicone butt for you to fuck during the next earnings call as that would be infinitely more valuable than whatever you could possible have prepared. What are you going to do, delay AGAIN? Or maybe you can get another one of your marketing goons to tell everyone on the call how great AMD is [9].\n\nBuy Intel PUTS now and gather round to watch it burn.\n\nINTL 53.5 PUT 10/23\n\nUpdate 10/23/2020 INTL -10% ME +100%:\n\nFuck all you god damn doubters and haters. I doubled my fucking principal with this put. To all of you idiots who mocked me for doing extensive research and analysis and making an aggressive call, FUCK YOU. I'm an actual expert who works in this industry and has payed close attention to this stuff.  You idiots are just some fucking asswads who don't know the first thing about this shit.  I made money while Bob Swan and you asshats lost money. I'm plotting my next move and in my next post, I'm going to come clean about Intel and what all of this was REALLY about. I have positions that I am MUCH certain about and I will show you. Follow me and I will lead you retards to tendy town.\n\nBe on the lookout for my next post.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://www.extremetech.com/computing/289157-tsmc-completes-5nm-node-design-node-in-risk-production\n[2] https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/19/tsmc-3nm-risk-production-in-2021-paves-the-way-to-2020-mass-production\n[3] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-first-10nm-desktop-cpus-land-in-second-half-of-2021\n[4] https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-tsmc-not-long-term/\n[5] https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately\n[6] https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2020/07/intels-chief-engineer-out-amid-manufacturing-crisis.html\n[7] https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/09/taiwan-semiconductor-secures-government-aid-for-us.aspx\n[8] https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hznvk1/intel_ceo_bob_swan_just_bought_8000_shares_at/\n[9] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFHBgb9SY1Y&amp;ab_channel=GamersNexus",

Thank you for the margin advice. I should of added to my post that I was using 100% of my available margin for these options. Had I not been using margin the loss would have been much much smaller.

These all have a max loss of 50-100, which allows for you to manage your risk better. **I use MACD and RSI indicators on 1hr to pick my direction(put vs call) You can use trading view for free for this.** I also take profit/cut losses quickly to protect my basis. Do not be afraid to just take 10-15$ of premium : consistent money is better than losing all your money like an ape. I am not sure how much of this you already know, but I hope it helps!",
