But that's not going to help you since they are not tax consultants. \n\nWhat you really want is a tax accountant to talk with. You can always start with one of the big retail tax preparation services like H&amp;R Block or Intuit TurboTax.  They have articles for expats online and you can talk with a tax preparer. \n\nBTW - you may want to check out the expat subreddits like r/expat . There is also r/USExpatTaxes \n\nLastly - the IRS actually has a free help line for international that you can just call if you have tax questions - [https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-my-local-office-internationally](https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-my-local-office-internationally) \\- there are other numbers on the IRS web site that you can check out if you have a different set of questions.",

They're obviously pretty single-quarter focused with tax season, but I'm guessing this quarter will look pretty good due to COVID deadline extensions.\n\nMy theory on this company: investing is more accessible now which means that a bunch of dipshits now have to pay for upgraded Turbotax so they can claim losses, and they're probably more likely to fall for grifts like audit protection.\n\nBeyond that, they paid off a bunch of debt last quarter and bought back a few hundred million worth of shares. COVID doesn't affect this business. They will continue to print money. The only risk they face is pre-filled tax forms/simplification and this admin has shown no inclination that that's on the agenda.",
