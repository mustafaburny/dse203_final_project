Europe is still (mostly) sluggish on inflation, so they\u2019ll wait until late 2022, but fed\u2019s decision might halt enthusiasm in Europe as well.\n\nI\u2019m staying in the market, I bought more bonds in March, now I\u2019m buying long term winners (tech/retail/banking/manufacturing/green energy) &amp; SPY when nothing is really interesting. \n\nWhat I found out is that all assets are basically dragging behind inflation (makes sense - margins get cut, prices always stay behind, bonds are lower then inflation too, same goes for real estate). To find good bets we should think in terms of what people will cut back on. Entertainment is first to go (Netflix lost subscribers, Disney will have a hard time growing subscriptions) value based retail should stay in business (I bought in Costco). \nI\u2019m going more into B2B based business with great tech that saves money/optimizes processes (Intuit is great).

Smart people making policy decisions and being the ones to direct 40% of the resources in society would lead to MORE resources for all. Smart people would have a higher percentage of wealth and at a higher rate of acquisition, but also, there would be more resources for everyone else, AND there would be more resources in total. \n\nYes, we live in a world of cause and effect. Society is an illusion of contractual obligations but the fundamental force is violence. Ever action is just a probabilistic equilibrium of various forces.  \n\nWhy would anyone give up any control? What interest is there in abandoning power? \n\nThose who abandon power will probabilistically at some point let go of too much and cease to have power. This you disappear. The only ones who are left, are those tho don\u2019t let go. Once you have power, you do everything to keep and maintain and generate more. (Even if you happen to be a mentally ill stupid parasite) why? Because the challenge to your power could be an illusion that the environment is more intelligent than you are, and that challenge might be not true, and just an illusion. Probabilistically, it\u2019s best to avoid loss of power. That\u2019s how you keep the power. \n\nI see what you mean. It\u2019s all game theory (rational choice theory) \n\nIt\u2019s all about cost-benefit analysis for option determination and application of mathematical analysis for strategic interaction in a competitive environments. \n\nwith competitive situations where the outcome of a participant's choice of action depends critically on the actions of other participants. \n\nBut no. I would not do the same. Eternal intelligence must be equated with eternal power.  That is the equilibrium. Everything else is just worthy of sacrifice. \n\nEventually, a bad decision will cause a loss of power. And these bad decisions are more likely with a lack of intelligence. But with eternal intelligence in a place of power (control over environment), these events are infinitely less likely than before. \n\nMental illness and power being together is an inefficiency in the system. And any friction or resistance to intelligence carries eternal harm. Of course this goes into ontology and epistemology. (Study of being and study of knowledge) \n\nBasically, people are localized (since a persons awareness and thoughts aren\u2019t everywhere at once) - I.e. disabling one persons neurons doesn\u2019t effect another ones consciousness. \n\nEssentially we are discussing Individualized, Localized, Sentient, sapient, conscious, autonomous(self-ruled) units. These units impart changes into the environment, or vice versa. \n\nAre all units the same? \n\nI would say no. Fundamentally, conscious choices define a \u201cconsciousness\u201d and not all choices are capable of being made by every consciousness. \n\nAnd taking this into account, some \u201cconsciousness\u201d will contribute tonight the inefficiency or a system more than other consciousness. \n\nAnd because of that, this warrants any applied judgement as valid, since a judgement is simply a recognition of an in efficiency that should not be there and only contributes to eternal harm. \n\nConsciousness tries to avoid eternal suffering, harm, and death. And there are conscious forces out there  that are eternally more aligned with inefficiencies. \n\nSo while rationally it might not be wise to ever \u201clet go\u201d of power and control over an environment, such actions so reveal the alignment to fundamental inefficiency. And such inefficiencies carry an eternal cost to existence. A cost that some existence would rather not pay. And thus, the legitimacy of a judgement is created.",

I think the human species needs to collectively invest in things that improve the world, not the contrary. To discern what improves the world is no small feat, and this substantially limits diversity in my portfolio, but I think it is worthwhile.\n\nThe most difficult aspect in making a utilitarian moral calculation is wrapping one's head around Game Theory, making an informed decision, and sticking with it despite potentially tremendous pressure to yield. This also means understanding Kant's Categorical Imperative:\n\n&gt;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\n\nOnce that's understood, the question is much more simple. Which maxims, when applied universally, will probably produce the most good? To answer that, I research ecology, biology, and anthropology for a sense of what has occurred, then I study contemporary issues (from macro to micro) in order to infer what is presently erroneous/detrimental, what functions, what is likely, and what is ideal.\n\nAt this point, I avoid doing anything within reason that (in my approximation) produces too many detrimental latent dysfunctions in exchange for (what amounts to) a meager reward. If the disparity between what's intended to benefit the world -- \"the world,\" defined as an ideal abstraction, an apparatus which best secures the fate of healthy organisms through the organic virtues of diversity, abundance, and equilibrium -- and what inadvertently causes the world harm is irreconcilable, I avoid the (in)activity.\n\nTL;DR\nYes, I avoid certain stocks on strictly moral grounds.",

Most trading is done by machines and is basically not emotional. \n\nBig capital moves the market and a large portion of that capital is other peoples money and can also be highly leveraged (margin, etc.).\n\nSo the funds with other peoples money claim risk levels to their investors that they tolerate and are obligated to maintain, or they have high leverage that creates more risk on bigger moves. So when risk gets created, they are compelled to sell off to de-risk even if the price they are selling is undervalued or low. \n\nThis creates abnormally large dips in prices in the short term since a lot of money is adjusting at the same time.

A few weeks ago I listened to Episode 382 of The Investor\u2019s Podcast - We Study Billionaires (skip to 20min) where Marin breaks down the macro outlook and I\u2019ve been bullish on carbon credits since. I subscribed to his newsletter and he\u2019s been teasing a $10mill investment for awhile. I had my suspicions it was this company but you\u2019ve confirmed my hunch with his 10% stake of the $100mill offering. Im sure r/carboncredits would appreciate this analysis as well! I\u2019d cross post but you deserve the all important Reddit karma haha.",

It's a person calling out a dam burst and there's no way you can time it or convince enough people in time to prevent it from happening. I myself believe in the things you say and have been expecting a crash for a long time now. None of these highs make sense or look sustainable in the long run. I am greatly concerned that the people do not understand that each subsequent crisis or string of bubbles is adding more dimensions to the unpredictable nature of the problem.

Folks, I know you don't want to plow through the SEC filings and nit pick them. But you really have to. Zy had already been borrowing massively from the dubious Perspective Credit Holdings II, **second line** in their s-1. When a company tells you it is in trouble, believe them. They RUSHED to IPO, with no revenue in Covid, because they were going to have to fork over everything to their creditors unless they had a big cash raise. They had a 100 million credit facility on December 31, 2020. They had liens on substantially all their assets when they IPO'd. Perceptive Credit Holdings will own every patent of ZY within days, now. Read your SEC docs, folks. Rely on teams with great lawyers and auditors that provide us with well crafted SEC filings in a timely manner. Edit: I mean it could still be salvageable because they raised about 548Mil in the IPO to service their debt, but the evidence was in the s-1s. And the analysts have only downgraded to hold, left them with a $12 instead of a $54. lol. who knows. My point is related to the SPAC vehicle and the SEC filings. Follow your teams and follow the quality, and please don't compare ZY to $DNA, they really do not match.",

I know very little about them.\n\nCHPT - Chargepoint - Their business model relies on the sales of cloud services to partners that provide colorful reports on charger utilization. The partner provides the power and in many cases the maintenance as well. Each charger nets them at least $300/year in revenue, with more if the customer buys a maintenance plan.\n\nEVGo - EVGo builds the infrastructure and pays for the power, and profits based upon how they bill customers. Their primary revenue source is customers using the network. Their prices are a bit high, but they are working on getting really valuable locations.  \n\n\nBLINK - They revenue share with the site hosting the charger and are mostly installing low-reliability chargers at usage prices that make gas look dirt cheap. Without a major change in their business model, I don't see this going far, but the upside is that low information site hosts (often in the hospitality industry) find them appealing.\n\nVOLTA - Advertising based free charging. The way I see it, these guys have figured out a way to buy billboard space in high traffic areas for &lt;$100/month in operational costs. Its a really clever business model. Not sure how sustainable it is, but maybe?\n\nElectrify America &amp; Tesla Superchargers - Automaker subsidiaries, so not independently traded. Probably closest business model-wise to EVGo, though with slightly different pricing strategies.\n\nI've probably left out some other charge equipment manufacturers, but I can't think of them right now.",

        "body": "Yep, at the end of the day: all investments are return mechanisms.\n\nYou lay out money today (principal) to get a return over time.\n\nTherefore, when the 10 year is at 1.2%, it doesn't even make sense to invest in bonds so people have been heavily investing in equities because the current S&amp;P earnings yield is around 3.3% (The S&amp;P PE ratio OP provided does not include Q2 earnings which means the real S&amp;P PE right now I think is between 29-30)\n\nA return of 3.3% with the ability to reinvest itself compared to 1.2% which is stagnant... not a hard decision to make there.\n\nThis is incredibly simplifying things but this is the general view that Buffett and Munger hold with investing. It's all about opportunity cost, and the benchmark they largely compare investments to (and discount future cash flows with) is the risk-free rate of return, which is the 10-year note.\n\n**EDIT:** The kicker of this highly unusual market is that many investors, like Buffett, seek 10% returns. If you see above, the TTM earnings of the S&amp;P is far from 10%, even with expected growth priced into the equation. BUT by pure investing standards, when the S&amp;P TTM earnings yield is over double the return of the 10-year yield... equities are without question the smarter investment. BUT (x2) is a 3.3% yield today (probably 4.5% by January 2022) a return you want to lock yourself in for the long term?.. BUT! (x3) Sitting in cash, or even government bonds, you're guaranteed to lose money with inflation..\n\nTLDR: The market is both objectively cheap and historically expensive. Some people call it a \"logical bubble\". Only time will tell what will happen, but remember the job of the investor is to not get sidetracked by macro factors and instead continue to assess the earning power of companies for the long term.",
