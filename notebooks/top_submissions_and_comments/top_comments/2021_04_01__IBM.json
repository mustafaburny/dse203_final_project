        "body": "Translated to English:\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR ) offers data analysis software to clients. Founded in 2013, the company works with government agencies to collect and analyze data in order to make decisions. His clients include the CIA and the FBI. The PLTR share got off to a great start this year as its software was adopted by commercial customers.\n\nOver the past few years, companies have understood the importance of data and it is changing the way business is done. PLTR stock has recently shown volatility. It peaked at $ 45 in January and is currently trading at around $ 23.\n\nDespite the decline, the title seems attractive to me. It's a long-term buy with long-term growth prospects.\n\nGiven the demand for data analysis in the country, the recent drop is a great opportunity to add the stock to your portfolio. Here's why PLTR stock needs to be on your radar.\n\nPalantir has a huge market\nWith a market cap of $ 32 billion, PLTR stock may appear overvalued. The company has not reported a profit over the years, but there is a huge opportunity for growth that justifies the valuation. Palantir's business is very relevant today as business companies have realized the importance of data.\n\nThe company is making great strides in the market and has signed several contracts in recent months. The company recently signed contracts with IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS. It only gained part of the market share, which means that there is huge potential for growth.\n\nPalantir reported over $ 1 billion in revenue for 2020 and fourth quarter revenue was $ 332.1 million, up from $ 229.36 million a year ago . Having signed 21 deals worth over $ 5 million, Palantir holds a strong position in the industry. The demand for data only increases from here and the company has the right software to meet the needs. The company plans to reach $ 4 billion in revenue by 2024 with a growth rate of 30%.\n\nStrong fundamentals coupled with growth opportunities make PLTR stocks a great buy right now.\n\nGovernment clients mean stability\nPalantir has had a lot of backlash for focusing on government contracts, but what's wrong? The company is well positioned in the industry as a provider of data analysis services for some of the major government agencies. The government sector generated 85% of total revenues in Q4 2020, or $ 132 million.\n\nThe government's demands will only increase in the years to come. Palantir is already working with NHS, the UK's public healthcare network, and there is no doubt that he will soon be an integral part of the US government. Recently, on April 22, the company was appointed as the UK Crown Business Services Provider.\n\nGovernment contracts are synonymous with stability and constant income.\n\nThe Bottom Line on PLTR Stock Cathie Wood's ARK Investir recently bought 1.1 million shares of PLTR. This is not the first time that the investment firm has bought PLTR shares.\n\nThe recent volatility of PLTR stocks offers a perfect opportunity for investors looking to add it to their portfolio. A huge amount of data needs to be stored and analyzed, and the demand for Palantir's software will only increase. With one foot in the government sector and the other in the commercial sector, Palantir Technologies is well positioned to conquer the market. He has a huge growth track for the next two years.\n\nI have been optimistic about Palantir in the past and reiterate my optimistic position today. The company reports its first quarter 2021 results on May 18.\n\nPLTR stock is a long term buy and hold.\n\nAt the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (neither directly nor indirectly) any position in the securities mentioned in this article.",

I\u2019d rather have a growing company. Their earnings have also been on a downward trend over the last few years so you can only get so much dividend out of that. \n\nIn tech IBM cloud is a joke. They will not be able to compete long term against the hyperscale CSPs. I think that\u2019s why Krishna is spinning off their infra business. I do think they have a future as a custom solutions provider that uses cloud.\n\nQuantum is a long ways off, I\u2019m pretty biased but I also don\u2019t see IBM a winner in this category because - riddle me this, what was the last technology IBM grabbed by the horns and took a leading position in? It was mainframes under Lou Gerstner nearly 30 years ago. No way their more agile competitors are going to let quantum go to IBM. Just look at how they did with Watson.\n\nAnyways, I personally don\u2019t touch IBM and that is probably my internal biases working against me because I\u2019m in tech. However, I genuinely have been impressed by Krishna so far. If you buy them it is a bet on him to turn the ship.

Keep that in mind.\n\nOn a fundamental level, MSFT has some headwind. The shift to cloud applications is actually not good for MSFT which thrives on enterprise computing and windows software. A cloud based setup is a lot like the old mainframe and dummy terminal approach of old days and in this case, the mainframe is worldwide access. This inherently means that you can do without Windows Servers in a lot of use cases. What used to be a staple (domain controller + active directory etc) is no longer required and as applications move to the internet.\n\nInternet servers and services (cloud) are easier and cheaper to manage. This is the main threat to MSFT. I know plenty of companies that simply use Google applications instead of rolling out Office. I know some companies who no longer bother providing a PC for everyone. That was unheard of not that long ago. Though I dont think thats a major threat due to office's legacy dominance, it is an example of how a cloud based app can replace MSFT software. There used to be a time when Outlook was a staple, now I am not even sure who uses it any more.\n\nYes MSFT itself is a cloud player, but Google and Amazon ate a ton of market share and other companies are trying to muscle in especially overseas where they have sentiment from their governments.\n\nAll in all, I like MSFT. I think they will be fine and I am sure they will keep buying stuff to stay relevant. But its not all roses and they made bad decisions in the past and are almost always a little behind the pack on innovations (though not as bad as IBM or Oracle). Beware of sector valuations.",

The CSPs hate them just because they overcharge for their proprietary networking gear (back end, not talking like office equipment) and have patents up to wazoo on them. I won\u2019t touch them either but am outside of my expertise when speaking about their consumer products. They\u2019re similar to Oracle in that a lot of the industry hates using them but they\u2019re just really hard to move away from. A lot of networking has gone open source in an effort to get away from Cisco though this has had mixed results. Again though, I only know one aspect of their business relatively well so can\u2019t comment on everything but it is enough that I won\u2019t buy this stock. They\u2019re also on the Acquirers Multiple as like the number two or three holding so great value.",

They did fall asleep at the steering wheel letting AMD and Apple get a good jump but they have a massive war chest, a new CEO and are probably R&amp;D'ing like crazy atm. With the vertical integration of design+fab and massive undervaluation in terms of tech companies (P/E of barely 11-12) it's an absolute bargain. The risk is that they become the next IBM but I find that highly unlikely.\n\nCurrently 2% of my portfolio but I've been adding in all these dips and my target is 8-10% of my portfolio for a 5-10 year hold.
