They mainly did govt contracts but are now shifting and opening up to the private sector. They are helping BP find oil in the ocean, they are helping IBM and other companies become more profitable, finding what solutions work best and updating their intelligence constantly. The simplest way to understand it is this... lets say your company makes 100m a year, pltr can help you make 150m a year with minor adjustments, and you pay pltr 10m yearly fee for that service. You cannot increase to 150m a year easily on your own, so you win 40m just by hiring them, of course you want to use them. They streamline and make businesses more profitable.

        "body": "In 2020, I collected dividends from the following holdings that I have since liquidated this year: ARR, DOW, EPD, GEO, GIS, IBM, IRM, JPM, MMP, PM, SKT, STX, T, TNL, VZ, VER, XOM.\n\nIn 2020, I collected dividends from the following holdings that I continue to hold: EPR, MO, SMHB.\n\nSo why did I sell some of the best dividend stocks the market has to offer after literally buying them in March/April of 2020 at the bottom?  Great question.  Maybe the better question is why did I keep those 3?  \n\nThe answer is because I still see great share price growth value ahead of both EPR and MO though for different reasons and the SMHB yield (based on pre covid historicals) could yield as high as 72% based on my purchase price.  Though I only collected 10.14% in 2020 and 6.82% so far in 2021.  EPR has yet to reinstate its dividend and I fully expect that when they do, their share price will see a large upward move.  And MO?  Well... it is my opinion that Altria is uniquely positioned to be the largest player in the budding legalized marijuana industry in the USA.  So obviously I will hold that until such a time when that new industry can be realized and profited from and pocket a 9.54% yield (2020 actual) in the meantime.\n\nBut the reality is, I didn't buy some of the best dividend paying companies at the 2020 bottom because I wanted the dividend.  In fact... dividend investing is mostly a waste of time unless you plan on buying and forgetting... in which case... it still is since you'd be better off in an index fund.",

Take that as you will.\n\nThere is nothing stopping Intel and AMD from producing ARM chips except for themselves. They already have the licenses and will begin developing when ARM is past its infancy in the data center world. Let deeper pockets be the pioneers, let all the software transitions happen (x86 software is not compatible with ARM), then poach their engineers. Intel and AMD are sitting back and letting AWS and Apple try their hand at ARM on purpose.\n\nIBM thrived on providing services that were being phased out. x86 isn't going to be phased out this decade and Intel will begin ARM chip production for clients in 3 years. IBM is dying, Intel is 3 years away from the start of unrivaled growth and has potential to eventually surpass TSMC as the industry leader in chip production thanks to the gov/mil backing within 20 years.\n\nIf you're looking for big gains in the next 2-6 years Intel is probably not the stock for you. It's at a 13 P/E ratio because people perceive it like IBM which is fine with me, I'll keep adding.\n\nNo clue what TSMC will plan to do after 3nm to prevent stagnation. For now they are the leader but physics doesn't let you go smaller than 3nm, possibly 2nm. At 3 times less earnings per dollar than Intel and lacking vertical integration...

Great question.  Maybe the better question is why did I keep those 3?  \n\nThe answer is because I still see great share price growth value ahead of both EPR and MO though for different reasons and the SMHB yield (based on pre covid historicals) could yield as high as 72% based on my purchase price.  Though I only collected 10.14% in 2020 and 6.82% so far in 2021.  EPR has yet to reinstate its dividend and I fully expect that when they do, their share price will see a large upward move.  And MO?  Well... it is my opinion that Altria is uniquely positioned to be the largest player in the budding legalized marijuana industry in the USA.  So obviously I will hold that until such a time when that new industry can be realized and profited from and pocket a 9.54% yield (2020 actual) in the meantime.\n\nBut the reality is, I didn't buy some of the best dividend paying companies at the 2020 bottom because I wanted the dividend.

Take that as you will.\n\nThere is nothing stopping Intel and AMD from producing ARM chips except for themselves. They already have the licenses and will begin developing when ARM is past its infancy in the data center world. Let deeper pockets be the pioneers, let all the software transitions happen (x86 software is not compatible with ARM), then poach their engineers. Intel and AMD are sitting back and letting AWS and Apple try their hand at ARM on purpose.\n\nIBM thrived on providing services that were being phased out. x86 isn't going to be phased out this decade and Intel will begin ARM chip production for clients in 3 years. IBM is dying, Intel is 3 years away from the start of unrivaled growth and has potential to eventually surpass TSMC as the industry leader in chip production thanks to the gov/mil backing within 20 years.\n\nIf you're looking for big gains in the next 2-6 years Intel is probably not the stock for you. It's at a 13 P/E ratio because people perceive it like IBM which is fine with me, I'll keep adding.\n\nNo clue what TSMC will plan to do after 3nm to prevent stagnation. For now they are the leader but physics doesn't let you go smaller than 3nm, possibly 2nm. At 3 times less earnings per dollar than Intel and lacking vertical integration... I'll happily put my dollars to work in Intel.",

Or is there actually something wrong with citing information?  \n\n\nAnd Intel has GPUs.   They sell more than anyone else.  Their integrated GPUs are a giant portion of the market, so their transition to making discrete GPUs should not be crazy.  They also have their own supply of chips that isn't nearly as affected by the shortage as AMD and Nvidia, so they stand to capture as big a piece of the GPU market share as they are able to produce.  I'm betting they are able to release before 2022, it's understandable if you are more skeptical though.  \n\n\nEven without the addition of discrete GPUs, due to the extreme shortage+demand at the moment, people are actively seeking out CPUs with integrated graphics in order to have working systems until supply for discrete GPUs is finally met.  AMD's integrated graphics options in the desktop market are not nearly as desirable - the SKUs are too low end for gamers or power users to use it as a viable upgrade path (buying a 3400g to hold you over until you can find a 3070 or 6700xt creates a CPU bottleneck, buying nearly any intel CPU with an iGPU avoids that scenario by being a way better CPU than the current AMD offerings)  \n\n\nIn any event, go ahead and hate on Intel if you want.  Analysts were already wrong once about their earnings, it won't be the first time.  Eventually the market will figure it out.",

So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

        "body": "&gt;In the US markets, it's a penny stock: 6 months ago it was trading at $4.81\n\nBy that logic, GME is a penny stock too. The strikes are disjoint but the vol trades reasonably tight, and there's enough volume to hedge a moderately sized position if you need to.\n\nAs you mention, Intel has been in the foundry business before; Intel Custom Foundry was the entryway for the Altera acquisition. Not really a failure in that sense, although it's telling that they dropped ICF around when their roadmap and yield woes began to arise. I don't think that's where people will be looking in order to judge Intel short term, but I agree it's a big deal for custom datacenter applications. What matters most IMO, short term (1-3y), is the 7nm roadmap, as well as a swift commitment to capex. If Intel sends the right signals that they're executing on those two factors, the rest of the bricks will fall into place. AMD already started to lose a bit of market share in the past quarter, and the messaging around 10nm yield has gotten better. I guess it's obviously better because the 10nm chips are widely available. And I believe that Rocket Lake is a brilliant move because it keeps LGA1200 engaged and 14nm humming along.\n\nAlso, if you look at it from a valuation perspective, rotation to INTC makes sense. Personally I believe IDM is the ideal strategy for a supply-constrained market because you become less reliant on predictions and your lead times can get shorter when needed.\n\nIntel Foundry isn't immediately gonna be a game-changing player for most of these automotive chips. AKM is a big supplier and they had a big factory fire. They offloaded some production to Renesas, which also had a relatively sizable factory fire more recently.",

If you check their earnings transcripts you can see that they talk about their deliveries as well as their inventory.\n\n&gt;For that reason, I believe that we're going to start seeing this revenue certainly inside 2021. At least, the execs at companies like AMAT seem to agree, and the market seems to be anticipating the PEG.\n\nYou're probably right about the latter part and perhaps wrong about the former part. AMAT isn't going to book profits in 2021 for the new capex outlay that was announced in the past couple of weeks from TSMC and Intel and the others. It would be accounting fraud. Even a nontrivial expansion of an existing fab will take 2-3y minimum. But the market is certainly anticipating the forward earnings. I am long-term bullish AMAT and the others, have been for a while, but AMAT is trading at a 33 P/E and INTC is trading at a 12.5 P/E. Assuming their earnings are correlated (which they ought to be if you normalize for lead/lag), I'd rather play the cheaper valuation with far cheaper IV.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I so desperately want to be involved in the capex names but the entry point right now is mediocre. My thinking is that if they rip, they will carry the rest of the fab side of the sector with them. So I prefer the insanely cheap upside skew of INTC because it will rip if it can break through the psychological barrier that 65 represents for the spot price. My play is to wait for everything to get crushed in a correlation event later this summer and then scoop them up. The stars will have to align but I think they just might.",

I followed TSLA since they migrated from Mobil Eye (and subsequent purchase by INTC) into creating their own solution.  This is the difference between AP1, AP2 and ultimately the options going into AP3 with users claiming better (smoother) performance from AP1 for months after AP2 was rolled out.  Anyhow, the NVDA and subsequent their own chips also play a role in terms of growing pains.  \n\nI am long on TSLA with a bit over $165,000 invested.  Current price is an interesting proposition but I have no active orders.",

It takes some of the benefits from ARM-like designs, and some from Intel-like designs.\n\nThere's reasons that Apple has done this while others haven't. First, they have the most to gain from this. They have two enormous lines of consumer hardware which will benefit from this investment. Second, Apple has more cash in their coffers than fucking everyone else, so the expense doesn't impact them materially. \n\nSamsung already has their own mobile chipset, and they don't have a significant product line in laptop/desktop world. They have no interest in making an M1 competitor. Huawei is in the same position. Fujitsu? Lol.\n\nThe M-series is an enormous win for Apple and no one is going to contest it for a long time unless Intel decides they want to do anything other than coast on their market share anytime soon.\n\nApple has so much cash that if TSMC doesn't handle the M-series fabrication in a satisfactory way, then Apple will just buy their own fabs and control their entire supply chain instead.",

In other words the un verified unsecured currencies died a decade plus ago from not being hack proof.\n\nThe currencies are currently competing with each other the same way the Yen, Euro, US dollar and more are competing with each other. They all have their own supply and demand and the more credible companies hop on, the more credible it will get.(compared to currencies being manipulated by stimulus packages, interest rates and buying other currencies). \n\n\nIt IS being regulated and audited. The mid February crash happened because some firm falsely stated that they found a double transaction. It was later backtracked but the damage was done. \n\nThe values is linked to how hard it is to mine 1 coin at this point. You could mine a coin with an idle computer so at the time it was chump change, now it takes high powered hardware, a heavy electricity bill and a ton of cooling to get one so the price goes along with it + how it can only get harder to have one. \n\nYour coins are as secure as you make it. There are crypted USB keys  to keep your wallet safe but like everything, the more valuable it is, the more someone will have the patience to get it.\n\nThe future is in that it cuts currency exchange fees(the banks) and rates(the government) and financial institutions from host to client. You get a coin, you trade parts of it the way you want internationally or confidentially with no brick and mortar fees. \n\nThe GME saga showed big banks can and will interfere to make money over the well being of free market.\n\nBitcoin might not be the end all solution but something can be said about the infrastructure behind it where no \"package\"(hash) can be hacked since the time and date , the number of characters, sender and receivers , and so much of the the data that makes the hash can be used to encrypt it thus can't be \"reinserted\" in the blockchain.",
