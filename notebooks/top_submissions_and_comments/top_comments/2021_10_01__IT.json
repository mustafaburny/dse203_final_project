Not to mention chips for automobiles have to be tested anywhere in the range from a month to 3 months after the very long time it takes to grow the chips.\n\nThey dug their own losses - and with that, tens of thousands of people will lose their jobs because of it",

At dinner, her Aunt would give the kids a candy but not her type of stuff all the time.\n\nMy wife worked her ass off going to school 6 out of 7 days a week for 12 hours. She got scholarships to go to University in Canada and the US, she got a free ride to a PHD program.\n\nHer parents worked hard, saved almost every penny. Her parents got a free condo for growing up on the land the Chinese government is building on and they have 2 more condos, one they live in and one they rent. \n\nI get why Chinese people are stereotyped to be cheap and I believe it's a lot of what you said. They worked so hard for their money so they protect it by any means necessary. \n\nOn the other side of the coin tho, my wife did not go to a real university party until she met me at 24. She basically had no fun and her life was completely centered around work until than. I did the completely opposite, partied all the time and in the end we both make the same salary.

        "author": "Away_Expression_1852",
        "body": "Let's say that you are absolutely correct and do a little theoretical even-handed math.\n\nSo for October 8th I went and looked at the 138 put for AAPL. The current price is 142.58. So the shift would be -$4 in a week. That's not unheard of for AAPL. That's delta .20 and that is selling for about 65. The put that is about 80 is the 139 put for AAPL and is delta .24. Okay.\n\nSo let's look at what this really means. You are willing to collect $80 to risk paying $13,900 as of this writing. As the price goes up (which you hope it does) that amount you're willing to risk rises but your premium, that $80, doesn't. Okay.\n\nSo here's the rub. If you are willing to sell these puts that means that you don't think the price will fall but if that's the case why not just the calls for the risk that you're putting up? Remember that you're making $80(26) for a risk of $13,900 at this time so that means that conversely you should be rationally willing to put *up to* $13,900 on the line in long options to profit $2,080 in one year.\n\nBut let's really dig into what these two bets would be rationally. Because you are doing this over the course of a year you have something on your side with the *calls* rather than the puts which is time. You can buy a 9/15/23 $140C  for approx. 2.4k so up to 5 about one year out from today with a target return on these slightly ITM calls of 17.3%. I am no wizard but I can promise you that if you did that, risking only \\~$12,000, you would make that money. That's a safe bet in my opinion. That's just one good day and boom, you made your money. But the thing I want you to pay attention to here is the number of trades you have to put on here: 1. One trade. One profit target. Set your limit and walk away. Nothing to manage.\n\nIn your other strategy you have to put on 26 trades. That's 26 chances for things to go against you and cost you however much in the case that you are wrong. Certainly you can close early and such and may be able to skirt death all year long but you're not guaranteed the $80 tag for the .2 delta and you certainly aren't guaranteed that you won't get assigned which will, at the moment, cost you $13,900.00. But there's something that you have to keep notice of; delta is not a \"number\", it is a concept, and it is anything but steady. Your .2 delta today could be .5 tomorrow and that's the problem in my opinion. You didn't detail to me an exit point for when things are going sour and it doesn't like you really thought that through. In fact I would pose that you did the opposite; you decided that the market would cooperate with you (exactly how you die in this game) and detailed not really a \"plan\" so much as a \"dream\". You told me your dream. You did not tell me a plan. You dream of getting $80 biweekly from selling these puts but there's no reason to believe that's anywhere near realistic because you're ignoring things like events throughout the year. What will you do during earnings? Or AAPL day for instance? Their expos? Releases of products? Disappoints and losses of landmark cases?\n\nI didn't type all of this to put you down. I typed it all because you need to really think about this at this depth (at least); you're not really \"thinking\" about it, you're suggesting it, kind of poking around with the bear, but not even aware that it's a bear. You act like it's a fluffy sheep. I recommend that you *think* about it. Do not take this as an attack. Do not mistake this as chiding. You will do what you want to do but please, *please* try to unplug yourself for a moment from your emotions and \"ownership of the idea\" and pretend it's your worst enemy asking you for advice. If you would say, \"Yeah, do that.\" it's a bad idea.\n\nAlways, *always* think of the inverse of your own ideas. If you're willing to put on 26 trades for a 17% profit over the course of a year why would you *not* be willing to put on 1 trade for a 17% profit, the same 17% profit, over the course of the *same* year?",

        "body": "I tend to disagree with the hyperinflation narrative. If you look at currencies that fail throughout history, it ultimately is due to loss of confidence in the structural integrity of the economy that begins the cycle. Usually the political and socioeconomic backdrop is incredibly compromised (Venezuala, Zimbabwe, Weimar) or is recovering from extensive printing to finance war debts (also Weimar, greyback/greenback, continentals). The CERB, CEBA, CEWA payments were to prevent mass unemployment, homelessness, basically general economic collapse. It wasn't enriching people or business, it was helping them keep their heads above water. \n\nIn my humble opinion, people are also giving way to much attention to the relationship between QE and inflation, of which there isn't much evidence. Keep in mind, all the money is ending up in the banking system, not the consumers pocket. The general result of this is asset inflation (higher stock prices, lower short and long term bond yields, higher leverage leading to higher real estate prices). The average Canadian/American doesn't have much access to this liquidity unless they take out a loan, but that is usually used to finance a home or vehicle purchase (both areas that are absolutely inflated).\n\nI think there are major deflationary backdrops in the global economy that have given developed nations the luxury of being able to print the hell out of their currencies without consequence. This won't go on forever, and we will return to more normal interest and growth rates, and a general market crash or recession can pull liquidity out of the markets too. I'm honestly not all that concerned about hyperinflation. High inflation over the short term? Perhaps, but not collapse of the USD. \n\nIn regards to the BTC argument, I will say this: there is absolutely no correlation between BTC and inflation. Literally almost 0. The highest correlation BTC has with another financial asset? The S&amp;P 500. It is a high risk speculative asset, not a store of value or financial safehaven. Please don't treat it that way, as you are likely to lose a lot of money on paper if/when markets correct. The number one pumpers of BTC that are feeding these false narratives have no financial or economic education other than googling \"what is M2\" and now they are apprently experts, and they also have the vast majority of their net worth in BTC...so obviously they are going to say whatever they can to get the asset to go up in value. Major conflict of interest, and if they were publically pumping the price of a stock this way, the SEC would have them in prison instantly and banned from financial markets for life. My honest to God advice is block Michael Saylor (proven conman and fraud), Dan Held, Pomp, and anyone else who constantly pumps BTC's tires and refuses to listen to any counter arguments from experts in the field. It screams narcissism and cultish behavior, and people are all too eager to listen because they think BTC=\"freedom\" (it doesn't) or the whole world becoming wealthy (it won't). Tread very carefully in this space, it is far from a guarantee. Disclaimer: I also dislike Peter Schiff, so hopefully that appeases some of you \ud83d\ude02. \n\nGood luck investing my friends :)",

If anything having the threshold there encourages people to overextend themselves to qualify.

        "body": "Firm's market cap climbing to $1 trillion\n\nOne trillion dollars.  \nThat's how much at least one analyst believes Cisco Systems Inc. will be worth in a few years--and you'd be hard pressed to find anyone to disagree.  \nThe San Jose-based networking behemoth's stock closed March 14 at $131.75 a share, slightly down from its March 10 one-year high of $141.88 (The entire Nasdaq slid 4 percent on March 14.)  \nThirty-seven investment banks recommend either a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" None recommend a \"sell\" or even a \"hold.\"  \nOn any given day the volume of Cisco shares traded is the equivalent of every man, woman and child living in California--having hit 33 million as recently as March 9.  \nGeorge Kelly, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York who took Cisco public a decade ago, is one of the Cisco bulls. Cisco's stock is trading at roughly 120 times Mr. Kelly's earnings' estimate of $1.13 per share.  \nThe multiple, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a number that places a value on a stock. It is a ratio of the price of the stock to the profit of a company expressed per shares outstanding.  \n\"A low P/E usually signals investors are uncomfortable,\" Mr. Kelly said.  \nAs a reference, in 2000 Cisco's multiple of 120 compares to Microsoft Corp.'s multiple of 55 and Intel Corp.'s multiple of 42. Yet their values are below Cisco.  \n\"One of the reasons investors value Cisco so highly right now is that, unlike Microsoft, Cisco doesn't have the uncertainty of a Justice Department settlement--it's a much cleaner situation,\" Mr. Kelly said. \"Second, Cisco has had a tremendous track record of continuous upside surprises. And Cisco is viewed as opening several new markets, the biggest of which is optical, which is expected to be an explosive market.\"  \nPerfect returns  \nPaul Weinstein, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, believes a $1 trillion market capitalization (stock price multiplied by shares outstanding) is within reach in a few years. He said Cisco's stock has increased 1,000 times, a perfect 100 percent annual return since it launched its IPO in 1990.  \n\"We humbly submit that over the next two to three years, Cisco could be the first trillion dollar market cap company--and don't think they wouldn't love it,\" Mr. Weinstein wrote in his \"strong buy\" recommendation.  \nAs of March 14, Microsoft's market cap stood about $510 billion, compared with Cisco's $465 billion, which is threefold the annual revenue of the state of California.  \nMichael Neiberg, lead analyst in the communications equipment sector for Chase Hambrecht &amp; Quist in New York, said Cisco is turning a lot of investors long-term.  \nRecommended  \nTechnology  \nRedwood City-based Jasper Therapeutics drops nearly 19% in Wall Street debut  \nTechnology  \nIonQ sets sights on new growth targets after going public  \nTechnology  \nTesla is launching a lottery with a $10,000 prize to encourage workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19  \n\"If you had picked a price point to sell \\[high\\] at anytime in the past 10 years, you would have been wrong,\" he said. \"They have such an impressive track record of growing ... that the financial community isn't thinking in terms of a multiple of what they're earning this year, but what they will be earning three or four years down the line.\"  \nAn opposing view  \nThere are market watchers that are dubious, however, about the high valuation assigned to a large-cap company like Cisco.  \nJeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School, wrote this week in The Wall Street Journal that the high valuation assigned to large-cap technology stocks--Cisco is at the top of his list--are unsustainable.  \n\"History has shown that whenever companies, no matter how great, get priced above 50 to 60 times earnings, buyer beware,\" Mr. Siegel wrote.  \nHis statistical research concludes when companies reach big-cap status--ranked in the top 50 by market capitalization--their ability to generate long-term double-digit growth slows dramatically.  \nYoung bucks in a different field  \nLooking at multiples of high-flying valley gazelles that compete with Cisco is almost meaningless.  \nTake Juniper Networks Inc. The firm has rapidly gained a 15 percent market share in the high-end routing market, cracking a lucrative niche dominated by Cisco.  \nJuniper posted its first profit for the fourth quarter of 1999 of 3 cents per share. Extrapolating that performance out to a 12-month period would conservatively give the company a profit of 12 cents per share. But with its stock price closing March 14 at $245 a share, the upstart company can boast a P/E ratio of 2,042.  \nIs its stock more valuable than Cisco's? In a word, yes. At least Wall Street believes so.  \nBut both Messrs. Neiberg and Kelly note that what Wall Street is valuing is relatively short-term growth--the explosiveness of these new valley firms.  \n\"For the early adopters and early movers, Wall Street is willing to assign these values,\" Mr. Neiberg said.  \nBut he added that what Wall Street is betting on is extremely rapid growth for a year or two. As the rapid growth slows, the multiples will fall into a more earthly range.  \nComparing P/E ratios of other industry giants in different technology spaces may be tempting to investors, but Mr. Neiberg is wary of mixing two different dynamics.  \n\"Both \\[Microsoft and Intel\\] are benefiting from the PC revolution,\" Mr. Neiberg said. \"But they are in a much more moderate growth phase. The more rapid growth is to interconnect all those computers, and Cisco is the standard bearer for all that interconnection.\"  \nYou can reach Mr. Taylor at dtaylor@amcity.com.",
