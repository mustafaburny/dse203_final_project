Or is the real problem that \"Working Class\" people are fed up with either underpaid, undervalued, or having their sense of job security taken away. I mean honestly how dare the working class want something better. \n\nMost companies have not worked to create good company cultures. What I have seen over my working career in many industries is that employees are often undervalued by their managers and companies. Employees are not given clear paths for progression and have been beaten down with wage stagnation to protect and promote stock growth. Even at $40/hr our attrition rates are getting rough due to labor and wage practices.\n\nCurrent hiring practices are also to blame. Why do we have three interviews for a job that pays minimum wage? If you think that is bad, try applying for white collar or skilled jobs, where it takes not only multiple interviews, but MONTHS of waiting to find out if you got the job or not. Automated software is also to blame. It often removes dozens of valid candidates from the hiring lists in the attempt to find \"perfect\" candidates. \n\nThen comes 2020. Large sectors of the economy are labeled \"non-essential\" and are told to go home. In an instant, millions of people were told they are not an important part of the economy and their jobs could be taken away arbitrarily thus reducing their feelings of job security. \n\nAll of these factors and more have contributed to a massive amount of unfilled jobs. HR departments won't scrap non-working hiring practices, CEO's won't raise wages to attract talent, and our Government has yet make a concerted effort to regain public trust. \n\nDo I feel annoyed that people took the last few months to evaluate their participation in the workforce and aren't at Starbucks filling my order? Or do I understand that many took the time to create financial stability in other sectors and leave jobs where they were either undervalued, underpaid, or the government took their sense of job security?\n\n I do not feel sorry for companies that fail to recognize a shift in \"working class\" values. \n\nAlso, for the person who decided to make money off of investing and replaced their income, Good for you! I am glad you found a way to make income that you enjoy.",

When they lost out on a candidate to a startup our vice president told my co-worker he didn't understand why. She told him it's about money. And they offered much more plus stocks. Our executive team isn't getting the message that they need to raise wages. I've also been hearing our bonuses might not be anything this year because of one failed project. We all are be hounded by recruiters. Eventually the offers will be too good to pass up. Funny how companies love capitalism when it makes them profits but hate it when the workers can actually utilize it.",

Wallstreet  again could care less about politics, you call me naive yet you reference YouTube as a place where you think anti Chinese sentiment is driving the equities markets. Are you listening to yourself? Wallstreet doesn't care what some random Youtuber with 200 subs feels about China. It's all about earnings reports and going through them with a fine tooth comb. However when a good company like BABA is being attacked by a whole ass country, smart money gets out and waits to see what shoe will drop next. No amount of great earnings reports can combat Xi deciding to simply shut down BABA. As far as you not wanting Chinese stocks in Western markets, be careful what you wish for, the only reason BABA's market cap is what it is today is because of Western money. If all Chinese stocks get delisted, they lose 95% of their value instantly. China alone will not be able to keep BABA's MC $500 bil+",
