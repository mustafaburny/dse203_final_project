Remove the pandemic and the 2020 rise doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nWhat\u2019s scaring me is the new administrations addition of Tim Wu to the NEC and upcoming nomination of Lina  Khan to the FTC.  I\u2019m getting out of the bigger tech especially FAANG because any anti trust litigation will take years and add a lot of uncertainty.  Doesn\u2019t matter if the action is successful or not - it\u2019s a drag on the company.  Ask Ma Bell, IBM and MSFT.\n\nfor me, that means goodbye FAANG, hello CRSR, INTC, NVDA, CRM",

It's not some skepticism but accusation of outright fraud: in other words an all-or-nothing proposition. \n\nThat's why with say Pershing Square I at least know they believe in their bear thesis, even when Bill Ackman is wrong. \n\n I'm seeing this with Triteras and with Phase2.

        "body": "$WU has been known to charge high fees to move money to people in places that need it. Emerging markets are economically suffering as is and then they want to take high fees for moving desperately needed money to them. Crypto lets people move money 24/7 and gives them secrecy from anti-money laundering laws. Even if I don't think that crypto will take their economic lunch from them I think the larger trend in banking of consolidation will take their lunch in a more gradual way. As banks begin to merge and acquire one another they can begin to offer money transfer services as they scale larger and are able to absorb the costs of doing those services. They're facing economic deterioration on two fronts.",

        "body": "In the wake of the 2000 crash and day trading and all of that bs, I had about $30,000 of credit card debt.\n\nIt's funny what happens when you pay it off... you suddenly learn why bankers are so rich: Time Value of Money.\n\nSee, TVM is the central principle of all finance, and it can work for you or against you.  It's applicable to everything:  Giving up some money now for more money later, or buying a dollar for sixty cents versus the other way around.\n\nWhen you're a borrower, you're paying the premium.  When you're a depositor and investor, you're collecting the premium... provided that you are properly pricing assets and not buying into the inflated premiums speculators attach to stocks on the front end.\n\nIf you're old enough to remember, there was this game for the Apple \\]\\[ called Taipan! that taught Time Value of Money and compound interest in a very interesting way:\n\nThe game involved being a trader on the China Sea.  It was basically the predecessor to Dope Wars... you would fight pirates, buy bigger ships, buy cannons, trade arms, silk, cargo and opium.  Opium was like a day trading stock.  It could skyrocket for no reason.  And you could get rich, then you'd get mugged by robbers and lose all your cash.\n\nYou have this Elder Brother Wu who is basically a loan shark.  He can loan you money but he'll loan it to you at a usurious rate of interest... it compounds 10 percent *per turn.*\n\nBUT THERE'S A GLITCH...\n\nIf you repay Wu more money than you owe him, suddenly you have a negative balance... and it grows at the same rate of interest, but in your favor.  He owes you 10 percent compounded per turn.\n\nIf you play this out for a couple of hours, your balance with him grows into the billions and trillions and hundreds of trillions of British pounds.  Pretty soon, the risk of getting mugged over \u00a33 million in opium seems worthless, because you're making more than ten times that just moving from port to port, causing Wu to incur humongous interest.\n\nThat is why you should always be, literally, on the right side of the Time Value of Money equation.",

Crypto eliminates the need for these services entirely. A surprisingly high amount of money gets transferred to developing nations, and there are no barriers to entry in said nations. Any person can set up shop, accept crypto payment, and hand over the equivalent local currency.\n\nI say this with my investor hat on. When I take it off I am glad these economic vampires are going to disappear. Transferring wealth from one person to another should not cost this much. I just got a quote for sending money to Samoa (a very common practise for Samoans in New Zealand). 8% service fee plus an exchange rate of USD1 to WST2.2364 when the spot price is 2.51753. They don't indicate anywhere that they're taking a spread on this. This is an effective service fee of 10.5%.",

An example of a woman who grew up in an oppressive society and used those cultural norms and expectations to seize power, a la Empress Wu. Her first scene really had some \u201csecretly plotting to kill you and seize power vibes. \n\nBut then they just decided to do the plot from the first movie again and have her be a blank piece of paper?  That plot is incredibly offensive for 2021. Especially since the movie implies that she\u2019s scared of her warlord father, hence her hesitation to do anything that would piss off the man the warlord has arranged for her to marry. And the movie has the crown prince give a speech about how horrible she is! \n\nThere were other weird misogynistic plot points too(why did the crown princess have to literally physically beat a challenger to the throne to convince her dad that she is capable of rule? The movie had kept bringing up trade routes-I thought she was going to pull some slick political move but NOPE ITS STICK BEATING TIME)",
