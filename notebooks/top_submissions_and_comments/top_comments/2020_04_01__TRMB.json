        "body": "I look at it like this: If you have a 10% chance of losing $50, consider it as if you have lost a straight $5.\n\nSo a 20% chance of losing 50%, means a 10% downside; a 80% chance of making 3.5%, means a 2.8% upside. So you are 5x skewed in the downside direction. At this point it's your call. What I do is this: if you're leveraged 5x in the down direction, don't you want to inverse that for your portfolio? Take out 80% of it.\n\nIn the same way, when you have positive leverage, and you're borrowing 2x from the bank, you should be 2x as confident that the stocks are gonna be going up. If you're 5x as confident that they're going to go down, shrink your leverage to be 1/5.\n\nIt's the same thing for individual stocks. I think Ally has an upside of 2x this year, and WDC has an upside of 1.8x. My portfolio is balanced accordingly. It's like a parimutuel bet. Put your money on the \"horses\" (stocks) in proportion to their expected return. There are many opportunities to make money in excess of what the stock market does on average.\n\nSo you see how quickly this particular bet becomes more and more clear what to do though. If you thought a 60% chance of a pullback, you're looking at 30% downside and 1.4% upside, around 22x negative leverage, implying that you should move to 95% cash.\n\nThe market is usually not on the edge of collapsing from a global pandemic, so usually these sorts of analysis are not so incredible. But in this case, the math demonstrates that the choice is clear; it is a hugely lopsided gamble in favor of removing your money. By keeping your money in, if you thought at all that the stocks would correct themselves, you were making a big bet for a small return",
