I went from HP to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to DXC Technology, and the whole time we were employed at DXC there was a feeling of death around with no morale and a very sad feeling around the fact that most were told they should just be happy they have a job. Although I literally sat and watched as person by person around me all inevitably got laid off. They'd come in on Thursday and be told the next day (Friday) would be their last day and they'd be lucky to get severance. I eventually left the company because of anything could be better, and I was looking to grow and not be held down. \n\nNo raises or bonuses for years, layoffs left and right, vile environment, etc. I wouldn't own it, but then again I don't track the stock price and I see it from a perspective that would never interest me in looking.",
