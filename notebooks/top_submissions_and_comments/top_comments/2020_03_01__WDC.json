Power is a big issue in 5G as telco's will need 3-5x the amount of sites we needed for LTE. \n\nEricsson went ASIC from the beginning which was the right call. In addition Ericsson has higher mshare vs Nokia and 5G will use the same RAN as LTE - so do I swap my whole network out or buy better 5G tech from the company I already buy my network infrastructure from?\n\nThat said MNO's are suffering and will buy from whoever offers the best terms. Payment terms will beat the better tech for many MNO's.\n\nI would still buy ERIC over NOK calls but better rhan both would be to back the tech behind them both and that will be ASICs.\n\nAlso ERIC &amp; NOK make their money from support/services/maintenance contracts as the MNO's play them off against each other to drive down Capex costs. Neither will profit bigly from 5G until at least mid 2021 when network maintenance contracts scale up.\n\nTLDR: Look for 5G ASIC companies instead of FPGA manufacturers like Xilinx. If going long ERIC or NOK buy exp as far out as you can - selling network infrastructure is low margin they make money from network services.",
