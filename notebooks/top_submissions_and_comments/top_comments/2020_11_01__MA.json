And the first question people ask when they find out what I did in college is about the economy and stocks. And it\u2019s a dumb question and they don\u2019t even realize it. Like I spent years learning about scarcity and a bunch of basically applied calculus and statistics. \n\nUnless I work directly for a brokerage I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to make an informed decision any one way or the other, and even then it would only be a best estimate and one with enough of a likely chance to not be correct that it would be pretty irresponsible to give an opinion on it. \n\nI can fully do the math behind it sure, but the stock market has proven time and time again that it\u2019s irrational and not really predictable with any algorithm. There is a reason that economic theory even says throwing a dart at a chart of stocks and picking where it lands is just as likely to be accurate than if you picked it based on extensive amounts of DD and research. \n\nBut I just point people towards index\u2019s, tell them if they aren\u2019t retiring in the next 5 years don\u2019t be afraid or worried that the stock market drops every now and then etc etc. \n\ntl;dr Economists don\u2019t study the economy they study scarcity. I\u2019d be extremely skeptical of any economist claiming to know what the market will do or that they have figured out the stock market. We exist to do small scale data analysis, or to advise large scale economic moves aka monetary/fiscal policy, we aren\u2019t adept at guessing small movements within certain markets. And if we\u2019re in a spot where we can then we are also in a spot where the sec would have something to say if we profited off it.",

        "body": "&gt; IMO it really validates the risks related with EM investments and the risks that are attributed to investments in Chinese markets\n\nActually if you read the piece the exact opposite conclusion is reached: that with this move China actually **derisked** its economy and therefore arguably made it safer for investors. It was not a \"move on a whim by Xi because he got his sensitive feelings hurt by Jack Ma\" like so many Western publications argued. Like the piece says:\n\n&gt; [Regulators think that] there are many deficiencies of the current Chinese financial system, but that does not mean \u201cBigTech\u201d gets to do what it wants, even if we can acknowledge their contributions to society.  TL;DR: we like innovation, but let\u2019s not overhype the magic of \u201cbig data,\u201d and anyway, you\u2019re still operating in financial services, and so that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be regulated, like it or not.  That\u2019s because if we the regulators don\u2019t step in, and something goes wrong, who will pay the price?  Society will, the citizens will. Don\u2019t you guys remember the Great Financial Crisis of 2008?  A few parties won, yes, but all the rest of us? We lost.  We were all set back.  That\u2019s not happening again, not on our watch!\n\nWhen regulators think like that, I think that's a system worth investing into IMHO, because they think long-term and they think greater-good which ultimately leads to a stronger economy, not something to be scared by...\n\nThe only argument that can be made, I think, is that they acted too last-minute and that is scary in itself but it is also actually somewhat reassuring because they're not afraid to stop something as iconic as the world's largest IPO when they believe it can ultimately be detrimental to society. They didn't mind losing face and that is a positive sign for China.",

Then in this speech he called all the banks \"pawn shops\" for loans and basically made fun of the biggest govt backed banks (who he had sold shitty debt securities to). Essentially he offloaded a shit ton of liability from ANT's (like paypal/venmo in china) loans onto the chinese government aka the chinese people.  So now the govt has to deal with all that before it potentially explodes in their faces, and they have to teach jack ma a lesson because he essentially sold them bags of dogshit and then bragged about it publicly while laughing in their faces",
