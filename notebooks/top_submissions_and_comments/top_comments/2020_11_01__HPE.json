Long term I think there were issues with their copier business and xerox wanted a take over prepandemic but the price per share was too low and rejected (I seem to remember the numbers 18 and 23 for some reason).\nI could very well be wrong\n\nThe CEO came out and said that it's undervalued by xerox and our share price should be higher and rejected that offer. \n\nThe share was around 14-17 for most of the pandemic. They had a backlog of orders during pandemic due to unable to transport stuff from China to here. \n\nThe prime competitors are Lenovo and DELL who are doing better than HPQ.\n\nHp split into HPQ and HPE.. I would look into a little more deeply.\n\nThe pandemic is almost over. Stay at home is almost done IE schools will open next quarter. Max by summer they will start opening. S&amp;P is at peak and there maybe transition into value stuff soon.\n\nI'd look more into it.",

First, comparison to the Leidos, CACI, BAH, IBM, HPE etc. of the government consulting world. They too employ a lot of talent. What is the difference with PLTR? Second, government consulting is often a \"customer intimate\" model, not quality leadership. Govt says it wants high tech, but they often buy those companies who understand them most. Which model is PLTR using? Why will PLTR succeed in Govt? Is it primarily IC?\n\nThird, if PLTR has silicon valley magic in it, then why is the commercial business not taking off? If you have a superior value proposition, that will be reflected in high margins and a kind of inevitability of customers who are drawn to your products. A weakness there would make me pause.",

For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth.

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

This year it hasn't that much. People are timid, but I largely think that is overplayed. Many companies reported great numbers for Q3. Whether the election is contested, biden wins, or trump wins, it doesn't really matter. The private sector is marching on. Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if people riot. Stimulus will pass whether its biden or trump. Even so, we know we have until next year to sort it all out. Im keeping some cash for buying opportunities, but I'm largely bullish.

Remember it\u2019s your money people love to brag\nAbout their gains no one mentions  how much they lost so be cautious and take calculatedRisks .

But they're also spending a hell of a lot of money to get all this other crap done. I have January calls it'll probably expire worthless. I've come to accept that unless Microsoft or the government or somebody buys a company which unfortunately is not for sale. But then again everything has its price. Including me because I've been giving $5 blow jobs behind the Wendy's dumpster near my house just to make ends meet.\nI've already lost my half my portfolio which is about $80,000 thank you AMD for moving your earnings date without telling anyone and buying xilinx. And now dunkin' donuts is going private and I knew about it and I didn't buy any calls or puts or any goddamn thing.\nThe only advice I can give you is stay out of this for a while or buy leaps for 2022. Nokia doesn't move enough to day trade you're better off investing in Erickson or Comcast or T-Mobile. Even Qualcomm I stay away from AT&amp;T though period well good luck with your investment you can always buy Tesla. I just bought Amazon and the price went down even though earnings were through the roof. The stock market is just not stable right now it's almost as if Trump is running that also as well as the country period both are in very sad state. Put your money in the bank and leave it there for a while you're better off period again this is only my opinion or is everyone says the mad ravings of a madman Good luck Chuck. Cheers",

It was an unqualified failure by any measure when compared to it's chief rival, Microsoft.\n\nYears later Jobs got a hold of the nearly bankrupt remnants of the Apple Computer company, and turned it into a very different company that had tremendous success in consumer electronics and media licensing.  In between Apple phase 1 and 2, Jobs founded Next Computers, which failed to make any money, but he also founded Pixar which was a great success.\n\nTo summarize, Jobs was never very successful at the computer business.  Had Jobs taken a more pragmatic approach in the beginning, Apple might have gotten decent market share in the computer business.  Regardless of Apple's current market capitalization, they have less than 8% market share of the computer industry despite being one of it's pioneers.  Sad.",

Casting a wide net can get some misses, but there's plenty of reason to expect upside north of 50% or more on a good number as well. Hard to make that case for MSFT or AMD. \n\nI'm between 75% and 250% on several of my bargain plays of April and May. There are still plenty of options out there that haven't begun to claim their recovery gains, but we can expect that in the meantime, big tech won't see a future six months anything like what it saw the past six months. \n\nI'm investing longer term as well, but I like to keep some fluidity for shorter term trading as well, since I'm already maxing out my and my wife's RIRAs and still maintaining sizable pragmatic choices in my brokerage. \n\nBut you're right on a horizon of a year or more, the longterm value and relatively low risk with the tech giants and chip makers will beat many value plays, and the FOMO factor is relatively small given the ceiling and the uncertainty between now and then, which means that even if the liquidity I added this afternoon pays off better elsewhere, it's certainly a defensible position to stand pat and take the lower drama.",
