Long term I think there were issues with their copier business and xerox wanted a take over prepandemic but the price per share was too low and rejected (I seem to remember the numbers 18 and 23 for some reason).\nI could very well be wrong\n\nThe CEO came out and said that it's undervalued by xerox and our share price should be higher and rejected that offer. \n\nThe share was around 14-17 for most of the pandemic. They had a backlog of orders during pandemic due to unable to transport stuff from China to here. \n\nThe prime competitors are Lenovo and DELL who are doing better than HPQ.\n\nHp split into HPQ and HPE.. I would look into a little more deeply.\n\nThe pandemic is almost over. Stay at home is almost done IE schools will open next quarter. Max by summer they will start opening. S&amp;P is at peak and there maybe transition into value stuff soon.\n\nI'd look more into it.",

Gates's mom served on a charitable board with the CEO of IBM; they were more associates than friends, and that wouldn't have helped Gates at all if he hadn't already, you know, founded MS. \n\nElon's family didn't own an emerald mine, and he was $100k in debt when he graduated college. \n\nMeritocracy just means that merit - mostly in the sense of skills - is rewarded. It doesn't mean that everyone necessarily has an equal chance. \n\nIf a company needs and engineer and I have an engineering degree, and you don't - maybe because you had an abusive family growing up wit a father in prison and so never graduated from HS, the company is hiring me *on merit*. I'm an engineer; you're not; you can't do the job. \n\nThis doesn't mean that if our lives were switched at age 3 I would have done any better; that's just a separate question from meritocracy. \n\nI mean, if a company needs someone who speaks French, and my wealthy family summered in France every year and sent me there one a gap year and then on a junior year abroad...while you took French in HS...merit means I get the job *even though* I was only able to obtain my qualifications because my family was rich enough to keep sending me to France. \n\nBut the company isn't hiring me because of who I am, but because of what I can do, and that I can do it better than you can.",

You mean the IBM Power10 processor? \n\nThe only thing that's sort of interesting is the \"Distributed Memory Disaggregation and Sharing\"-feature, but that processor is not available until the end of 2021. If there is any proof that it is *real* and is competitive in terms of pricing, then I might see some value there. \n\nThe world has been moving to commodity servers for the past 15 years. IBM is everything but that. \n\nIBM has a debt of 50B. I don't see how their current assets are worth more than their debt.",

        "body": "So the other response summed it up pretty well, but left one other important factor out. The importance of Intel's architecture is fading. It will always be around of course, but anyone that doesn't think ARM is going to keep getting a larger and larger bite of the pie isn't paying attention. Apple will give everyone permission to target software for ARM architecture and we'll soon see a second attempt from Microsoft. Again, we'll always have applications for Intel, but it won't be nearly as dominant. Intel's production woes over the past half decade are well documented, and it's clear that they are about as well run as Boeing these days. The problem for Intel is that they face much more fierce competition than Boeing. Intel will survive of course, but they'll be a shell of their former self, and they'll have fumbled their flagship products and missed the boat on the areas of the industry that are sure to see rapid growth. I understand that people want to target value, but Intel is priced the way they are for good reason. If you're looking for value in Intel then I have some IBM stock to sell you as well.",

So I will be around so long there are investors willing to keep the company running.\n\nAs for the eV controversial giant, this is not quite finished. Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money. Seagate was dismissed in 1997, sue again and paid [$45 M to R+ as late as 2000](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/seagate-to-pay-rodime-45m-to-settle-suit-2000-01/).   R+ only exists as a shell company and its share price soared on news of the patent settlement.  I think **NKLA** can remain as a shell company with its patent portfolio covering designs that covers most vehicles built electric or not.

This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",

These include borderless transfer without needing to convert to to local currency (cant do this with Western Union), black markets, safe haven from oppressive governments, sending aid to citizens of oppressive governments, ways to bypass import sanctions (see Iran), and more. Just because you don't have intrinsic use for BTC, doesn't mean others don't (see link below).\n\nYou can do this with Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Vertcoin, even Dogecoin. I agree cryptocurrency and blockchains are useful but I don't see Bitcoin as a long term store of value. It's far more volatile than precious metals and also intangible.\n\nIBM is making huge strides towards quantum computing, and once they pull it off, Bitcoin will become worthless once the public/private key cryptography is cracked and anyone with access to a quantum computer can simply sign transactions to send coins to themselves. We're easily within 10 years at this point, possibly less.\n\n&gt;This is like saying anyone can create a better social network than Facebook and therefore Facebook has no value\n\nWhat about Myspace?
