I thought jeez these companies must be making a killing, so I looked into buying stock in those companies. \n\nI checked out Seagate first since they were strictly HDD but my broker isnt able to clear Seagate shares (Canadian stuff) but I could buy WDC. I went through their history, financials, leadership and learned about their company, and it's pretty stellar. I waited through the earnings call and was surprised that it wasn't mentioned even once, and based on the sideways trading over the past 3 months, there hasn't been a significant reaction from the market yet. Sooner or later, people will learn just how much WDC is making and when that happens they will see the stock is undervalued and they will buy in. If you want to buy in before that happens, now is a good time.",

It's essentially already late to get into it by individuals.\n\nWithin a month or two, buying hard disks will be pointless as the only way to keep a ROI on it will be SSDs (already is), and these in turn will also quickly become obsolete in terms of ROI due to the insane amount of storage added to it, making returns plateauing.\n\nThat's when you will get a tsunami wave of individuals dumping their hard drive farms in the second hand market, relieving retail demand for storage space and killing prices.\n\nIn other words, the new currency has a spike in storage demand now, but given its trajectory vs. the ROI that is achieved it's very likely to lead to quick dumps of the bought storage space to the second hand market as it's already considered 'late' to enter by individuals. Once people realize that for every day that passes they need additional terabytes of space just to stay in the same ROI, they will get off it quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps an interesting comparison would be to see how did other currencies affect the prices of AMD and NVIDIA, then take a massive chunk out of that and you'll get the WDC potential upside, since it's nowhere near as attractive as those who use gpus.",

Im very bullish on achronix, especially with xilinx being swallowed by AMD, which will probably be much smoother than intel's debauchery of a buyout  /w Altera, but will still mess up xilinx IMO.\nAchronix will stand out even more.  FPGA tech is not very click bait worthy, which is fine by me. Less pump and dump volatility, and I see this as a long term hold with zero doubts.",
