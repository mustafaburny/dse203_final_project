Intel must succeed at their roadmap for the next 5 years without any major delays.\n\n2) Launch their new foundry program (a low margin business) to compete with TSMC while simultaneously getting their margins back to 60%+. Having a successful number two depends on number one being successful.\n\n3) Continue to better compete against AMD/Nvidia without resorting to lower pricing/margin.\n\n4) Deal with the emergence of ARM competition in server and other high margin areas.\n\nIf they are able to handle these challenges over the next 5 years then I think you can make a pretty decent return on your investment. However, if they have continued missteps, then you'd probably have better returns just investing in the SP500 or competitors like AMD/Nvidia.

And I'm not convinced that it's safe given the size of capex investments they're looking to make against the potential to falling revenue and increased costs.\n\nDo I think INTC will succeed in it's turnaround?

Apple is on a league of its own, and someone like nvdia or Qualcomm will create the M1 equivalent for PC.\n\n\nAnd the other problem as someone who works in Silicon Valley, in this industry and has a lot of friends in Intel is: \n\nIntel has been bleeding talent left and right for the last 5 years. \n\nIntel pays very low compared to Silicon Valley standards, that\u2019s partly because there is so much competition for talent from nvidia, apple, Qualcomm who are all killing it.  And as a big chunk of compensation is tied in RSUs, Intel cannot compete with salaries as these companies stocks have done extremely well. Apple\u2019s stock has gone up 300% in 5 years and if 30% of your compensation is RSUs, then you are basically getting 30-40% yoy raises for 5 years straight. No way Intel can keep up with that.\n\nIntel pays like 30-50% lower for a comparable position at apple. You just cannot retain top talent with that kind of a pay disparity. Anyone I know, who is talented enough and can leave Intel, has left Intel. \n\n\nIntel is seriously at the danger of becoming IBM of chip makers. Especially now, with amazon working on its own server chips, google working on its own, Microsoft is rumoured to be working on their own silicon for azure. Apparently Qualcomm is going to compete in PC processors. Intel is increasingly looking its in a death spiral. Google, Amazon, Microsoft can pay intel\u2019s top people 2x and poach them left and right. Because these companies are swimming in money form their other businesses.\n\n\nOne thing they have going for them is their fabs. With the increased attention to on shoring chip manufacturing, they should leverage that and start manufacturing chips from competitors for domestic consumption, especially like the defence industry. They have a healthy head start with chip manufacturing infrastructure and know how. They should lean into that. The days of them competing to make the best processors in the world is over.",

If you look at AMD stock they're revenue is up 99.3% Y/Y and net income up 353% Y/Y (mostly due to COVID, but intel had same situation). AMD's revenue wasn't much of a threat to Intel previously.

Their Alder Lake product line is using big.LITTLE setup, and the initial benchmarks show incredible performance increase over their current offerings. To the point where their 12900K shows the ability to match AMD's top consumer CPUs, 5950X in multicore and significantly beat them in single core (basically meaning they can do very parallel work just as fast, but do the non-parallel single throughput workloads much faster).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntel is also preparing to launch their first real dedicated graphics cards starting in Q2 2022. This is Nvidia's bread and butter and where alot of AMD's profit comes from as well. You may or may not be aware of the madness that is the graphics card market right now, with prices skyrocketing 200-300% and demand has been outstripping supply by huge amounts for 12 months now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntel's long term plan is the expansion of it's fabrication foundries. You may have heard that semi-conductor production is a dog's breakfast right now. Production of everything from cars, to computers to toasters is being slowed by the fact that chips can't be made fast enough for them. The big chip manufacturers for most of these things are TSMC, Samsung and to a lesser extent, Global Foundries. Intel is making a play, likely using huge amounts of government money, to increase their production ability, move the capacity to produce chips to the US (which is currently a high national security concern). It will take 2-4 years to make this happen, but it's a great direction to move in, especially since a short time ago Intel was toying with the idea of getting rid of it's production capability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I think Intel has a great future, but they have probably one more quarter before we see the effects of their turnaround strategy and if it will work.",

        "body": "Personally I think people are blowing the ARM threat completely out of proportion. In my view the concern it poses is that ARM will allow more companies to develop their own in house design plus a new  CPU competitors will enter the market. That being said Intel has an enormous amount of advantages over any possible entrant into the CPU space. Lets not forget they've been in this position for the majority of their corporate history. They fought Power PC and won. They competed in against a multitude of x86 vendors which they brutally destroyed like DEC, Cyrix [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_x86\\_manufacturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_x86_manufacturers) the only exception is AMD which itself has almost died multiple times. Had Intel not rested on their laurels AMD would be dead now too and this is coming from someone who loves AMD to death. (I bought AMD @ $4 back in 2014). \n\nNot only does Intel have some of the best CPU designers in the industry their Roadmap is insane. They are planning on marrying together all of their IP CPU, GPU, FPGA's, Memory, Software and all the other random highly competitive stuff intel does. I think Big.Little married with chiplets and AI accelerators will be a game changer. The only other company I see approaching this scale of capability is AMD. I also don't think every single company will have their own inhouse designs, building CPU's is very expensive and complicated. The expertise is limited and you open yourself up to a whole host of complications. Yes it makes sense for Apple, Amazon, Microsoft etc. But the small to medium sized players will still need a common platform if they want to exist. \n\nThe Foundry is a risk yes but I believe Intel has the finances and talent necessary to figure out this problem. Perhaps they could even go license a new node from Samsung similar to Global foundries. Or maybe Intel and Samsung partner up to develop new nodes to take on TSMC. To me its not a crazy though that Intel and Apple might partner up on the manufacturing side either. Apple has tried to be less dependent on TSMC by leveraging Global Foundries but they just could keep up with TSMC. I don't think anyone wants to be in a situation where there is one FAB to rule them all especially with the geopolitical risks. I'm willing to bet that their massive war chest will help them solve this problem. If not they can always pull an AMD and sell the fab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion Intel's problems have been self inflicted by poor management under Brian Krzanich. They got lazy meanwhile and AMD came in and smashed them. Imagine if Intel began doing their plans 10 years ago? What would the market would look like? The missing element is aggressive management hopefully Pat and Intel's $20 Billion in annual profit will be the answer. The downside is large if the fail yes but the upside is also huge. Imagine Intel retuned as a vertically integrated AI powerhouse that brings giant leaps in performance with every new generation. Intel is the only company in the world capable of doing this. People are underestimating Intel just as they underestimated AMD its a complex situation and takes time to play out but if anyone can pull it off its Intel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee Moore's law is dead for more info on the tech\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44zQII9GV4",

And at first amd was supposed to be just gaming, but now it is growing into a threat to the whole consumer computer business. Intel had been in a position where it didnt have to do much to be the dominant leader, they didnt inovate much and kept prices high, which upset a lot of people. They are delaying 7nm to 2022 or 2023 and amd is already launching next year the 5nm chips. Now the monopoly is being challenged, and intel has tl catch up.\nEven schools which are now replacing old desktops are buying amd desktops.\nCan you tell me about someone who is under 30 years old and knows computers who would rather buy intel chips than a ryzen?",

        "body": "Intel could well go the way of Kodak in the coming decade; around, but not in nearly the same capacity. Intel's main business is in data centres, I think something close to 99% of data centres use Intel, and the big 3 are Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. While Apple is very unlikely to start supplying their chips to other companies, what they have done is proven to everyone just how powerful and efficient ARM chips can be and what happens when you drop a stagnant supplier.\n\nApple may not supply chips but other companies will. We now know that Microsoft and Amazon are working on custom ARM chips for their own data centres, and we also know that the world's most powerful supercomputer runs on ARM chips too. Intel has slept through all of this thinking their ~99% data centre marketshare is safe, but they will very quickly begin to lose marketshare once Microsoft and Amazon are happy with their ARM developments. This is without even mentioning AMD which is also making strides.\n\nI just see it as Intel will begin to shrink and pivot their business a bit, I don't think they'll disappear but I wouldn't expect much growth either. They could make and supply ARM chips themselves, but they don't make nearly as much money as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, so they won't be able to afford the same engineers who can make such developments. One of the main reasons Apple's chips have been so successful is because they can afford to throw *a lot* of money at it.",

I don't even mean desktops.  I mean servers, which change over in terms of technology on an insane tempo compared to consumer devices.  Data centre operators are going to see the power savings with ARM and are going to drop Intel like a hot potato.   Apple's ability to ship the \\*same silicon\\* in iPad, Macbook air, and iMac format, with better performance, and no need for a fan... man, I don't know what else would put them on notice.     The same designs can be wrapped up on a Linux or Windows server already.  I can run an ARM instance at amazon today.  If this trend picks up steam, the server HALF of their business is going to get rekt. And did you notice that Windows is shipping ARM versions? I sure did.\n\nOr we could consider that Intel's leadership completely *blew it* when it comes to the various new semiconductor businesses that were invented in the last 2 decades, namely phones (ceded to Qualcomm and ARM), tablets (same), game consoles (ARM, AMD), cars (blackberry, microsoft), smart TVs (qualcomm).  They have a small IoT hobby business, but I would be real worried about Nvidia in this department, who are iterating fast with Jetson.\n\nI just looked at AMD's 5 year stock price chart compared to my previous favourite chart, Intuit, and holy cow, they have just completely kicked ass.\n\nTrue fact, Intel's 5 year performance is worse than Blackberry's.\n\ntldr; Intel = woof",
