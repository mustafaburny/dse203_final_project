        "body": "Yeah, this. They have been aggressively growing top line by basically undercutting every CDN on pricing. Basement level pricing for CDNs is not a viable long term strategy. They really changed their tune to security this earnings call which basically shows they know that they need to start getting away from pure traffic delivery, but they don\u2019t have anywhere near the security portfolio that Akamai or Cloudflare can offer.  I work in the field and operationally the network is nothing special and they have a huge gap to make up when it comes to being able to compete in the security space.",

        "body": "Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are hardly competitors. They offer cloud infrastructure (API's, virtual boxes, web services, etc. ). Cloudflare and its main competitors, Fastly and Akamai, focus on their Content Delivery Networks (CDN).\n\nAkamai was the first and is the largest CDN, but they use old technology and are making questionable choices for management positions. They are kind of old news.\n\nFastly and Cloudlfare started around the same time, but Cloudflare focused on scale and marketing, while Fastly focused on efficiency.\nFastly has the fewest Point of Presences, but more than made up for it with their incredibly efficient and powerful design. They seem to be dominating in the edge computing world with their compute@edge project, but Cloudflare isnt far behind. Fastly's founder and CEO stepped back last year to focus on the technology. In the past they have struggled to land large contracts due to lack of exposure, but I think their new CEO, and the proven performance are turning that around. Cloudflare is used by a lot of websites, probably most, but to name a few notable contracts for Fastly there is Shopify, Spotify, A&amp;E, Vimeo, Imgur, and many more. Also, to emphasize why Amazon and Microsoft arent competitors, Fastly is used by Github, and at least the Amazon Prime website. Unfortunately, TikTok was their biggest client before politics had to end that, which is a large part of why they missed earnings in Q4. Faslty's business model is also based on usage, which obviously has its pros and cons for the users, but leads toward an unsteady income and a bit of a concern for investors.\n\nCloudflare is way better than Akamai, way larger than Fastly, and more well known than both, but I think they are already the big dog. Sure they will grow, sure they will do well, sure they have more consistent revenue, but Fastly has much more room to grow, and much more reason to. I think Cloudflare is a solid stable company. Fastly has a stronger product, but they havent quiet found the support to become stable yet, I think that is coming.\n\nFastly is my largest holding, but then again I am a noobie, what do I know.",

Sorry for poor formatting I am on mobile but i really want to discuss this. \n\nProof of position before starting: https://imgur.com/a/GXhOznp\n\nShares: https://imgur.com/a/urp4YcN\n\nLoss porn the first week: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay29a/hold_lads_gme_will_remember_us_we_will_not_be/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n$250-250k to basically 0 now to the theory! \n\nI have been watching \ud83e\udd13 the GME saga for weeks now and ready every single post, shitpost from WSB, GME and so on and something has really bothered me. \ud83e\uddd0\n\nHow will \ud83d\udca9 shitadel get out of this. So lets talk about a few theories as to what is happen and multiple fronts.\n\n1. Front is old and new shorts, have a war according to uncle bruce between NYC hedge funds and CME options traders in which shorts are flipping long at the expense of naked sellers of the CME. To do this you buy enough ITM calls to cover your short and a little extra to sell back to naked options sellers thus getting out of the short and passing the burning house to options sellers. Now granted this may only work for small positions.\n\n2. The second front is the large short positions that are so fucking deep it will form the black hole of the galaxy. How do they cover and still break even or profit without necessarily cheating. \n\nWell you heard of interstellar \ud83e\ude80 i shall put on my tin foil hat and explain black hole event horizon slingshot.\n\nHow does it work? Well it requires 3 things shorts that will exit, put/call options but mainly puts and chaos/volatility. \n\nThe theory is that shitadel will tank the market and use the stimulus money. Now retarded spud \ud83e\udd54 how do they do that? Well.. \n\nMost people are getting a $1400 \ud83d\udcb0 check which they should be buying food and shit with but are buying FDs and stonks.  Fun fact if 1 million Americans yoloed GME thats 1.4 Billion $$$. Now imagine how much shitadel can get out with if half did that. \n\nEffectively pumping the markets. So what do you do if your short so fucking deep that your anus is wider than the sun and the sun is shining? \n\nYou first cheat to stabilize the position aka GME and the market. Thus effectively shorting volatility and lowering IV. \n\nNow how does that relate to GME? Well if GME does the damage we think it will do then you need insurance. Which are basically options.\n\nQueue magnifying glass. If you look at any boomer stock and or blue chip etc there are 10s of thousands of puts for march 19th. \n\nFOR EVERY FUCKING large cap. Now lets look at the chaos/volatility fuel in this case VIX and VXX derivatives. \n\nConsidering how chaotic the market looks and the looming doom that is GME vix is really low. \nIf you look at VXX in particular for march 19th there are 80000 calls at $20 and 40000 at 40.\n\nIm no tin foil man but that seems like an elaborate setup for a rug pull and ive been through many. \n\nShitadel may use that as justification for shorts and right now theyre fucked. GME turn around, they lost their mole CFO and now the SEC is turning sides with new officials. This smells the ultimate exit.\n\nJDST, JNUG, UVXY, SVXY, AMD, BEYOND MEAT, THE piss, the coup, the shitcoins shill, montezation of WSB attempt, SPY FDs 0DTE and Trump Tweets I have been with WSB through it all and this time i want to contribute.\n\nTl;dr. Shitadel is planning the biggest rug pull ever and its powered by gamestop. How do you capture the violence that will occur to 401ks ane retirement? \n\nGamestop, VXX, and puts on \u201cinsert favorite boomer stock here\u201d or SPY.\n\nPositions \n\nGME: \nCalls for \n\n3/5\n3/12\n3/19\n3/26 \n\nat various strikes at 115-800\n\nVXX: \n\nCalls for\n3/19 at $40 for 500 calls adding an additional 500-1000 for insurance.\n\nFun position\nRKT\n\n3/12 at $25 for 45 calls. \n\nThey will be rolled into GME and additional puts across the market.\n\nAlso: 100+ shares and holding across 5 brokers https://imgur.com/a/urp4YcN\n\nLet me know and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 my fellow smooth brain \ud83e\udde0 \ud83e\udd8d  brothers! Ice cream on me when this is over \ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\n\nSide note i bet a girl to marry me at 10000 on GME make sure it happens y\u2019all invited to the livestream.\n\nEdit: A SILVER? Spend it ON GME, also when and if we implode load up on the dip! You now can feel like rich billionaires crashing the market to buy cheap shit! Or you know LONG black berry\n\nEdit2: Shoutout to the boys over at the other subreddits with the amazing DD you all helped me develop a wrinkle you know who you are.

Why would they even allow me to spend the cash if I didn\u2019t truly have it in my account? They shouldn\u2019t be allowed to close on my behalf at a loss, especially when the stocks rising.

To the moon!!\u201d\n\nNo. This is idiotic. Some of the largest asset managers in the world are Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity, State Street, Schwab, and T. Rowe. A huge percentage of their businesses are passive funds and ETFs. They buy whatever the index creator tells them to. If their ETF gets inflows they buy more. If it gets outflows they sell. They don\u2019t \u201clike the stock,\u201d they don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t make more money if the stock goes up or down. They own EVERY SINGLE STOCK IN THE MARKET. \n\nMost of these firms also have ACTIVE funds, which are actively managed and trying to beat an index. If an actively managed fund buys a stock, they like it. These are a smaller part of most of their businesses (T. Rowe and Fido still have big active businesses) Cathie Wood runs active funds. When she buys or sells, it matters! \n\nGenerally speaking active funds buying stocks is a \u201cgood sign\u201d (although they\u2019re obviously not always right). Passive investors buying or selling stock is no sign unless they\u2019re doing it because of new index inclusion which are well known in advance (see TSLA). \n\nA lot of passive investors in a low float stock actually IS a hypothetical good set up for a gamma or short squeeze. This is because they are indifferent to price. If Vanguard owns 95% of a stock in its passive funds and it goes up 1000% they... do nothing. The more passive investors in a smaller market cap stock the more retail trading effects pricing because there are few natural sellers (it is price inelastic) \nGood thread here: https://twitter.com/macrocephalopod/status/1362758036188758016?s=20\n\nHowever! This may only be the case between rebalances. XRT is an \u201cequal weighted ETF\u201d for example that rebalances every quarter. It will sell some of the best performers and buy some of the worst performers. \nOn the other hand S&amp;P 500 is market cap weighted index. It\u2019s rebalances are more about additions/exclusions. \n\nAnyway, generally speaking, stop saying sht like \u201cBlackrock (a multi *trillion* dollar manager) bought $3 *million* dollars of this stock\u201d and stop thinking it means anything unless you want to lose all of your money.",
