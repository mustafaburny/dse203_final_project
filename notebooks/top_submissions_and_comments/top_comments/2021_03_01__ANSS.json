Besides that, Microsoft and Ansys are closely following the project.   \n\n\nSource: (you probably need to translate it through Google, but you can simply ctrl+f the above names)\n\n[https://www.ed.nl/eindhoven/tu-e-onderzoek-biedt-sportscholen-hoop-apparaten-verwijderen-aerosolen-uit-lucht\\~a0ea76e3/](https://www.ed.nl/eindhoven/tu-e-onderzoek-biedt-sportscholen-hoop-apparaten-verwijderen-aerosolen-uit-lucht~a0ea76e3/)  \n\n\nAs for sales, it's not for sale yet. People have been researching and developing this technology recently. The biggest issue is that purifiers are extremely costly and can cause more harm than good if they arent installed properly. They want to spend a lot of money on marketing to properly educate people how and where to install it, so I doubt its going to cost 45k$, probably more towards 50-60k$, but that is still a massive difference.\n\nAs for how it will end up performing on the stock market, I doubt the stock will keep rising, but I am fairly certain that it will at the very least spike once it is proven to have any positive results on covid, let alone that a lot of aging purifiers can be replaced with higher end hardware for the same cost.  \n\n\nAs for which ticker belongs to the company providing the new technology, I have no clue exactly, but according to other comments, there is vyst(for cheap play), LLC, trox, carr, jci(carr and jci might already be too late to invest), xiaomi, haier and midea(last three for china market). Not to forget the prototype companies Phillips, Trotec and Plasmamade ofcourse.",

MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC. Samsung is still in the game and SMIC is trying to catch up. But basically TSM takes the majority of the market. \n\nDisclosure: I have been holding TSM for a couple of years.

So if starting from 6.5% (again very rare for a company growing 10% top line which should say something about simply using present FCF yield to say that\u2019s the return I\u2019ll get), combining that with high growth and what I believe to be sustainable growth based on strong competitive positioning and secular megatrends, the return will be north of 6.5%.

You can get into the ratios etc of a company but those aren't always going to mean a whole lot, a low P/E doesn't mean something will be a great investment.\n\nFind a topic/sector you're interested in just read news articles, fundamental news and and events often effect price more than actual numbers. I've had a handful of +100% returns on single stocks in the past few years based of a single piece of news, below being the most notable.\n\n- Splunk (SPLK) news about changing to a subscription pricing model\n- Blackline (BL) signed deal with Salesforce for bundled selling\n- Lowes (LOW) &amp; Toll Bros.(TOL) changes in mortgage rates\n\nP/E, EBITDA, EPS are important to backup some investments but a lot of the time they don't mean shit.",

        "body": "I've been eyeing these companies prior to this dip so I'll mention my ideas about them\n\nCostco is great but seems to be valued properly for what it is. Nothing is changing for Costco, and they don't seem to want to embrace their online ordering.\n\nI haven't done my dd on Walmart but they're positioned well, maybe the market didn't like the idea of $15 wage?\n\nI just bought target at $178 so I wish I had waited a little more today but I'm still happy to hold on to them. They had a great earnings report, and I'm excited to see what bringing in Apple stores will do for them. In a time where b&amp;m are sinking they found an excellent idea to bring in even more traffic\n\nRedfin- the market hates real estate but redfin has the potential to rival zillow which is obviously trading much much higher. Personally, I like the idea they're going with of getting away from the need for a real estate agent for quite as many things. Many people are afraid that this year was literally the best anyone could do though. Low interest rates and most $ coming from refinancing that won't be there when rates continue to climb.\n\nSalesforce I haven't done enough dd on but they seem to have a decent moat, not sure why they stayed low when everything climbed yesterday",

        "body": "Welp, your DD falls on its face here.\n\nSalesforce's acquisitions aren't a result of trying to pump revenue on the bottomline, it's a combination of moving into adjacent marketspace without R&amp;D investment, and staying competitive with competing offers.\n\nYour Slack example is a perfect example.  Their valuation was $25B, and you need to pay a premium in order to acquire a company.  And the play wasn't a result of trying to get Slack's revenue or profit.  Microsoft has been pushing Dynamics *hard* as part of the O365 licensing model.  That's a direct competitor to SFDC.  And MSFT's message that their sales org is pushing is \"We hit all of your software needs with one license.\"  The biggest driver of upsales on O365 are Dynamics and Teams.  Bundling CRM and UCaaS is a gamechanger, and has been wildly successful for them.\n\nSFDC needed to be able to compete with that bundling.  So they bought the biggest competitor to Teams.  And they'll bundle it with SFDC licenses.\n\nTableau is a similar purchase.  BI is a huge play right now, and *also* a feature that MSFT is bundling with O365.  Adding Tableau into the fold allows SFDC to directly compete with MSFT on that front, too.\n\nThese aren't cookie jar acquisitions, they're competitive expansion via acquisition.",
