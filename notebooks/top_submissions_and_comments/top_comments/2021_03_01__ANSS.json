Besides that, Microsoft and Ansys are closely following the project.   \n\n\nSource: (you probably need to translate it through Google, but you can simply ctrl+f the above names)\n\n[https://www.ed.nl/eindhoven/tu-e-onderzoek-biedt-sportscholen-hoop-apparaten-verwijderen-aerosolen-uit-lucht\\~a0ea76e3/](https://www.ed.nl/eindhoven/tu-e-onderzoek-biedt-sportscholen-hoop-apparaten-verwijderen-aerosolen-uit-lucht~a0ea76e3/)  \n\n\nAs for sales, it's not for sale yet. People have been researching and developing this technology recently. The biggest issue is that purifiers are extremely costly and can cause more harm than good if they arent installed properly. They want to spend a lot of money on marketing to properly educate people how and where to install it, so I doubt its going to cost 45k$, probably more towards 50-60k$, but that is still a massive difference.\n\nAs for how it will end up performing on the stock market, I doubt the stock will keep rising, but I am fairly certain that it will at the very least spike once it is proven to have any positive results on covid, let alone that a lot of aging purifiers can be replaced with higher end hardware for the same cost.  \n\n\nAs for which ticker belongs to the company providing the new technology, I have no clue exactly, but according to other comments, there is vyst(for cheap play), LLC, trox, carr, jci(carr and jci might already be too late to invest), xiaomi, haier and midea(last three for china market). Not to forget the prototype companies Phillips, Trotec and Plasmamade ofcourse.",
