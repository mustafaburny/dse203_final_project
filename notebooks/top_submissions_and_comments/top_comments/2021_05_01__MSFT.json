        "body": "Fear of inflation is inducing a rotation out of growth. Tech (especially FAAAN/MG-ish stocks) are seeing  TREMENDOUS earnings reports and then either immediately staying flat or seeing a steep discount. AMD not only had a great quarter, but changed guidance from 37% growth for the year to 50% growth. The result? AMD is down 15% since the high on their earnings day. Same with MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, and even NVDA. PLTR is going with the market.  \n\n\nAdditionally, PLTR has no reason for price to increase right now, outside of the market/sector drop. They are significantly over-priced. I don't think the price is likely to drop down to a saner value. I think it's more likely to hold and stick around 20-30 *until the fundamentals  rise to justify the price*.  Everyone suspects they should have a pretty good quarter. That'll be good. They'll need several of those consecutively for the market to respond. Every few new big contracts and news stories, they gain another analyst adding them to their coverage. Enough really great quarters of growth (say, another year worth) and the market will start responding.  \n\n\nThose of us invested now -- and those like Cathie Woods -- are playing the hunch and taking the risk that we are recognizing the potential of the company before the rest of the market has caught on to it. While they're waiting for results to move the price, we're betting on results. We could be wrong. Probably not, but we could be.  \n\n\nAnyway, I have been calling this for weeks. Nobody -- not even the CEO -- has implied that PLTR is a short term profit play. Everyone knows you hold PLTR for the long term, if you have conviction in the company. And yet, you have all these people going \"HURR DURR PLTR TO THE MOON ON EARNINGS DAY!\" and \"HURR PLTR 50/100/150 by END OF YEAR\".  \n\n\nFor weeks, I've been saying this: ***PLTR will drop to 20 before earnings and then it will moon... back to 24 or so, where we are today***.  \n\n\nWe've done the \"reached 19/20\" part. I expect good earnings on 5/11. I no longer think we'll see a lift back to 24 or 25 on earnings, though. Not in the current senseless market. I think we'll see it trade flat after earnings or possibly very slightly higher for a day... and then all the \"HURR DURR PLTR 50 BY END OF YEAR\" people will get impatient (despite being warned since the beginning) and start selling off... leaving us back down to around  wherever we are just before the earnings report.  \n\n\nIf you don't have conviction in PLTR, don't invest. If you do, leave your position alone and relax for a few years.  \n\n\n***11% of  portfolio is PLTR at 23.98***",

People lose money when they act on emotions instead of sticking to their tested strategy.  Being retarded and just YOLOing on a good stonk and then never selling is an entirely viable strategy.  That's what I did with AAPL, MSFT, BIDU, and GOOG back in like 2008 when the market bottomed out and my basis on those stonks is so low that the market could lose 80% of it's value tomorrow and I'd still have made a profit (if that happened I'd actually just YOLO my entire emergency fund into something and keep holding).

For example, there's little doubt in my mind that VACQ (Rocket Lab), SPFR (VELO3D), and SRNG (Ginkgo) will continue to be successful companies going forward, and should provide a lot of value for shareholders. But even if you believe in the technology, if you, as an investor, are seeking to maximize your ROI, why pay a premium of 40+ times 2021 revenue to invest in companies that are in such early chapters of their lifespan? Why not invest in mature, high growth, high revenue-generating companies for the next couple of years, and *then* find an entry point for your speculative picks once the companies are in the 3rd, 4th innings of growth? \n\nA lot of SPACs that've identified innovative companies will likely be trading sideways for quite some time. We're in a bull market right now. I feel a lot of young investors have never experienced a full bear market. How sustainable will 110x 2020 revenue for Ginkgo (trading at $10) be in a bear market? Even during this last three-month downturn where speculative stocks trading at high revenue multiples got crushed, names like GOOGL have returned 15%, Microsoft 6%, and Amazon 3% - all while continuing to have their prices inflated to account for future growth.\n\nNames like Ginkgo are not going to double your ROI (110x 2020 revenue at $10 to 220x 2020 revenue) overnight, while some high growth tech or software stocks are growing at 20-25% CAGR and their ROIs are reflecting that growth.\n\nNot shitting on all SPACs...there are certainly names out there that are in the 3rd, 4th innings of their growth. Invest wisely; the money you put in speculative SPACs should be money you can afford to see cut in half over the next two years.",

        "body": "Sure, here is what I know.\n\n1. In general, buy low and sell when you retire, or get insider knowledge and learn to avoid the SEC. 5% corrections happen four times a year, 5-10% corrections happen about once a year, and 10-20% corrections happen every 18months or so. The entire world will feel like it is falling apart and the end of capitalism is near; so don't sell, just smile and push all your chips in... unless you own small caps and meme stocks, in which case you deserve to panic sell and take your losses.\n2. Your initial strategy should be buying sp500 large cap ETFs and whole market ETFs every month, and loading up on dips with your extra cash. This is most people's retirement strategy to be honest. As you get into it more and more, you might buy some calls or puts, or specific stocks you feel strongly about.\n3. You will get a feel for how low is low enough once you watch a few dips. Many of the 3-5% corrections are just because the market over reacted and is cooling off, or Yellen said something about inflation. The 10-20% moves are usually coupled to fed rate hikes, over valuation fears, real inflation, or a couple quarters of less than desirable economic data and people start to fear a recession...or a combination of these factors. Most recessions don't get below -35%, so once we get close to these numbers all chips go in. \n4. Small caps usually do best coming out of recessions, so dump into small cap etfs once the selling slows, after six months of so of recovery, shift back to large caps and blue chips. Small caps also do worse during recessions, and worse after recoveries, so don't hold them for long. Look at the green energy bag holders on this sub (ICLN) - that should be enough proof. \n5. Tech grows fast, but is dependent on fed interest rates. If rates go up, tech panic sells off. More dip buying potential for nice rebound plays.\n6. Dont fight the fed. Once the fed starts quantitative easing, the market goes up, so be invested. Once the printing stops, overvaluation and inflation fears correct the market, so be ready for a 10-20% move down. \"Be ready\" means move all your extra cash into the account, pick your stocks and ETFs, and be ready for the move up or down. \"Extra cash\" means everything other than money needed for your car payment, rent, and ramen - dump the girlfriend or boyfriend. \n7. ETFs are easiest unless you have intimate knowledge AND like to invest as a hobby. This doesn't mean only buy VOO, you can buy etfs for specific industries, but you will need to pay closer attention to the markets and move cash around as necessary.\n8. Dividend stocks suck. Dividends get smaller and smaller as the years go on. Dont do it.\n9. By the time you hear about \"it\" on CNBC, FOX, or CNN it is too late, don't jump on the band wagon. \n10. I had something about a rabbit and a turtle, and wise words to encourage mediocrity that somehow amounts to excellence over time, but clearly that is so stupid I forgot. Get as much money into the market as you can on dips when you are young. Full-on 100% everything in. The proof is in a compounding interest calculator, I recommend you play with one. Or look at the share price of MSFT and AAPL at the peak of 08, then the bottom of the recession, compared to now. Every month you set aside as much money as you possible can for investing, no matter what.\n11. Only date people who have both a 401k and a roth IRA. Employers often pay for one account so someone might sound financially responsible because \"they have a retirement account\", but they are actually fuck-wits and posers who will expect fancy diners and ruin you financially. If they ever order avocado toast, exit immediately. This goes for friends and family as well as dates. Live frugally.\n12. Money does not give you purpose. Money will not help you \"find purpose\". Purpose is something you create through hard work and dedication to something greater than yourself, and when the time comes having money will be really nice. If someone tells you \"what is the point of having money if you don't spend it?\", like the avocado toast scenario, ghost them and run away. These people will suck your account dry \"getting drinks\", or \"going out for coffee\", or \"why not get a nicer apartment, you deserve it\"... blah blah blah - POISON! Live frugally. \n13. Start with a ROTH IRA. You can withdraw from this for home purchases, so it doubles as a tax advantaged investment account as well as a way to save for a home. Being a home owner will improve the quality of your mating options too. Once you clear 6k a year in contributions (max out the IRA), open a 401k next and dump everything extra you have into that. Once you max out your roth and the 401k, then get a brokerage account and keep going.\n14. Use a real broker like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, or Fidelity. Stay away from the millennial and gen Z crap apps like Robinhood. \n\nThats about it for now.",

My favourite was one where a young girl who was no older than sixteen had somehow used her phone without registering on her devices data that she used 20 gbs of data. So I call in and say \u201clook dude, there\u2019s gotta be a mistake, she has a blackberry curve and they didn\u2019t take SIM cards so unless she switched IMEIs (something she would have to have done over the phone or online and would have left a paper trail) in the last couple weeks this didn\u2019t happen\u201d. The other guy (we have to call in to Telus office from the store) proceeds to argue with me and say he can\u2019t do anything. She basically got saddled with (I think) a $1700 phone bill and Telus wouldn\u2019t do anything despite it being obvious the mistake was theirs. We also all knew when we sold you garbage, such as the Motorola keyboard phone, the Blackberry Storm, and several other hot garbage devices that were defective as fuck.\n\nAlso, they were charged pay and talk clients to add features and minutes (.25 a minute) when they called the number, charging for things like automatic texts and honestly as a rep, I felt like it was my job in the end to protect the customer from my employer. I will say it has gotten better, and out of the three carriers, I trust Telus more than the other two.",

People need drinks and they are dominant in that market. People have always needed the demand for drinks for 100 of years. If you notice most food and beverage  companies have been around for 100 years but it's not the same for tech. Many tech companies have fallen off after a few years of growth( IBM, Motorola and many other companies)\n\u25cf If the demand for the products of a company simply reduces then the growth of thay company also reduces. This is a cycle we cannot measure and it is purely based off what the company  and its competitors can please its customers  for.\n\u25cf I agree companies will have growth for 20 years too but it's not all companies. It's only a fraction of the companies that will have growth in the next 20 years and they will get exhausted too once the company has no new products to offer which will meet the demands of its customer. The company share prices either declines or offer a good dividend to attract investors.",

Like Radio Shack, they catered too much to the hobbyist crowd, and essentially turned into a glorified RC car shop. GameStop has a chance with adding Razer, Corsair, Thermaltake, EVGA, MSI, and ASUS gear that appeals to a much wider audience. Hell, they could make themselves the best brick and mortar for liquid cooling, which is something that's sorely lacking even considering Microcenter. \n\nI don't think they should focus on stocking every component for every use case, but I think it would go a long way for them if they essentially browsed r/buildapc and kept popular products around while they're popular. Like the 011 Dynamic XL cases everyone has nowadays. A limited selection of AMD/Intel cpus + compatible, typical use case motherboards. Toss in some gamer branded ram like GSkill and a small selection of 650-850W psus, and they're a quick stop for console gamers and pc gamers alike.",

You might be right about tsla and it is definitely richly valued, but as the future moves to a greener future, I expect the tides to turn pretty quickly. I expect tsla to get a bigger piece of that pie than most. You might want to buy a Ford Mach E over a Tesla and that\u2019s fine. There will be a lot of others that think the same way. It reminds me of when LG and Motorola had their \u201ciPhone killer\u201dphones 15 years ago and I had to hear about people telling me how Apple was doomed. Same for amazon being a joke of a company bc they couldn\u2019t make a profit for a decade.",

        "body": "They won't repair it for free, and they deliberately make it harder for consumers and third-party vendors to repair it. Things like gluing the battery to the board, not allowing people to replace it using software (users will get a \"unable to verify if this a genuine battery\" error, which is straight bullshit. If you call a rep to discuss repairs, their go-to policy is to convince you to just buy a new item. \n\nThat isn't an argument against the quality of Apple products though. In general, they have pretty good build quality (although 2018 MacBooks with their butterfly keyboards would beg to differ, and unfortunately I have one of these).\n\nFurthermore, their shitty policies encourage other companies to do the same. It seems that Apple sets the bar for what is acceptable (removing headphone jack, not shipping chargers, etc), and since consumers are enamoured with their products, they accept this change. This in turn emboldens everyone else to do the same, which normally would have gotten them burnt, but since Apple normalized it they remain unscathed.\n\nAlso, your Dell/MSI laptops were probably significantly cheaper. You're paying a premium to have higher quality products, which is a fair trade. Paying a premium to own less of the physical thing you just bought (software blocks), and then defending the company that does that is just shooting yourself in the foot. It's possible to enjoy something and still be able to criticize it and expect better.",
