        "body": "Storytime\n\nThis economic data looks grim, I think to myself. This is the right move. I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.\n\nI come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&amp;P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.\n\nI hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. \"What am I-\"\n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he asks.\n\n\"Huh?\" I respond, confused.\n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he demands, louder this time.\n\n\"I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-\" WHAM! One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.\n\n\"It's priced in,\" he says coolly. \"So why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nDizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&amp;P has climbed back to 2850. Impossible, I think to myself. \"Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!\" I manage to answer. WHAM! Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.\n\n\"Repeat after me: stocks only go up,\" Powell demands.\n\nI say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&amp;P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary guh escapes my mouth as it falls agape.\n\nPowell frowns and continues, \"I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nI feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, \"GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-\" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&amp;P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.\n\nThe first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" I say.",

Since 1994 it's Value hast grown 412,7% which equals to an annual growth of 6,2%. However, growth is accelerating and in the past 10 years it has grown 126,65% which is 8,5% p.a.\n\nA Regular ETF costs around 0,12-0,3% TER, so if you deduct that you would still be at a little above 8%.\n\nSure, than come Taxes. The fucking Taxes. There are ways to reduce your payment (here in Germany for example you have 801\u20ac Tax Free every year so if you go for some dividends you can reduce Tax pay a little bit). But in General, your point with taxes is right. If you just multiply the 8,5% gain with 25% taxes you get 6,37% gain p.a.. Keep in mind though that if you dont Cash out for 20 years or so, the taxes that you haven't paid since than Keep working for you in your depot with 8,5% each year.\n\nBut taxes also come wenn you invest in rental properties though. I'm curious, how much taxes do you generally pay for a rental?",

        "body": "WDC makes long term storage, not ram. Micron sells a bit of this, but its not a huge part of their revenue. Ceo of Micron founded sandisk, sold it to WDC.  dRam is pretty much split between them, sk hynix, and samsung. There is not a shitload of competition, neither WDC or CRSR are competitors at all. Corsair is a gaming company, the memory modules in their ram is made by sk hynix. \n\nNeither will do anything with server storage or dRam for auto chips. Memory is all about supply and demand, there is no brand loyalty at all. Most of it is sold to businesses who integrate it into their products. They don't have the most sales cause samsung is larger, but that doesn't really matter. Three companies make 95% of the worlds dRam, no one else can make it at scale.",

        "body": "If you're investing in dividends for \"reliable\" income, diversification is crucial. Companies can and do cut their dividend, sometimes even when they can still afford to pay it. For example, Western Digital suspended their dividend in March 2020 to focus on reducing debt and investing back in the company, and it remains suspended even as their profits have resumed.\n\nOwning a fund like VYM and/or VIG provides significant diversification. That way during recessions you might see a 25% reduction in dividend income if things are really bad, vs if you invested in a single stock you might see a 100% reduction.",
