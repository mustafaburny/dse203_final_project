I believe Buffett sold out of them because of management concerns a few years back.\n\nDon't be a sucker for dividends, often times a high-yield masks a failing business.\n\nTake V or MA as a replacement for DFS. I'd probably include a small percentage allocated to JPM for big bank exposure, they'll turn around eventually.\n\nSHOP or AMZN are fine, frankly I'd make a whole e-commerce section for AMZN, SHOP, MELI, SE, ADBE. You'll likely thank me in a few years.\n\nDon't like ANET, would rather EQIX. I assume you mean CRWD which is definitely an option. Cloud plays: VEEV, OKTA, AYX, RNG, BAND, many others.\nYou could look at using the SKYY ETF for exposure to most of the companies in the sector instead of betting on individual small/mid-caps. There's also the WCLD etf which has seen a pretty big run-up this year.",
