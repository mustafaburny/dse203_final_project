Through the course of the day Asian futures markets open, as do India, and lots of Middle East exchanges (DFM, Kuwait, Tadawul, Tel Aviv,etc.) that trade either Sunday-Wednesday or **Thursday-Saturday**.  Then you've got all the European exchanges.  And then there's Chicago, ICE, CBOE, Nasdaq that all go US Sun-Fri.  You've also got Weekend Wall St. (among others) which is like a derivative of futures trading.  Futures can be traded for 24 hours **of two different days at the same time** most days out of the week, and there is futures trading for some number of hours everyday of the week.  Some exchange's hours are affected by US daylight savings (Australia for example.)\n\nSo to update my joke:  Futures are 25.85/6.5 baby!",

        "body": "I have some money tucked away for the Snowflake and Palantir IPOs.  No idea what the tickers are yet or potential dates, but thanks to a bunch of people on Reddit I now have google alerts set up to help me track them.\n\nSPCE - I keep a few shares in a nonretirement account because I think they are in a really good position to make commercial space travel possible and hope to use it some day.  I keep some in an roth account for swing trading - just sold for a small profit and watching for the next drop to buy back in.\n\nOther than that, I have a list of EV related stocks I'll be researching this weekend.  They've been on my watchlist for a few weeks and I'm not sure what the sudden run up is.  I'm guessing at least some of this is a by product of TSLA going up, but I won't know till I've done some research.  Here's my EV watch list:\n\nNIO - Recent approval for 10billion Yuan line of credit.  I think I might have seen some actual car news on them recently.\n\nBLINK - Charging equipment.\n\nPLUG - Hydrogen &amp; fuel cells.  \" Its fuel cell system solution is designed to replace lead-acid batteries in electric material handling vehicles and industrial trucks for some distribution and manufacturing businesses.\"\n\nSHLL - Acquisition company that will get Hymillion into the market.  From what I saw on their website, Hymillion already has EV trucks on the road.  Missed it in the $10 range.  It's coming down, but I'm waiting to see if it comes down more.\n\nAPTV - I think they are parts &amp; safety for EVs.\n\nDRIV - EV ETF.  Might be the best play for me so I can get a slice without all the tracking &amp; research of individual companies.\n\nEKAR - EV ETF.  Gotta compare the ETFs.\n\nKARS - EV ETF.  Gotta compare the ETFs.\n\nKNDI - \" Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. engages in the development, manufacture, and trade of vehicles. Its products include electric cars, tricycles, and tractors. \"\n\nNVDA - Chips.  Recent contracts.  Clearly I have some reading to do since that's all I can say.\n\nNXPI - Semiconductors\n\nTEL - \" TEL is the world's largest maker of passive electronic components (75% of sales) led by a leading share (20-25%) in connectors (50% of sales). TEL's biggest served markets have longer cycles, such as auto (30% of sales) &amp; telecom equipment (19% of sales). TEL also produces components for telecom &amp; energy networks (14% of sales) that protect/connect cabling.\"\n\nNKLA - nothing to say, just keeping an eye on it.\n\nForbidden topics because $5 rule...blah, blah, blah...  I know it's to prevent pump &amp; dumps, but these are companies I am legit interested in for investing.\n\n\"Single\" - That single seater is hideous, but they have other designs that look good.  Gotta check and see what they're up to right now.  Starting watching this at about $1.60 / share several weeks ago when they release some new shares that were costing the purchases something like $2 / share.  Considered buying then for swing trade, but had just failed on some other trades and wasn't ready to take the risk.  Now it's close to $5 / share.\n\n\"Werk Hors\" - Actually about $15 now, but I'm pretty sure I saw it banned on this sub since it crossed the threshold by a mod that called it trash.  Could've been a different sub.  In case you don't know this one - \"engages in designing and build performance battery-electric vehicles and aircraft. It develops cloud-based, real-time telematics performance monitoring systems. The firm operates in two divisions, Automotive and Aviation. The Automotive division operates as a original equipment manufacturer of class 3-6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck chassis, marketed under the Workhorse brand. The Aviation division offers delivery drones and SureFly multicopter.\"\n\n\"Cee Bat\" - Lithium batteries.\n\n\"Cee Pee Ess Tech\" - Metal components - gotta do more research to see specifically what they do to contribute to EV market.\n\n\"Eff You Vee\" - engages in the design, development, manufacture and sale of electric vehicles. It also involves in building products that catalyze the shift to transportation system.\" - Got some more research to do!",

        "body": "It's a stock with more than one catalyst. Obviously, the covid-19 Cameras is a big one. I've also sent an email from a commercial standpoint asking them about those cameras. The reply came from Magna BSP ( the own foresight). They talked about the technology and what additional symptoms it can detect, such as redness of eyes. Availability wise, they said their first target will be airports. At this point we should not be worried which airport it could be. My bet that it's either tel aviv or lax, maybe both!\n\nAnother catalyst is in the automotive sector. Right now EV stocks are wild! such as ayro, scon...etc. I do feel like people ignore or underestimate the info they gave out in their previous PRs, where they talked about distributing their technology through a multibillion dollar company. Their unique quadsight vision technology paired with FLIR thermal cameras (FLIR are their new partner) is suggested to be used for self driving vehicles. It did look like in the PR that their goal was for this technology to be sold to heavy vehicles ( commercial or military) but you definitely cannot take companies such as TESLA out of the equation.\n\nThey did drop an S-8 the other day, But it did not seem to really impact the stock negatively at all. They've done enough offerings already as well, financially they seem to be stable. A good entry point would be in the low 1.50s or in the 1.40s. They have not released a PR in a while and they are overdue for one. A big one! \n\nHope this helps!",

When it would rise in Tel Aviv, it would rise in the US.\n\nThat said if anyone is bag holding, I hope this news allows you to break even. I had a good ride with $KTOV",
