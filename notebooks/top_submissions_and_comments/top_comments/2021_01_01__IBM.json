Not only the buybacks, but there were expensive ventures by buying up large cloud companies that made no money of consequence. They actually started losing when they missed the PC train. And recently, yes they've been spending fortunes on competitive business practices while only spending enough on science to keep their products relevant... While the other guy was following the Edison model of the business of science (money obtained from the last patent funds the next invention).\n\nWho is to blame? IDK, I ain't an insider.",

        "body": "&gt; There is another contrast that comes to mind. When the going is good and new issues are readily salable, stock offerings of no quality at all make their appearance. They quickly find buyers; their prices are often bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels in relation to assets and earnings that would put IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid to shame. Wall Street takes this madness in its stride, with no overt efforts by anyone to call a halt before the inevitable collapse in prices. (The SEC can\u2019t do much more than insist on disclosure of information, about which the speculative public couldn\u2019t care less, or announce investigations and usually mild punitive actions of various sorts after the letter of the law has been clearly broken.) When many of these minuscule but grossly inflated enterprises disappear from view, or nearly so, it is all taken philosophically enough as \u201cpart of the game.\u201d Everybody swears off such inexcusable extravagances\u2014until next time.",
