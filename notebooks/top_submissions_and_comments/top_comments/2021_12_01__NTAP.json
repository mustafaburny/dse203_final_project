        "body": "I will tell you why your reasoning is flawed.\n\nNVDA was different company over the years. You've wrongly assumed they're the same company and deserve the same valuation.\n\n2013 - $4130\n\n2014 - $4681 (13% growth)\n\n2015 - $5010 (7% growth)\n\n2016 - $6910 (38% growth)\n\n2017 - $9714 (40% growth)\n\n2018 - $11716 (20% growth)\n\n2019 - $10918 (-7% growth)\n\n2020 - $16675 (53% growth)\n\n2021 - $26671 (60% growth)\n\nAs you can see they used to be a low-mid growth company with the exception of the crypto boom years which was considered a one-off benefit.\n\nHowever they've transformed into a super high growth company. \n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 13% deserve?\n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 50% deserve?\n\nTo answer that, look at how different growth rates affect a company after 5 years\n\nCompany @ 50% growth after 5 years = 7.6x revenue\n\nCompany @ 13% growth after 5 years = 1.84x revenue\n\nIf NVDA actually achieves 50% for 5 years, which I think is too high, their profits would be over 60bn which is what MSFT earns now, and they're a 2.5T company.\n\nEven at 35% growth for 5 years, they become more profitable than FB is today.\n\nInvestors seem to have trouble on assessing growth valuation. That's why the investors who just throw money at growth stocks without evaluating financials do well, because they don't shoot themselves in the leg.\n\nIf you think NVDA will grow at less than 30% avg. then you have a point. However, the consensus is closer to 40% growth.",

It isn\u2019t a matter of just designing the jet engine but then innovating and improving that design.\n\nHave you forgotten about the Space Race between USSR and NATO?\n\nCompetition between sports teams has led to amazing developments in nutritional science and how we see our bodies.  Sports medicine has also developed new techniques and dramatically reduced recovery time for injuries that used to leave people crippled. Analytics has been dragged forward by sports teams and companies looking for that edge.\n\nWhat about having a single supplier vs multiple suppliers of a critical part as we are learning now with semiconductors?\n\nThe competition between the amd and nvda and other semiconductors to surpass Intel right now is transforming the way that we can use computers to solve problems.\n\nCompetition is what causes humans to take the information in those research papers and bring them to the masses in an affordable fashion.\n\nLack of competition is how we end up with complacency and apathy in our end products(again see Intel and their being left behind)",

How much of this is baked in currently is anyone's guess.\n\n\nIf you really think it's overpriced then short or buy puts (and good luck).\n\n\nAs with everything, only invest what you can afford to lose.

I'm skeptical of the worth of any cryptocurrency, yet fully acknowledge that any fiat currency is really \"the full faith and credit of...\" so I try to compare BTC and Ethereum to euros and $, not Beanie Babies or collector plates. No need for me to be unfair.\n3. I'm interested in energy - how it's generated, and where, which includes energy companies with respect to price and environmental cost.\n\nThat said, if the underlying nature of Bitdeer isn't to assemble rigs with components from Nvidia, AMD,etc, and not to compete with those companies to make rigs more efficient for the specific task of mining, I'm left with one grave concern:\n\nIf the companies that print money, even a different money than the widely accepted one that I carry, need to raise my flavor of money to expand operations, are they hurting the case for their money? Is the end product unprofitable?\n\nIf BTC is real, wouldn't the case for crypto be bolstered by expansion funded by that currency?   If the widget factory has an economically stable business model to produce money itself, why not expand in a manner that bolsters belief in that currency? That would be a very noteworthy event - \"invest your coins in us, and we will return them X-fold\" Is that the sales pitch they offer to existing hosting customers?\n\nTexas, as TX is wont to do, won't insulate pipes or weatherproof equipment, because of a fear of regulation on principle. When TX suffers its next extreme weather event (or increasingly, its next regularly scheduled *seasonal* event, what is the PR hit if the mining operation continues? The economic one if it doesn't?\n\nNorway has abundant geothermal energy, which lets everyone feel good. In TX, the cheapest way to generate energy is oil/gas. By contrast, CA generates over half its energy via oil &amp; gas, but sells that to other western states, then repurchases it as hydroelectric and other renewable forms. That's silly windowdressing, imo.\n\nYet everyday, uncapped abandoned methane leaks from the Permean Basin fail to provide energy to 7M households. TX has 10M total. It's generally accepted to be 10% of the annual output of methane. Did Bitdeer select TX because they won't face regulation in a state that doesn't require one to cap a well they abandon?\n\nAbsent some answers, I'm left with the assumption that as an earthling, I simply have to root for this company to fail.",

        "body": "First, are you looking to exit your gains only if they drop but not cap profit to the upside?  Then protective puts are the only answer.  If you want to exit no matter what around here, there's a strategy called a collar where you sell a covered call close to the money or even at the money and use that to fund a put a little further out of the money.  It essentially creates a window of you reach max profit when the shares trade to your sold call and locks in your downside risk as well with the put.\n\nAn example:  I own 100 shares of NVDA but I think the market is going to get choppy between now and the beginning of 2022 and I want to lock in my profits and start again.  I select the January monthly expiries and want to give the stock about 5% to breathe to the downside just in case but also think this is pretty much topped for now and would be ecstatic to sell my shares between $330 and $340.  I sell a $335 call and buy a $315 put.  This results in approximately a $2.80 credit to my account and I have locked in my upside sell price and my downside crush.  NVDA could fall to $1 tomorrow and I can exit my shares at $315 with no more risk to me.  The only downside to these positions is that if NVDA gets a second wind and chugs to $400 say, then I have locked in my upside.  However, you can roll your position as well if it breaches it strongly.  This can be done for a net credit as well if done well.",

That's why the investors who just throw money at growth stocks without evaluating financials do well, because they don't shoot themselves in the leg.\n\nIf you think NVDA will grow at less than 30% avg. then you have a point.

EOD yesterday all options were roughly 6k. at noon today they were worth 17k but i didnt know that cause i didnt look. EOD theyre now less that 4500 and will most likely open less than 3k tomorrow cause i just held. The day i chose to not stare at my account is the day basically everything lines up perfectly for me to make a shit ton of money. I've never had unrealized gains like that in my life besides GME.

They can fill a gap in the GPU market for lower cost GPUs. \n\nI have a sizeable position in Intel and I have a smaller one in AMD. I will be looking at Intel's and AMD's server CPU and discrete GPU offerings next year to determine which position I will be expanding. Both look promising but Intel looks like it will offer a lot more value long term. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC you might want to open positions with all of them. Betting that the 4 of them will do well is probably a pretty safe bet. I would also look at MU, that's another position that I like right now.

Tesla is the future with EV, they have a head start over all competitors. And nvidia is innovating for the future. \n\nI\u2019m not disagreeing with what you\u2019re saying. I just like to keep my investments simple, but yeah I think emerging markets could be a good play for sure.",
