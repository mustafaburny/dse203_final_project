Tesla is a growth company. A disruptive one at that. It is disrupting industries with an enormous total addressable market (several times that of Apple's TAM, for example). Did Qualcomm do and have that?\n\nTesla is a growth company. Using P/E to value Telsla is misguided at best. You should be using discounted future cashflow (DFC).",

At what point does that start dragging sales as competitors release unique cars?
