There will be negative catalysts like Apple making its own modem(still have to pay licensing to QCOM for using 3g/4g if I am not wrong). Exynos with AMD GFX might at one point end up better than QCOM chips and low/medium end soc's are in competition against Mediatek. Still they should be around for a long time.",

Yes, they are the unquestioned leader in 5G modem and RF technology currently, and will benefit from a historic refresh cycle as all handsets become 5G-enabled (this is already underway). However, beyond that, handset units isn't a viable growth story (penetration already high) - so Qualcomm will have to depend on design wins in auto, notebook PCs etc, where their dominance is far from a sure thing. Others have already noted the potential for in-sourcing of iPhone components that could disrupt the handset moat over time.",

If you re-read my original post, I mention how post-IPO, they had $300 million in cash and no debt.\n\n&gt;I pause becuz Vizio doesn\u2019t make their own TV components and will always have an inferior product.\n\nPretty sure neither do a lot of the \"big name\" brands. Everyone buys TV OLED panels off of LG. Sony can't even put more than 2 HDMI 2.1 ports even in their top $4,000 OLED TV right now because they are having to buy the chip off of MediaTek. Just 2 quick examples.\n\n&gt;Personally I stay away from their TVs and over last 15 years go with LG (recently with Samsung, which was disappointing). \n\nLG's non-OLED TVs are complete trash. They are THE market leader in OLED though and make all the OLED panels (Sony and Vizio buy OLED panels from LG). Sony overall makes the best non-OLED TVs. Basically if you want the best high end, get an LG OLED or debatably a Sony OLED, which uses an LG OLED panel but Sony's own processor.\n\nSamsung has been churning out trash TVs for a few years now (because they know most people are too clueless to realize it and will fork over $ for Samsung brand). The exception is the top few models, all of which are really overpriced in my view vs. Sony.\n\n&gt;Are these profit margin numbers indicative of Vizio\u2019s industry in whole, or is Vizio ascending to a leading position? \n\nVizio's platform gross margins are a lot higher than Roku's. I'm not sure why yet.\n\n&gt;Curious as I\u2019d expect every smart TV to have an ad selling platform.\n\nAlmost none of the others fully control theirs. Sony licenses Google/Android TV OS. Samsung uses some Linux-based one called Tizen. LG licenses webOS from QualComm. TCL licenses Roku. Hisense licenses both Roku and Android. The final piece here is that ad selling platforms don't move the needle for massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG. Not to mention that these platforms are not mutually exclusive....will advertisers only want to reach Roku customers and just ignore the millions who own Vizio's for example? No. They want to get the furthest reach possible!\n\nLet me know if you have any other q's",

I'm a fan of semiconductor plays like , QCOM, Lam research, AMD and intel (long hold, short is hairy.) I like big tech with good earnings and decently low peg and pe multiples. Tech is presenting some good buying opportunities, but the market is rampant with companies that just simply won't make it. Stick to blues chip names that have gotten beaten up and dca into a solid position. Anything else speculative, may be comparable to catching a falling knife.\n\nApph isn't terrible and has promise. \n\nEV is solid, but very expensive for most investments right now, as most don't turn a profit. Tesla barely even turns a profit and is the first mover. To play this space, I would go with legacy automakers like Gm or ford or volkswagen, as they are on a path to integrate EVs into their lineups. \n\nOther than automakers, I would buy lithium miners like Livent or albemarle. Precious metals like palladium and rhodium related stocks may also be good buys because PGM metals are used in EV cars as well as ICE cars. \n\nRight now, industrials are good, although with the inflation narrative, stocks with pricing power are in demand. Healthcare, tobacco, oil (eh, I'm bullish, but I'm biased), food and beverage (pepsi, Coca-Cola, etc) will probably do decent under this volatility, but won't make you heaps of money either. \n\nBanks are also decent buys, I like Citi and BAC. They will do well under inflation BUT have already went on a bit of a tear so dca into a position may be smart.",

Unfortunately I left it for dead and didn't reballance into it. If you don't want to spend a lot of effort finding good companies in different areas and periodically reballancing,  just by a low cost index fund and they do it for you. \n\nAnother way is to dump your losers and let your winners run.  Ignore the price you paid for the stock,  that's the most meaningless thing and it would benefit humanity if that number was hard to find.   The important thing, is it going to go up from the price today? People sell something that still has a lot of upside just because they are up some arbitrary amount or hold something going down because they don't want to \"sell for a loss \" and instead take an even bigger loss.  Again,  if you're holding a diversified portfolio then you would sometimes sell a portion of your winners and buy your low priced losers to keep roughly the same dollar amount in each sector. Example,  I sold 2/3 of QCOM after it shot up big in February and put that money into beaten down energy and materials.  I  didn't get rid of all my QCOM,  but it was back to 1/15th of my total dollar amount.",

I doubt apple will share their Soc or design with other tech companies and they currently do not have cloud offering\u2026 google/Amazon can go to qcom but qcom is mostly strong on modem side\u2026 I doubt nvidia can close the ARM deal, but if they are successful, it will again cause a disruption and vendors would try to look elsewhere\u2026 I guess Nvidia would try to close the ecosystem and slow down the innovation in ARM. The bigger shift in DC is with TPUs and ML specific processors\u2026 nvidia would be hurt once everyone comes out with ML specific cores\u2026 I assume intel and AMD are trying something there. Google has the lead and Amazon maybe trying to copy things. Microsoft will most likely try to buy qcom/AMD/ml-hardware company\u2026 I doubt they can come up with a cpu internally. Interesting times ahead.",

        "body": "Looking at Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei on the radio side gives a hint as to what the competitive situation could become where basically incombants are challenged by a low cost option (in this example Huawei) that is also very technically competitive.\n\nThat said currently Qualcomm is very dominant..I think non technical people overstate the potential there competition has in the short term. Like they forget Qualcomm has had years and years working in the standards bodies steering the direction of LTE and 5G to be to its liking and not faced the competition Ericsson for example has always faced from Nokia. Qualcomm is deeply entrenched.\n\nAnd you should remember that it's a US company. The US banned Huawei and there is not a top US radio vendor benefitting from that the way Ericsson Nokia and Samsung do. The US will go far to protect Qualcomm from competition from outside the US. The security concerns are similar as on the radio side.\n\nBearish ideas:\n\n*It's not sexy to regular consumers. Maybe the valuation is just 'good' and the rest of the market is crazy right now with TLSA, AAPL and Bitcoin making everything consumer facing crazy with dumb money flooding the market. Maybe it's just what it should be.\n\n*5g may not be as revolutionary as Qualcomm and radio vendors want it to be. It has its own technical challenges that must be overcome for some of the great benefits to be realized so those features can be enabled. How that rolls out is work in progress.\n\n*Longer term I would be looking at the satalite radio communications/internet as possible disruptors.",

        "body": "Renewable Energy (excluding nuclear)\n\nAs stated before me, renewables are more than likely to be the future of energy. The reason I think investing here is safer than any tech or space company is the capital needed to participate and the time it takes to acquire/build wine and solar plants.\n\nAs recently seen at Qualcomm and before that on many other occasions, tech stocks as well as crypto are extremely vulnerable to disruption. One malfunction, one competitor with a better code or a single security breach can ruin companies for ever. And competition is only getting steeper with almost anybody with a PC able to try to compete.\n\nOpposed to that, renewable energy is a necessity for long term sustained life in earth. Wind and solar plants are extrmly expensive to build and in most of the world you need a government permit to build them. This narrows down the companies likely to succeed substantially. Furthermore, once a plant is installed and the debt you took on to build it is paid off, it's pretty much free money on a great margin.\n\nSo yeah, probably not anymore the fastest growing industry out there, but one with stable cash flows, a good dividend and a great outlook for about as far as we can try to foresee the future.",
