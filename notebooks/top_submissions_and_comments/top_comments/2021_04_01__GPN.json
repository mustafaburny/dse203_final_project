Just doing shallow dive. Anyway, I came across American Express. It runs its own payments network and issues credit cards. In my mind Amex is this credit card for rich people that is not accepted anywhere except in fancy places so I thought meh, boring. Well it turns out Amex is like Apple of credit cards. It has big population of millennials who love the prestige of Amex. There is this whole thing about what color is your card and there are rare colors and you get attention with those and then there is black Amex card that is like epic rare. Then there is whole community about gaming Amex points and such. And I know that gaming credit card bonuses is nothing new and people been doing it for ages but with Amex it's not just that. There is genuine community of young people who enjoy prestige of using Amex. And its not just people shit posting. I watched this news video with Cramer where he said that 50% or so new Amex card owners are millennials. Anyway, maybe its not news for anyone else but it was to me. I had wrong perception it seems. In any case Amex is a decent company too but a bit expensive right now. I'll put it on my shopping list and might get some when it goes lower.",

        "body": "I'm focusing on all of tech, but primarily companies I know. Even if Powell raises federal interest rates early and we have another setback, which he has said over and over he won't so I believe him, interest rates are going to be very low for a few years. \n\nFirst let me summarized why I believed the cycle was already on the verge of turning back to tech, posted earlier in the week in an Ark thread.\n\nDisclaimer, assume I have a position on every stock in this topic, even the retails.\n\nApple and Amazon started falling from their ATH quite awhile ago actually, before the rest of the tech correction. They bottomed out around 118 and 3000, both dipping below those marks even but not for long. Then they started to show resistance and basically trade sideways around 120 and 3050 while the rest of tech continued to sink, and finally early this week they were even rising and beating the market. This all showed a bottom out to me.\n\nDisney was my reopening stock, crushing it and breaking ATH. The news and this sub was all about DIS and other reopenings/retail/cyclicals. But then they started to fall back on positive earnings. They got a one hour bump from positive park news, the next time they got zero bump from positive park news, and they fell a good 10% from their ATH.\n\nBy the time Roku hit 300, Etsy below 200, SQ at 200, it was time to put all money possible in. Even if they keep going down, at that point I don't believe they can go too much farther, as they were at their prices from last Fall, much like Apple and Amazon had bottomed out there. These stocks are going to fall to summer prices while TGT soars indefinitely past its ATH high?  Fine I'll keep buying down, but I don't think so. Now we have lulu being shorted as soon as they beat earnings and there's nothing but positive news, the same thing that was happening to the companies like Apple a couple months ago.\n\nThe bond yields should climb some more and stabilize closer to 2, maybe even in the near future, so there might be some more choppiness ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even that bad and we already got most of that priced in though.\n\nFAANG of course is recommended, although I did think it was interesting Biden called out Amazon twice in the infrastructure speech and there may be bipartisan agreement against some of these companies. It's not like I see any major problems here, but I think their cash reserves will matter more in a year or so, so they're just buy as you can per usual.\n\nMy favorites are the household names or dependable tech stocks that are still way below their ATHs. I'm deep and long on Roku, just search the sub for the excellent DD about Roku if you don't really know what they're about. Their industry is mid-game, so room to grow, but also at a point where Roku has spent the money to secure their position, with an agreement with every major streaming service, pretty much every non-first or discount tier smart TV brand, and now their own advertisement company which is where their money flow will come, as they both help the streaming services make money while getting a cut. They crushed earnings and gave a better than expected outlook but fell $180, all I could post was to buy at point. They are not a gimmick, they are over 70% institutionally owned.\n\nSquare, PayPal, Zoom, Tesla, Etsy, Pinterest, pick your poison, there's more than I can think off the top of my head. I'm picking as many of these household tech stocks that have been around for years and will be around for years to come. I don't see a reason to get safer investments while these stocks are 50-75% from ATHs if you can ride it out long enough for them to climb again. I'll even throw out an Uber mention despite their bump in UK, because this is a household name product.  I hate apps, but I'm not deleting by Uber app anytime soon. Longevity and % of dip is what I'm focused on when it comes to taking on perceived risk.\n\nThen you can look at stocks I don't even like such as LMND and FSLY. Fastly is still almost 50% from its ATH, sure I'll take a small position there. A short time of rising with the rest of the market and one positive news story and they'll be back to at least $85 or $90, surely.\n\nPeople are over the semiconductor shortage by now after MU yesterday, right? Surely semiconductors, ev charging, clean energy, uranium, etc has room to climb even if they can't boom as fast as they did previously? \n\nSoftware companies? Sure. HPE was unaffected lately.check that chart. I guess it's because they pay dividends, all I know is they're working on every futuristic cloud and software idea. I won't even talk someone out of PLTR, we know it's going to continue being pumped daily on Reddit lol, but it's also by far the lowest Institutionally owned stock in this post I'm sure. MDB should be a good one again although it already got 8.5% since Thursday opening,it's 75% from its ATH and the company is going to be around for awhile.\n\nI don't know your companies, and I like to focus on what I know, but I will look into them too. I don't think this tech storm lasts too much longer, and regardless of how long it lasts I'm riding it out if I believe the company will be a well known name five years down the road.\n\nHappy day off everyone, hopefully the next quarter is good to you all. Just get SPY or something if you want to safely grow your money, I think that route will be very good to you this year and beyond as well.",

Great question.  Maybe the better question is why did I keep those 3?  \n\nThe answer is because I still see great share price growth value ahead of both EPR and MO though for different reasons and the SMHB yield (based on pre covid historicals) could yield as high as 72% based on my purchase price.  Though I only collected 10.14% in 2020 and 6.82% so far in 2021.  EPR has yet to reinstate its dividend and I fully expect that when they do, their share price will see a large upward move.  And MO?  Well... it is my opinion that Altria is uniquely positioned to be the largest player in the budding legalized marijuana industry in the USA.  So obviously I will hold that until such a time when that new industry can be realized and profited from and pocket a 9.54% yield (2020 actual) in the meantime.\n\nBut the reality is, I didn't buy some of the best dividend paying companies at the 2020 bottom because I wanted the dividend.  In fact... dividend investing is mostly a waste of time unless you plan on buying and forgetting... in which case... it still is since you'd be better off in an index fund.",

Take that as you will.\n\nThere is nothing stopping Intel and AMD from producing ARM chips except for themselves. They already have the licenses and will begin developing when ARM is past its infancy in the data center world. Let deeper pockets be the pioneers, let all the software transitions happen (x86 software is not compatible with ARM), then poach their engineers. Intel and AMD are sitting back and letting AWS and Apple try their hand at ARM on purpose.\n\nIBM thrived on providing services that were being phased out. x86 isn't going to be phased out this decade and Intel will begin ARM chip production for clients in 3 years. IBM is dying, Intel is 3 years away from the start of unrivaled growth and has potential to eventually surpass TSMC as the industry leader in chip production thanks to the gov/mil backing within 20 years.\n\nIf you're looking for big gains in the next 2-6 years Intel is probably not the stock for you. It's at a 13 P/E ratio because people perceive it like IBM which is fine with me, I'll keep adding.\n\nNo clue what TSMC will plan to do after 3nm to prevent stagnation. For now they are the leader but physics doesn't let you go smaller than 3nm, possibly 2nm. At 3 times less earnings per dollar than Intel and lacking vertical integration... I'll happily put my dollars to work in Intel.",

        "body": "As a disclaimer, I do own a Bitcoin ETF in both my TFSA as well as my RRSP in addition to the real thing. Now, here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC or BTCC because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. These products are not insured and same goes with the newly released ETF called BTCC. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

It will be zero hit to their bottom line.  Pure $100m of grade a cheddar cheese with which we can smother some glorious tendies.  And as we munch down on those deep fried birds, consider this:\n\nIf you were Pfizer, why would you pay $100m per year for something when you could just buy the whole dang thing and only owe yourself $100m per year?\n\nPeople think GME was a squeeze but this has heavy short interest, an insider with tons of shares who could quickly use them in diamond hand fashion when big daddy Pfizer comes in to clear a debt off the books of 100m per year through a buyout attempt, and holds the keys to some effective covid services.  And hint hint, covid isn\u2019t going away, it\u2019s the new flu.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s say Pfizer buys them out, gives frosty a boatload of Pfizer shares (they pay dividends so he can retire and still earn millions) and pays a handsome sum to all of us retailers for our shares.  Frost has already said he won\u2019t sell unless he rescues those who bought during high offerings which means he would be looking at $18-20 per share price point.  \n\nEither scenario gets investors 300-400% gains.\n\nI do live in fantasy land so not financial advice.",

That's the one people talk about as being vulnerable to quantum computers down the line.  The real dangers of crypto institutionally is with reusing account addresses.  It's a pretty sloppy, yet common, practice of reusing addresses (you print one qr code, receive deposits to it, then withdraw from that account as needed, or a company has a deposit account that is linked to you, but you withdraw every now and then).  Using a crypto address multiple times is a major vulnerability.\n\nOf course, if Elliptical Curve gets cracked through raw computing power, every single thing done on the Internet will be an open book, so BTC will probably be the least of our worries, as the entire banking system becomes a low lying fruit bush of passwords, account info and free money.",

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

TSM, Samsung and INTC have near-term headwinds in terms of earnings based on semiconductor demand simply because it takes so long to expand capacity. The front-end winners in current semi production efforts are going to be those who supply the tools, products and services that go into these fabs that are planned for construction: AMAT, ASML, TER, LRCX, to name a few. Secondary effects on earnings from this will come 1-2-3 years down the line for the semi manufacturers themselves, depending on whether or not they are expanding/upgrading an existing facility, or building one from the ground up.\n\nThe end-users of these semiconductor products (GM, F, NVDA, AMD, etc.) will be the last ones to benefit from expanded chipmaking capacity, as easing the demand crunch allows them to resume normal sales levels. Note that for auto mfrs, this has a ripple effect on rental car companies, who sold all of their fleets in fire sales last year and now can't replace them because the auto mfrs can't make cars.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is booked up for the foreseeable future; these bookings have prices agreed well in advance, and are almost certainly not subject to TSMC's recent statements that they plan to increase prices; that will happen with new bookings down the line.",

        "body": "Your analysis is probably true for delta, but the problem with playing those names using vol is that the IV is higher. Options trading is most useful when you get the gamma cheap while also calling the direction right.\n\nI'm buying INTC 23Apr 70c because resistance at 65 has kept IV muted. My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr. I hate talking in terms of resistance in general, but looking at the long-term chart as well as price action in the morning after the Intel Unleashed event, it certainly seems like you'd need a big catalyst to justify a breakout beyond 65. I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",

        "body": " TL:DR - looking for feedback on a simple hi return stock screen and thoughts on how to rank results.\n\nEarly 60's, simple, diversified, buy and hold retirement portfolio approach my whole life. Looking at working probably another 5-10 years and starting to get a lot more active in my portfolio. Nothing crazy and I'm fundamentally a conservative+ investor, but I do not subscribe to moving 100% into ultra safe right before retirement. Portfolio size is low 7 figure for reference.\n\nOver the past few months I subscribed to a couple of authors on Seeking Alpha and have tried out a few strategies with minimal exposure and have a good idea of how to use some of the approaches in my portfolio. I want to develop my own screens because at least on Seeking Alpha, the authors I've found charge a small monthly fee for their updates. It's nothing huge, and for me at least has been worth seeing their approaches, but nothing I want to pay for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm going to put together a dividend screen/strategy and a \"better than cash\" parking lot strategy. Pretty basic and straightforward. I also just got started on putting together a screen to identify a more hi growth strategy - thought being on a monthly basis invest in the top 4 stocks that fall out of the screen. Would love some feedback on the screen (I'm stock knowledgeable, but certainly not an expert). When looking at the screen and giving feedback keep in mind my objective: not looking for the perfect approach or for mega returns, I'm an 80/20 kinda guy so looking for a decent, simple to execute strategy to reliably give back a growth-class return. (And using the Fidelity screener as that's where my portfolio is).\n\nScreen as it stand currently:\n\n* Tagging Energy, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Industrials sectors\n* Market cap down to Medium (as defined by Fidelity: 6-33B)\n* 13 week price performance down to 13%\n* 3 yr annualized Beta of 1.1 and up (conflicted on whether this really helps the screen)\n* Very Bullish or Bullish analyst recommendations (Summary score from StarMine)\n* Forward EPS 3-5 yrs high to very high (16.5% and up)\n* EPS growth Projected year versus last year high to very high (40% and up)\n\nAs an example, running that screen today resulted in a list of 7 stocks (sorry not allowed to link image or would give you a shot of the fundamentals):\n\n1. AMAT - Applied materials\n2. FANG - Diamondback Energy\n3. EOG - EOG Resources\n4. NXPI - NXP SemiConductor\n5. KKR - KKR &amp; Co\n6. LRCX - LAM Research Corp\n7. MU - Micron Technology\n\nSo the thought would be to run this first day of every month and put a set amount in the top 4 stocks in the filter. I would guess some stocks might stay in for months, some might rotate in and out quickly.\n\nMy question is basically around how to rank. So do I just pick a screening metric (or some other metric) and do a simple rank on that metric to determine top 4, or do I create a formula to weight and aggregate multiple metrics into an overall score and rank on that?\n\nSorry for the long post - thank you to those who stuck with it and are willing to share your thoughts.",

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

        "body": "I work in the semi industry and I've been in and out of AMAT positions the past couple of months. TSM, Samsung and INTC have near-term headwinds in terms of earnings based on semiconductor demand simply because it takes so long to expand capacity. The front-end winners in current semi production efforts are going to be those who supply the tools, products and services that go into these fabs that are planned for construction: AMAT, ASML, TER, LRCX, to name a few. Secondary effects on earnings from this will come 1-2-3 years down the line for the semi manufacturers themselves, depending on whether or not they are expanding/upgrading an existing facility, or building one from the ground up.\n\nThe end-users of these semiconductor products (GM, F, NVDA, AMD, etc.) will be the last ones to benefit from expanded chipmaking capacity, as easing the demand crunch allows them to resume normal sales levels. Note that for auto mfrs, this has a ripple effect on rental car companies, who sold all of their fleets in fire sales last year and now can't replace them because the auto mfrs can't make cars.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is booked up for the foreseeable future; these bookings have prices agreed well in advance, and are almost certainly not subject to TSMC's recent statements that they plan to increase prices; that will happen with new bookings down the line.",

        "body": "Your analysis is probably true for delta, but the problem with playing those names using vol is that the IV is higher. Options trading is most useful when you get the gamma cheap while also calling the direction right.\n\nI'm buying INTC 23Apr 70c because resistance at 65 has kept IV muted. My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr. I hate talking in terms of resistance in general, but looking at the long-term chart as well as price action in the morning after the Intel Unleashed event, it certainly seems like you'd need a big catalyst to justify a breakout beyond 65. I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",
