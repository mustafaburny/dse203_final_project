If there is a reopening of commercial business spaces then I expect HPQ to also benefit from printing demand.  I am in NYC and there is not really any talk of reopening commercial offices yet because of the sheer logistical difficulties in staging empty elevators - when you have 50-100 story buildings it is almost impossible to get 1 person per elevator car.  Companies have gotten around this by staging staggered shifts of employees although that is as you can imagine not very popular.  Of course NYC is not the rest of the country nor the world so things can be very different.  \n\nGoing back to low volatility stocks what kind of criteria do you look for and what screeners?

I know they've done industrial floorings in food processing plants that can stand up to all the cleaning that's needed.  And roofs on buildings to keep rain water out.\n\nBear feelings:  Will more people want to have flooring that can be cleaned like mad after this pandemic?  Probably.  But idk how many will be able to afford it and i don't think too many new buildings will be made in the near future that will need it.  Bull feelings: the world is melting, weather getting bad, they make some mean water proofing membranes.  I'm out currently, but will gladly buy back in if price drops below ~65 and long outlook looks decent.\n\nAs for other companies, many see packaging seeing a bigger demand after all this super bug.  So chemical companies and material companies like Eastman and polyone and others that make the chemicals/resins for packaging looks decent.  But if the recession is bad, demand will fall anyways so who knows.\n\nSame more or less is true about axalta.  Bad recession means not many buyers of powder coating.  Only good thing is EU pushing hard for solid coatings to reduce volitiles and the us might follow.  China doesn't give two shits, but demand worldwide has been rising.  I'm in it for the long haul\n\nI want HPQ to get their shit together.  They have 3d printing segments (inks~polymers), and a huge clothing printing division they've been working on that'll make screen presses go bye bye ish.  Think of newspaper printing press but for t shirts that can shoot out all sorts of stuff.  Only problem is who's going to want that if demand for customizable or mass produced clothing prints plummits.  I bought it when they got beat down after earnings.  \n\nBut yeah innovative plastic companies still seem strong.  And paint/coating companies won't go away even if plastic uses fall.  Basically everything you touch has a coating on it and it's why I like the area.",

        "body": "Options are contracts.  They are not stocks, they are a contract stating that the holder has the right (the choice, or the *option*) to purchase/sell 100 shares of a specific stock at a specific price on a specific date.  Calls are for purchasing 100 shares on a later date, puts are for selling 100 shares on a later date.\n\nLet's say a stock, we'll call them AAAA for simplicity, is at $100 today.  If you were to buy 10 shares of this company, that would cost you $1000.  You would own 10 shares of that company for $1000 though.  If you instead buy options, you would likely be able to get a couple options instead for the same price.  Let's say that a $100 call on AAAA for next friday costs $5 per share, or $500 per contract.  For that same $1000, you could have 2 calls on AAAA.\n\nIn both scenarios, you're looking for the value of the stock to go up obviously.  If you have 10 shares and AAAA goes up one dollar, you gained 10 dollars.  If you have 2 calls (which is 200 shares worth of an option) and AAAA goes up by a dollar, those calls increase in value as well, although not quite as much, we'll say it increases by $0.50 per share.  That's still a lot.  Instead of making $10 from your $1000 investment, you made $100 instead.  It's not quite that simple though.\n\nCalls (and puts) have an expiration date.  If the call is expiring on the 12th (next Friday), then the value of the stock needs to be decently close or above the value stated in the contract, or the \"strike price\".  In our $100 AAAA calls, if the stock goes below $100 (especially on the Thursday), the value of the call will plummet.  And remember, since these are just contracts, you don't actually own anything with the money you spent.\n\nSince you also spent $5 per share in order to get the call, the value of AAAA needs to not only be above $100 on the 12th to be redeemed (nobody should ever execute a right to buy at a higher than market price, obviously, you'd just be throwing away money for no reason) but it needs to be above $105 in order to make a profit.  You had already paid $5 per share for the right to buy those shares later at $100 per share.\n\nNext, and here's what many people do in order to make their profit instead, *you do not have to hold your contracts.*  If you buy a call on Monday, you don't have to wait until it expires on Friday to make money.  If AAAA jumps to $120 on Tuesday, you could sell your 2 calls for likely $23-$24 per share.  That would turn a $1000 investment into $4600.  What a hell of a gain, right?  If you just had 10 shares, you'd have only made $200 on a 20% stock jump when people who are options trading just made a $3600 or a 460% return.\n\nLastly, the reason that so many people avoid them.  *Options can expire* ***worthless***.  If the stock drops to $95 on Tuesday, those calls are suddenly only $2 per share, you just lost $600.  If it drops again to $90 on Wednesday, those calls are suddenly less than $1 per share, you're at an $800+ loss.  If you had 10 shares, you'd have only lost $100.  On Friday if you still have those calls, if AAAA never hits $100, your calls will expire and you'll have lost the full $1000 investment with absolutely nothing to show for it.  That money is gone for good, no amount of wishful thinking is going to make it come back to you.\n\nPuts are the opposite of calls in a way, they're the right to sell 100 shares at a certain price.  You get a put when you believe the value of the stock is going to drop.  Let's say you have a $100 put on AAAA and the stock drops to $80 on Friday.  On Friday, you would purchase 100 shares of AAAA at market value ($80, or $8000 worth) and then immediately sell it to whoever wrote the contract for $100 per share, or $10000.  That's quite a profit right there too, you made money when a stock decreased in value.  You can't really do that with standard stock trading.  Puts do still come with the same risk as calls in the fact that they too can expire worthless if the value of the stock is above the strike price.  If you have a $100 put on AAAA and the value on Friday is $105, it would be absolutely stupid to purchase 100 shares at $105 to sell them immediately for $100.  Remember, these contracts give you the *option* to buy/sell at a certain price, it doesn't mean that you have to when they expire.\n\nI hope that helps!  If you've got more questions, I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.",

This can be FOMO in anticipation or FOMO in reflection. In both cases, you feel a negative emotional reaction to missing or potentially missing a big move.\n\nAs you know, negative emotions are very bad as a trader and can limit your Trading Vision - preventing you from seeing a much clearer move that fits within your own defined strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"missing out\" in the stock market. There are infinite opportunities presented to you every single second. So focus on that. Focus on the stream of infinite opportunities and how you can interpret and decipher this data stream to pluck out trades within your own strategy boundaries.\n\nStick to your rules, manage your emotions, and focus on what is right in front of you.\n\n**I'd love to hear some thoughts from other traders who very recently learned this lesson.

        "body": "&gt; I shorted the market when Apple initially reported supply chain problems back in early February and turned 15k into 130k\n\nHah, I did exactly the same thing. Turned 5k into 100k in an old brokerage account through Apple puts at the start of the crash. Once South Korea and Samsung facilities got hit with COVID I figured there would be (warranted) doomsday predictions about tech supply chains that would hit AAPL.\n\nI did end up catching the bottom though in another account. SABR @ 3, CPRI @ 6, LEAPS on VTR @ 15. Those were the core buys when the market was at peak liquidation. That account was managed into a more balanced COVID-recovery portfolio. Still very heavy on SABR and CPRI.\n\nHere are some of the current holdings: https://i.imgur.com/IAiV8gp.png. It's admittedly an absolute mess because it's all locked in a brokerage account that none of this should have taken place in. The market was literally down 10% and my main trading account was in a hilariously bad margin call while I was on the phone with someone asking \"is the world ending\", so the set of buys at market bottom were extremely haphazard and chaotic. Meanwhile, tech is my wheelhouse yet I happened to be about to pull the trigger on luxury clothing (which I know *absolutely* nothing about) because it's apparently trading at half of its bankruptcy value and buys needed to happen within a window of the next few minutes as the -10% market was turning. Just an absurd day. Things may have literally been on fire as far as my memory serves. Soon it will be in an IB portfolio margin account with proper management tools though.\n\nSo the path has been: Set of random equities and options from the SPY 2200 market bottom -&gt; Scaling out of those positions and buying Quality/Tech (asml, lrcx, nok, sbux, oled , chl were the buys in the weeks after the bottom) -&gt; Value COVID recovery/\"return to normalcy\" stocks (brk, bx, banks, txrh, cxw, vwagy, dfs, banks). There's also been some side ventures in there like buying CLMT and XOM during the negative oil event, and those won't be held long term.\n\nLots of options not showing there as well. Collars on positions, covered calls, 200k short nasdaq hedge. Basically locking in the profits and marching towards neutral until the positions can move over to the PM margin account and it can turn into something actually sane.\n\nA lot of that stuff is probably going to be gone by next friday and sold into the rotation. dfs up 10% today, sabr up 12%, txrh up 8%, Well +7%, VTR +10%, CXW +6%... Today was the exact day that that list of stocks was positioned for. There was a 4 sigma move into value a few weeks ago that I took to be a canary in the coal mine for the rotation. Looked like a quake from quant funds moving factors around. Not sure what's next. It's probably time to focus on the insane quarterly reports we're about to get, and start actually paying attention to the real economy and things like the +600 unemployment checks rolling off and the unemployment trajectory. Maybe just step out of the way until that all picks trends.\n\nThere are still many laggards to pick out but they by and large have debt loads that carry a very real bankruptcy risk, and some extreme exposure to COVID and lockdowns (restaurants, entertainment, companies like SABR that provide the back-end for flight booking). So they come with a bundle of esoteric and disastrous tail risks, but honestly, some of the common risk exposures like consumer credit risk, commercial real estate, etc aren't rocket science to hedge against. Most of this stuff is not something I'd want to leave alone without watching charts for even a day though, even in a decently hedged portfolio.",
