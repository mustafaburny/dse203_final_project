        "body": "&gt; I made a lot of mistakes, but I made one real doozy. So, this is kind of a funny story, at least it is 15 years later because the pain has subsided a little. But in 1999 after Yahoo and America Online had already gone up like tenfold, I got the bright idea at Soros to short internet stocks. And I put 200 million in them in about February and by mid-March the 200 million short I had, lost $600 million on, gotten completely beat up and was down like 15 percent on the year. And I was very proud of the fact that I never had a down year, and I thought well, I\u2019m finished.\n\n&gt; So, the next thing that happens is I can\u2019t remember whether I went to Silicon Valley or I talked to some 22-year-old with Asperger\u2019s. But whoever it was, they convinced me about this new tech boom that was going to take place. So I went and hired a couple of gunslingers because we only knew about IBM and Hewlett-Packard. I needed Veritas and Verisign. I wanted the six. So, we hired this guy and we end up on the year \u2014 we had been down 15 and we ended up like 35 percent on the year. And the Nasdaq\u2019s gone up 400 percent.\n\n&gt; So, I\u2019ll never forget it. January of 2000 I go into Soros\u2019s office and I say I\u2019m selling all the tech stocks, selling everything. This is crazy\u2026at 104 times earnings. This is nuts. Just kind of as I explained earlier, we\u2019re going to step aside, wait for the next fat pitch. I didn\u2019t fire the two gunslingers. They didn\u2019t have enough money to really hurt the fund, but they started making 3 percent a day and I\u2019m out. It is driving me nuts. I mean their little account is like up 50 percent on the year. I think Quantum was up seven. It\u2019s just sitting there.\n\n&gt; So like around March I could feel it coming. I just \u2014 I had to play. I couldn\u2019t help myself. And three times the same week I pick up a \u2014 don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it. Anyway, I pick up the phone finally. I think I missed the top by an hour. I bought $6 billion worth of tech stocks, and in six weeks I had left Soros and I had lost $3 billion in that one play. You asked me what I learned. I didn\u2019t learn anything. I already knew that I wasn\u2019t supposed to do that. I was just an emotional basket case and couldn\u2019t help myself. So, maybe I learned not to do it again, but I already knew that.\n\n- Stan Druckenmiller\n\nStay bear my brother",

If there is a reopening of commercial business spaces then I expect HPQ to also benefit from printing demand.  I am in NYC and there is not really any talk of reopening commercial offices yet because of the sheer logistical difficulties in staging empty elevators - when you have 50-100 story buildings it is almost impossible to get 1 person per elevator car.  Companies have gotten around this by staging staggered shifts of employees although that is as you can imagine not very popular.  Of course NYC is not the rest of the country nor the world so things can be very different.  \n\nGoing back to low volatility stocks what kind of criteria do you look for and what screeners?

I know they've done industrial floorings in food processing plants that can stand up to all the cleaning that's needed.  And roofs on buildings to keep rain water out.\n\nBear feelings:  Will more people want to have flooring that can be cleaned like mad after this pandemic?  Probably.  But idk how many will be able to afford it and i don't think too many new buildings will be made in the near future that will need it.  Bull feelings: the world is melting, weather getting bad, they make some mean water proofing membranes.  I'm out currently, but will gladly buy back in if price drops below ~65 and long outlook looks decent.\n\nAs for other companies, many see packaging seeing a bigger demand after all this super bug.  So chemical companies and material companies like Eastman and polyone and others that make the chemicals/resins for packaging looks decent.  But if the recession is bad, demand will fall anyways so who knows.\n\nSame more or less is true about axalta.  Bad recession means not many buyers of powder coating.  Only good thing is EU pushing hard for solid coatings to reduce volitiles and the us might follow.  China doesn't give two shits, but demand worldwide has been rising.  I'm in it for the long haul\n\nI want HPQ to get their shit together.  They have 3d printing segments (inks~polymers), and a huge clothing printing division they've been working on that'll make screen presses go bye bye ish.  Think of newspaper printing press but for t shirts that can shoot out all sorts of stuff.  Only problem is who's going to want that if demand for customizable or mass produced clothing prints plummits.  I bought it when they got beat down after earnings.  \n\nBut yeah innovative plastic companies still seem strong.  And paint/coating companies won't go away even if plastic uses fall.  Basically everything you touch has a coating on it and it's why I like the area.",
