Large number of cloud providers won\u2019t be able to design their own devices and ARM will never be 100% of the server market unlike the smartphone market. AMD is also well diversified into console gaming and IP licensing areas. See for example Samsung\u2019s device using Vega. \n\nRegarding mining, I don\u2019t think this is significantly material to AMD from downside risk since a bulk of the GPU business is in actual graphics use. This includes high end PC gaming, console gaming and yes also perhaps mobile gaming if Samsung\u2019s plan comes to fruition. \n\nSo overall risks to AMD are just the usual competitive pressures but given that the overall markets they are playing in continue to increase in size, as long as they execute they should be fine. \n\nHaving worked in the chip industry for 25+ years there is not a whole lot of reasons not to buy into semiconductors. Semiconductor content in our lives continue to increase and while the players might change the overall industry is going to be growing and valuable over time. Just look at TI or STM or even INTC who have been around for 50 years and still going strong.\n\nJust don\u2019t bet more than you can afford to lose. AMD and others for that matter have struggled in the past on execution and so the stock might trade sideways or even down for a long time. \n\nBut Dr Su has built a solid team now and hopefully these issues are in the past and won\u2019t repeat again.",

AMDs market share gains have slowed down due to shortages, they're selling every chip they can make.\n\nWhen supply catches up to demand (which isn't happening for another year at least), their sheets will still look great because they'll start chipping away at Intel and Nvidias market share. With the Xilinx merger they'll become the largest customer at TSMC. As they start transitioning to 5 nm, they'll be able to allocate 7nm to lower margin GPU products, a segment which is currently neglected due to shortages, both by Nvidia and AMD.\n\nBesides that, they just announced a $4b share buyback. AMD have never had this kind of free cash before. This is going to prevent any sub $70 targets, unless there's a very sudden macro cause, and even then they'll eat it up because they want to buy the shares at a decent price. The reason they're doing share buybacks and not investing in the company? They have no factories, so they don't need capital to increase production levels. They've already effectively maxed out on R&amp;D, and as Intel have proven over the last 4 years, you can't throw extra money at semiconductor R&amp;D to get better results.\n\nTheir product roadmap for the next 5 years is amazing and they have a proven track record of delivering.\n\nThey said themselves that their gpu lineup should get another 50%+ per/watt improvement next gen, and leakers who have been pretty reliable previously are pointing to much higher numbers.\n\nIn the CPU space, Intel's next two generations are no threat whatsoever, and AMDs iterative design approach means consistent gains in performance and power consumption every year. Intel's 10nm laptop CPUs can increase their performance by 10% for a 50% power consumption tradeoff. It proves how bad the state of their foundries really is.\n\nThe Xilinx merger is a big brain play if it goes through, which it should. It gives them the FPGAs necessary to chip away at Nvidias monopoly on machine learning. Xilinx already easily outperforms Nvidia here, but Nvidia has an ecosystem that needs to be broken. As we move towards smaller processing nodes, transistor size reductions will no longer be the way to get better performance. A mix of FPGAs, ASICs, and general compute units is the future. That's what AMD have recognised and why they're building an arsenal of integrated CPU and GPU products now. They're building the experience required to meet the demands of the future.\n\nI don't have much money so I've got 265 shares via CFDs on 5x leverage. Assuming the Xilinx merger is successful, $100-130 EOY is easily manageable imo. It will likely take a hit after the merger as Xilinx owners sell their converted shares, but that's to be expected. With the guidance AMD have for this year it's also plausible they may increase the buyback program depending on demand/shortages, which could alleviate Xilinx sellers.",

        "body": "Dude, that shows how little you know about $BB. They haven't been making phones for years. If you are going to say company is worth dick because they have outdated phones, have the decency to do some research first.\n\nI'll just point out a few of the reasons:\n\nQNX: the most secure and #1 automotive embedded OS used in over 175MM vehicles today, medical systems, droids and many other connected devices. Automakers using QNX: GM, Hyundai, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, Chrysler, Porsche, Skoda, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Bentley, Holden, Land Rover, BMW, Mini, Honda, Acura, Nissan, Ford, Mercedes, Saab ,Xpeng, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Toyota, Jeep, Volkswagen, Audi, Kia, Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Fiat, Lexus, Jaguar, [Plus.AI](https://Plus.AI), Peterbilt, Subary, Byton, Peugeot, LUCID, Daimler, FCA, NIO, SsangYong, Suzuki, Chery, Volvo, Scania, Baidu, Nvidia, Intel and more. This list is only for the auto industry. There are many other companies and OEMs using QNX.\n\nIf you are referring to IVY when you say phantomware. Although it isn't  launched yet, it's been in development for years in partnership with Amazon, they have design wins with 23 of the 25 EV companies already and if you look at page 13 of the following deck ([https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/BBAS-2021-Presentations.pdf](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/BBAS-2021-Presentations.pdf)),  you'll see a preview of companies that are already integrating with IVY. IVY will also bring recurring monthly revenue as opposed to the one time license fee that QNX generates. Chen has also indicated that IVY will evolve into supporting smart cities.\n\nI would recommend that you actually read through the entire deck. \n\nWhat other products do they have in market today? How about:\n\n* Blackberry Alert - critical event management\n* Blackberry protect - Endpoint protection\n* Blackberry Persona - Behaviour and risk analytics\n* Blackberry Optics - thread detection &amp; response\n* Blackberry Gateway - network security and analytics\n* BlackBerry UEM - Endpoint control and management\n\nEach and every one of those offerings are wort researching but I'll let you do that if you are even interested in $BB. \n\n$BB are leaders when it comes to patents owned relating to AI/ML Cyber Security with 63% of patents. Next up is Carbon black with only 26% of patents. Crowdstrike only has 11%.\n\n$BB has government security certifications that no one else has obtained. (ex: NSA, CSfC, DoDIN and FedRAMP)\n\nAll 7 of the G7 Governments and 18 of the G20 governments are blackberry customers and I'm not talking about phones here.\n\nThey've been focusing on transformation for the last 8 years (which CEO John Chen is renowned for doing).\n\nNow they are ready for growth and are starting to market their products. \n\nWatch this video from this year's Needham virtual technology &amp; media conference to hear Tom Eacobacci's insight into how they will market their products [https://youtu.be/Ik7hYuH8sS4](https://youtu.be/Ik7hYuH8sS4)\n\nThese are only a few reasons why their future looks bright. You don't have to search much to find details on other factors like the Facebook settlement, patent sale for mobile related patents they no longer need, recent partnerships, IVY fund... ... ...\n\nStill think they are worth Dick? Reason why they are so undervalued is because people still think they make cell phones and fail to see the potential. To be honest, that is great news for us bulls because if everyone realized what $BB is up to, we wouldn't have the opportunity to buy it at these low prices. I guess I should say thank you?",

I was running a startup hoping to IPO, and I had dozens of friends who were paper millionaires with their stock options, and most wound up worthless. I started with $5k in 1998, and by 2000, I had over $200k in my Schwab account. I thought I had cracked the code, and I was feeling pretty invincible.\n\nIn Feb 2000, I shorted some tech stocks, then bailed when they kept going up and took my losses. As the bubble started to burst, I put all my money in \"safe\" profitable tech stocks (Cisco, Oracle, Network Solutions and Intel). A month later the bottom fell out. It was a roller coaster ride, with enough ups to make you think it was coming back. My \"safe\" stocks lost a bundle. I rode two companies into the ground, and lost 90% on others. \n\nToday, Cisco and Oracle are worth less than they were 21 years ago. Despite consistent earnings increases, they never grew into those valuations. (Yes, I wish I had put everything in AAPL, GOOG and AMZN instead).This market feels \"frothy\" (to quote someone smarter than I am). There will always be winners and losers, but when the market loses its collective mind every time someone says \"inflation\" or \"tightening\" it's concerning. I'm still long, but it seems like it's time to think about taking some chips off the table soon.",

Any technology they show us would be the equivalent of magic in our eyes. Like showing a 13th century knight a surface to air missle or a monk working on moveable type an iphone. It might take generations to understand it.\n\nSome talking points: \n\n1) If they don't want to eat us (there are easier ways to create protein than catching and processing a meat sack) but want to exploit resources, then perhaps they want to trade, buy extractive industries (mining, heavy equipment).\n\n2) If they don't have the concept of trade, and only take by force, then we're toast anyway. Buy bugout gear and live off the grid for as long as you can. Patriot Supply and Readywise are not publicly traded, but Coleman is as part of Newell Brands (NWL) and just had a stock split. Any of the gun manufacturers would likely do well, IF they were publicly traded. Only Ruger (RGR and Colt (Olin mnfg OLN) will do you any good before the market tanks due to the aforementioned bugout.\n\n3) If they are just studying us, and had an equivalent of a NSF grant to study indigenous species, and stupidly left some equipment behind, then, by all means, find out if Lockhead-Martin, GE, SpaceX etc, got access to it and quietly invest. If the DOD got the item first, go Lockhead-Martin or General Dynamics. Otherwise, if the item was IT related, especially storage, NVIDIA, Intel, etc. If it was communications, maybe a SPAC like FIVG, or Raytheon.\n\n4) If they turn out to be benevolent, and want us as a \"partner\" of some sort, then we go with the space tech and extractive models. a) Extracting elements from asteroids is substantially cheaper once you are out there, but you have to get people, resources, support and some medium of exchange out there. Buy SPCX, since Musk has the vision. b) You also will need a bunch of new psychiatrists since this won't be easy for anyone to deal with. c) Designers for all the alien themed clothing, cars and tchotchkes that will emerge. d) engineers and mathematicians to make sure space vehicles don't end up in the sun.  \n\nThanks for reading this far into the endless drivel. \n\nTL: DR\n\nIf we're not food or slaves, then buy rockets.\n\nGood luck.",

Let's say tensions with China intensify and a skirmish or war breaks out there.   There would be a strangle on a lot of chip manufacturing.  Pay attention to trouble brewing in the south china sea.  \n\nIf Intels fabs are up and running they would continue to build un-harrassed in the USA.   \n\nI agree that any time a company takes money for capital expenditures when it is running behind is risky. TSMC IS SPENDING 25 TO 28 BILLION THIS YEAR ON CAPITAL EXPENSES.  Samsung  is spending 28.1 billion this year. The reason Intel is producing more fabrication facilities is so that is can have more capacity which it does not have access to currently.  So the numbers being thrown around are normal for the industry.   \n\nI would have to agree in the short term intel is behind and it will take time for them to get back up.   I do however believe they will be much better positioned going forward.   Their stock already looks discounted. \n\nJust remember semiconductor companies are always playing texas hold em.   They have to put tons of money upfront and then hope everything works out to stay profitable.   Loss of power, interuptions in supply chain i.e. south china sea, would be devastating to any company producing there.  \n\nThe only thing that would push intel higher right now would be an announcement of more capacity,  upgrading to 450 mm wafers, or some new advanced processes that blows away the competition.   They are making more capacity but that yield will be 18 months or more out.  Not a bull or bear hear just my two cents.",

With regards to personal computing, Intel has led on the central processor front for decades in terms of market share, partnerships with oems, and performance. At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. \n\nAfter building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. \n\nTL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has.

        "body": "Reading other comments - I won\u2019t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. \n\nIntel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. \n\nHence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won\u2019t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. \n\nIntel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. \n\nAlso the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. \n\nAs I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. \n\nIs NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. \n\nNow regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. \n\nAnd regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel\u2019s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. \n\nFull disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.",

        "body": "Sometimes being a consumer of a company can help you see some trends that can help you find a good purchase, but over time learn to separate your outlook on various companies between your perception as an investor and as a consumer.\n\nI bought a laptop with an Intel chip this year, but I got over $20k in AMD.\n\nA few fundamentals I see some young investors struggle with, myself in the past included, is understanding P/E, revenue, and net profit. But more importantly, go a step further and understand what competitive advantages a company has to gain future profits without the rise in competition from other companies that will undercut them. Certain companies can find ways to get more pricing power in contracts with other companies or be able to price a little higher with consumers. \n\nFirstly, since the peak in February I'm up 9%, something to keep in mind. \n\nThese high-growth companies everyone gets excited about should be a part of your investment portfolio, but only a part. Many of them will fail or one day be out-competed by another company, while 1 will remain as the next big thing. They're riskier and more volatile in the interim. They haven't made it yet, they're just on the cusp of maybe making it. Look beyond just the recent price performance of the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake CHWY as an example.  They've yet to make a profit. Let me say that again, they've yet to make a profit.\n\nIn 2020 They had revenue's of $4.85B, but their net income with expenses was -$252.37m. \n\nThey still need to do 1 of 3 things generally speaking:\n\n1) Get pricing negotiation power over suppliers to get a higher cut of the products they are retailing.\n\n2) Get a higher price from consumers that are buying the product\n\n3) Get more efficiencies to lower expenses per amount of revenue they take in.\n\nCHWY is getting traction on their stock price, because they are on the edge of being able to turn a profit and possibly grow larger, but they haven't yet.\n\nIf there is any small downtrend in the market, stocks like this are bound to fall faster and deeper. Investor's are paying a premium for a stock that might turn a profit later.\n\nIn the meantime, they offer no dividend, so the stock doesn't give the investor anything back directly. The fwd P/E ratio, with analyst expectations they will be profitable in 2022, is still $442.89 (CFRA).  This means you are paying $442.89 for each $1 they earn. That is extremely high. To be worth the current price, not only do they need to start turning a profit, they need a high enough profit to make that P/E ratio lower between $15-$35.\n\nThis tells me any little news that shows forward momentum of improvement will make investors get excited, but any bad news on the macro-economy or about their suppliers, consumers, or the company can cause larger drops in the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example of a growing retail company that is a more stable investment is TSCO, Tractor Supply Company. They have a growing consumer market on the exurban edge of large and mid-size cities. One of the fewer places brick and mortar retailers have room for growth.\n\nThis is an example of a company that has made it, has room for growth, and the stock is paying out.\n\nThey have had several years of sustained profits. In 2020 They have a revenue of $10.6B and a net profit of $749m. \n\nThe stock is paying a divided to shareholders just over 1% annually.  The P/E ratio is 26.87. This means for each $26.87 in the cost of the stock the company is making $1 after expenses.\n\nWhat to expect is there is room for growth and room for the stock to go down, like any company. But it will be less volatile than CHWY. If there is a small hiccup in the macro-economy investors won't be as nervous. It's a stable company turning a profit that can justify its price without as much future growth. Whereas, CHWY depends on that future growth that is in jeopardy.\n\nThis exercise isn't about saying TSCO is better than CHWY or the opposite. That is not the point and I'd be interested in buying both.\n\nBut this is an exercise in understanding and managing risk. I was some riskier companies with real potential, but I choose carefully what % of my portfolio are those types of companies. I have other parts of my portfolio that are growth companies that have already achieved success and have lower P/E ratios, but are less risky during small downturns.\n\nThen I have another portion of my portfolio that are value companies. These are stable companies that I don't expect much growth (beyond growth from inflation), in fact some are slowly in decline, but they're stable, common to consumers and produce dividends. Sometimes just 2-3%, but sometimes 7%. That is annual income from the stocks, not tied to changes in the share price at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are two important sides to investing, 1) finding companies that will grow and 2) managing the overall risk you're taking in finding that growth.\n\nIt is easy to find growing companies during a long Bull Market, but these popular companies with these large potential upsides in stock price are the riskiest during a bear market or even a small downturn. You're not paying for the profits they are making now, you're paying a huge premium for profits you believe they will be making in 5-6 years vs. a company that is making the profits now.\n\nSo don't just look at the performance of a stock by share price over the last few years, rather look at it on a broader level of how much that company is making for that share price and how down it will probably go in a downturn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might buy some CHWY myself for my riskier portfolio allotments, but I know their profits haven't come close to justifying that price. It is priced at profit potential 2-3 years out and any sign of a potential downturn or problem will cause some volatile dips that aren't always guaranteed to recover.\n\n(Side note: I'm long on TSCO. I needed a good comparison to examine risk. At it's current price, I believe it to be slightly overvalued. It has been a good long-term investment.)",

Their stock price rise seems to be more about can Intel shit itself even more.\n\nWhat is next for Nvidia, artificial intelligence ?\n\n'' On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Arm Inc. from SoftBank Group Corp. (TSE:9984) for $40 billion.10 Arm is a U.K.-based semiconductor and software design company specializing in CPU architecture. Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''\n\nLooks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.\n\nWhich company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ?

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC, BTCX or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

Some exchanges actually provide you with the coins, other just provide you with exposure to it and give you some kind of object tied to the price action but never the actual transferable coin.\n\nFor exchanges that allow you to buy the coins, just look at [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/) \n\nEtoro, Robinhood and a few others just allow you some exposure.\n\nFurthermore, exchanges give you acces to the coins, but they are never yours, they still can exert influence on them such as freezing the account and you will not be able to transfer or trade. The second part is much more relevant. These exchanges can be hacked and your coins can be transferred without your consent. In crypto we say, not your keys, not your coins. \n\nWallets are a bit tougher to explain, it's your personal bank account which is accessible through software.  I'll try to explain it buy using Cardano. \n\nA Cardano wallet is accessible through Yoroi and Daedalus and those two allow you to make transactions on the network (sending / staking). So your adress is where it is stored, but the software allows you to mutate the contents. \n\nNow.. if you are still reading :)\n\nWhichever is good for you depends on what you want. First you have to realise the fees.. \n\nEach exchange has fees, trading fees and transfer fees as well as minimum transfer amounts, this scheme varies. Depending on which coins you are interested in, you will find a subset of exchanges with their own set of values for this. \n\nSecond, some coins allow for staking (you can roughly translate this as a short term fixed deposit which gives you a return on investment). This can be done on some exchanges (Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken), but again, they facilitate, they take. There are some cases where it is preferable though, i.e. when you don't have the minimum required amount to stake.\n\nWell that's all for now :) If you want more info, send a DM or visit us at the cryptocurrency sub.",

Didn't pay attention to the jobs report coming out that Friday. Monday comes and SPX spikes. Rolled up my puts to 4025/4050 for more premium and to try to mitigate losses. Should have bailed earlier in the day at a $2k loss, but waited it out, ended up taking a $3.8k loss. Made it all back through the week and ended up +$300 by that Friday. But that is the only time I would have lost. But only because I didn't pay attention to upcoming market events.\n\nOpened a 0DTE 4100/4120 on 4/14. Was still stinging from the $4k loss a week before. Watched it dropping. Literally spend 2 hours in a gaming setup with fingers on the up/down keys and hand on the mouse adjusting my limits. Rode it from a $4k loss to $60 gain to $2k loss, roller coaster. Closed at a $159 loss with 45 seconds left in the trading day. Closed at 4124, so I would have been fine. But had $20k collateral riding on it and couldn't risk that for a $550 premium.\n\nThen monday, opened a 0DTE  4165/4175 spread. Panicked and sold at a $700 loss. Recovered right after I sold and closed at 4191. So would have been fine. That's what changed my thinking to letting it play out and trusting the deltas.\n\nsince 3/22, I've run 31 credit spreads and 16 iron condors. only had the 3 total losses above and 2 of them would have been gains if i had trusted the process.

First I need to sleep on time so I can actually be awake to trade \ud83e\udd23\n\nThere are a lot of channels on YouTube, none quite like this guy. I recommend watching his oldest stuff. He mentions his big strategy almost every video. I recommend taking the free \"cycles timing indicator\" seminar too.\n\nAnyway if you can find his entire strategy and learn how to apply it, the pieces are scattered through several videos. Learn to read momentum.\n\nHe likes to find rare indicators for new videos. Honestly he could continue just making videos with the same examples and it would still be a good channel. Just relearning the same few keys over and over.\n\nAgain, mindset. Be humble, but not impatient.\n\nIf I see an entry developing but I'm too early, I often either get stopped out just before profit, or my profit isn't great (like under 1% or under risk). In those cases I've been taking slightly larger risk so I don't get stopped (and I don't place a stop loss, I just watch like a hawk). The thing that helped me here is \"would I enter here if I was going to buy options to take this trade?\" and normally I get a better entry because I want everything to be perfect. Just getting past the options spread can be tough in an hour or two.\n\nSo perfecting the entry makes more money and reduces risk. If a trade isn't going to work out, it should be obvious soon by the indicators, they'll negate the entry relatively soon.\n\nThe PDT rule helps in the beginning because you only get 2 or 3 shots per week. So you're looking for the perfect entry. Or if you have a margin account you can trade with unsettled funds. I like to hold stocks overnight, then sell during the day, and buy back later. This doesn't count as a daytrade so I can take 5 trades per week.\n\nIf everything goes well I should have over 25k in my account within the next 100 trades or so, maybe by the end of the year. Really looking forward to making up all my losses and then some",

There\u2019s collateral.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know if the bank that\u2019s earning interest is really getting paid in your scenario, but I\u2019m assuming that this debt is just getting kicked down the road.  Eventually, there\u2019s going to be a tipping point where the borrower can\u2019t borrow any more to pay the interest, and the bank is going to want to collect their earnings.\n\nSo, maybe they can roll it for a while, which is what they\u2019re doing.  But eventually somebody is going to say, check please.  And the borrower won\u2019t be able to pay, and then there will be a cascade.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to call it a \u201cmargin call\u201d that\u2019s fine.

Last March this thing was a dead horse at 6 bucks then all hell broke loose .\n\n...multiple factors contributed to the greatest run on ammo as long as I have been in the industry ..8 years now. ..national emergency with Covid, Civil Unrest, Police Brutality..looting in Santa Monica, CA of all places, Massive influx of new buyers..the list goes on. \n\nObama was no match for this.  \n\nIt started March 12th 2020 and has been outrageous sales EVERY SINGLE day 417 days in a row!!!!!. Can't keep anyting in stock. Vista has a massive market share(Federal, Blazer, CCI, Speer, American Eagle and now Remington) This is THE ammo stock. They also hold the keys to primer manufacturing which is the reason we are in this mess. The primer shortage caused a backlog and then 10 million new gun buyers wanted to feed their new toys. \n\nSuper Demand City and no Supply easy math. As far as timing..this thing still has some juice left in it I believe and that's because they've had some price increases and recently stated they are behind a billion dollars in orders.\n\nPrice Targets range from 35-49. A consensus buy across the board on most outlets.  I believe all time high was 52 and change..it has a serious shot at beating that.  I have personally spent a year watching and running with this stock.  Seriously hours daily researching this for over a year.\n\nThe negative is there is low volume to move this thing. It's insane. It has taken a big jump, but over 14 months.\n\nThe earnings probably hit 575 million in this report and might break earnings record. It was at 38 not too long ago.  I've owned this since last March at an average of 7.80. I have taken profits twice so far. I now have stock and 35 dollar calls to hit May 21st which are green and also some 40 dollar hail mary calls as well. Those could be dreamers, but I work in this field and it never ends. Phones ringing off the hook..lines all day long.  I can't and won't give you advice on what to do with your hard earned money, but I do believe this company has a serious positive short term outlook.\n\nBest of luck Champ",

This will only continue as more and more serious institutions start to get it and don't want china to control them. \n\n&gt;The ecological impact of running computers to support BTC is insane and currently unsustainable.\n\nEnergy consumption of Bitcoin is lower then our current monetary system (banks, visa etc) in relative terms. There's also a clear trend to sustainable energy usage since mining is location independent and is a way to profit off of otherwise unusable land and wasted energy (deserts/surplus of the power grid etc.)\n\n&gt;Nobody knows the exact origin of BTC, so nobody really knows if there is a back door to hack\n\nKnowing who Satoshi is is irrelevant in terms of hacking. The entire code of the protocol is public since it started. Bitcoin is an open source project and anyone can look at the code if they want to. There are no backdoors and there's no way to build one unless you want the whole world to see it. \n\n&gt;there are a number of early early adopters that hold a huge amount and can tank the market anytime they decide to sell their billions of dollars worth of BTC\n\nOnly point that's fair imo. Although there's something to be said that the market can tank it by now and it won't be the end of Bitcoin. Also I doubt these individuals would voluntarily trigger a market crash by selling billions at once. They obviously believe in Bitcoin's future or lost their keys otherwise they wouldn't have stayed committed to their holdings for this long. \n\n&gt;I think blockchain is a tech that is here to stay, but current versions are basically beta tests.\n\nSmart contract platforms and everything build on them are still in beta/early adopter territory but Bitcoin isn't. Banks and the biggest financial institutions don't adopt technologies that are in \"beta\" Bitcoin is a trillion dollar asset and on it's way to cross the chasm to the early majority.",

Interesting but full of conjecture and vague suppositions, typical for that kind of pitch \"people disagree with me but this is because they are stupid and are part of the machine\"\n\n If VCs where prone to believe every similar line of reason they read like Dan's they would invest after every one of thousands of hockey stick presentations they see. Here is one such gem based on emotional appeal to the outsider:\n\n\"The idea that Satoshi perfectly crafted Bitcoin on the first try is unfathomable for them to consider.\" \n\nTo which the first commentor correctly replies \"Because it's unfathomable that this is true\" and there you have the summary of the two sides of the argument.\n\nEven a brief browse through the Wikipedia entry for Bitcoin will tell you as much based on its history.\n\nThere are so many other problems with BtC but let's just choose one and let's also apply another line if reasoning: how secure is it in a physical sense? People are keeping their keys on physical media in safety deposit boxes at multiple banks because they are rightly concerned people can and would kill them for their Bitcoin or otherwise steal it. Many people who used services for their wallet have been burnt hard. We have laws about the fiet money proceeds of such crimes but people who own BTC do well to be concerned. Whose jurisdiction does solving a theft of Bitcoin actually fall under? Where exactly is Satoshi if he is even a real person? If he is not dead it's pretty dangerous to be him.\n\nThe truth is that BTC is flawed and will be changed/replaced as people solve problems with it. As such it will become obsolete or be updated and when that happens it will be vulnerable and Dans reasoning is flawed on this basis.\n\nI have no doubt there is utility for crypto. I just think investing in any particular technology as an investment asset will be demonstrated to be a huge mistake in 15 years when when we look back on the crypto bubble of 20xx. Many of the Dotcom companies had value there was still a bubble. Except now with crypto we have perfected this bubble. For Dotcom and firms pretended to have value and products or services. \n\nBottom line: Dan is invested",

        "body": "Remind of the time when people could autonomously stake their tulip bulbs to earn passive income, become a liquidity provider, yield farm, swap between tulips or lend 24/7 all from home without a centralized account ie. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?\n\nOnce you've driven off the fiat ramp, you actually own and control your crypto keys, which can't be said about a centralized bank account. No one needs to verify or check that you're swapping some ETH for another token or buying an NFT to trade. There's no transaction limits. However, there is a varying degree of responsibility (security practices, properly tracking and paying taxes, etc) and a learning curve to get over.\n\nI remember the time it clicked for me: I was able to pay and settle an advertising deal in a few seconds to another country with just their ETH address. No IBAN or SWIFT or adding a payee and waiting for a wire transfer to execute and settle. You can transmit value from one address to another without a middle person and transparency track the transaction. The receiving party can opt to convert their crypto to fiat or a stablecoin, which is pegged to fiat but can be exchanged through various chains and later converted to fiat and into a traditional bank account.\n\nCrypto happened to change my life forever. I got in and out when I did, but there's always someone else who got in earlier or lower than you--you'll rarely sell at the top. Accepting the reality of your decisions is an individualistic emotional exercise. The markets have been working in bull/bear cycles so far; gains are gains after all. Set your goals and try to stick with them or just wait things out until something becomes significant to your situation. Do not take this as investment advice but I would want to see a many month trend of lower prices to buy in long term. Now or anytime is great for short term activity despite the historically high prices.\n\nThe whole thing of crypto having no intrinsic value is a pretty sloppy argument that I've been hearing for years. Crypto isn't traditional finance or regulated as such. I don't believe anything has intrinsic value. An individual and society give value to things. Sometimes you don't need a persistent or objective value to make gains in the short term. If you're getting stuck at this part, maybe crypto isn't for you in this form.\n\nAll of the naysayers out there have their own beliefs and opinions. Some of my friends felt the same 4-5 years ago and I wonder if they ever came around. Not everyone is going to be ready at the same time. You can be scared about something new or not understand it, but that doesn't make anything more or less true. It also doesn't get you closer to exploring a new frontier. I can attest that through the noise, there is enough incentive that everyone should at least hedge a little into crypto. Just owning a little gives an inherent incentive to learn more about what you bought. You may not like it or understand everything, but it's an experience where you will at least come out knowing more than you started with, even if your portfolio goes into the dumps for a while.\n\nObviously 10,000+ coins won't all have value in the future. Many are just clones or created as iterations of other ideas and code. I still dabble with things and own a little of various coins that are both well-known and just for fun as moonshot bets. I believe in a cashless society and crypto is in the frontier of facilitating that eventual transition into the future decades. How big of a part it will play is anyone's guess.",

        "body": "Yes, as a Canadian, there are multiple exchanges available to us such as Newton, ShakePay, NDAX, WealthSimple Crypto, and some Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",
