Large number of cloud providers won\u2019t be able to design their own devices and ARM will never be 100% of the server market unlike the smartphone market. AMD is also well diversified into console gaming and IP licensing areas. See for example Samsung\u2019s device using Vega. \n\nRegarding mining, I don\u2019t think this is significantly material to AMD from downside risk since a bulk of the GPU business is in actual graphics use. This includes high end PC gaming, console gaming and yes also perhaps mobile gaming if Samsung\u2019s plan comes to fruition. \n\nSo overall risks to AMD are just the usual competitive pressures but given that the overall markets they are playing in continue to increase in size, as long as they execute they should be fine. \n\nHaving worked in the chip industry for 25+ years there is not a whole lot of reasons not to buy into semiconductors. Semiconductor content in our lives continue to increase and while the players might change the overall industry is going to be growing and valuable over time. Just look at TI or STM or even INTC who have been around for 50 years and still going strong.\n\nJust don\u2019t bet more than you can afford to lose. AMD and others for that matter have struggled in the past on execution and so the stock might trade sideways or even down for a long time. \n\nBut Dr Su has built a solid team now and hopefully these issues are in the past and won\u2019t repeat again.",

AMDs market share gains have slowed down due to shortages, they're selling every chip they can make.\n\nWhen supply catches up to demand (which isn't happening for another year at least), their sheets will still look great because they'll start chipping away at Intel and Nvidias market share. With the Xilinx merger they'll become the largest customer at TSMC. As they start transitioning to 5 nm, they'll be able to allocate 7nm to lower margin GPU products, a segment which is currently neglected due to shortages, both by Nvidia and AMD.\n\nBesides that, they just announced a $4b share buyback. AMD have never had this kind of free cash before. This is going to prevent any sub $70 targets, unless there's a very sudden macro cause, and even then they'll eat it up because they want to buy the shares at a decent price. The reason they're doing share buybacks and not investing in the company? They have no factories, so they don't need capital to increase production levels. They've already effectively maxed out on R&amp;D, and as Intel have proven over the last 4 years, you can't throw extra money at semiconductor R&amp;D to get better results.\n\nTheir product roadmap for the next 5 years is amazing and they have a proven track record of delivering.\n\nThey said themselves that their gpu lineup should get another 50%+ per/watt improvement next gen, and leakers who have been pretty reliable previously are pointing to much higher numbers.\n\nIn the CPU space, Intel's next two generations are no threat whatsoever, and AMDs iterative design approach means consistent gains in performance and power consumption every year. Intel's 10nm laptop CPUs can increase their performance by 10% for a 50% power consumption tradeoff. It proves how bad the state of their foundries really is.\n\nThe Xilinx merger is a big brain play if it goes through, which it should. It gives them the FPGAs necessary to chip away at Nvidias monopoly on machine learning. Xilinx already easily outperforms Nvidia here, but Nvidia has an ecosystem that needs to be broken. As we move towards smaller processing nodes, transistor size reductions will no longer be the way to get better performance. A mix of FPGAs, ASICs, and general compute units is the future. That's what AMD have recognised and why they're building an arsenal of integrated CPU and GPU products now. They're building the experience required to meet the demands of the future.\n\nI don't have much money so I've got 265 shares via CFDs on 5x leverage. Assuming the Xilinx merger is successful, $100-130 EOY is easily manageable imo. It will likely take a hit after the merger as Xilinx owners sell their converted shares, but that's to be expected. With the guidance AMD have for this year it's also plausible they may increase the buyback program depending on demand/shortages, which could alleviate Xilinx sellers.",

Automakers using QNX: GM, Hyundai, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, Chrysler, Porsche, Skoda, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Bentley, Holden, Land Rover, BMW, Mini, Honda, Acura, Nissan, Ford, Mercedes, Saab ,Xpeng, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Toyota, Jeep, Volkswagen, Audi, Kia, Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Fiat, Lexus, Jaguar, [Plus.AI](https://Plus.AI), Peterbilt, Subary, Byton, Peugeot, LUCID, Daimler, FCA, NIO, SsangYong, Suzuki, Chery, Volvo, Scania, Baidu, Nvidia, Intel and more. This list is only for the auto industry. There are many other companies and OEMs using QNX.\n\nIf you are referring to IVY when you say phantomware. Although it isn't  launched yet, it's been in development for years in partnership with Amazon, they have design wins with 23 of the 25 EV companies already and if you look at page 13 of the following deck ([https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/BBAS-2021-Presentations.pdf](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/BBAS-2021-Presentations.pdf)),  you'll see a preview of companies that are already integrating with IVY. IVY will also bring recurring monthly revenue as opposed to the one time license fee that QNX generates. Chen has also indicated that IVY will evolve into supporting smart cities.\n\nI would recommend that you actually read through the entire deck. \n\nWhat other products do they have in market today? How about:\n\n* Blackberry Alert - critical event management\n* Blackberry protect - Endpoint protection\n* Blackberry Persona - Behaviour and risk analytics\n* Blackberry Optics - thread detection &amp; response\n* Blackberry Gateway - network security and analytics\n* BlackBerry UEM - Endpoint control and management\n\nEach and every one of those offerings are wort researching but I'll let you do that if you are even interested in $BB. \n\n$BB are leaders when it comes to patents owned relating to AI/ML Cyber Security with 63% of patents. Next up is Carbon black with only 26% of patents. Crowdstrike only has 11%.\n\n$BB has government security certifications that no one else has obtained. (ex: NSA, CSfC, DoDIN and FedRAMP)\n\nAll 7 of the G7 Governments and 18 of the G20 governments are blackberry customers and I'm not talking about phones here.\n\nThey've been focusing on transformation for the last 8 years (which CEO John Chen is renowned for doing).\n\nNow they are ready for growth and are starting to market their products. \n\nWatch this video from this year's Needham virtual technology &amp; media conference to hear Tom Eacobacci's insight into how they will market their products [https://youtu.be/Ik7hYuH8sS4](https://youtu.be/Ik7hYuH8sS4)\n\nThese are only a few reasons why their future looks bright. You don't have to search much to find details on other factors like the Facebook settlement, patent sale for mobile related patents they no longer need, recent partnerships, IVY fund... ... ...\n\nStill think they are worth Dick? Reason why they are so undervalued is because people still think they make cell phones and fail to see the potential. To be honest, that is great news for us bulls because if everyone realized what $BB is up to, we wouldn't have the opportunity to buy it at these low prices. I guess I should say thank you?",

I was running a startup hoping to IPO, and I had dozens of friends who were paper millionaires with their stock options, and most wound up worthless. I started with $5k in 1998, and by 2000, I had over $200k in my Schwab account. I thought I had cracked the code, and I was feeling pretty invincible.\n\nIn Feb 2000, I shorted some tech stocks, then bailed when they kept going up and took my losses. As the bubble started to burst, I put all my money in \"safe\" profitable tech stocks (Cisco, Oracle, Network Solutions and Intel). A month later the bottom fell out. It was a roller coaster ride, with enough ups to make you think it was coming back. My \"safe\" stocks lost a bundle. I rode two companies into the ground, and lost 90% on others. \n\nToday, Cisco and Oracle are worth less than they were 21 years ago. Despite consistent earnings increases, they never grew into those valuations. (Yes, I wish I had put everything in AAPL, GOOG and AMZN instead).This market feels \"frothy\" (to quote someone smarter than I am). There will always be winners and losers, but when the market loses its collective mind every time someone says \"inflation\" or \"tightening\" it's concerning. I'm still long, but it seems like it's time to think about taking some chips off the table soon.",

If the DOD got the item first, go Lockhead-Martin or General Dynamics. Otherwise, if the item was IT related, especially storage, NVIDIA, Intel, etc. If it was communications, maybe a SPAC like FIVG, or Raytheon.\n\n4) If they turn out to be benevolent, and want us as a \"partner\" of some sort, then we go with the space tech and extractive models. a) Extracting elements from asteroids is substantially cheaper once you are out there, but you have to get people, resources, support and some medium of exchange out there. Buy SPCX, since Musk has the vision. b) You also will need a bunch of new psychiatrists since this won't be easy for anyone to deal with. c) Designers for all the alien themed clothing, cars and tchotchkes that will emerge. d) engineers and mathematicians to make sure space vehicles don't end up in the sun.  \n\nThanks for reading this far into the endless drivel. \n\nTL: DR\n\nIf we're not food or slaves, then buy rockets.\n\nGood luck.",

For Intel,   I do know however that as you increase your technode you must increase your equipment technology.  20 B for new Fabs is not an eye shocking number and anyone who knows semiconductor companies knows this.  \n\nLook at the foundry TSMC majority of output is in Taiwan with only 2 8-inch wafer facilities in the USA.   8 inch wafer facilities are money losers, you spend the same amount to produce them as a 12 inch wafer, but netting less chips, industry current standard or 300 mm or 12 inch.  Those fabs wont be around much longer and they will eventually need to be retooled, and most likely completely rebuilt.    \n\nWhy building in the USA will be so important in the future.   \n\nLook at Taiwan and Singapore two places China would love to control.  Let's say tensions with China intensify and a skirmish or war breaks out there.   There would be a strangle on a lot of chip manufacturing.  Pay attention to trouble brewing in the south china sea.  \n\nIf Intels fabs are up and running they would continue to build un-harrassed in the USA.   \n\nI agree that any time a company takes money for capital expenditures when it is running behind is risky. TSMC IS SPENDING 25 TO 28 BILLION THIS YEAR ON CAPITAL EXPENSES.  Samsung  is spending 28.1 billion this year. The reason Intel is producing more fabrication facilities is so that is can have more capacity which it does not have access to currently.  So the numbers being thrown around are normal for the industry.   \n\nI would have to agree in the short term intel is behind and it will take time for them to get back up.   I do however believe they will be much better positioned going forward.   Their stock already looks discounted. \n\nJust remember semiconductor companies are always playing texas hold em.   They have to put tons of money upfront and then hope everything works out to stay profitable.   Loss of power, interuptions in supply chain i.e. south china sea, would be devastating to any company producing there.  \n\nThe only thing that would push intel higher right now would be an announcement of more capacity,  upgrading to 450 mm wafers, or some new advanced processes that blows away the competition.   They are making more capacity but that yield will be 18 months or more out.  Not a bull or bear hear just my two cents.",

        "body": "Reading other comments - I won\u2019t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. \n\nIntel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. \n\nHence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won\u2019t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. \n\nIntel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. \n\nAlso the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. \n\nAs I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. \n\nIs NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. \n\nNow regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. \n\nAnd regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel\u2019s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. \n\nFull disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.",

        "body": "Sometimes being a consumer of a company can help you see some trends that can help you find a good purchase, but over time learn to separate your outlook on various companies between your perception as an investor and as a consumer.\n\nI bought a laptop with an Intel chip this year, but I got over $20k in AMD.\n\nA few fundamentals I see some young investors struggle with, myself in the past included, is understanding P/E, revenue, and net profit. But more importantly, go a step further and understand what competitive advantages a company has to gain future profits without the rise in competition from other companies that will undercut them. Certain companies can find ways to get more pricing power in contracts with other companies or be able to price a little higher with consumers. \n\nFirstly, since the peak in February I'm up 9%, something to keep in mind. \n\nThese high-growth companies everyone gets excited about should be a part of your investment portfolio, but only a part. Many of them will fail or one day be out-competed by another company, while 1 will remain as the next big thing. They're riskier and more volatile in the interim. They haven't made it yet, they're just on the cusp of maybe making it. Look beyond just the recent price performance of the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake CHWY as an example.  They've yet to make a profit. Let me say that again, they've yet to make a profit.\n\nIn 2020 They had revenue's of $4.85B, but their net income with expenses was -$252.37m. \n\nThey still need to do 1 of 3 things generally speaking:\n\n1) Get pricing negotiation power over suppliers to get a higher cut of the products they are retailing.\n\n2) Get a higher price from consumers that are buying the product\n\n3) Get more efficiencies to lower expenses per amount of revenue they take in.\n\nCHWY is getting traction on their stock price, because they are on the edge of being able to turn a profit and possibly grow larger, but they haven't yet.\n\nIf there is any small downtrend in the market, stocks like this are bound to fall faster and deeper. Investor's are paying a premium for a stock that might turn a profit later.\n\nIn the meantime, they offer no dividend, so the stock doesn't give the investor anything back directly. The fwd P/E ratio, with analyst expectations they will be profitable in 2022, is still $442.89 (CFRA).  This means you are paying $442.89 for each $1 they earn. That is extremely high. To be worth the current price, not only do they need to start turning a profit, they need a high enough profit to make that P/E ratio lower between $15-$35.\n\nThis tells me any little news that shows forward momentum of improvement will make investors get excited, but any bad news on the macro-economy or about their suppliers, consumers, or the company can cause larger drops in the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example of a growing retail company that is a more stable investment is TSCO, Tractor Supply Company. They have a growing consumer market on the exurban edge of large and mid-size cities. One of the fewer places brick and mortar retailers have room for growth.\n\nThis is an example of a company that has made it, has room for growth, and the stock is paying out.\n\nThey have had several years of sustained profits. In 2020 They have a revenue of $10.6B and a net profit of $749m. \n\nThe stock is paying a divided to shareholders just over 1% annually.  The P/E ratio is 26.87. This means for each $26.87 in the cost of the stock the company is making $1 after expenses.\n\nWhat to expect is there is room for growth and room for the stock to go down, like any company. But it will be less volatile than CHWY. If there is a small hiccup in the macro-economy investors won't be as nervous. It's a stable company turning a profit that can justify its price without as much future growth. Whereas, CHWY depends on that future growth that is in jeopardy.\n\nThis exercise isn't about saying TSCO is better than CHWY or the opposite. That is not the point and I'd be interested in buying both.\n\nBut this is an exercise in understanding and managing risk. I was some riskier companies with real potential, but I choose carefully what % of my portfolio are those types of companies. I have other parts of my portfolio that are growth companies that have already achieved success and have lower P/E ratios, but are less risky during small downturns.\n\nThen I have another portion of my portfolio that are value companies. These are stable companies that I don't expect much growth (beyond growth from inflation), in fact some are slowly in decline, but they're stable, common to consumers and produce dividends. Sometimes just 2-3%, but sometimes 7%. That is annual income from the stocks, not tied to changes in the share price at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are two important sides to investing, 1) finding companies that will grow and 2) managing the overall risk you're taking in finding that growth.\n\nIt is easy to find growing companies during a long Bull Market, but these popular companies with these large potential upsides in stock price are the riskiest during a bear market or even a small downturn. You're not paying for the profits they are making now, you're paying a huge premium for profits you believe they will be making in 5-6 years vs. a company that is making the profits now.\n\nSo don't just look at the performance of a stock by share price over the last few years, rather look at it on a broader level of how much that company is making for that share price and how down it will probably go in a downturn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might buy some CHWY myself for my riskier portfolio allotments, but I know their profits haven't come close to justifying that price. It is priced at profit potential 2-3 years out and any sign of a potential downturn or problem will cause some volatile dips that aren't always guaranteed to recover.\n\n(Side note: I'm long on TSCO. I needed a good comparison to examine risk. At it's current price, I believe it to be slightly overvalued. It has been a good long-term investment.)",

NVDA has a relative monopoly on the space, and have been making partnerships to ensure that their cards are a standard for developers. AMD is beating Intel in the processor space, but demands have expanded much more towards the video card sector recently for various reasons, and I sort of feel like Intel is destined to be a Compaq that has been too slow to adapt.\n\nThat said, I think AMD can seriously challenge NVDA, but they need a serious focus on that area which is difficult.",

Their stock price rise seems to be more about can Intel shit itself even more.\n\nWhat is next for Nvidia, artificial intelligence ?\n\n'' On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Arm Inc. from SoftBank Group Corp. (TSE:9984) for $40 billion.10 Arm is a U.K.-based semiconductor and software design company specializing in CPU architecture. Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''\n\nLooks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.\n\nWhich company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ? Will AMD still be producing better chips than their last one ? Is AMD going to be around or are Intel, Apple and Nvidia going to push breakthrough things AMD can't possibly match ? AMD is quite scarier and riskier investment in that regard. Nvidia on the other hand has bigger stronghold with their GPUs and have a lot of speculative things that could pay off big time.\n\nDisclaimer, i own fuck ton of both equally.",
