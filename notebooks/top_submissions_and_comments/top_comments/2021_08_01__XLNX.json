If youre buying weekly options then yeah, youre playing with fire holding options through earnings. But if you have options contracts that has a lot of time left after the earnings call then you have time to recover. If your options contracts has months left until expiration then holding through earnings is not going to hurt you too bad. I bought calls on AMD at the end of June and they were down 50-80% leading up to earnings. I have been slowly (maybe prematurely) selling my calls all for profits of 150-300%. My calls expired in September, November, and December. I like to stagger mine. \n\nWith that being said, I think people grossly missunderstood the position AMD is in. The signs were all there. Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely.",

        "body": "Absolutely. AMD and XLNX have agreed to a merger in which 1 share of XLNX will equal 1.72 shares of AMD. The merger is currently being approved by regulators in Europe and China and my guess is that China fears have created this arbitrage situation. If the merger fell through - which is seems unlikely to do in my opinion - people generally think XLNX will fall from its current $140 to around $100. No idea what the AMD stock would do - I'm just parroting what I've read elsewhere.\n\nSo - as of right now AMD is around $120 and XLNX is around $140. If price according to the merger terms, XLNX should be trading at $206 to equal 1.72 shares of AMD ($120 x 1.72 = $206). I'm currently selling my AMD and buying XLNX under the belief that the merger will go through. As the merger date approaches (later 2021, early 2022) the arbitrage opportunity will disappear and the prices of the two stocks will follow that 1.72:1 ratio that I mentioned earlier. There is risk but I have not seen anything in the news to suggest the merger won't occur, so I am comfortable converting my shares now to take advantage of that \\~30% differential ($140 vs $206). The downside is probably around a 30% loss ($140 to $100) if the merger fails, but again, I'm long AMD and would LOVE an opportunity for a discount on the share price via arbitrage.",

Now, I'm really new to options trading and have made a good amount of money with AMD calls for the past 2 weeks, but I've never experienced trading through an event like this. Based off of the momentum that AMD and XLNX have, I feel like the dilution of shares won't have that bad of an effect by the time expiry comes. I guess what I'm trying to ask is:\n\nWhat usually happens to a share price during a merger?",

FPGAs do lots of different thing (they can and will be used in servers but they are so much more). And they bring a deep software engineering bench that AMD has often lacked over the years, so the tie up ought to work out well along several lines. \n\n&gt; now that TSMC is being used by Intel, Apple, AMD, and anyone who needs 5nm, it may be difficult to keep up with demand until the new TSMC fabs come online\n\nApple will always get first crack at the new stuff because they essentially pay TSMC a premium for it and subsidize its R&amp;D for the newest nodes. Intel has announced a need to turn to TSMC for fabrication of at least some of its leading edge chips, due to its own technical problems. \n\nHowever, between AMD and Intel, AMD will be given preference. The reason is simple. Intel has declared open warfare on TSMC with the announcement of its \u201cIDM 2.0\u201d initiative, which aims to open Intel\u2019s fabrication facilities to third parties \u2014 essentially, they want to take a chunk of TSMC\u2019s foundry business. As a result, while TSMC will supply Intel to a reasonable extent, they will almost certainly give AMD preference over Intel, as a way to check Intel\u2019s ambitions. \n\nIn other words, TSMC says if you want to cut into our core business (foundry), we will enable AMD to cut into your core business (x86 server and laptop CPUs) by making sure they have whatever they need on the fabrication side of things.",
