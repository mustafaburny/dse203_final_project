        "body": "From [Seeking Alpha](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3724985-xilinx-deal-spread-with-advanced-micro-devices-widens-to-highest-ever):\n\nThe deal spread between Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had widened to $65/share, or about 45%, the highest since the deal was announced in October. Xilinx fell 3.7%, while AMD rose 5.9%. Several other technology deals that also need Chinese antitrust approval also saw their spreads widen today.\n\nOne reason for Xilinx's (XLNX) move down may be that risk arb investors can't handle the potential downside for Xilinx (XLNX) if a deal with AMD (AMD) were to fall apart as AMD's shares continue to rocket higher, according to CNBC's David Faber. CNBC's Jim Cramer also said he believed that AMD (AMD) has become a meme stock at this point. AMD shares have jumped almost 25% in the past two weeks.\n\nIn addition a Dealreporter column from last night may be contributing to weakness in the spreads. The opinion piece points out that China's leaders appear to have changed their tone about the importance of technology in late May and may have put the country on a \"technology war footing.\" The U.S. and South Korean's announcement to fund multi-billion dollar semiconductor factories may also have contributed to China's potential slowdown on approving the U.S. deals.\n\nAs far as Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) planned purchase of Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM), the Dealreporter column says the timing is uncertain. Last month traders circulated a report that the timing for Chinese approval had moved out as some customer have issues with export controls, though the deal was still likely to be approved.\n\nRisk arb investors may also be \"de-risking\" due to heightened antitrust risk after Aon (NYSE:AON) and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) abandoned their $30B deal last week after the U.S. sued to block the deal and after a report from The Information last night that the U.S. DOJ is considering filing a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth's planned $8B purchase of Changed Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG).\n\nLast month MLex reported that the AMD's (AMD) purchase of Xilinx (XLNX) is expect to see a Phase Two review by Chinese antitrust regulators. China's State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR is believed to have reached out to industry participants a few months ago to find out their views on market definitions and market shares.\n\nOther deal spreads that are wider today include Maxim (MXIM)/Analog Devices (ADI) and Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR)/II-VI(NASDAQ:IIVI).\n\nAlso last week it was reported that China's review of Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) planned purchase of Arm Holdings (ARMHF) was said to be delayed. China's antitrust regulatory hasn't started its formal review of the deal for Softbank to sell Arm to Nvidia, according to a report from The Information.",

        "body": "I have mixed feeling on selling prior to earnings. Beucase of exactly what happened. If youre buying weekly options then yeah, youre playing with fire holding options through earnings. But if you have options contracts that has a lot of time left after the earnings call then you have time to recover. If your options contracts has months left until expiration then holding through earnings is not going to hurt you too bad. I bought calls on AMD at the end of June and they were down 50-80% leading up to earnings. I have been slowly (maybe prematurely) selling my calls all for profits of 150-300%. My calls expired in September, November, and December. I like to stagger mine. \n\nWith that being said, I think people grossly missunderstood the position AMD is in. The signs were all there. Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely.",

The merger is currently being approved by regulators in Europe and China and my guess is that China fears have created this arbitrage situation. If the merger fell through - which is seems unlikely to do in my opinion - people generally think XLNX will fall from its current $140 to around $100. No idea what the AMD stock would do - I'm just parroting what I've read elsewhere.\n\nSo - as of right now AMD is around $120 and XLNX is around $140. If price according to the merger terms, XLNX should be trading at $206 to equal 1.72 shares of AMD ($120 x 1.72 = $206). I'm currently selling my AMD and buying XLNX under the belief that the merger will go through. As the merger date approaches (later 2021, early 2022) the arbitrage opportunity will disappear and the prices of the two stocks will follow that 1.72:1 ratio that I mentioned earlier. There is risk but I have not seen anything in the news to suggest the merger won't occur, so I am comfortable converting my shares now to take advantage of that \\~30% differential ($140 vs $206). The downside is probably around a 30% loss ($140 to $100) if the merger fails, but again, I'm long AMD and would LOVE an opportunity for a discount on the share price via arbitrage.",

For a total of 30 shares and some change meaning i get an additional 1k? \n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong but isn\u2019t this what would happen?",

That\u2019s like a 40% premium which is just too damn expensive. Also, it seems like the catalysts for the recent run up for AMD are tied to that specific exchange agreement",

That doesn\u2019t change, no matter the price of either stock. \n\nSo if you buy 18 Xilinx stock today, you end up at the end of the day with 31.0212 AMD stock. \n\nThe risk is twofold. Either that AMD stock drops, or Xilinx rises, and wipes out the gain you could have made. Or two, that the merger doesn\u2019t go through and you lose out on the potential upside.\n\nI guess the price difference now could mean the bigger institutions aren\u2019t as hopeful?",
