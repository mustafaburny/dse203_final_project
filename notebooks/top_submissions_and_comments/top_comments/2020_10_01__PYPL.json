I don\u2019t hold Tesla stock but it\u2019s the bears like OP that have gotten musk where he is. People have time and time again said what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t feasible and then he proves them wrong. Calling him full of shit when he\u2019s essentially a modern day Galileo is laughable really.\n\nJust my 2 cents",

        "body": "Behold my new epic poem:\n\n#Out Retarded: A Story of IV and Multilevel Autism\n\nSteven was new to options but had been doing well, very well. He knew himself as the smartest in his friend group. This was reinforced to him by the fact he was up 300% all time and his stock-playing friends were up a boomer-esque 6%.\n\nHe had a thing for tech stocks. It seemed like every stock he picked he made money on. Lately, he just couldn\u2019t lose. \n\nHis had a very unique edge. He used his own life experiences to pick his stocks. This is how he came to settle on Microsoft for his latest options play. Steve used Teams in school and Windows on his wfh laptop. And, lately, his girlfriend had  started a job selling software or something online. He never really listened when she spoke, but her newly purchased Peloton spoke for itself. \n\nSteven looked at the charts. The 1D, then the 1W, then the 1M. He looked at how low it fell during the crash a month prior. Finally, he felt confident. Microsoft was reporting earnings in a week and was going to rip. He bought 2 MSFT 180, a safe bet considering it was at 171 already.\n\nSeveral days passed, his position slowly remaining steady. People on the sub whined about their calls losing value and something called theta. Losers, he thought. That\u2019s what they get for listening to TA.\n\nThe day of reckoning. He woke up excitedly but a little late to check his good fortune. Microsoft was up to 177 and climbing! He was going to make serious money. He opened robinhood and - this must be a glitch. Robinhood was red, how could this be? He\u2019d never seen the red theme before. He checked the sub, more people taking about bullshit TA now, IV crush or something. \n\nFuck! How could he be bested by TA! Then he looked closer...Fool! He had bought 180 puts not 180 calls! His account was ruined! No wonder it was red. Forget IV crush and theta. His account might be red but at least TA still means nothing. To think he had second guessed himself. \n\nOh well, there\u2019s always next earnings to make it up; Steven thought he would just have to double down on calls. He went downstairs to ask his girlfriend for some more money to \u201cinvest\u201d. She agreed and started transferring the money. \n\nHe looked at her phone and caught a glimpse of what looked like her transferring money, but... instead of Venmo... it was some app called OnlyFans. Fuck! He thought. More competition for Venmo, that\u2019s a bad look for his PayPal calls. He was gonna need more money.",

        "body": "Potential earnings plays:\n\nATVI: Bull Case: Will beat estimates. Forward guidance will be great considering new console releases and Christmas. Winner of election does not have a big impact. Trading below ATH and trading below price from previous earnings. Has been consolidated for a while and no pre-earnings run up. Free advertising in forms of celebrity streamers playing ATVI games is underappreciated.\n\nBear Case: Last earnings beat but was a buy the rumor sell the news ordeal. Do investors feel safe putting their cash in ATVI during these times? ATVI has burned lots of people who played their earnings.\n\nETSY: Bull Case: Has been consistently green in this massive sea of red. Profitable for 4 consecutive quarters with a recent S&amp;P inclusion. Advertising revenue should be up bigly. Etsy does a great job of retaining first time customers. COVID cases and potential lock downs help ETSY. Christmas around the corner.\n\nBear Case: No stimulus which impacts this non-essential business+. Lots of competition. Big run up post SNAP earnings largely in part of surprise ad revenue from SNAP earnings. This could very well be priced in and a beat could still result in a sell off. Large part of business was mask sales. IV very high and estimated EPS high\n\nTWTR: Bull Case: Increased users that will continue due to elections. Could have a major gap up like SNAP in large part of unexpected ad revenue. Potential for 10+ bagger.\n\nBear Case: Trading at ATH. Growing at a much slower rate in terms of Y/Y revenue and profitability versus its competitors (FB, SNAP, etc.) Lots of controversy this quarter. An insane run up to earnings. Expectations very high because of SNAP. Last quarter was atrocious. Expectations are a big increase in ad revenue. TWTR struggles with ad revenue in large part because it is a more text-heavy platform in a social media world dominated by visual ads. Not too profitable and operating at a loss.\n\nSQ: Gapped up on previous 4 earnings (feel free to fact check me this may be incorrect). Purchase of $50 mil in shitcoin and may offer crypton payments like PYPL. Has an edge on the younger demographics. Approved for bank opening in 2021. Cash app is very profitable (23% of revenue is profit) . Cash app is 62% of revenue. Price to sales lower than PYPL and V. Nice dip for good entry. Earnings not priced in (yet). SQ Card readers are a hot item with a big profit margin.\n\nBear Case: Competition from PYPL and Chase who just entered this market. Sort of a one trick pony that relies too much on revenue from Cash App. Already up 150% on the year. Do investors trust Jack Dorsey long term?\n\n\\*Disclaimer\\* I have no positions in any of these. This is hardly DD but just some quick analysis for a potential play. All depends on how the market reacts tomorrow. I'd stay away from TWTR unless you're buying puts. Now do your own DD you lazy fucks.\n\nEdit: I can add this as a flaired discussion post if you'd like to it doesn't get lost in this thread.",

        "body": "Depends a bit on your thoughts for growth in the financial industry. Personally I think banks have some high risk right now with long term unemployment creating issues for customers repaying loan debt. Could be good for high interest credit revenue but most people in the Us have scaled back dramatically on spending as well in the short term. So for financial sector, I\u2019ve focused on banks that generate revenue from investments and fin tech as opposed to traditional banks. \n\nCathie Wood is revered for her stock picking. And I do have about 3% in ARKF. Probably 7-10% total in financial sector right now. \n\nOther companies like Tencent and Alibaba are in ARKF since they handle digital payments in China. Huge growth over last 2-3 years even ore COVID cash was dying in China. See recent announcements from digital yuan being made available. Great play for fin tech. Look up wechat pay and Ali pay for more info there. Think of it like everyone in the US starts using Google pay or Apple Pay almost exclusively. \n\nMany of the others are e commerce sites which are obviously making a rise in sales during quarantine. Alibaba fits here as well, Mercado libre is the South American version of Amazon/alibaba. \n\nJust to name a few sides of their play. I believe this is the better side of the financial sector currently with significant chance for growth worldwide seeing the push towards touch-less payments. \n\nNow if life returns to normal and the US and Europe don\u2019t adopt mobile payments and we return to in person transactions the growth will level off. It\u2019s been on a huge run outperforming the market and I\u2019ve made quite a good return this year. I\u2019m holding some of this long term, but I may eventually trim some and put it back into banks once the debt risk is lowered.\n\nEdit: didn\u2019t see that last bit. As mentioned previously BABA, Tencent in China, AAPL, GOOGL, SQ, PYPL(Venmo) in the US, most of these have many facets to their business. PayPal and Square are the purest plays on mobile pay.",

There is a reason Elon Musk made a lot of money selling it lol.\n\nYou also underestimate the number of merchants that have paypal directly integrated which allows me to bypass needing my debit card on me or saved to my browser etc. Its much safer to use a bypass like PayPal as they act as a protected intermediary between you, your merchant, and your bank account. Thats huge - and Apple products are exclusively owned by a very small percentage of the overall market. Same with Chase Pay, google pay etc. They have to rely on people going all in on their products whereas PayPal works with all of them.",

I wouldn't doubt Amazon is a $10k/share company in 10 years.\n\nNvidia. They lead their share of the market pretty significantly, while I think their growth will slow down as companies like AMD grow more fierce in their competition, Nvidia also has their AI which I think (at least for a period of time) will be highly saught after as we move closer to automation I'm vehicles and everywhere else.\n\nMicrosoft. Great run company, also has capital to expand where they want, they've got completive cloud and they make shareholders happy. It's gonna be hard for them to lose shareholder support.\n\nCoca Cola. They're massive and while they don't dive in the snack industry, they can. And even without it they dominate the Bev industry and usually end up buying out small companies that may be disruptive.\n\nPaypal.

        "body": "So I like calendar spreads because they\u2019re risk defined positions; your max loss is the cost of entry. It can be neutral, bullish, or bearish; just depends how you feel about the stock. \n\nYou sell a short call (or put) 4-6 weeks out, and buy the same strike call/put a month further out. If the options are normally priced and IV for the stock is low, it should be a positive (long greater than short) delta (slightly; delta is your option price chance per $1 change in the underlying), theta (time decay per day), and vega (option price change per 1% move in IV, up or down) position. Gamma (change in delta per $1 change in underlying) is usually negative (short is higher than the long) so that\u2019s something to keep an eye on, but the theta decay and vega should more than offset gamma for while. \n\nSo with IV rising as earnings approaches, your short leg should increase in value, but so does your long leg. And as IV increase, theta also increases, much more so on the short leg. That\u2019s where you make your money. \n\nFor earnings, if I\u2019m bullish, I generally pick a strike about 5-10% OTM. My short leg expires the week of earnings; I rarely play monthly positions unless the earnings line up that week. In a perfect world, I\u2019ll hit that strike price the day earnings are announced and I can close around 100%. \n\nIf you\u2019re just playing a stock that\u2019s been stuck in a channel for a while (airlines and banks, recently), you can just open a position at the nearest strike price, call or put, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \n\nLastly, sometimes you\u2019ll get lucky and IV on the short leg will drop. This happened to me on a $PYPL position this week. Friday morning I opened my account and saw my $3-3.50 positions had moved to $5.25. $PYPL doesn\u2019t have earnings for a few more weeks, but my personal rule is 50% gains or better and I close that day. So I took my money and ran. \n\nTheta Gang isn\u2019t sexy. It\u2019s slow. It\u2019s boring. And there sure as shit aren\u2019t any 10 baggers to be bad. But you can almost consistently turn 10-20% profits per month without much effort, and you\u2019ll profit on 70% of your trades. They just take discipline to manage, and you\u2019ve got to do some research before entering a position.",
