I entered a sell order at my break even price and will leave it there---either it will be gone by the time I wake up tomorrow and then skyrocket or it will have tanked (or both). It's only a few bucks and 100 shares for me.  If you think there is another stock that will take off then it's a waste of money trying to recover .08 or whatever a share on this one, if that makes sense.  I only use RH for fun---not serious investing, which is why I am just blindly buying whatever people here say is good.\n\nI mean, look at HTZ---it went up 80 or 90% today. Why? It's in BR and people probably are under the misconception that their shares will blow up once it restructures.  99 of 100 times, however, inequitable it seems to me, the old shares go to 0 when/if the company liquidates and the shareholders are basically last in line to get anything back.\n\nGNUS moved 2500% on an announcement that they are releasing the \"Kartoon Channel\" (this was old news from last week, I believe) and that there was an \"important announcement.\" It makes absolutely no sense ...\n\nIn short, I have no idea, I'm sorry.  It seems that there are some insights in this sub that have led to very good gains and, I am sure, a lot that tank (but these do not get exposure at the top of all the posts, I guess).\n\nGo with your gut and be lucky enough to get in line with the herd.  When it seems to have hit some resistance, sell at least enough to cover your cost basis, and then do what you want with the rest.\n\nPersonally, I would have never made it to 2500% on GNUS unless I wasn't paying attention.  I would sell out sooner to lock profit probably by 500% in the event it reversed quickly.  I may then set a lower limit buy and see, because it is going to bounce up and down for a while until the 14th or 15th (I am assuming that is when the big announcement is coming).  Also beware of the shorts.  I haven't looked at the short interest, but it was probably relatively high.  GNUS started shooting up and they started trying to cover to minimize their losses.  If there were a lot of them, this may have been a big part of why it went so high (\"short squeeze\").",

I saw the prices increasing every single week.\n\nFrom memory, an entry level small 3 br 2 ba houses in the suburbs like Markham/Richmond when I came was about $180k-$200k in 2001. So, the stats hold true. It was still on the higher range of 2x median income.\n\n In 2002, the prices started skyrocketing. That same house was around $240k-$270k just a year later. I decided to rush and secure an entry level house in Markham for $270k, borrowing money for cash down from the family, as I knew this market will soon not be affordable to folks like me.\n\nThis house signed in the fall of 2002, delivered a year later ia today worth in the range of $900k.

Added interface of buttons for players to buy skins for guns while users work on their weapon loadout.   \n\nThere are league's where you need to buy team skins I guess.

Sure players can earn free in game currency over extended time,  say over a year.   \n\nI would buy some for long holding but it's boring and on my last 200.
