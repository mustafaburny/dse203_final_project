Aphria has turned things around but there was a very, very long stretch where they were not executing correctly and the past acquisition bullshit is still going to echo on the balance sheet for a long time.\n\nWhat's happening in Lesotho, LATAM, Israel, England?  Where are the thinstrips they PR'd?  The state of the art kitchen in Leamington where the edibles were going to roll out from?  The beverage partnerships they teased?\n\nSo it's nuance.  If you rightly crow about market share, leading multiple market segments, brand recognition, markedly improved flower etc you are also going to need to discuss goodwill, inventory, lawsuits.  It's how people talk about the cash but they don't talk about the debt.\n\nSo when I hear rah rah bullshit I like to counter it.  Just like when people shit on the company I like to counter that.\n\nPeople need to stop acting like these companies are their beloved sports teams.",
