Both manufacture chips, but the manufacture them for very different products. \n\nTSM primarily focuses on computer and smartphone chips(think AMD, Nvidia.) Basically they make the CPU\u2019s, GPU\u2019s, etc. I honestly don\u2019t know much about Skyworks, but it seems like they do a lot of things with radio frequency. So they make chips that allow phones or other devices to connect to wireless signals. \n\nSo you could certainly buy both and not have to worry about them stealing customers. They actually have some customer overlap (Tsm makes ARM bases chips for Apple and skyworks is making 5g chips for Apple.) \n\nI just like chip manufacturing companies in general. It is very difficult for companies to both manufacture and design chips. Just look at Intel. These chip manufactures do it better than the rest and they will always have customers as long as they keep improving their tech.",
