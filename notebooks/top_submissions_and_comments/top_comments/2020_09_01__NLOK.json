It goes way beyond traditional antivirus (McAfee, Symantec, Trend, etc). \n\nThe next gen endpoint protection vendors focus primarily on behaviour based detection rather than signatures. Collecting a large number of contextual metrics and then correlating these to detect indicators of compromise and prevent them effectively.\n\nCS are one of the best out there. Superb marketing. Lots of hype. Only vendor I've seen that goes toe-to-toe is Cybereason. They are not listed yet though, but keep an eye out.",

The tool is an incredible force multiplier if you have a SOC that knows what to do with it.",

By knowing tech I mean I\u2019m in the industry and I know what products are best and how well they\u2019re doing compared to others well before you see it in top line results - and definitely before wall st. who don\u2019t use the tech on the ground and see the trends competitively. There is no doubt that provides an edge on where to place your bets across B2B tech if you\u2019re competing, partnering, and integrating with the other players in the space and through your network. \n\nGreat example is new Relic. Everyone in the industry new they were getting killed way before their price halved because of architectural decisions and pricing mechanics changes. Everyone knew it was two players eating their lunch (stocks which have since some very well).\nSame with Symantec and Oracle and all their adjacent competitors. \n\nThere is just no way I could know that about energy and telecom at this juncture.\n\nMaybe I can get there but hard for me to make big bets on who is differentiating themselves when I have no idea how these guys differentiate their products and services.  \n\nAnd I guess just trying to figure out if it\u2019s worth investing time to understand another space as intimately without living and breathing it the way I have with tech. \n\nEdit: typos",
