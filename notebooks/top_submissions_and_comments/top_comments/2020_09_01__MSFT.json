        "body": "Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people.",

But will that provide enough growth to justify the current prices over the next 10-20 years?   I am not so certain.",

In 2016, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz served on the president\u2019s transition team, and two years later, dined with him at the White House, where she complained about a government contract she deemed unfair, Bloomberg reported. Vice President Mike Pence visited Oracle\u2019s headquarters in Redwood City, California. Catz has contributed more than $125,000 this year to support Trump\u2019s re-election, according to Federal Election Commission data. And Ellison let Trump use one of his California estates to hold a fund-raiser in February.\n\n&gt;In recent weeks, the U.S. president had publicly endorsed the Oracle bid and called Ellison a \u201ctremendous guy.\u201d Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro, who earlier came out against a potential sale to Microsoft and had at one time advocated banning TikTok completely, echoed that endorsement during an August appearance on Fox News.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-13/oracle-is-said-to-gain-advantage-in-deal-for-tiktok-in-u-s",

        "body": "\"Due to those losses, I stopped investing for a couple of months exactly when the prices were at minimum of the year.\"\n\nI think a broad issue with this sub that I've seen over the years is that people buy when things are good (eventually - this happens after a couple of months of half a dozen \"WHY IS THE MARKET GOING UP?\" threads every day), but when the market has a correction - something that used to be viewed as normal - it's viewed as almost apocalyptic. I saw a post the other day about Amazon being down 10% as a \"massive decline\" - if you cannot tolerate a 10% decline in Amazon don't own it, because there are times where that's the initial reaction to earnings. If a 10% decline throws your view of owning a company into question, then your thesis on why you bought it in the first place probably wasn't that strong. If something goes down 10% and you look at it in your portfolio and if your first instinct is to dump it, then that tells you exactly how strong you really feel about the company.  Growth stock investing is not going to be trees grow to the moon or years like this where Ark funds are up 70% or whatever they were; there's going to be periods that are highly volatile and far more volatile than the last month - look at growth names at the end of 2018.  This year with growth is not normal; it's a situation where things came together that benefited a lot of growth companies tremendously.\n\n1) I think people have to view a March when the VIX is 80 and the CNN Fear and Greed is 2 and yadda yadda as the time to really lean in. That's the time when if you have an even somewhat longer-term view you're getting opportunities. By the time this sub has warmed up to the market is not the time to lean in.\n\n2) People have to have a longer-term view and not this \"one foot out the door\" mentality where every bit of market volatility and events that might cause volatility is something to flee from. There's been way more threads in the last year where people talk about \"selling everything\" - not a decision that should be easy and a decision you should make very, very rarely - if ever. Volatility creates opportunities, you just have to think in months and years with purchases, not \"OMG WHAT IS THE MARKET GONNA DO TOMORROW?\"  \n\n\" I want to know how can I feel less sad about this.\"\n\nIt's a bummer and I'm sorry that you're dismayed at what happened but you're going to miss opportunities. Everyone does. I owned VFF when it was around $1 and sold not long before it went to $6 and then eventually the high teens. There's plenty of other instances over the years. I think what I'm looking for in terms of individual names has become specific enough that there are things that do well where I know I wouldn't have bought it any way, but with that it's not being bummed as much as trying to understand why it did well and any takeaways - could I have looked at it differently? Etc. If I missed something there's always going to be a bit of dismay, but I've gradually tried to be far more automated about it - is there is a lesson/takeaway from this? y/n? then move on.\n\nThere is going to be a lot of \"could haves\" throughout your time in investing. The issue I think becomes that was before and today is a new day - literally. Chasing now after what you could have done is not always going to be the best idea - have to look at it with a fresh perspective and consider what is the best long-term strategy to build on right now.\n\n\"When I backtested my ETF purchase across my deposit intervals, I found that I could have made 37.9% in returns\"\n\nCould have. I wouldn't base decision making on what things have done, the question becomes what is the potential going forward for the next 3-5 years. I look at my portfolio all the time with the thought of - if I was stuck with this portfolio tomorrow and couldn't sell it for 5 years, would I be okay with that? If something is a no, then changes need to be made. Things are bought with the intent of owning long-term and bought with the view of potential over the coming years. I have no idea what the market will do tomorrow or next week.\n\n\"When I want to invest smaller amounts of money, I have to rely on fractional shares and my brokerage doesn't provide that, so I have to shift to Robinhood or other trading platform.\"\n\nIf you want fractional shares, I'd much rather suggest Fidelity than RH. I don't see the appeal of RH at this point.\n\n\"AAPL 20%, MSFT 15%, AMZN 15%, \"\n\nSo half your portfolio is the household names everyone already knows, likes and probably owns. These are not bad companies and I think they will continue to do well in the future, but I also do think that it's at a point where people have to devote more if they're going to be in tech to finding growth beyond FANG names.",

        "body": "Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people.",

Vice President Mike Pence visited Oracle\u2019s headquarters in Redwood City, California. Catz has contributed more than $125,000 this year to support Trump\u2019s re-election, according to Federal Election Commission data. And Ellison let Trump use one of his California estates to hold a fund-raiser in February.\n\n&gt;In recent weeks, the U.S. president had publicly endorsed the Oracle bid and called Ellison a \u201ctremendous guy.\u201d Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro, who earlier came out against a potential sale to Microsoft and had at one time advocated banning TikTok completely, echoed that endorsement during an August appearance on Fox News.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-13/oracle-is-said-to-gain-advantage-in-deal-for-tiktok-in-u-s",

        "body": "&gt;it doesn't seem like value can outperform growth in any time horizon in the past several decades.\n\nThat is completely incorrect. It is only true for the last 10 years or so...as seen in this chart, up until that time Value beat Growth by a huge margin (about 4% per year on average) [https://www.whitcomb.com/market-insights/march-2016-market-insight](https://www.whitcomb.com/market-insights/march-2016-market-insight) . Also, small/mid cap has historically outperformed large cap...another trend that has been reversed over the past 10 years. The reason for this is pretty clear...extremely low interest rates favor growth. Add to that the recent influx of new investors riding the tech bubble that think those stocks only go up and that the company fundamentals don't matter at all...and there you go. Unless the fed will keep interest rates at 0 forever, sooner or later we can expect a reversion to the mean. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind, any stock that has grossly over performed during any 10 year period tends to under perform during the following 10 years. To see this as an example, look at the top 10 in market cap from 10 years ago...now compare that to the 10 today. You can do that for any period. You'll see very few companies can stay on that list for any amount of time...and other than Microsoft, not a single company on the list from 1999 was on the list in 2019. In fact, if you would have invested an equal amount into each of those \" can't miss\" growth companies from 1999 you would have portfolio that has severely under performed the market today.",

Bullish call-option buying has exploded. Over the past month, traders have bought almost 15 times the number of call options expiring in November of those FAANG stocks, plus Microsoft and Tesla, than the equivalent number of put options.\n\n....\n\n\nWhen call-option buying spikes, it drives call sellers to buy underlying stock, sending shares higher. When brokers sell options contracts, they don\u2019t want to take the risk of what happens to the underlying stock. Brokers only want to earn a commission selling\u2014and trading\u2014the options. Often times, brokers buy underlying stock to hedge their book of business. That way, any gains or losses on options positions are offset by corresponding gains in the underlying stock prices.\n\nSo any explosion in call-option buying generates stock buying on the Street. That\u2019s one way to explain the 20% rise of those tech stocks since July.\n\nIt\u2019s also a way to explain the recent two day collapse. Call-option trading volume Thursday in those tech stocks was down by roughly two-thirds compared with recent highs.\u201d",
