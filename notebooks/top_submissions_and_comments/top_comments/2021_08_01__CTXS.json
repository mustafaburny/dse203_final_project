The ones that always pop into my mind include Cisco, Intel, GE, Akamai, VeriSign, Checkpoint. Citrix. I'm sure there are more examples including companies that eventually failed or were delisted. \n\nAnd please don't ask me why they pop into my mind.",

On-premise hardware will start to linger in favour of cloud, VDI is useful for legacy apps but a lot of companies struggled with remote working because they used thin client devices that were bound to the office and as great as Carbon Black might look, Microsoft will continue to grow its security capabilities and take more of the market as enterprise organisations consolidate and get more value for money from their M365 licences.\n\nCitrix is another great company that needs to transform itself before it\u2019s too late, at least they have more patented technology than Microsoft partner with to use with their WVD offering (HDX technology).",
