I\u2019ve literally watched it for more than a decade, only held just smaller positions on corrections - in 2010 ( in retrospect should have gone all in back then) and last year. Just recently in the dip I went in very big. I figure I can just keep adding each time it dips another ~15-20% if that happens.\n\nIt\u2019s very similar to Adobe, Autodesk pretty much followed their lead with SAAS. But I think 30% of Autodesk has a much stronger moat than a larger percentage of Adobe. If Adobe ever buys Autodesk (big price) it would be quite a powerhouse.",

        "body": "Dividends are misleading because share buybacks do the same thing while being more tax-efficient. Many companies that don't pay dividends, buyback shares.\n\nIt's quite easy to look at the full picture by referring to the Financing Cash Flows on the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nIt shows debt repaid, dividends paid and shares repurchased. Dividends paid and shares repurchased are both capital returns to the shareholder. \n\nThis is important because by focusing on dividends only, you're ignoring companies that always return capital via buybacks.\n\nLook at FB, they've bought back stock for the past 4 years. The amount of shares they bought in 2020 is equivalent to 0.7% yield at current price but you don't get taxed on it.\n\nADBE buybacks in 2020 is equivalent to 1.1% yield.\n\nGOOGL buybacks in 2020 is equivalent to a whopping 2.02% yield at current price. It would be &gt;4% yield if bought in March last year.\n\nLooking at dividends alone, TSLA and the above stocks look the same. But TSLA which issues stock every year so they're complete opposites.\n\nCompanies like NVDA pay a dividend but recently they haven't been buying back stock, instead they've been issuing more stock than buying and they've taken on more debt. \n\nLooking at cash flow also helps you know which companies are on the net NOT returning cash to shareholders because they're diluting stock and/or adding debt to the balance sheet.\n\nAnyway you will find many companies buyback more stock than they pay in dividends (like MSFT) so you are missing half the yield. All these companies could buyback 0 stock and instead pay it all as a dividend and their yields would jump dramatically e.g. MSFT yield would be over 2% including buybacks.",

        "body": "**TL;DR:**\n\nThere is stock overvaluation going on covering a vast area of the market (high caps, mega caps), while some other (mid, small caps) are bleeding out in valuation. But the overvaluation has probably even reached supposed \"safe picks\" (I'll go into some ruminations below on MSFT).\n\n**Go by your own convictions** \\- because whatever opinion of either side is being postulated here currently has a 50/50 chance of being the \"right one\".\n\n*In depth personal opinion:*\n\nIs being on the sidelines at this point \"fearful\"? Is it \"greed\" that makes current valuations possible? A mix of FOMO, retail investors with supposedly too much free cash they don't need otherwise for any daily necessities or paying their mortgage / rent? Big institutions rotating into supposed \"safe havens\"?\n\nThe old \"Be greedy when others are fearful...\" trope. The real question is how do you know the current market participants are being greedy? \n\nOr are you the fearful one on the wrong side?\n\nIt's just that most people - especially in the recent market tide - do not know which side is being \"fearful\". \n\nLet's assume the ones reciting Buffet mean the people supposedly crying \"wolf\" (\"Crash\", \"Bubble!\" etc.) and the \"greedy\" ones are the people shouting \"No worries!\", \"Stonks only go up!\", \"Shut up and take my money, anonymous guy selling tesla for $700!\", \"This time is different!\" etc. \n\nOr are the ones being not fearful enough the ones buing TSLA for $700, thinking this is totally OK to pay someone for one share? And the greedy ones are \"waiting for the dip\" that might never come quickly so they're missing out a massive growth spurt (right now -&gt; date X?)\n\nWho's right? Who's wrong?\n\nWe're going to find out sooner or later - the timing of any market correction has never been exactly pinpointed other than *post factum*.\n\nI can only tell you that I have a severe \"This time is not different than 2000 .com valuation overflow\" vibe. One part of my brain tells me \"this can only go on for at least 2021\" and the reptilian part tells me to stay the hell away from that overcrowded concert when everyone is running to the exits in case of a fire.\n\nThe mix we currently have has never existed in the past, so I give it to the people to say \"what's the big deal?\" - well, the big deal is this:\n\nThe economy is being propped up - unhealthily I might add - via mainly central bank QE and as a last resort \"helicopter money\" (FED) being dropped on people it makes for an unhealthy overflow of cash in totality. Really, [read up on using \"helicopter money\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_money) in any given monetary policy for whatever the reason might be to grab the straw. You might, as did many others, quickly come to the conclusion that it should be the *last* straw to grab for in case of desperation.\n\nOn the same note, read up on [Zombie Companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/america-s-zombie-companies-have-racked-up-1-4-trillion-of-debt) being propped up way beyond their due dates, economically speaking. You might actually have the stock of one, even.\n\nCome on... a P/E of 40+ approaching for Microsoft? They are constantly hitting ATH - to me this is the signal stock for the inflow of supposed \"smart money\" cash into large caps.\n\nLet's stay with Microsoft.\n\nHow has their intrinsic value gained +40% (taking the pre-March 2020 dip $188 notation and the current $259 notation) roughly in around twelve months? Yes, we have moved to a \"working from home\" and \"entertainment at home\" period. Forced by governmental policies, one might remember. So are institutional investors and retail investors now pumping their free cash to the \"devil they know\" kind of stock because \"MSFT? Too big to fail!\" thinking? \n\nIs the \"Corona\" Effect taken duly under assumption to be a \"one-off\" inflow of mainly companies throwing around big money to supposed solutions to the speed with which \"working from home\" needed to be rushed out in 2020? Some didn't have a clue how to do this. Consultants everyhwere made big cash on this one, as did all the obvious winners like DocuSign, MSFT, Adobe (to a lesser extent but still) and others in the same area. \n\nMS Teams was a big winner, obviously, being tied into the Office Suite. Will this continue \"post-Corona\"? Xbox grew exponentially with Game Pass and so on. So big wins all around, whoop-dee-doo!\n\nI'm not saying it's already an overvaluation in this specific case, but the speed in which it happens seems borderline insane since MS is not growing their business by +40% after all the \"stay at home\" mania is ended or at least approaching a more mixed level of people regaining their freedoms and office workplaces moving back into full capacity. \n\nDo we have a high potential for continued \"working from home\" in a mixed scenario, reducing office presence? And more gaming subscriptions being purchased for Xbox?\n\nAbsolutely. \n\nIs that alone worth +40% *growth* for the next 5 years for MSFT, continuing the current trend? \n\nPersonally, I can't see this trajectory being overall healthy or justified *for the near to mid-term future*.\n\nSo: Is MSFT is now maybe approaching a \"fair forward valuation\" after the hefty March 2020 corrections, which we now know were a great buying opp in hindsight? What happens in 2021 going forward? Will they now be a super \"boring\" $280 stock, as they have been for long stretches in the past at lower valuations, sideways trading for years?\n\nOr: will they maybe deflate downwards, slowly or maybe more quickly, to a rough P/E of 35 (NASDAQ avg) once people begin to realize that all the growth has b*een already realized in recent valuations* and will try to ease out of their positions or just keep it in lack of any other monetary saving, or because it's \"tax locked\" in their 401K? \n\nFYI a P/E of 35 would put them around a $227 \"avg valuation\" currently. Let's see!",

        "body": "Last September I started investing in the same 20  or so stocks: ATT, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Shopify, Etsy, Square , Adobe, Amazon, Disney, Pinterest, Sony, Netflix, Chewy, Starbucks , GE... etc. I would use a weekly 3 week moving average to determine whether I should  buy or sell on a daily basis. I also established a few other rules like reinvest any earnings into stocks below the average as well as average down the ones that had not yet gone up. Once sold, those averaged down stocks I would not rebuy for over 31 days to avoid a wash sale and I would never sell until I had at least a 1.5 percent overall return on each sale. I did this daily and in about three months I had made close to a 25 percent gain over what I started with. Unfortunately, this portfolio of stocks leans heavily in the tech sector and as you can tell has never been too diversified. A good amount of the money has been in these stocks since a lot of them dropped by a decent percentage but are now slowly rising and I anticipate being out of the red in the next couple of weeks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question to you all is , could you please recommend some other sectors and or specific stocks that I can use this same strategy with. I'm not necessarily looking for rising stocks, more so stable ones that hover around a certain price point. Thanks.",

        "body": "Avoid Paywall: \n\nUnder the lights of Tesla\u2019s Big Top, you\u2019re never quite sure what sort of show you\u2019re going to get.\nBut luckily for us, ringmaster Elon Musk brought along the whole circus on Monday night. There was the $594m of operating income that was exclusively down to Tesla selling $101m of bitcoin and $518m of pure-profit regulatory credits. And, of course, there was the mumbly conference call in which Musk\u00a0attacked the media, waffled about Tesla\u2019s autonomous tech, and delayed several of its key catalysts to 2022.\nThose details, however, have been covered elsewhere by the likes of\u00a0these pink pages,\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s Liam Denning\u00a0and the\u00a0WSJ\u2019s Charley Grant. In FT Alphaville\u2019s humble opinion, they\u2019re all worth a read.\n\nBut there was another oddity less discussed: a weird formatting quirk in the\u00a0shareholder deck\u00a0itself.\nTurn to page 5, and cast your eyes to the third paragraph down:\n\ufffcRemember here: Tesla\u2019s bitcoin sale represented just over a fifth of its net income, and this is only the time it was mentioned, so this isn\u2019t an immaterial line in the deck.\nAnyway, notice anything weird? Yes, that\u2019s correct, the line detailing cost reductions and the $101m of bitcoin sales is not only in a different font, but a slightly different shade of grey.\nEven weirder is that the text \u2014 unlike the rest of the paragraph \u2014 can\u2019t be highlighted. Check it out:\n\ufffcWhat\u2019s more, none of the words in the sentence can be searched. Try it yourself \u2014 hit CTRL+F (or CMND+F, if you\u2019re one of those types) and type \u201cbitcoin\u201d. Only two hits, despite being mentioned three times in the document.\nNow, we weren\u2019t quite sure what was going on here, so we decided to run the document through Adobe Acrobat Pro DC\u00a0which allows you to edit the PDF and see the different text and formatting elements. (Not a pitch for the product, we\u2019re sure you use it anyway to be honest.)\nHere\u2019s how it looks:\n\ufffcTake a look at the key paragraph \u2014 rather than being its own separate text box, it\u2019s split into two parts.\nThere\u2019s more. Once you start to move the different items around the page, it becomes clear that the offending line is not even text at all. In fact, it\u2019s an image.\nHere\u2019s what it looks like when you pull that image out of the paragraph:\n\ufffcSo what is going on? Well, it wasn\u2019t a late edit to the PDF to override an existing piece of text, because there\u2019s no other text below the image. So we can just about rule out that explanation.\nA more sinister one might be that Tesla\u2019s investor relations department knew journalists, investors and algos would be scanning the text for any mention of bitcoin sales, and wanted to try to hide the fact that these helped to boost the bottom line so much.\n\nWe\u2019d love to have asked Tesla for their own explanation so that we wouldn\u2019t be forced to resort to conjecture, but the company disbanded its public relations team in 2020. Oh well.\nInstead FT Alphaville asked Nick Mazing, director of research at data provider Sentieo, how common JPEGs in earnings presentations were, and he said:\n\nJPEGs in SEC filings are mostly seen in 8-Ks containing slides from investor\u00a0presentations or in proxy statements. It is highly unusual to have all images 8-K filings for earnings: this makes searching and redlining against prior versions harder or impossible. The argument one hears from Investor Relations and proxy voting professionals is that JPEGs enhance the communication with ordinary investors. But it certainly brings up the question, is reducing searchability and comparability in the spirit of disclosure requirements, or is it not?\n\nIt would be ridiculous to suggest investor obfuscation from most blue-chip companies, but Tesla does have a history of making its documents difficult to read. In the third quarter of 2019 it\u00a0switched the format\u00a0of its earnings releases from a document format to a presentation, and with it the text became greyer and therefore trickier to focus on. In the same quarter, it also decided to change to reporting all of its numbers in the millions, rather than the thousands. In effect, three digits got removed from every number that mattered both in the earnings release and the ensuing SEC filing.\nThis latter tweak was particularly curious as some six-digit numbers had repeated across Tesla\u2019s filings. For instance, in\u00a02017\u2019s third quarter\u00a0and\u00a02019\u2019s first quarter\u00a0its work-in-process inventory number was exactly $277,155,000.\nUnder the same line item in\u00a02019\u2019s second quarter, the figure was $334,641,000. In the\u00a0following quarter\u00a0when Tesla decided to report in the millions? $335,000,000.\nWhether it\u2019s in its figures, its\u00a0guesstimates, its attacks on the media, or its production struggles, it seems history repeats more often than not at Tesla.\nTesla\u2019s shares closed Tuesday evening at 704.74, down 4.53 per cent on the day.",

Invest 90% of your portfolio in EV, Renewables, Alt Energy, and 10% in Tech\n4. Use the Roth IRA conversation latter, staying within your tax bracket move your positions over to the ROTH annually\n5. Reevaluate your portfolio in 4 years time from now.\n\nDo Weekly and Monthly Candlestick Chart Technical Analysis on your investments.\n\nStocks to consider: TSLA, AAPL, BEEM, GEVO, HYLN (Carful with this one), CLSK, FCEL, PLUG, WKHS (carful with one too), QS, CHPT, BEPC, REGI, FANG, ENPH... lol list goes on for miles. But you get my point. That's what I would anyway...\n\nPS... Probably a good idea to leverage some crypto too. DOGE, because it's going to moon the next 5 years, BTC (if you can afford it), ETH. Maybe some stable coin too.",
