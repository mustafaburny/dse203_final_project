        "body": "OK yes: Nvidia, because they have Mellanox (Mellanox is a great company and their only serious competitor for HPC is Solarflare (now owned by Xilinx)). I think I did allude to the fact that for my (anecdotal) use case, NIC performance &amp; integration would be paramount (vs being stuck with PCI and its limitations). With the Mellanox acquisition, Nvidia is clearly going for the HPC/cloud server business in a big way.\n\nAMD can do it too, but all I was saying is you have to then look much farther than just the current story of stealing Intel's x86 CPU revenues: I believe that the future of server space will be much more about integrated SoCs vs selling CPU chips for OEM mobos. You do make a good point re: clients connecting their own designs. There's already a lot of stuff out there that you can do things with (Xilinx FPGAs with ARM cores etc). But for something to scale (customers' needs, time to market), I think it needs to be an out-of-the-box integrated system running Linux with full NIC support etc. so that I can just compile the software and run it like I would today on a Xeon or an AMD server.\n\nAs for Intel, yes they have Altera and a bunch of stuff, but they have their difficulties now (and a long track record of failing e.g. with their mobile Atom stuff).\n\nWhen you say \"x86's inherent advantages over ARM\", what exactly do you have in mind? Software now is a lot more seamless between the two than what it was say 10 years ago.",
