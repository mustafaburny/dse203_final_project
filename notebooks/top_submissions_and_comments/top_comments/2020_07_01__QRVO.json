I would definitely buy these over QCOM or INTC. \n\nIf you want more growth (and therefore risk), you can go with AMD, MU, QRVO, or SWKS. Though do keep in mind that NVDA is growing very quickly. \n\nAlso, AVGO has a nice dividend.\n\nMy top semiconductor stock is NVDA. I want to buy in, but it\u2019s pretty overvalued. But it also keeps going up.",
