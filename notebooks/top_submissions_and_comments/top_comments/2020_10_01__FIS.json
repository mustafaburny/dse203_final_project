        "body": "A word of caution. There is an endless amount of \"free\" youtube videos and courses from TD Ameritrade, TastyTrade, eTrade, Fidelity, etc. But, what they don't show you is how someone actually puts that knowledge to practice into developing a strategy that allows you to make an income while properly managing risk. The course I went through helped with that and may be most people don't necessarily have the issues that I ran into using these courses. But, in hindsight, I wasted way too much time just going through these free videos without really understanding how they work in the real world.     \n    \nEdit: I didn't want to appear as if I'm spamming but I got a couple of DMs asking about the course I took. It's from ZipTrader. You can get 70% of the information from his youtube channel. But, I wanted something more structured and he really goes in a lot more detail in the course. I highly recommend it. Check out his free videos on YouTube particularly the one on why he is a trader and if it resonates with you (like it did for me), and you want to go ahead and check out the course, DM me for a discount coupon.",

Start as soon as you can part with the $100 and just try to get 1% better everyday. This is better than trying to sift through a bunch of sleepy and amateur learning resources. Fidelity also has the same thing but I prefer TD Ameritrade. I think these are both reputable places to start with educational resources and offer enough customer service. I prefer TD Ameritrade.",

Some people complain that they can\u2019t get to the level they want so they change brokerages. \n\nIn my experience Tastyworks is the most liberal in giving out option permissions and I think they are a little cheaper.\n\nI trade with TW, TDA and Fidelity. I trade Roth accounts and cash accounts. \n\nThe Roth and IRA accounts have limited trading permissions but I\u2019m ok with that. You can\u2019t have margin you can\u2019t sell naked calls. \n\nYou want to be able to trade ...\n\nCash secured puts\nCovered calls\nSingle leg calls/puts\nAnd importantly call/put spreads\n\nIf you BUY an option, that is your max loss. \n\nIf you SELL an option, that is your max gain. \n\nI strongly suggest that you take advantage of TOS paper trading. It\u2019s free. Practice trading options for months. For free. No risk. You can practice all the strategies and most importantly learn to manage a trade. \n\nYou will need to roll a trade out in time to give yourself more time to be right. You can also roll a trade out and up/down. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to teach you how to trade, but option trading requires management. It is as important to manage winners as well as losers. \n\nMonths ago I bought SNAP at $19.8x and sold a $20 covered call for $1. That is 5%. Not bad for a month. \n\nI\u2019ve rolled it out and up so I now have a $25 covered call. I\u2019m still ITM but the point is that it\u2019s never only one trade. And the trade isn\u2019t over. \n\nAm I an expert - no. But just realize that options trading is not one and done. It\u2019s not. \n\nAnd it is a sum zero game. Your lose is my gain. We all don\u2019t profit. Stocks go up and everyone wins. That is not true with options. \n\nYou need to be very smart to make money. Smarter than average. Are you?\n\nPaper trade. See how you stand.",

(I've only ever used Schwab, which is fantastic, but the others are known for great support.)\n* Financial advice and free workshops\n* As far as I can tell, better order flow. Schwab abides by NBBO and provides price improvement on approximately\n90% of orders. (Unlike RH, other brokerages apparently don't make a lot of money on order flow.)\n* Native real-time trading apps (Schwab has StreetSmart, Fidelity has Active Trader Pro)\n* Roboadvisors\n\nNone of this costs anything extra, though tailored financial advisor services do come extra.\n\nI think one of the big draws of a brokerage like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard is access to mutual funds. At Robinhood you're limited to stocks, which includes ETFs. Mutual funds offer a wider range of funds, including target date funds and tax management funds. (Contrary to what many people on Reddit seem to believe, mutual funds don't just mean expensive actively managed funds! There are tons of cheap funds, and some that are even cheaper than ETFs.) For example, my IRAs are all in target date funds that have a fee of just 0.08%.\n\nIf I were starting out today, I'd pick Vanguard. Fantastic company with a uniquely altruistic vision.",

There are more ideal ways, and if you're investing long term, you would want assistance limiting taxes as much as possible, but there is absolutely no reason why you couldn't start a small fund on your own through robinhood.\n\nBond ETFs you might look at are TLT, TIPS, BND, and of course there are tons of others (those just happen to cover different durations or different strategies, so I thought I would toss out some names so you start looking at what different bonds have for goals -- read the prospectus).\n\nA basic 80/20 portfolio or 60/40 would simply be something like (VT, VTI, VOO - Pick one for now or similar equivalents, but VTI is generally considered slightly lower risk than the other two, with good exposure to the full USA market) and add BND to the bond portion, for simplicity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Going to pitch Fidelity to you here, and explain why (full disclosure, I have a broker account with Fidelity, but they are not my primary broker)  :\n\nIf you intend on investing long term, you should get professional financial advise, and be aware that a company like Fidelity, which actually does handle mutuals, tax advantaged acccounts, retirement plans, and so forth, might be a better choice than a broker that you have to email even for simple questions. Fidelity also offers fractional shares, including on ETFs, and they have good customer service available via phone. That would be my move from the start, before you have to start moving funds from one broker to another, as long term investing like this includes trying to reduce taxes and fees as much as possible as part of the general strategy.",

And I would say, often because Joel and I and all the other fund managers started as Fidelity research analysts, when a new analyst arrives, they usually show up at my office with a list, and say \u201cI'm the new railroad analyst. Here are my names, and I like XYZ railroad because the group's trading at 14 times earnings, and this ones trading at 11 times earnings.\u201d And I might say, \u201cWow, that's interesting. Why is that one trading at such a discount to the group?\u201d And the analysts might say, \u201cWell, they just lost their largest customer\u201d or \u201cthey've got a big business into Mexico and Mexico's into a recession,\u201d or \u201cTrump wants to build a wall and therefore the Mexican business is falling off a cliff.\u201d **And I usually say, \u201cThat's not the type of company I'm interested in. I'm interested in companies that are doing well, where the earnings outlook is positive, where earnings per share is growing. Maybe it's growing faster than people think. What do you have on your list that would fit that bill even if it's more expensive than the average company in your group?\u201d** So, it's that's sort of give-and-take. And I might encourage an analyst to reorient their priority list to help me look for stocks that fit my ideal pattern.\" (https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/the-long-view/40)\n\nToo many people I think jump to an Intel because \"LOOKS CHEAP!\" when they'd have been better off with the things that appear more expensive where the company is doing well and the outlook is positive.\n\nIntel spent $15B on Mobileye, and for all the discussion of self driving, I don't know that I've heard anything much regarding Mobileye probably since they bought it.\n\nLastly,\n\n\"Intel completely missed out on the smartphone revolution, too, having been unable to come up with an answer for the rise of the ultra-low-power ARM SoC. After its smartphone insurgency, ARM chips quickly moved on Intel's territory by spreading to tablets and laptops. Intel's latest black eye is being completely dumped by Apple, which, after building its own ARM design house for the iPhone and iPad, has announced plans to upscale its ARM chips to Mac laptops and desktops.\"\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/heads-roll-at-intel-after-7nm-delay/\n\n\"Laptops and desktops are the next great frontier for Apple's chip division. That division will help the company avoid the same fate that has befallen Android smartwatch manufacturers: letting some other company dictate your product lineup. Apple's plans to update the Mac have often been stymied by Intel's product roadmap, and Intel does not make chips that serve all of Apple's design priorities. The new CPU will be just one part of an Apple-designed system-on-a-chip that would also include (among other things) an Apple GPU and a desktop version of Apple's Neural Engine machine learning and AI processor found in the iPhone and iPad.\"\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/this-is-apples-roadmap-for-moving-the-first-macs-away-from-intel/\n\n\"Intel actually says that the issues with its current 7nm production means that production is trending a year behind its internal roadmap. For some reason, though, the company says that being a year behind schedule will still only result in that aforementioned six-month delay to market. For comparison, AMD has already been outputting its own Ryzen 4000 chips based on its 7nm architecture for months, which have been handily outperforming Intel\u2019s offerings.\"\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu",

I had major paper hands, and just couldn't resist checking the prices to see if I had lost a few dollars. \n\nI would say that most people would and should be investing as early as possible, reason being that you can put money in index funds and hold for the long term. Trading is a different matter, I would say that around the age of 15-16 is probably a good time to start. Start with a little bit, and play around with it. The reason being is that you're able to experiment and learn things about the market before actually committing larger amounts of money. \n\nAs for starting off, I would highly recommend watching youtube videos or a udemy course on investing basics, as well as looking at Investopedia. Those in combination with reading posts on specific reddit subs (r/stocks, r/finance, r/stockmarket, r/options) helped me get started. Reading reddit posts gets me more interested into trading. Stay away from WSB though, there's a lot more meme material there.\n\nIf you want to invest and not trade, then research basic market principles, how index funds/ETFs work, and research various ETFs. Generally I like to look at total market index funds, mid-large cap company funds, and emerging markets/fast growing markets such as Tech, EV, and Cannabis.\n\nIf you want to minimize risk, hold ETFs for the long term. Open a brokerage account through Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Schwab, etc and put a portion of your paycheck into it. I actually really like this short document that has an ETF trading strategy: [https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)\n\nTL;DR: Look at a basic investing course on Udemy or YouTube to learn basics of the market, and read about things on specific reddit subs. Invest and don't trade (investing tends to be holding for the long term while trading tends to be more short term). Invest in ETFs, and there are many different resources for finding which ones to invest in.",
