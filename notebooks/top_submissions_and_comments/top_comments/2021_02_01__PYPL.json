Those scientists and engineers didn't magically materialize around them from thin air. Brilliant minds have always been here, but for large projects such as these you need an individual with a vision, self-drive to act upon it and make enough money for a company to survive in the process at least. And people like these are few and far between for some reason. They are deservedly in the spotlight, because they are leaders that made those projects a reality. Yes, those scientists and engineers did the vast majority of the \"manual labor\", but they wouldn't do it on their own, if somebody didn't brought them together, gave them a common direction and paid them for their work. \n\nI'm an engineer, but I don't understand this devaluing of leadership and management in the company that some people do, as if it is somehow less important. I'm talking about real management and leadership of course, not a human centipede of kinder-management sticking from the asses of their superiors in the corporate ladder of halfway disintegrated corporations (looking at you, IBM).",

Both are valid strategies that have made me money, and show how there are multiple ways to succeed in stocks.\n\nIn terms of YouTubers, I follow too many to list. Jeremy from [Financial Education](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMn36GT_H0X-w5_ckLtlgQ) is the obvious place to start, and then start branching out from there as you find more YouTubers who match your investing style and/or stock portfolio. As someone who owns Chinese stocks, I like the pleasantly British, animal-loving, Hong Kong-based [Felix Finance](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJtfma0mE_XrBAD9uakcjfA).\n\nI might get hate for this, but I watch a lot of CNBC, including Squawk on the Street, Fast Money, and Mad Money. All of those shows keep me perfectly in tune with the market, and have made me money. Just from this past year, CNBC helped me get a jump on PayPal, CRM, Tapestry and CVX.\n\nAs for podcasts, the best is probably [Best Stocks Now](https://www.gundersoncapital.com/radio-show-archives/). Since reddit trends younger and liberal, I always warn that this podcast host is a Republican Baby Boomer \u2014 but boy does he know his stocks. All the Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha podcasts are also worth checking out.",

IMO way better plays in disruptive tech out there that actually have a viable product and earnings. I also dont like the fact that you cant safely invest a large amount of money in the coins and hold them without a high risk . Many people have lost hundreds of millions in Bitcoin when they lost access to their private keys through whatever means. It also kind of annoys me that I cant buy a lot of these coins in my brokerage acct. and almost 12 years later there is still not an ETF with a good mix of crypto you can just buy without a premium. I say skip it, who cares if it goes to a million, too much uncertainty and you can find stuff out there that is a lot more likely to keep doubling with lower risk (ex. cannabis oplays, SPCE, JMIA etc.). Theoretically I own some BTC through all my ARK ETFs which have a lot of companies that either own or process crypto transactions, such as SQ and PYPL, ICE etc, that is the safer way to play it. Also safer may be BLOK ETF for indirectly owning crypto without huge risk when it tanks.",
