        "body": "Well, as a finance professional with over twenty years of experience, i will tell you that what you are doing is not analysis. Stocks are not an absolute thing. The value of something is never judged in isolation. An apple (an actual fruit) has a value dependent on where the apple is.  An apple in an apple orchard is worth much less than an apple in a desert. You need to compare stocks with others in the sector. What is the price it is trading at. How does the company\u2019s health compare to others in the same sector. Also remember that our equity markets are near perfect competition. All news is available to all participants. Therefore the price a stock is trading at is always its current fair price, discounting for all available information. The price is an equilibrium between positive and negative expectations. Just as an example, payc stock trades at a PE of 90. This means that an investor would need to accumulate earnings of the company for 90 years to break even on the cash paid upfront. (In a simplistic way). 160 million in annual earnings supporting a 16 billion market capitalisation. Looking at green markers in some website which has applied some filters to the stock price is not a very intelligent way to analyse. Perhaps you should think about if you would want to invest your entire retirement money into the payc stock. That is what I think about when I am looking at investing. \n\nTrading is a different animal. If you are talking about trading, you MUST talk about take profit and stop losses on your trades. It is risk reward strategy. Assuming that you are right about 50% of the time, a 1:2 stop loss / take profit level will leave you with a profit and limit losses. \n\nNot that it may do you any immediate good, my strong suggestion is to study market economics theory and actually stake some money on your ideas. Nothing brings clarity as making or losing money. These are not immediate solutions. But this will make you a better analyst over time. You have to come out green over a boom and bust cycle. Typically a 5 to 10 year period. \n\nAlso read a lot of research. See what factors good research analysts look for. How they think about valuations. And then start thinking about is this a good business to buy at this price? The price is a crucial element. It may be the best business in the planet but is is worth the asking price. Is there any logical way in which the price will increase or decrease over time. As mentioned before, all participants of the market have all the information in the market. Therefore company valuations are dependent on the company\u2019s efforts and also on external factors. \n\nI will also encourage you to read company financial presentations and earnings releases. It will not teach you to be a better analyst but it will certainly tell you which numbers are important and what the company\u2019s outlook for their business is.",
