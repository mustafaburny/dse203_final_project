I\u2019ll save you the boredom, but it was one horrible company with a marketing department so impressive that they had us all seeing a silly puppet at night while we slept.\n\nPets.com got everything right except the part where you put together a properly run management and logistics team to keep costs from killing you while you\u2019re out spending every last penny on marketing. Pets burned their candle at both ends: losing money on just about every single thing they sold without the benefit of free advertising and hype from social media creators. Rivian has been both much smarter, and simply had an easier advertising road to take. They aren\u2019t streaming millions of dollars a week sponsoring the Sun bowl or some shit. \n\nInstead, Rivian has been controlling costs; auto manufacturing is it\u2019s just an unbelievably high up front capital business. Thing is though: they\u2019ve got 4-5 years of cash on hand. Pets had 4-5 minutes, tops. Rivian partnered with one tech firm and one auto manufacturer to keep the number of roosters in the henhouse to a minimum. Pets.com took in money from anyone and everyone willing, and with them, their agenda, vision, and demands. \n\nIs Rivian worth anything near what the stock is selling for? Absolutely not. They just aren\u2019t the complete windbag that pets was.\n\nAssuming that they aren\u2019t cooking the books in a massive fraud conspiracy, I see Rivian getting a high and tight 90% amazon style correction before either recovering to reasonable levels or being gobbled up by one of the larger automakers willing to fulfill amazon\u2019s van order, or to simply buy out the IP they\u2019ve certainly built up.",

You've wrongly assumed they're the same company and deserve the same valuation.\n\n2013 - $4130\n\n2014 - $4681 (13% growth)\n\n2015 - $5010 (7% growth)\n\n2016 - $6910 (38% growth)\n\n2017 - $9714 (40% growth)\n\n2018 - $11716 (20% growth)\n\n2019 - $10918 (-7% growth)\n\n2020 - $16675 (53% growth)\n\n2021 - $26671 (60% growth)\n\nAs you can see they used to be a low-mid growth company with the exception of the crypto boom years which was considered a one-off benefit.\n\nHowever they've transformed into a super high growth company. \n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 13% deserve?\n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 50% deserve?\n\nTo answer that, look at how different growth rates affect a company after 5 years\n\nCompany @ 50% growth after 5 years = 7.6x revenue\n\nCompany @ 13% growth after 5 years = 1.84x revenue\n\nIf NVDA actually achieves 50% for 5 years, which I think is too high, their profits would be over 60bn which is what MSFT earns now, and they're a 2.5T company.\n\nEven at 35% growth for 5 years, they become more profitable than FB is today.\n\nInvestors seem to have trouble on assessing growth valuation. That's why the investors who just throw money at growth stocks without evaluating financials do well, because they don't shoot themselves in the leg.\n\nIf you think NVDA will grow at less than 30% avg. then you have a point. However, the consensus is closer to 40% growth.",

How much could Apple grow their net income if it became $600 Billion? 7% growth would mean they would make $42 Billion more the next year. I think that would be extremely unrealistic. Realistic net income growth for a company of that size would be maybe 2-3%. Which also means that a PE of 16 would be completely unjustified. So if we gave Apple a PE of 10 and $600 Billion in net income, that gives a market cap of $6T. And that\u2019s if you assume the absurdly high net income of $600 Billion which is higher than Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple currently combined. There will be a point when Apple is large enough that they will greatly underperform the market just because it won\u2019t be possible for them to grow their earnings at double digits forever.",

You've wrongly assumed they're the same company and deserve the same valuation.\n\n2013 - $4130\n\n2014 - $4681 (13% growth)\n\n2015 - $5010 (7% growth)\n\n2016 - $6910 (38% growth)\n\n2017 - $9714 (40% growth)\n\n2018 - $11716 (20% growth)\n\n2019 - $10918 (-7% growth)\n\n2020 - $16675 (53% growth)\n\n2021 - $26671 (60% growth)\n\nAs you can see they used to be a low-mid growth company with the exception of the crypto boom years which was considered a one-off benefit.\n\nHowever they've transformed into a super high growth company. \n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 13% deserve?\n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 50% deserve?\n\nTo answer that, look at how different growth rates affect a company after 5 years\n\nCompany @ 50% growth after 5 years = 7.6x revenue\n\nCompany @ 13% growth after 5 years = 1.84x revenue\n\nIf NVDA actually achieves 50% for 5 years, which I think is too high, their profits would be over 60bn which is what MSFT earns now, and they're a 2.5T company.\n\nEven at 35% growth for 5 years, they become more profitable than FB is today.\n\nInvestors seem to have trouble on assessing growth valuation. That's why the investors who just throw money at growth stocks without evaluating financials do well, because they don't shoot themselves in the leg.\n\nIf you think NVDA will grow at less than 30% avg. then you have a point. However, the consensus is closer to 40% growth.",

        "body": "i've been glued to my options account for months watching charts all day but trading sideways regardless of how many trades i made. Yesterday before close i bought a bunch of MSFT COST NVDA and SPY calls and said i wouldn't look until EOD because \"i dont want to be the kind of person thats glued to his phone all day staring at charts\" anymore. EOD yesterday all options were roughly 6k. at noon today they were worth 17k but i didnt know that cause i didnt look. EOD theyre now less that 4500 and will most likely open less than 3k tomorrow cause i just held. The day i chose to not stare at my account is the day basically everything lines up perfectly for me to make a shit ton of money. I've never had unrealized gains like that in my life besides GME. Even when I'm right I find a way to be wrong.",

So the idea that they are dead in the water or can't compete is plain wrong. \n\nTheir GPUs aren't looking too good right now but they are coming pretty soon. They can fill a gap in the GPU market for lower cost GPUs. \n\nI have a sizeable position in Intel and I have a smaller one in AMD. I will be looking at Intel's and AMD's server CPU and discrete GPU offerings next year to determine which position I will be expanding. Both look promising but Intel looks like it will offer a lot more value long term. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC you might want to open positions with all of them. Betting that the 4 of them will do well is probably a pretty safe bet. I would also look at MU, that's another position that I like right now.
