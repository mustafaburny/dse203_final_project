I\u2019ll save you the boredom, but it was one horrible company with a marketing department so impressive that they had us all seeing a silly puppet at night while we slept.\n\nPets.com got everything right except the part where you put together a properly run management and logistics team to keep costs from killing you while you\u2019re out spending every last penny on marketing. Pets burned their candle at both ends: losing money on just about every single thing they sold without the benefit of free advertising and hype from social media creators. Rivian was much smarter about this bit. They aren\u2019r streaming millions of dollars a week sponsoring the rose bowl or some shit.\n\nInstead, Rivian has been controlling costs; auto manufacturing is it\u2019s just an unbelievably high up front capital business. Thing is though: they\u2019ve got 4-5 years of cash on hand. Pets had 4-5 minutes, tops. Rivian partnered with one tech firm and one auto manufacturer to keep the number of roosters in the henhouse to a minimum. Pets.com took in money from anyone and everyone willing, and with them, their agenda, vision, and demands. \n\nIs Rivian worth anything near what the stock is selling for? Absolutely not. They just aren\u2019t the complete windbag that pets was.\n\nAssuming that they aren\u2019t cooking the books in a massive fraud conspiracy, I see Rivian getting a high and tight 90% amazon style correction before either recovering to reasonable levels or being gobbled up by one of the larger automakers willing to fulfill amazon\u2019s van order, or to simply buy out the IP they\u2019ve certainly built up.",

        "body": "Let\u2019s say Apple traded at a $10T market cap and they had net income of $600 Billion (current net income is less than $100 Billion). How much could Apple grow their net income if it became $600 Billion? 7% growth would mean they would make $42 Billion more the next year. I think that would be extremely unrealistic. Realistic net income growth for a company of that size would be maybe 2-3%. Which also means that a PE of 16 would be completely unjustified. So if we gave Apple a PE of 10 and $600 Billion in net income, that gives a market cap of $6T. And that\u2019s if you assume the absurdly high net income of $600 Billion which is higher than Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple currently combined. There will be a point when Apple is large enough that they will greatly underperform the market just because it won\u2019t be possible for them to grow their earnings at double digits forever.",

Most of those are taking a pretty significant hit at the moment.   My personal thesis is that companies with strong balance sheets will outperform in general.  Inflation FUD is hitting growth stocks right now, with an extra punishment for not having a great balance sheet.  Companies with strong balance sheets have mostly held their ground so far.  \n\nAs a buy and hold person who is big into indexing, I'm comfortable with the SP F PE of around 21.  Short term growth projections justify it IMO.  My individual picks are pretty focused around strong balance sheets and good earnings.  Only about 10% of my total is in companies with more than a 18 forward p/e (and half of that is Microsoft).",

        "body": "Why do they do it?  Because:\n\nIt's a smart thing to do for every year.  This year is particularly special because of tax reasons.\n\nFor example, if you live in Seattle and have a bunch of shares in Microsoft, Apple, Costco, Amazon for more than a year.  If you sell those shares after this year (for a sizeable profit or you already a high earner) and if the build-back-better bill is passed as-is, your tax bill would be 7% (state, 0 for this year, has nothing to do with the bill) + 39.6% (used to be 20% for higher earners) + 3.8% (Obama care tax - same as last year - for high earners).  That's more than 50%.   If you sell them this year, it would be 23.8%.\n\nFor tax harvesting,  believing in the company alone it not enough.  You have to believe that the company would turn around in 31 days to hold the stock.  \n\nFor example.  If you bought BABA at $160 and now it's $130 and you believe that BABA will be $1000 in 2024 but not back to $160 by Jan 31, it makes sense to sell now, reduce the tax liability then buy it back after the 31 days wait period at a price somewhere between 130 and 160 (I simplified the math significantly, the exact break even price is the function of your tax rate).\n\nFor first year trader, they'll see the tax bill if there is a net profit plus the under payment penalty (if their income+profit is above $125k.  If it's below that, no penalty).  Cutting losses is a great way to avoid that penalty either by staying below the 125k cut off of just reduce the penalty in general.\n\nFor me specifically,  I have a rental property to sell (not sure yet) so I will bring some of the unrealized loss into next year (only the one that has some chance of recovering) to offset my LTC gains after tax harvesting a bunch this year.\n\nBuilding wealth is strategy that involves tax avoidance as much as maximizing profit/income.   After all,  mega back door Roth, cash value life insurance, HSA, 429, regular Roth etc. are all about future/current tax avoidance.",

We could just see less alpha until things catch up. The only major pull back we have seen has been on meme stocks or Covid stocks that were way over valued.

Buying calls on a company like Microsoft with a PE of ~30 might be more reasonable.\n\nAlso btw in relation to MSFT they had a PE of 68 (double what it is today) in March 2018. 3 years later their PE is half that and trading at 3x the price.

This 2 week \"stall\" could just be a consolidation.\n\nBut - even if it pulls back some, just buy more. You're probably not going to lose with MSFT in the monthly/yearly long run.\n\nJust because I see targets that are below its current price doesn't mean I'm bearish on the stock, just means it has to test a price level probably before going up more later.",

Also loaded on what was a speculative position last year with higher conviction now - bought quite a few CRSP at what I believe to be the bottom at the 78 range - currently avg at 102+-.{Not even mentioning my stupid PLTR,BB position - gambles going wrong atm, believing in the hype and the reason I bought hasnt changed still hence why i havent sold}\r  \n\r  \nAlthough I have sizeable losses here these positions have elevated my positions amazingly.\r  \n\r  \nHolding a sizeable position with xxx% returns on AMD and NIO and very bullish on SE - recently added to my position at 280\r  \n\r  \nbought into the AMC hype with a 14 avg and sold of 80% at around the 60 mark\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSquare shouldve been scalped and rebought 205-280 range and back is ridiculous but oh well\r  \n\r  \nsold JD into strenght to buy into my weaker positions - had a big position before. still bullish but seeing more upside elsewhere atm.\r  \n\r  \nI dont have any us mega caps- I know winners stay winners usually but I am looking for hopefully bigger returns albeith I run risk of big losses, clearly, as well - such as sizeble position in a clinical trial biotech AGTC - currently at a big loss aswell but that was expected.

Gonna take a while to double your investment (assuming you bought today) but strong financially and bright future. \n\n$NIO is insanely overvalued. There\u2019s no argument here. All EV and renewable stocks, wouldn\u2019t suggest hopping in. P/Es are inflated so high it\u2019s a guarantee we\u2019ll see lower prices (a lot lower!) soon. History has shown.\n\nI like undervalued gems. \n\n$SMCI, $ASO, $VIRT, $ERIC, and $MTZ are my small cap stocks for long term hold. Each have their reasons as to why I\u2019m holding but more importantly, their financials are strong. P/S approximately 1 (tough to find this ratio in today\u2019s market. Gotta dig.) P/E ratios are low relative to competitors. Some have little long term debt. Good ROEs. Increasing revenue. Just safe to hold and DCA down during times like this for me. \n\nLarge cap stocks I\u2019m holding long are $TMUS, $VZ, $AAPL, $V, $MA, and waiting for $PYPL to hit $130 to hop in. But guess what? If it doesn\u2019t hit, I\u2019m not jumping in. Simple as that. Plenty of stocks out there, no reason why you should jump in a stock that hasn\u2019t convinced you yet.\n\nOr if you don\u2019t wanna bother and have a strong stomach to handle red days, buy $TQQQ. \n\nLast thing. Rule of thumb: if it\u2019s being newly mentioned highly on Wall Street bets, and media outlets, most likely it\u2019s too late.",
