        "body": "\n\n5 years ago I had about $20k saved and decided it was time to start investing. I moved it into my E*Trade account and bought FANNG It worked well... but one stock in particular crushed it... $NVDA [in @$63] From that point forward I was chasing the fast money.\n\nI then decided to get approved for options, and  like most most of you, I wasn\u2019t a retard (yet). I played it safe and bought LEAPs on $SQ [in @ $24] expiring 2 years out. Satisfied with this decision and it\u2019s initial momentum I started studying up on options... when I came across /WallStreetBets.\n\nThe hype stock at the time was AMD... several others came and went. I saw so many people YOLOing on weeklies I thought it was hilarious and said I\u2019d never do that.\n\nI did however become riskier with my trades... I got approved for margin and maxed out on FANG, bought more LEAPs and decided to put 10% of my portfolio on an $ADBE earnings with OTM calls... they printed... +700% or $15k in like 48 hours. It was my very first weekly... I was officially a retard.\n\nNow at this time, the Trump rally was like 18 months strong and every small dip recovered within a week... so I was sure at the next dip, \nI\u2019d capitalize. At the time $AMZN was just on fire so at that next dip I bought $2000 OTM Calls expiring one month out... the EV on this was EXPENSIVE. So I was really pushing the limit.\n\nThen came the dip. (Summer 2018) Only this time, it didn\u2019t recover, the market just sucked ass for like a week... I got margin called and had to sell all my stocks at a loss, but held on to all my options. The $AMZN call evaporated instantly. And by then I had lost like 2 years of gains $130k in about three days.\n\nAt that point I was terrified that the whole market was going to collapse... that there was something I was not privy to. Like the housing bubble of 2008... so I sold everything I had left, and stopped investing for a year.\n\nThe recovery came and went, the summer of 2018 just looked like a speed bump in hindsight. So I told myself I\u2019d wait for the next dip... I was patient. \n\nWaited over a year and boy did that dip come. COVID-19... up 320% since COVID. Never had the courage to tell anyone about my shitty summer of 2018 until now... It\u2019s a lesson I had to learn otherwise I\u2019d still be trading like a lunatic until I hit a land mine. So those of you posting losses feeling like it\u2019s the end of the world... \ud83c\udf7bcheers to getting your cherry \ud83c\udf52 popped and welcome to /WallStreetBets\n\n\n** green line shows E*TRADE balance before it was merged into Robinhood.\n\n**TLDR - crazy gains 2 years ago trading like junior varsity retard, lost 80% in three days. Now making it back trading like a Varsity retard",

Big ones right off the bat are the Energy/EV sector (TSLA, ENPH, PLUG, NIO, etc.), the Genomics sector (EDIT, CRSPR, FATE, PACB), some tech/cloud (APPS, SE, FVRR), and some miscellaneous stocks (PENN!!!, RICK, CELH) etc. Genomics and EV specifically because they are supposedly the future. No doubt they are but that's what everyone was saying about the internet back in 1999, 2000, and it really took about 10 years for those stocks that crashed but survived to *really* get going (MSFT, ADBE, AMZN, PCLN, etc.), some haven't even recovered still, such as Cisco and MicroStrategy.\n\nDo keep in mind that the DOW has risen 12k+ points in just 10 months and some bubbles have already popped or on the decline (think NKLA or ZM).\n\nWhen you say \"everyone\", do you mean people on this subreddit or people in your daily life? I've noticed on these forums people are a bit more cognizant of what's going on, so they know that a lot of these valuations don't make sense but in the outside world, I know and have heard of plenty of people buying stocks on Robinhood because \"BuY tHe DiP!!\" is constantly blasted on social media and through word of mouth.

        "body": "I've been doing it for about a year now. In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",

        "body": "Hi.  Wow.  You've put a tremendous amount of work into all of this, and it's incredible of you to share.  I take a similar approach.  I use Morningstar reports (a popular analysts which you can access for free on Charles Schwab) to see if a business is good and favorably valued.  Morningstar focuses on qualitative analysis and also makes judgements about whether a business has a moat (no moat, narrow moat, wide moat).  So, my strategy is I look on Morningstar to see which companies have a wide moat.  Then I take notice on how a wider array of analysts including Morningstar values the current stock price.  All of this gives me some assurance that the company is long lasting and defensible, and it's a fair price.  Then I see which of these Wide Moat stocks are also in Ark Invest funds.  This tells me if the stock is also offensive.  I figure why not buy a business that Morningstar thinks is defensive and what Ark Invest thinks is offensive (growth).  There's actually a lot of companies that fall in this category.  They've included Google, Salesforce, Amazon, Adobe, Intuit, Ansyss, Roche, Novartis, Charles Schwab, Mercado Libre, Caterpillar, and probably a few others that I can't recall at the moment.  My last filter is that I do not buy companies that have a high debt to equity ratio.  I'm concerned about a future looming big debt crisis.  Anyways, I hope that helps you as well.",

Or wait for the dip then buy.\n\nIf they seem low and are a company with minimal risk to bankrupt, buy and hold. See what happens.\n\nId be up on gamestop by 25 dollsrs a share, amd by 40, adobe by some good amount, nvidia by 400 a share, activition by 40...\n\nYep. gotta buy and hold if its not over valued and wont go bankrupt.

My BS was in Computer Engineer, and included computer architecture classes where we design entire processors at the gate level.\n\nMy company's internal refresh cycle is about 4 years for PCs.  I never hear any complaints, because it's not really relevant.  Nor are we doing light weight software.  For my home gaming PC I had a 8 year old that was able to play the AAA titles without issue.  I did have to upgrade my GPU at one point, but that's usually the bottleneck, not the PC.\n\nThe truth is that CPU clock speeds have largely stagnated in recent years, and as a result they've moved to more and more cores, large caches and other things.  You'll see with with the design of the M1 chip, which has a number of built in accelerators for things that are not traditional CPUs.\n\nAnd yes, the typical workflows of most people can be accomplished on older PCs with little to no problems.  Writing emails, Word docs, and surfing the web have been things since the 00s.  Refreshing your PC every couple of years is far from necessary for most people.\n\nI've seen the reviews of the M1 chip, and the software compatibility is only mostly there.  Yes there are a lot of things that work, but now that people have had a chance to dig in, they're finding that there are some serious drawbacks and problems.  This is with Apple controlling most of their software ecosystem, where they can compile a majority of the software.  However major pieces, like Adobe will not work.",

        "body": "Shadow banned. Fucking mods. Posted to promote discussion.\n\nDon't decide what you do based on what I think but here is the bear case for the catalyst for the GME sell-off:\n\nThe events of last Friday's gamma squeeze triggered the stocks run-up and possible short squeeze action we saw this week.\n\nMy thoughts are based on the market events of Wednesday 1/27.\n\nFrom Melvin Capital's most recent quarterly holdings filing (which can be read publicly here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml) we can almost say with certainty that they liquidated most, if not all of their long positions to cover losses with their short positions. I don't think they reloaded shorts yesterday - I think they are waiting to reload.\n\nAll their assumed short positions have run up over the last month, either due to Melvin covering or due to buys from traders making the same play that has been made on GME or a combination of both.\n\nI think one of these scenarios could play out next week,BE CAREFUL:\n\nOfficial short interest reports release for the end of the month are due for publication from NASDAQ on 2/9 (I am assuming the current reports are not accurate as they are not official). The short interest reports include up to 1/29 and are due for processing on 2/2. IF and ONLY IF they show a LOW short interest, this will trigger a major sell-off in the GME as without the high short interest there is NO MORE upside. I don't think Melvin Capital has given up in this yet, they are not done. Prior to that official data release, I believe they will reload shorts and then cover after the sell-off upon official data release, which is their next attempt to fuck the little guy.\nIf official short interest is still high, this could be another buy catalyst, but I don't think it will be. Melvin liquidating all its capital shows that they HAD to of covered. There has been so much buying and selling that it would have been less detectable to cover systemically throughout the week.\n\nIt depends on how you play this, if you hold you'll still be OK as the price won't drop. Everything points to next week being pretty tame and the 2nd week of February leading to a potential bloodbath.

They made deals with Microsoft and Adobe to help each other which will hopefully pay off. They will hopefully have a profitable earnings report which would be a nice way to start the new year. Also they are kinda small right now with a market cap of about 15 billion so there is a lot of room to grow especially as a tech stock.\n\n$OAC - I found this SPAC, on r/SPACs. They are gonna merge with the Telehealth company Hims. I remember seeing Hims ads in the subway and they were valued at 1.6 billion recently. The pandemic may have helped them grow in the last year and I think they\u2019ll grow even more soon. The merger vote is on the 19th\n\n\nBonus: SPCE - Ummm space travel is cool, very risky",
