All the chip manufacturers are building new foundries to handle the growth in demand.   \n\n\nLong story short, people are finding more uses for AI, and better AI requires more powerful chips. Sure, the stock is trading at a high P/E. That doesn't mean it's not on my pullback radar.   \n\n\nValue investing for me is all about buying and holding for 10+ years. I expect the demand for chips to power AI skyrocketing over the next 10 years. Self-driving cars, automated factories, airborne pizza delivery, robotic pilots, algorithms for predicting consumer behavior, automated logistics, personal health AI wearables, kill bots to dominate the battlefield. There are uses for AI that we still haven't found yet, and all of those new uses are going to require lots of chips.   \n\n\nEven now, chip manufacturers are building new foundries to meet the demand. I'm so fucking bullish on chip manufacturing over the next 10 years. I'm thinking about switching out some of my VGT tech etf funds specifically to a semiconductor ETF to hold for the next 10 years.",

Sure, the stock is trading at a high P/E. That doesn't mean it's not on my pullback radar.   \n\n\nValue investing for me is all about buying and holding for 10+ years. I expect the demand for chips to power AI skyrocketing over the next 10 years. Self-driving cars, automated factories, airborne pizza delivery, robotic pilots, algorithms for predicting consumer behavior, automated logistics, personal health AI wearables, kill bots to dominate the battlefield. There are uses for AI that we still haven't found yet, and all of those new uses are going to require lots of chips.   \n\n\nEven now, chip manufacturers are building new foundries to meet the demand.

For a fee.  And if they fail, don't blame them, because... \"You can't time the market!\"\n\nNotice that every bank, mogul, institution, fund, billionaire, millionaire, pension, sovereign, university, muni, hedge, family office, farmer, corporation, money manager, insurer on earth devotes most of their resources and personnel to spending 24x7x365 timing the market.  Yet they tell you \"it doesn't work\".\n\nIt's nonsense.  Even the lemmings who believe and spread it don't accept the myth in any other aspect of their existence.  They time the market looking for Black Friday sales.  They sell their house when the market is hot, and they try to buy a snow shovel in the spring when it goes on clearance.  The farmer keeps his crop in a silo waiting on the peak price, and the car buyer tries to grind for a better deal near month end when the dealer is supposedly more motivated.  When soup goes on sale, we buy a bunch of extra cans.  \n\nLiterally everything in our life is governed by \"timing the market\" yet we're supposed to believe it doesn't work when it comes to the actual, literal market?  \n\nHogwash.  \n\nIt was more than possible to time the market when Disney stock dropped under $80 and MSFT dipped to $130.  And it was pretty obvious when Palantir popped to $45 during the GME frenzy, it was appropriate to \"time the market\" and cash that in.\n\nTiming the market absolutely does work.",

Stock picking is not for everybody, especially if you are new to the game. If I were you, I would sell them and pick up quality companies so I can sleep better at night. \n\n\u201cWhat exactly should I buy?\u201d\n\nWhy not the big tech? AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, FB. That\u2019s a portfolio you will be proud of come rain or shine. \n\n\u201cBut those are boring household names. I want to pick somewhat riskier stuff in hopes of better returns.\u201d\n\nEven in this case, I suggest you diversify 60% of your portfolio in large companies with solid fundamentals and take meaningful risks with the remaining 40%. \n\n\u201cI lost faith in individual stocks. It\u2019s not my cup of tea\u201d\n\nFine, roll with ETFs! SPY, QQQ, XLY, VNQ etc. They contain hundreds of good companies within them, so you will fall and rise with the market. Won\u2019t be your fault anymore. \n\nWhy not a mix of everything above? \n\nFrom your picks it appeared like you are into penny stocks. That\u2019s a big no-no in my books. Don\u2019t be afraid to purchase few shares of an expensive stock. You want to own good companies, not a lot of shares of junk. \n\nJust keep in mind that anything that goes up quickly will fall back as quickly. So don\u2019t give into hype. Slow and steady will win you the race. \n\nThat said, I am glad to see that you started investing at the age of 20. I wish I did that. Good days are ahead of you. All the best!",

Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and the likes have shown that they either are, or have proven that they can be, hugely profitable compared to essentially all other companies of the past.   \nAnd because we have seen these examples, in the case of interest rate hikes, investors will be much more patient with their investments in \"zombie-companies\". I mean sure, several would collapse and we would see some retraction from specific companies like Wework, Uber and the like. I don't think interest rate hikes would cause the massive crash that many people seem to think.   \n\n\nBut i'm honestly conflicted, because i feel like there's some aspect to theories above that i haven't heard, or more likely don't understand. I'm also much more worried (from an investor standpoint) about government regulation as i feel a increasingly growing sentiment to regulate data privacy and to a lesser extent monopoly/oligopolies.",

On the other hand, a company priced at $10 which you see as worth $100 has a huge margin of safety. Even if you were off dramatically and it\u2019s true value is $50, you have bought the company at a great price.\n\nPrice to book ratio uses tangible assets, which in the early 20th century America (think Ben Graham) was highly correlated with earning power due to the American economy being more industrial than it is today. Think of companies like Microsoft, Facebook, or Google which need relatively little tangible assets to generate revenues via online advertising, selling subscriptions, etc. Business value is generally accepted to be the present value of future cash flows, so the value of tangible assets today are very dependent on the industry in which a company operates.",

If AAPL stock goes on a run, VOO is going to rise considerably less than straight up owning AAPL.\n\nThe main question you need to ask yourself is if you think you can pick the next AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, etc.  If the answer is yes, then it might be better to sell off your current positions in AAPL and MSFT and invest in those.  \n\nIn my opinion, AAPL and MSFT are very safe bets for the time being.  The market is really whacky right now and I would be hesitant to sell those in favor of some other small or mid cap stock that you hope might one day join the ranks of the big boys.",

I can anecdotally confirm from my tech peers.  Also many large companies prefer one vendor and AWS is also cheaper to boot.\n\nAs you know Managers/Execs aren't often tech-savvy and many wouldn't even understand the benefits of Fastly and simply go with AWS.

From what I have read, dividends and value are what folks like during times of inflation and economic uncertainty. Warren buffet invests in value and it stands the test of time. Growth is basically what we have been in after the 2000 bubble recovery, pretty much big gains as the US shifted from industry to tech (Microsoft, apple, google, amazon leading the s&amp;p 500 funds). Time in the market and time period trends are what matters here IMO. Long term/far from retirement = more risk/growth funds, short term during times of uncertainty/closer to retirement = value/dividends/cash. If you are not an active investor and are close to retiring value and dividend are attractive because risk is lower. Could be wrong though, I just read crap on the internet, lol.",

        "body": "I don\u2019t think you understand people stop holding volatile assets when they don\u2019t have the time to wait it out. You\u2019re pretending people hold boomer stocks until they die, yet it\u2019s widely agreed that it\u2019s safer and smarter to invest more and more into bonds or the likes, than to have your money in volatile assets that could take a much bigger hit in the time frame you need it. That has nothing to do with believing or disbelieving in the market, that\u2019s taking financial security seriously.\n\nJust because you don\u2019t have a reason to sell doesn\u2019t mean you can speak for the mind of millions. After all, if you intend to enjoy the fruits of your investments, you sell. \n\nThat\u2019s not the difference between investing and trading. You just come across like a smart ass, implying meanings where there are none. Investing and trading aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, you can have both, one or neither. There\u2019s no hard rule like you\u2019re stating. \n\nI never stated what the major players are doing. I\u2019m sensible and don\u2019t speak for millions on data that doesn\u2019t exist because I feel some type of way. The burden of proof falls on those who are making the claim, which is you, me asking for proof is not me arguing for opposite. It\u2019s me arguing to back up your point with facts which you don\u2019t have. \n\nEverything you state is like it\u2019s some black and white opinion. Everything has to be this or that. Numbers don\u2019t speak for beliefs. But what do I expect from someone who doesn\u2019t understand volatility and that sometimes people need to protect themselves from the risk of loss. That volatile investments make for better short term trades, just as you always see volumes spike on massive volatility movements. When Microsoft starts going 20% in a night, than see if your statement holds true. Look at any volatile asset and look at its comparable trade volume. Btc has rose more than 10x Microsoft the past 3 months, if you want short term or big gains, where\u2019s your better chance? And ones beliefs have nothing to do with capitalizing on cryptos appreciation. \n\nFunny how you think you\u2019re educating anyone, but you lacked the knowledge to know you don\u2019t invest money you need immediately and was to worried about buying at the wrong time because you have no apparent ability to do an research on what you could guesstimate to be a fair price and target. From someone who infers useless data to go on about points they know nothing about, while not even understand the concept of volatility and millions of reasons why one could realize gains. \n\nHave a good one. I\u2019ll smack my head on the wall before I give you anymore time out of my day. I proved my point and that was that you couldn\u2019t back shit. The very fear mongering, fud I speak of that\u2019s nothing more than someone\u2019s else ignorant opinion.",
