        "body": "I think you are confused between what the technology is (quite exciting), and what the valuation is through the merger (nothing exciting). If $ACEV trades near NAV, well, there is a reason: poor multiples.\n\nI already replied to someone else on $ACEV yesterday, if you want to understand my point of view. On top of what I wrote, I would also add the fact that most of their topline is linked to a single client (Intel). This is clearly not good.\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* My previous comment \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nLet me, however, point a few things about your rationale, especially on P/Es as this seems to be a central point in your DD.\n\nP/E for semis do not mean much, as :\n\n(i) you're talking about actual P/E. Nobody cares about actual P/E. What matters is forward P/E (you pay for what you will get, not for what you could have gotten). What's Achronix's forward P/E? Nobody really knows. You assumed CY21 P/E will be equal to CY20 ($37), but looking at the merger presentation, the company projects a net income of $50.3mn in 2021e and $58.6 (see page 40). We're rather talking about a company trading at 40x its Q4-Q8 projected earnings. That's in-line with Xilinx, the most comparable semi manufacturer.\n\n(ii) P/E can be ultra cyclical. For example, we can see forward P/Es as low as 3-4x on NAND/RAM players such as Micron, SK Hynix etc (check their multiples in 2018 for example if you don't trust me). Even in a very oligoplistic market + highly fragmented client base such as NAND/RAM, the top players can't just fix their own prices. The end market is just too big and the semi too commoditized ; all you can do as a manufacturer is hope for demand to stay solid / stocks turnover to increase / stocks to decrease, and you need to compress your OPEX/CAPEX as much as you can in a downturn. This is not easy, and this is why the NAND/RAM market has this oligopolistic configuration (a lot of companies just died in previous downturns). I know it sounds counter intuitive, but a low P/E for semis is a sign of (a) extreme cyclicality and (b) poor outlook for demand, hence why the market prefers not to assign any premium to the stock. What matters is the sustainability of your gross margin down to the operating margin (e.g. how fast can you adjust your production? Can you shutdown some operations without suffering too much? what happens it you loose a big client and need to keep your factories open? ... this is where the problems usually arise). We don't really know about this for Achronix. I read from their merger presentation an EBIT margin ranging from 16% in 2018 to &lt;0% in 2019, 35% in 2020, and 32%-33% estimated in 2021/22e (page 40). These variations make it difficult to assess the real, long-term EBIT margin.\n\n(iIi) you can't compare P/Es among different types of semis. NAND, RAM, FPGAs, GPUs, etc. we're talking different levels of profitability, different cycles, different clients and end markets.\n\n(iv) P/E for a given company/semi can vary dramatically. Forward P/E for Xilinx, one of the closest comparables for Achronix, has historically been between 15x to 25x, and is now north of 45x. So what it is the true P/E for a FPGA manufacturer ?\n\n(vi) you can look at other metrics (page 38). Achronix is valued at 11.2x 2021e Revenue and 32.1x 2021e EBITDA. These multiples are absolutely in line with Xilinx's.\n\nAll that to say that if you base your decision on multiples... well, you end up with a valuation for Achronix that is quite comparable to a similar player such as Xilinx, which a has a longer track record, continued strength and several end markets... There doesn't seem to be anything exceptional for Achronix in terms of multiples. ACEV trades below 10.5, that probably tells you something.\n\nThat being said (and this is why I might buy some), the company does not seem to be overvalued, and given that it is operating in a very specific niche (FPGAs), which is already a hot topic and will remain a hot topic for the future, with few, remaining listed competitors, I think it's worth owning it.\n\nSource: [https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix\\_Ace\\_Merger\\_Presentation\\_VF.pdf](https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf)",

It seems like Chaudary is the real deal as an innovator with the company as well.

You\u2019re lingering in generalities here.\n\nMakes it easier to swap between x86 code and native. I will explain.\n\n&gt;\tApple\u2019s memory model is far different than standard PC memory because they have unified memory across the SOC.\n\nThat\u2019s not it what I referred to with \u201cmemory model\u201d. What you are thinking of is unified memory architecture that is shared between cpu and accelerators (ML/Linear algebra, GPUs), as is done on consoles by AMD in collaboration with Sony and Microsoft. But in reality it\u2019s not \u201cfar different\u201d. That\u2019s not what I was referring to.\n\n&gt;\tThis wouldn\u2019t help them with x86 emulation IMO. It does generally help with good performance, but not for raw ARM CPU to x86 CPU instructions. If anything, the extra hardware necessary to ensure coherence would cost performance in this area.\n\nYes, what you were referring to doesn\u2019t matter in this case, except for faster instruction fetch. Note apple silicon has larger instruction cache than AMD/Intel cpus but that\u2019s not it, though it helps in a non trivial manner.\n\n&gt;\tThe fact they can offload to accelerators makes up for this, but again, this wouldn\u2019t be the case for CPU-CPU instruction emulation.\n\nAccelerators are irrelevant here, except perhaps if AMD pulls off an fpga x86-&gt;arm transpiler in an arm cpu, remember they filed relevant patent for fpga execution units embedded in a cpu, they own Xilinx now and dabbed in arm cpus some years ago and I am already salivating. \n\nOkay onto the main topic. Rosetta2 uses ahead of time compiler (transpiler) to go from x86 to arm, so it\u2019s not an emulation layer like Microsoft did.\n\nThe second important trick is with respect to memory ordering, more specifically with how memory access instructions are ordered and how changes are visible to other processing units. Remember, modern cpus execute out of order and employ a vast array of tricks and intricacies to make everything work [1]. Apple implemented a memory model that is compatible with Intel. Actually they implemented 2 models the arm one and one for Intel. When executing x86 code, the cpu itself changes operating mode so it stops using Arm\u2019s memory ordering and switches to Intel\u2019s more strict model. \n\nIt isn\u2019t as fast or intricate as Intel\u2019s, but they don\u2019t need to because they are aiming to remove it (it meaning x86 code).\n\n[1] there\u2019s an absolutely brilliant conversion between Jim Keller and Lex Friedman on Lex Friedman\u2019s podcast on what cpus do with out of order and speculative execution.",

Here is one recent example: [https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/10/fpga-chips-are-coming-on-fast-in-the-race-to-accelerate-ai/](https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/10/fpga-chips-are-coming-on-fast-in-the-race-to-accelerate-ai/)\n\nXilinx is being taken off the board by AMD and who knows how much of what they do now will be taken \"private\" in-house.\n\nFrom what I've gleamed so far is Achronix makes stuff on the upper end of FPGAs, higher performance etc.\n\nNot sure where AMZN and GOOG stand with their current in-house FPGA capabilities,  but we do know that they are gaining success with their own inhouse ARM CPUs.\n\nFor these big cloud players they simply have to move up to SOCs with FPGA offerings to keep up with AI cloud needs.\n\nASICs are not flexible.  Top end FPGAs can even be \"reprogrammed\" on the fly.\n\nBottom line the future of FPGAs seems to still have a lot of upside.  With a bit of luck Achronix + SPAC management can catch the wave or miss it.",

        "body": "Similar to the Altera acquisition, where the promise was that both Altera and Intel would leverage their existing infrastructures in a synergistic fashion to make some grand product from combining x86 + FPGA, and it didn't pan out for them, I see no indication that anything would happen differently with Xilinx + AMD. The problem is that the software toolchains required to compile FPGA designs are just so drastically different than the software required for processors, and given that AMD does not really have a good software story (similar to Intel), I don't see them solving this problem where Intel failed. My prediction is that Xilinx will continue to operate as a largely independent entity within AMD and their balance sheets are going to be pretty much independent. Xilinx will continue targeting the existing FPGA market, maybe a little bit of ML cloud market where they can, but generally you are not going to see some amazing FPGA based product with an AMD CPU in it that's going to the increase market share greatly (and thus the stock price).",

Even if they think they can reach higher growth rates.
