You're mostly just trading one type of growth for another, but you may be less diversified if you just buy high dividend stocks or high dividend funds.\n\nAn important advantage of getting more of your returns in the form of capital gains is that you decide when to sell and take capital gains while you're forced to pay taxes frequently with dividends. High dividend funds are less tax-efficient because more of your return is being taxed along the way. \n\nBoth Andre and Joseph earn money from their YouTube ad revenue and other streams like Patreon so they can continue to be tax inefficient in their investment strategy. \n\nIt's just a bit surprising to willingly ignore some of the non-dividend payers like FB, AMZN, GOOGL, TSLA, ADBE, BRK.B, etc. \n\nThis is just another reason why both continue to underperform the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq-100.",

Learning Management Systems like Blackboard, Canvas, D2L, and Moodle (LMS) are also a huge chunk of it, but I'm not sure how much more growth these companies will be seeing. There is also going to be a lot of movement in normal software licenses for students to use remotely (think MS Office, Antidote, MatLab, SPSS, NViVo, etc).  \n\n\nOne that I keep hearing buzz about unis needing to buy is remote proctoring software services (such as Respondus or ExamSoft, or services built into an LMS (e.g Blackboard, Canvas).

Keep hustling and saving and you\u2019ll be able to retire earlier than most.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know much about investing, you should definitely learn before investing any money. It is easy to lost your money if you aren\u2019t careful. Youtube is a great place to learn. I like sending people to Andrei Jikh\u2019s channel to learn how to invest. He is more focused on dividend stocks, while I think that growth stocks are better. Most people on YouTube aren\u2019t too bad.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much you should trust redditors (probably not at all), but if you do decide to, here is my opinion.\n\nI think for young people, growth stocks and ETFs are best. Here are some good stocks IMO.\n\nLarge/Mega Cap Growth Stocks: AMZN, MSFT, ADBE, LULU, NFLX, PYPL, MA, NVDA, TSLA (be careful w/ TSLA).\n\nSmall/Medium Cap Growth Stocks: LOGI, SQ, TTD, SE, LVGO, CHGG, NET, AMD.\n\nGrowth ETFs: QQQ, WCLD, QCLN, TAN, all of the ARK ETFs.\n\nIf you are OK with risk, Bitcoin could be an interesting buy, but don\u2019t make it more than 10% of your portfolio and make sure you know if you actually own the Bitcoin.\n\nNote that this is my opinion. These are all growth stocks/ETFs, which carry more risk but pose a higher return. If you want something more safe, invest in SPY.\n\nMake sure to do your own DD (due diligence) and research to make sure you are OK with investing in a stock.\n\nMy absolute favorite stocks on this list are MSFT, ADBE, NVDA, TSLA, LOGI, SQ, and ARKK.",

        "body": "It may also be worth looking at this from another angle. You've already shown an interest in some diversification, given your broad accumulation of tech stocks rather than betting on an individual one. And you list an interest in additional companies, 2 payment / financials and 3 healthcare related.\n\nA lot of the focus on long term investing is based on the minimization of downside. Ex: Suppose one company from your list of 7 tech stocks got banned from a country (we're seeing the beginnings of this with Huawei, likely expect some retaliation). How exposed are you to that negative news?\n\nBy constructing your own collection of 7+ tech stocks, you'll end up re-creating your own mini diversified ETF. By adding additional sectors into your investment portfolio, you're diversifying your risk from one sector into multiple. The end result is an actively managed portfolio where you do all the work. If you value your time / energy spent on managing stocks in this portfolio, you're effectively paying a fee for this actively managed portfolio. At the very least, you're spending your free time.\n\nSuppose you want to focus on a tech-heavy portfolio, but from a less actively managed standpoint. You can pick up an etf, like VGT for example, that focuses on just the tech sector. From the top asset holdings as of 6/30, that etf holds AAPL, MSFT, V, M, INTC, NVDA, Adobe, Cisco, Paypal, Salesforce with roughly 60% of it's assets. This is actually pretty well aligned with your current collection of stocks. There are individual sector ETFs, dividend growth ETFs, disruptive tech ETFs, and broad market ETFs. It's important to recognize when the collection of stocks you end up with actually aligns with a broader index. Arguably your current portfolio and intended direction seems like 40% VGT and 30% VHT. If later you want to add exposure to other parts of the economy, you might end up with a mix of multiple individual sector ETFs, which might end up having significant overlap with the S&amp;P500 or VTI (total market ETF). A long road to end up at a broad market ETF.\n\nThe important thing about ETFs that track benchmarks / indices is that the index is a moving target. Right now there are discussions about TSLA being included in the S&amp;P 500, which would kick some other company out. All the S&amp;P index tracking funds would adjust to this new definition of the index, and all passive investors would then be exposed to TSLA. This is true for many of the index tracking funds, the index definition can change and the funds change to reflect that.\n\nIn trying to outperform an index, you're making a bet that you can pick stocks that do better than the continually evolving indices that track economic growth of various sectors. It's always worth evaluating whether you can outperform the 7-9% long term avg the S&amp;P500 returns, and how much effort it takes for you to do that. By spending a lot of time and effort on stocks, you're spending time trying to improve performance on current savings. Your time could also be spent acquiring skills to increase your earning potential, increasing future savings.\n\nTL;DR: Upgrade your portfolio to sector ETFs, eventually to VTI.",

Margins along with ROA/ROE are beautiful but a company can't go bankrupt by having too little debt and although it is nothing to sell over I always try to be as pessimistic as possible before I buy because the emotional scale tends to shift once you've purchased an asset.\n\nSalesforce: As with Adobe, Debt/Equity is low but the current ratio is also low.  Profits are worse with Salesforce with operating margins decreasing since 2018. As of 4/30/20 the Operating Margin is around -0.2%. ROA and ROE are both negative and have been decreasing since 2018 like Operating Margin. Also, Salesforce has had an unpredictable EPS. I like to see a line with a 45 degree angle but Salesforce has been wildly fluctuating since 2006. \n\nNividia: Debt/Equity is low (less than 1) but recently it went from roughly 0.20 to 0.5 which is because of a nearly 200% increase in debt from Q1 to Q2 2020. However, even though the Debt/Equity has gone up in the past quarter the current ratio is MUCH higher (10) than Salesforce or Adobe. Also, unlike Salesforce, Nivida has beautiful Operating Margins (26%) as well as ROA (18%) and ROE (28%) like Adobe. Finally, EPS and Free Cash Flow is a lot more predictable and is what I like to see. As a cherry on top, insiders own roughly 4% which is always great to see.",
