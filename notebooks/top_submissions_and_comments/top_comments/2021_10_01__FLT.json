While I like pot stocks the hype is not on them and with most pot companies still posting huge losses it does not look like there is a lot of improvement in the near future. (On the fence for FLT.v as well but you asked for two... Think of FLT as third alternate.)\n\nI don't expect DOC.v to be profitable either but I don't think people are expecting the to be. For a SaaS play they really should be profitable. (My pick for teledoc plays is RHT.v)",
