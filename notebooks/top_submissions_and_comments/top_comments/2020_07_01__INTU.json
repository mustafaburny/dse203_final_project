This subreddit loves value stocks and dividends, so you're going to get a lot of people who agree with your assertion.\n\nPeople are hoping for the \"bubble\" to pop because things are \"too expensive\" in their minds. Unfortunately, many of these people will not be buyers even as the market is dropping, because they don't have any money. They'll be busy making predictions on how far the market will drop and sitting in cash talking about how cash is amazing. Then when the market goes back up they'll be the first ones complaining about how they missed their opportunity again. People in this sub tend to be extremely risk averse and stubborn. These same people get irritated every day as they see their value stocks doing nothing while growth stocks continue to march forward.\n\nI've posted this portfolio last year, when talking about portfolio construction. I think that you need more than 3 stocks (so don't just buy this blindly), but here is a combination of three stocks that have beaten the SPY for the past 26 years (and yes, I discussed this portfolio last year and it's still winning). (WM,INTU,MSFT): [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=1000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=WM&amp;allocation1\\_1=33&amp;symbol2=INTU&amp;allocation2\\_1=33&amp;symbol3=MSFT&amp;allocation3\\_1=34](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=1000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=WM&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=INTU&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=MSFT&amp;allocation3_1=34)\n\nI'll repeat again because people seem to miss it: You should have more than 3 stocks if you're going to pick stocks. I prefer 8-15 per composite portfolio. The key to this is that you need to keep investing on a consistent basis. That way when the market goes down, sideways, or up, you're accumulating more shares.\n\nInvesting should never be a one-time event. Treat your investments like a bill and make a habit of buying into them on a regular cadence.\n\nIf you're interested in growth stocks, compile a list of the ones that you want to buy into, and then start doing some research. If you would prefer someone else manage the growth (so you can skip the research part), you could buy into an ARK ETF or a ZVN ETF/fund.",

How hard? My father spent 37 years as a pharma executive, eventually working his way up to being a C-suite exec at one of the world's largest pharma firms and after \"retiring\" sat on the board of another. He's also an active trader...and he doesn't touch pharma stocks aside from the ones that were part of his conp package.\n\nSo....maybe stay away completely or keep your investment really small, because I promise you no one here or elsewhere on the internet is going to be able to tell you which way is up when it comes to stocks like ABUS.",

        "body": "It is entirely possible to get 25% or more per year. Many people will never do it because it requires you to build a composite portfolio targeting specific quantifiable aspects (e.g. vol, alpha, max drawdowns, Sharpe/Sortino ratios, etc.) and then test your theories over and over. Additionally, it requires you to ignore most index ETFs and build a sim with 8-15 stocks (you can do it with more stocks if you're worried about volatility (e.g. 30-40), but it becomes much more difficult). Please understand that the hard thing about this is going to be that no one will be there to help you or to advise you because the vast majority of people don't try to construct their own active portfolios.\n\nSince everyone here loves Warren Buffett, I'll quote him, \"diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.\u201d\n\nI have written about this before, because I do actually get more than 25% per year. In fact, my non-tech portfolios are targeting 25%/year, and my tech ones can return 50%+/yr.\n\nPeople think it's some kind of miracle to beat the SPY, but it's actually quite straightforward if you know what you're doing. This portfolio (33 WM, 34 MSFT, 33 INTU) has beaten the SPY for the past 26 years: [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=WM&amp;allocation1\\_1=33&amp;symbol2=MSFT&amp;allocation2\\_1=34&amp;symbol3=INTU&amp;allocation3\\_1=33](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=WM&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=MSFT&amp;allocation2_1=34&amp;symbol3=INTU&amp;allocation3_1=33)\n\nI use this as an example because it shows that even during a drawdown with the SPY, this composite portfolio has beaten it. The portfolio has a CAGR of 20%. I've linked this one for the past 2 years much to many downvotes, but it still stands and is still beating the SPY. Again, I would advise caution here, you need more than 3 stocks. Do not go and buy into this blindly, because the drawdowns could be catastrophic with only 3 stocks. Also understand that 20 stocks basically drive the SPY's returns, so it makes sense that you could have 8-15 stocks which give you better performance vs the index.\n\nDespite all of these data points, for most people, it makes more sense just to be in an index ETF. It protects you against stupid mistakes (+ complete failure) and there's plenty of \"feel good\" articles to give you warm and fuzzies while making you feel like you're on the right path. Plus, there's a whole sub-reddit of people who follow indexing and have retired early; r/financialindependence  .\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "It\u2019s not nonsense. It\u2019s not even an original comment, fund manager Nancy Zevenbergen said, \u201cIf you want to maintain wealth, go for diversification and go passive. If you want to create wealth, own growth companies and concentrated portfolios.\u201d [1] ; considering she\u2019s done astonishingly well in her long term funds (both ETFs and mutual funds, as well as in her firm, I\u2019d at least open my mind to the idea that perhaps index funds are not the way to grow your money in a manner that doesn\u2019t require 20+ years even with max contributions. You\u2019d be better off owning Old Dominion for the past 30 years vs owning SPY. The CAGR is much higher and the drawdowns are much lower. \n\nI\u2019ve posted this concentrated portfolio over the past couple years to get people thinking. It\u2019s beaten your diversified index over the last 26 years, so again, it seems like you have no idea what you\u2019re taking about:\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=MSFT&amp;allocation1_1=34&amp;symbol2=INTU&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=WM&amp;allocation3_1=33\n\nI would go with more than 3 stocks though if I were to run the above. 8-15 is the sweet spot that I\u2019ve found. If you like making money you\u2019re going to concentrate your portfolio. If you\u2019re fine with 6% returns, then stay diversified. My math is on my concentrated portfolio (although I do also run a 3-fund as mentioned for long term retirement planning. It\u2019s maxed each year but it has lagged my primary taxable portfolio and I\u2019m starting to question if it will ever catch up.) \n\nHave you read anything from Nancy or Cathie Wood? Or even Dev Kantasaria? I\u2019m talking about folks who run equity long portfolios that have turned millions of dollars into billions. They all preach the same rhetoric regarding concentration of stocks.\n\n\n\n1- https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2017/10/03/nancy-zevenbergen-investor-tesla-amazon-netflix-best-investor/#707d80376ffd",
