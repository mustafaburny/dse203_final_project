They have come out against video games.  They have come out against online education.  And it is believed - international investing.\n\nYou have a powerful central government coming out against the central business mode of big Chinese tech companies, that\u2019s why people are leaving the trade.\n\nBABA was last permanently below $150 in 2017.  We don\u2019t have selling pressure from traders or sector ETFs anymore.  This is an unwinding of long term investors.\n\nFinally: no one is 100% that the founder is even still alive.  Jack Ma has been sighted by humanity 6 times since Xi went to pound town and companies related to Ma lost a half trillion in market value.  The most verifiable by the west?  A Japanese billionaire claims that he and Jack Ma text every now and again, that Jack Ma has taken up painting, and the pictures he has seen are pretty good.",

Steel buildings are great and in a normal market the cost difference between a steel building and a wood building is negligible. What causes steel buildings to be more expensive in even a normal market is the cost of the foundation. You don\u2019t need near the concrete for a pole barn, but you can still get it about 95% as efficient for heating and cooling.

        "body": "So let's get at this for real.  What uses steel, and in particular what uses steel mined and smelted in the US to the exclusion of imported?\n\nNot US residential housing stock.  Most of those units are wood frame construction, with maybe a few cables in the foundation.  \n\nNot US office buildings and malls.  Yes, they require steel to build them, but we have vacancy rates in excess of 50% as everyone has pivoted to work and shop from home.  No one needs a new steel building in this country for the next 5 years.\n\nCars (and other motor vehicles)?  Yes, cars require steel to build, although not the US' best selling vehicle the F-150, that's aluminum chassis and frame now, and many vehicles will follow suit.  Overall the trend will be less steel to make more cars.\n\nSo what the fuck exactly would induce someone to drop 2 bands a ton on steel in 2021 when they could just as easily defer their project to 2023 or not do it at all?\n\nSimple:  a Congressional mandate to spend tax dollars to build infrastructure.  Roadways?  Require steel.  Bridges?  They are made of steel.  Railways and railcars?  Those are pure steel, with a pinch of engineering added for flavor.  New factories?  Steel.  Solar installations?  Steel.  Power transmission lines?  Steel.  The CAT equipment (cranes, dozers, loaders, et c.) to build all this stuff?  Made of steel.\n\nIt pretty much boils down to whether Congress can get their act together.  If they pass Infrastructure Jr, (1.2T), a lot of steel will get bought and used.  If they also somehow put Manikin's balls in a vice and Kyrsten dies of COVID and they get the $3.5T bill passed, steel prices will rocket to the moon and holders will be blessed as the dividends rain down like flakes of slag from a hot-press.\n\nDon't hold your breath.\n\nEDIT:  I see most of your calls are dated Oct 15th.  The trust in Congress runs strong in you, little one.  I'd sooner dip my balls in an industrial grinder.",

        "body": "I think people adding up all of the issues right now and saying it's not a normal economic period are right that it's not a normal economic period, but by those measures, last year wasn't a normal economic period, as well.\n\nInflation: It's actually declining month over month, whereas last October it was increasing. People forget that the inflation metrics they cite are YoY and while inflation is in the zeitgeist now, it was also in place last year.\n\nThe debt ceiling: This is an actual problem, that could create a 2018-style long bleed. I've worried about this, but the government funding deal shows that there is likely a positive outcome. It represents some degree of blinking on the parts of those opposed to raising the debt ceiling, so I think we can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nCOVID: The economic data is much better than last year, and as much as it disappoints people who hoped for a full recovery by now, the soft re-opening from delta is still a relative increase in economic activity that is likely to get better as time goes on. We're in the upswing. Vaccines \\*do\\* work, and that's in the data. It just takes time for the end of a pandemic to happen.\n\nChina and supply issues: These concern me, and I think we're looking at supply issues for 6 months to a year, and this will cause some issues... but we have to remember that this is all due to an increase in overall demand and largely related to issues that specifically affect China. This isn't to say there won't be some problems from this, but we're not talking a 2008 larger systemic issue that is global. There are solutions to these problems that are in-play, and they're happening in an environment of very high demand for goods and services relative to last year... these are ultimately bullish, growth environment factors.\n\nTaxes/Taper/Rate increases: Will create a short term correction when they happen, but they're not unexpected and the impact of tax increases to corporations are not going to really effect growth the way that people think. Macroeconomically and historically, the reality is the opposite of what people think it will be with increased taxes creating more local capital velocity which means more revenue, more profits, and more growth opportunity. Companies are good at finding various ways to create efficiency in pricing, and Jeff Bezos getting some extra taxes won't impact the value of Amazon. The stock taxes proposed, like the estate tax on unrealized gains and the removal of the in-kind ETF tax break will largely have a null effect because the people concerned about them aren't taking into account how much they don't matter or aren't available to consumers. This is a bigger topic, but fears over these taxes are nothingburgers once you introduce human behavior into the mix.\n\nWorker shortage: Adjusted participation has close to returned to normal, with the exception of about a million workers based on the last data and it's probably tightened since then (most people getting higher numbers aren't accounting for historical reduction from baby boomers retiring since 2000 and pandemic mortality) and these forces are due to high demand, an expansion of higher pay work in the country post-pandemic due to supply chain issues, and come with higher overall wages which is an offset to inflation pressure, reducing the likelihood of a crash. This is actually a good signal even if it's a problem for insolvent businesses.\n\nAlmost all of the things people cite as problems are artifacts of positive economic growth.  \n\n\nIn the end, I expect October to be volatile, but I think there's little reason to automatically assume that it will be blood red... it depends on a number of factors. Me? I'm keeping a close eye on things and playing a bit conservative with my portfolio right now, but I'm looking for the broader entry point in the coming month, because I think this could look a lot like last year... but I also think human psychology dictates that we could have a short red period because the fundamentals matter less than people wrongly believing we're in a crash in the short term. In the long term, all of these forces will actually bring people to the market.",

If you think about it, its actually a smart move for Citadel, why play tug-o-war against the GME and AMC crowd when you can make $ attacking the Tilray people. I think you nailed it when you said that Tilray's the biggest target in the space since its very liquid on a real exchange with high retail ownership. Despite what people are saying about legalization getting push back or \"it won't happen\" the truth is everything is up in the air right now. The fact is that (despite speculation) the democrats have not done anything yet to stop the advance of the legalization bills advancing through congress and thats a very good sign. And as per Schumer in his interview just a few days ago, he said that \"they have made great progress\" on getting the other senators on board so there are a few catalysts coming up and those are great opportunities to attack Citadel &amp; friends.",

For Tesla it\u2019s like $1.5 million per car per year. \n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Tesla is an amazing company, but the valuation is still out of this world.
