This was completely understandable due to the supply constraints and disruption we have faced.\n\nHowever, now is appears to be spreading into most areas of the CPI - Housing, Food, Core goods and services, and perhaps most troublingly, it is now setting into the labour market. Once it gets settled into labour it really becomes a problem, because the only way out involves hurting people.\n\nThe situation in the 70s was actually very similar - it started with supply side shocks, monetary policy eased, the supply shocks eased, but by then the inflation had become endemic. What is really important about inflation is not so much the absolute rate of inflation, or how long it persists, but what people *expect* to happen. Once people believe it is happening, it will. People will unload money faster. Businesses will put prices up. Bosses will grant pay rises to their employees, landlords will put rents up, and it starts a cycle which cannot be stopped without very firm, even brutal, action.\n\nIt is still possible inflation falls back to target of it's own accord, and people continue to believe it is transient. But, we're on the edge of a precipice now, and the Fed should be watching the data extremely carefully and be ready to act if it continues to become broad-based, expected inflation.",

But they were interviewing a guy that won a nascar race on NBC and the fans were yelling F Joe Biden loudly in the background, and the lady interviewing him said \u2018the fans are chanting let\u2019s go Brandon blah blah blah\u2019 when it was clear that\u2019s definitely NOT what they were saying. Pretty strange. Never in American politics have we had a situation quite like this, and obviously the TV networks will do their best to filter this out of broadcasts both because it\u2019s profanity but also because of their own political leanings. They now have \u2018let\u2019s go Brandon\u2019 shirts and the like. It\u2019s pretty funny actually.",

Have a plan in place that deals with how you are set up for those multiple 25% - 30% or maybe 50% crashes - multiple! For example - maybe never sell and invest a huge amount when you read in the paper that a recession has been OFFICIALLY announced (2 quarters passed with negative growth) - then go all in. And find a way to be mentally and psychologically prepared and financially that you will have funds to invest and go all in. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how you do now, when the tide is rising.

If you put $50,000 of your money into boring boomer SPY, blue-chips, AAPL, etc you can expect about a 7% annual increase in value over the long term. By the time you\u2019re out of college and ready to buy a house you\u2019ll have almost $100k for a down payment. If you instead choose to pull out $6,000 every year and max out Roth IRA contributions that $50k will be more than $1.2 million (tax free!) by the time you retire. \n\nBasically, if you delay gratification for a few years you can escape burning hundreds of thousands on rent in your twenties and/or completely guarantee you\u2019ll be able to live very comfortably when you retire. \n\nKeep a little and yolo, but also lock in some profits so you\u2019ll never go back to being broke.",

        "body": "Great question! Yes, you can calculate the probability of touch for a *fixed* target stock price in closed-form. The issue we have to address is the fact that, in our case, the target stock price is changing every day we hold the position! \n\nIt's better to explain this with an example:\n\nSay we sell a $1.00 put that expires in 45 Days. We will hold this position until expiration BUT we will close it if we hit 50% of max profit ($0.5). What is the probability of hitting 50% of max profit up until expiration?\n\nAt 45 DTE: you've just opened the position. In order for you to close the position, the short put value has to drop to $0.5. What stock price corresponds to this short put value? If we know the corresponding stock price we can use the Brownian Motion model to calculate the Probability of Touch (PTO) at 45 DTE. Well, we could use the Black-Scholes model to establish the relationship between stock price and options value. This model is pretty complex that takes in multiple inputs like time till expiration, volatility, etc. Great, we can now calculate the 'target' stock price and its corresponding PTO at 45 DTE!\n\nat 44 DTE: Unfortunately, you didn't hit the target stock price at 45 DTE so what's the PTO at 44 DTE? You still need a short put value of $0.5. What stock price corresponds to this short put value? We can use the Black-Scholes model again but now you're inputting different values for time till expiration, volatility, etc. Your target stock price is now different and so is your PTO at 44 DTE.\n\nYou can collect **all** the PTO's for every day up until expiration and do some fancy math to calculate the probability of hitting 50% of max profit up until expiration. But here's the problem: The Black-Scholes model is pretty complex and, to my knowledge, there is no closed-form way of calculating the corresponding stock price given an options value with this model; you would need to use numerical methods to do it. Hence, there is no closed-form way to calculate the probability of hitting 50% of max profit up until expiration.\n\nThe above strategy for calculating the probability of hitting 50% of max profit is plausible but not the same as Monte Carlo Simulations. I thought it would be easier to highlight the complexity of the problem by explaining that strategy. Monte Carlo takes a more stochastic approach where *thousands* of individual simulations are run for the stock price and a probability is averaged out. It's better explained on the website. You could think of it as a more brute-force approach relative to the other strategy with the downside of lower accuracy and being more computationally heavy. However, the upside with Monte Carlo is that you can use much more complex models with it if you wanted to. Maybe you don't want to use Black-Scholes and wanted to use a more complex options pricing model. Maybe you don't want to assume that IV is constant and wanted to use an IV model. Monte Carlo would be a much better choice for these situations. \n\nHope this answers your question!",

Citadel internalise that order and shits out and IOU for you. \n\nAll good so far right?\n\nBut Citadel as MM dont like to cover during major volatility so they keep taking these 50/60/70..$ orders while internalising order flow from RH or other PFOF broker(basically assuming short position), they know from experience that 99.99% of the time markets will calm down, the price will drop and they will be able to secure shares for favorable price to deliver them. PLEASE LET ME CLEAR THAT MOST OF THE TIME ITS DONE UNWILLINGLY BY ALGOS THAT RUN THE MARKET.\n\nSo what happened is that when GME started blowing  up at December/Early January algos took these 20/30/40$ orders gave out IOUs but never delivered actual shares. By mid Jan, some1 got margin call and realised that GME situation is that 00.01% event and now they are on the hook for 2700% payout compared to what they took in. \n\nThats why only PFOF brokers had to turn off buy button, because unlike brokers like fidelity that actually got their shares delivered they only had IOU but not the share and as soon as some1 pressed Sell button they had to pay from their own pocket the difference hence all the liquidity issues.",
