        "body": "This last year has been a wild ride.\n\nI was a Bogle Head for 10 years only investing in a Roth IRA into the S&amp;P 500 Index fund. I also built up over almost $100K in cash savings for a house down payment, but the housing market continued to out-price my purchasing power (Fuck you California). I saw annual inflation eating away at my savings and decided I wanted to do more active investing. I opened a Fidelity brokerage account and slowly started legging in capital. One of the first plays I made was a $5K loss on GME and Nokia (Yes, I lost money on GME) after losing money on the hype and selling at the bottom I decided to do some deep diving into value plays. I stumbled across $CLF as one of my first very high conviction plays when it was at $14 and also bought shares in $AA when it was $25. Boy oh boy do I just wish I simply held those shares.\n\nA tale as old as time - I learned about options and my account balance quickly became as volatile as $DWAC. Take a look at that Fidelity chart. By the time June rolled around I had allocated almost all of my cash into my Fidelity account and at my highest point, I had made roughly 50% total account gains and maxed out at $156K, primarily due to $NUE and $CLF calls.\n\nIn mid-June, steel stocks got shit on (and I'm talking forceful Taco Bell style projectile shitting) and I had OTM calls that were absolutely murdered. I was a paper handed bitch and sold for 80% losses and watched steel rise from the ashes a couple weeks after I sold. Something switched in my head after those heavy losses that made me want to chase. Classic newbie dumbass move right? Anyway, I decide to go FUCKING HARD IN THE PAINT on short dated $QQQ puts. At one point intraday I had massive gains on those drops on 7/14/2021 through 7/19/2021. The problem was I held and sold almost at the complete worst times. Also, once the market reversed, I held onto my puts like a dumbass and my account was crushed to almost nothing.\n\nDepression and anxiety ensue, but I am fortunate enough to not have other people depending on me,  I don't have kids, I have a good job, and as much as it sucked asshole I could get by on beans and cans of tuna for a while.  I am lucky to have an amazing support network of internet friends who helped lift me up and believed that I could make my money back.  Also, like Naruto says, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the hand that fate\u2019s dealt you with, fight for a new one.\u201d\n\nA month or so later I try for the big dick comeback.  I started trading with $200 somewhere around 9/7/2021, but like the degenerate I am, I kept my rent money in Robinhood just in case I wanted to blow up my life even further.... So my 3 month chart doesn't show my true total gains and I'm not going to post it here because it will just be confusing.\n\nSo for all intents and purposes with the limited screenshot documentation I took along the way, I have documented confirmation that I went from $7.7K on 9/9/2021 to $67K on 9/16/2021 to a peak of $141K on 9/20/2021 and EOD balance of $110K on 9/20/2021 all in 11 calendar days!!! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK, RIGHT?\n\nSPAC-sanity was back in business and I was lucky enough to catch massive gains on $IRNT calls on 9/7/2021. I took the $IRNT gains and snowballed into consistent 30%-100% day gains on other SPAC plays including $OPAD. On 9/14/2021 I threw cash into $SPRT puts right before they merged wit $GREE and on 9/15/2021 I realized my single highest percentage gain (50,000%). I made so much money on this play that I panic sold thinking I was doing something wrong or breaking the law (I wasn't). I also made about an average of 200% total gains off of $HSBC and $DB puts, alongside $YANG calls and $YINN puts that I held from 9/17/2021 through 9/20/2021 on the initial Evergrande fear. Mixed in between these plays I made several 50%-200% gains on more $QQQ/$SPY puts mixed in with other SPAC calls.\n\nWell, as most of you could have guessed, after I made it to $100K again, I slowly bled my account balance back down to $500 making trades with poor judgement. I am sitting here writing this up to share some very expensive lessons. As much fun as it was to win this big in such a short period of time, I was bound to lose it with the extremely risky way I was trading near the end. Don't be a Treabeard. Protect your capital. Take a break after you see massive gains. There will ALWAYS be more plays. Never feel rushed to go into another. Take a step back and enjoy life for a minute. Easier said than done, I know.\n\nI will be back in some time. I plan to do a better job documenting my trading journey starting with $500 this time. This time is different ;) ..... Right? .... \\*please\\*\n\n\\-Trea",

I feel like there's a bit more opportunistic sector weighting with the higher net worth relatives. The fees were generally 1-2% on top of the fund fees, which is something I made sure to point out to all of them, but most were OK with paying to not have the responsibility of watching their accounts (again, they're getting up in age and their priorities in life are different). I always had a bit of concern with some of their risk profiles though, because the fund correlations always seemed kind of high to me given their age (if your funds have high correlation, then you're not really effectively diversifying), but I guess nobody seems to be too concerned about it.",

However fidelity's shares are not even held by fidelity themselves; it's held at a large central authority (DTC). When a shorter tries to make a short sale, they request a \"locate\" to find a share available to borrow. This \"locate\" pings back from the DTC with something along the lines of \"yes we have enough shares in our coffers\". \n\nWhen you DRS, the share is withdrawn from the DTC. They will never be able to \"locate\" that share, because that share will be \"located\" right under your name. As the DTC's coffers of GME shares dwindle, so will their ability to magically \"locate\" more shares than outstanding(they're fucking complicit in this obvi). \n\nIn conclusion, it's not fidelity's fault, but DRS takes the ball away from DTC, which is the final boss holding all the real share certificates.",

This, and their shitty behavior towards their own clients will precipitate the growth of ghost accounts that have a penny or two in them and increase long term costs. They cant close these accounts, because they need them open to try to make their numbers look good and in the hopes these poor people come back to the market that fucked them over.\n\nOther clients might arbitrarily hit it big, and in doing so migrate their account to a real brokerage. Or might take a less active wealth preserving strategy which I'm sure makes them less useful data wise. Or overtime unsophisticated clients become sophisticated clients and outgrow the childish platform.\n\nAnd in the case of an economic downturn (whether large or small) who is going to be more likely to divest and remove all their money from their account? the 70 year old bogglehead boomer who has his money locked in a traditional IRA at Fidelity in a conservative mix of mutual funds, or the twenty three year old who has their entire life savings of $300 in doge, lost their job and needs gas money to get down to the local Food Stamp office.\n\nThis should be a peak time for them and yet theyre bleeding out already because of their strategy of fucking over their own consumers to appease their real clients (i.e. hedge funds).

They are available on all QC clouds, and are really driving applications research. The trapped Ion approach offers NxN connectivity with low overhead for error correction, high gate fidelity further reducing overhead, high coherence time (hours to days). \n\nI think the main selling point is that, while silicon or photonics approaches require low operating temperatures (0,x-4K) and massive overhead for error correction, they get away with laser cooling in a vacuum chamber and have shown 13:1 error correction working on trapped Ion systems. Personally I believe that they are on a strong path to be the first player to leave the NISQ era.

If you want exposure to crazy tech growth look at the ARK ETFs and they probably have a product that will give you that.\n\nCongratulations on your income.

Someone on this subreddit suggested VXUS, but Fidelity shows that fund as \"weak\" across the short/mid/long term.\n\nVXUS is weak because US equity has dominated international equity for a long time, which is also directly at odds with the idea that the US economy \"isn't looking too great.\" I don't know how you arrived at that conclusion, but I would seriously reconsider if I were you.",

Also another somewhat sketchy thing, not sure if it\u2019s like this now, but when I signed up for HOOD back in about 2018 I got options level 2 approved with about three clicks. I was like, that\u2019s crazy, because with SCHW and Fidelity I had to fill out applications, show trade experience, prove I had funds, etc. and I am pretty sure they would have given me options level 3-4 had I requested it. That\u2019s frankly derelict in my opinion.",

        "body": "They're a local company for me and they've been making their car/motorcycles for years. People really love them for in-town commuter cars. The problem is the price, of the car, and of the stock. No idea how good an investment it is, but this company is a real company with a long history of building real products, and selling every one they can make.\n\nIt's a three-wheeled car that is licensed as an enclosed-motorcyle in some states, so the fees are lower and regulatory requirements are lower but it doesn't need a motorcycle endorsement.\n\nThe downside is, they've never shown an ability to grow very fast. Their management team is operationally competent but seems rather unable to achieve the growth that the customer interest suggests they could meet. Now that they're public, they won't be able to keep their insular team forever; they're eventually going to have to add some real professionals who can take their growth to the next level. This is a very promising long-term investment, but don't expect to see it pop again in the short or medium term. If you bought it on the prior meme-interest you might wait a lot of years to see those prices again. But they are absolutely a solid little company.\n\nThe fundamental analysis on Fidelity (by S&amp;P) gives their financial health a \"0/100\" oddly, but the balance sheet shows a lot of cash and very little debt, which is consistent with the local reporting, so I suspect that 0 is an error where they just didn't finish the analysis.",
