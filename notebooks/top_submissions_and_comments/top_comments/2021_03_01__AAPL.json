Undervalued when compared to other EV plays, despite having nearly double the employees and over 3 times as many vehicles set to go into production in the next 3 years.\n\n\n\n\n2. They've only been around since 2018. In that time, they've locked up a manufacturing agreement with magna, secured deal with Hyundai to produce vehicles using their chassis architecture, brought a vehicle from idea to production in just 19 months (average time 4-5 years), and even received a buyout bid from Apple... and had the balls to say no. Lucid, for example has been around since 2006 and has 1 vehicle going into production.\n\n\n\n\n3. The multi-purpose delivery vehicle can reach distances up to 250 mi and will be sold at a starting point of $33,000. The workhorse vehicle for comparison can reach 100 mi and sells at $52,000. It does however have 200 cubic feet more space, but over 400 ft of exterior space making it more difficult to maneuver in a city. The engineering behind Canoos vehicles is simply much better.\n\n\n\n\n4. Their skateboard chassis and their steer by wire technology make up 70% of the vehicle. This means that the cost of production is drastically lower since research and development, testing, and production are already complete on any future vehicle. this will allow them to bring new vehicles into production much quicker than their competitors. This point is validated by their partnership with Hyundai.\n\n\n\n\n5. Don't underestimate the news that Apple sought a takeover bid. Apple could have targeted any EV company in the world, and they chose to go after Canoo. It is the only vehicle truly designed to be ridden in rather than driven. The engineers were clear that they were designing a vehicle to be eventually be fully autonomous.",

Then after the first big drop I saw it as an \u201copportunity\u201d so I sold some commons in exchange for warrants. Well pretty much all those warrants are down 30%-60% since I bought them on the \u201cdip\u201d. \n\nAnd that is how you lose a years worth of gains in 2 weeks.
