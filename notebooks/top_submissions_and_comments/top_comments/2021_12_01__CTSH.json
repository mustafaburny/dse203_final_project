Like I said, I still believe in you. \n\nAnyone who understands their own argument can explain it to the simplest of people just as I have. Even if they are wrong, they can explain the mechanisms behind their opinion as I have (according to you). So I\u2019ve done it and I\u2019m barely borderline cognizant, obviously you can too then right? I\u2019m giving you the easy way out but if you want to explain the algebra behind it go ahead. My lack of understanding has no bearing on your ability to explain your thought process. That\u2019s 100% on you.",
