        "body": "Options (call, put), futures, warrants, turbos, etc are derivatives on stocks. Basically there are leveraged products on the stocks themselves. The amplify changes in the stock prices, so stock down 10% can be 100% in the other product, up 10% can be 100% up etc. So it is leverage.\n\nWiki is good enough to get the basic grasp. Read on the derivatives to make sure you DO NOT buy such products... \n\nThere are also leveraged ETF! For example TQQQ, that is a triple leveraged Nasdaq 100 ETF. So be careful as well when people say \"ETF's are safe\".\n\nThe S&amp;P500 tracker (ETFs like VTI, etc) are good. Always be informed about the TER of ETFs. S&amp;P500 should be &lt;=0.2% for example. But also they can crash say 50-60% down from its current value. So don't lump sum (invest everything at once) now in the S&amp;P500 when you think it is a good opportunity.\n\nDCA (dollar cost averaging) the S&amp;P500, for example, can be an idea, as a beginner, over say a few years, 5 or 7. If the index drops dramatically, say 50% or 75% or so, you might put a lump sum in, etc. So in reality that 5 or 7 years might be 3 years.",
