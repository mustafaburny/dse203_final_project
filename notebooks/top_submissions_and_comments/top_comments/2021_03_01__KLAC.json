        "body": "Not sure how you managed that.  I got stupid lucky and decided to buy a few calls before GME became national news.  Paid something stupid like $10 for a GME $50C when GME was trading at $35.  And bought some AMC and BB.  Then GME hit $300 something.  Not knowing what I was doing I exercised and then sold off at like $300, $290 and $270.\n\nEnded up with 30 grand and decided to make it my options play money.  Lost a good chunk on NVDA when it shit but stayed about even overall cause I was playing MU LRCX AMAT DKNG and AMC.  Because you know like silicone chips and shortages.  Figured buy the guys that make silicone chip equipment.  Atleast I think some of those stocks do that shit.  And DKNG because like sin stocks are a good hedge for market down turns or some shit.\n\nSo I didn't make money for a while.  And I also learned how those stocks move.  I also learned if when the dip comes if you don't have any cash well then you are fucked.\n\nSo I waited for most of my calls to go back green and took barely any profit but got back to my original 30k.\n\nThen I did some ground breaking shit.  I didn't buy anything until the shit dipped for a few days.  And when it did I just bought a little and kept buying all the way down.  I also started buying calls 90 to 60 days out with strikes around the most recent high.\n\nSo when MU tanked I bought it all the way down to $82.  Same thing with AMAT and LRCX.  Also KLAC which doesn't run like those.  DKNG is hella cheap now, so is UWMC, and some of the cruise stocks.\n\nSo I did that and now Friday happened.\n\nAnd now I think I'm smarter than Warren Buffet.\n\nSo now I'm going to hold this shit for way to long until it goes red and expires.\n\nAnd then I'll listen to my wife banging her boyfriend while I figure out if I have anything of value to pawn other than my mouth.",

There's already waiting lists for their $120M lithography machines into late 2022/early '23. \n* AMD (AMD) - Intel's recent product gaps have given AMD time to step up. Even with the new leadership at Intel, it's unlikely that they will maintain market share dominance to the same extent over the next decade, and that's a massive available market for AMD to continue growing within. \n\n**Honorable mentions**\n\n* Texas Instruments, NVidia, Hitachi, Tokyo Electron Limited, and Samsung",

I look at the next industry that no one is talking about. \n\nHuman capital is further along but still has so much realistic growth ahead of it; workday/paycom/etc. are really only the beginning of the possibilities and technologicification of the workplace and employment; they\u2019re just trying to do it decently; the next iteration will be explosive and creative building off that. HR tech is like 50% built. \n\nAll that said about HR, Ed tech has 99% of an industry to grow. The actual industry itself has barely even begun to evolve. E-learning now officially legit forever\u2014everyone from k-12 to higher education will be looking to not just survive but find long term solutions to thrive, impress and engage students and in higher Ed, highly paying students with high expectations. Who will land DOE contracts? Who will the major players be? All markets are open for taking. Good move Zoom could make would be Ed services expansion. Connect content providers to educational institutions. Students and teachers hate most of the software and platforms they\u2019re using because they\u2019re super old but accepted, or are ad hoc with lots of issues. \n\nOwn Adex, eac, more.",
