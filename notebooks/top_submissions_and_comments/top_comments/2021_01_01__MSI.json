It\u2019s a short sale induced seller hoping to trigger stop losses or sell offs by individuals who get scared by the quick drops. However if you look at the actual sales data you will see there are not a lot of shares being sold. The beautiful thing with this has been every time they\u2019ve done this strong hands of swooped in to gobble up these discount shares. Look at today\u2019s data you can see the giant red swoops down and then a return as people were able to buy back. It wasn\u2019t as rapid as in previous days because of the collusion blocking out traders from being able to buy a GME. Imagine you shorted all of that stock today drove the price down to under $200 at close. You went home to watch your wife with her boyfriend and celebrate your successful job. When you opened up your Motorola Razr to take some quick pix you had a text message from your boss that said \u201cGameStop back over 300\u201d dammit now what.",

On that note, when was the last time you bought a Motorola phone?  Or a Blackberry?  Hell, we can even look at the history of the automotive sector itself.\n\nTesla is sitting in a very bizarre spot right now where it is being valued as if it already has accomplished its lofty goals.  It will need to earn this valuation against a field of competitors which is something much harder in practice than in the wide, dollar-filled eyes of investors.  It's easier to imagine TSLA doing all these things than for them to *actually* do them.\n\nRegarding #2, you realize there are already non-auto manufacturing companies working on this, right?",

It doesn't take much money.\"\n\n\"It's a fun game and a lucrative game and you can move it up and then fade it, that often creates a very negative feel (...) That's a strategy very worth doing. (...) I would encourage anyone who's in the hedge fund game to do it because it's legal and it's a very quick way to make money and very satisfying.\"\n\n\"Hedge funds are positioned long-short okay, not just long like mutual funds, so it's really vital these next six days because of your payday, you've really got to control the market. You can't let it lift (...) It's really important to use a lot of your firepower to knock that down.\"\n\n\"You can't foment, that's a violation. You can't create yourself an impression that a stock's down, but you do it anyway because the SEC doesn't understand it so yeah.\"\n\n\"A hedge fund that's not up a lot really has to do a lot now to save itself. (...) This is actually just blatantly illegal but when you have six days and your company may be in doubt because you're down I think it's really important to foment.\"\n\n\"When you see a guy's bidding you'd wipe out that guy very quickly. What i used to do was if I wanted to go higher I would take and bid, take and bid, take and bid, and if I wanted to go lower I'd hit and offer, hit and offer and I could get a stock like RIM, maybe that might cost me 15, 20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on RIM.\"\n\n\"When your company's into survival mode it's really important to defeat RIM and get the Pizani's of the world and people talking about it as if there's something wrong with RIM then you would call the journal and you get the bozo reporter.\"\n\n\"These are all the things you must do on a day like today and if you're not doing it maybe you shouldn't be in the game.\"\n\n\"Apple's very important to spread the rumor that um that both verizon and AT&amp;T have decided they don't like the phone (...) You want to spread the rumor that it's not going to be ready for macworld and this is very easy.\"\n\n\"With a little bit of capital you go buy some January 80 puts that makes it look like there's going to be something going on (...) and you just kind of create an image that there's going to be news next week and that's going to frighten everybody.\"\n\n\"What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view right that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction.\"\n\n\"The mechanics are much more important than fundamentals. Who cares about the fundamentals? (...) That's a fabulous thing. The great thing about the market is there's nothing to do with the actual stocks.\"\n\n\"Fannie Mae lied about the earnings for six billion dollars right? It's fiction and fiction and fiction and I think it's important for people to recognize that the way that the market really works is to have that nexus of: Hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders that can push it down, then leak it to the press and get it on CNBC, that's also very important, and then you have a kind of a vicious cycle down. It's a pretty good game.\"\n\n\"The problem with the cell phone market frankly is that these guys are all killing each other, you know? Someone has to take a dive. Motorola and Nokia, you have to get in a room and just fix price. They've been reluctant to do that because of the various justice departments. (Host says \"And because it's illegal\") Well, that hasn't stopped a lot of other companies. What eventually happens is the shareholders demand that you get phony lawyers and you sit in the room and it'll happen soon\"\n\n\"I have to talk about what it's like at my hedge fund and what other hedge funds do because this is an intraday show and you need to know what's going on.\"",

It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares. \n\nBecause of that, I feel like your math is a little backwards. CRWD is at like $220 right now. That's what leads to that $50B market cap. It's not really the same thing as BB (which I love; don't take this the wrong way). Also: is CRWD even competition to BB? I searched for their competition and came up with JAMF, MOBL (just bought by Ivanti), MSI, and EVBG. Most of those companies trade waaaay higher, but also do not have the integration of BB, so I'm not sure if they're comparable for our reasonings.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm asking is, how did you land on any of these valuations? Why compare them to CRWD? \n\nSo I'm clear: I'm investing in BB. Don't mistake this critique as me tearing you down or shit-talking, please. I'm merely trying to understand how to better vet my choices for investments.",

Take AMD\u2019s Smart Access Memory (SAM) it is great but has lots of compatibility issues with many games out there as not all developers are using the AMD platform for Game Development thanks to Advantages bought by RTX &amp; DLSS. Nvidia always had an upper hand and now Intel and Nvidia have their own version of SAM known as Resizable BAR giving Intel CPU to access all of GPU memory all at once if needed. \n\nPreviously, CPU\u2019s access to the VRAM in a GPU is limited to 256MB for data transferring. When\n\ndata exceeds the limit; it will lead to a performance drop in the system.\n\nBig improvement in calculating efficiency has been realized by decreasing data transfer\n\nbetween CPU and GPU, and instead of collaborating via shared memory as a buffer.\n\nI have seen these improvements on some MSI Laptops which comes with new RTX 3000 Laptops. After looking at those I couldn\u2019t resist but to pre-book one for myself. \n\nTo sum up, MSI implements Intel CPU plus NVIDIA GPU that will technically improve frame-per-second (FPS) by 5%-10%, which is currently the best solution for direct memory access between CPU and GPU. 2021 is going to be a great year for mobile gaming.",

Palo, Fortinet, Checkpoint, all do the same NGFW stuff - IPS/Content Inspection, DNS Security, Decryption, etc...  All of these features are being disrupted by cloud-native products like Cloudflare, Zscaler, and cloud providers like AWS/Azure.\n\nThe \"cloud\" sentiment is happening whether its your thing or not.  The biggest companies on earth are abandoning their data centers.  It is simply more cost and risk effective.  Will it happen tomorrow? No. But it is a fact that pure cloud is going to be the dominant way IT departments function in the future.  We'll see \"hybrid cloud\" for a while, but it wont last.  \n\n\nRegulatory and compliance requirements are changing regulations to accommodate cloud only environments as everyone agrees this is the way forward.  \n\n\nI don't think that Checkpoint is a *bad* investment.

        "body": " \n\nHey there, this is Tom, this is one of my accounts, not sure which as I tend to lose passwords and end up making new accounts... :). I just finished reading this post and I want to stress I have no hate or anger towards the OP, but I'd like to offer my side of story if you may:\n\n1. I think the OP should have disclosed he is managing a competing youtube channel in the same niche as me. Its a smaller channel and it is pretty much the same content and audience. Not saying he did this to clout chase, as I am sure his motives are pure, but he needed to disclose this fact and omitting it is kinda weird... (especially since he posted this exact post in multiple YouTube promotion groups...)\n2. He couldn't find my intro video after viewing it once: That is because it will only auto play for first time visitors, for repeat visitors the page plays the recent video posted instead of the intro. That point amused me...\n3. I only do small cap stocks and trendy stocks: here is an excel spreadsheet which I keep of every stock I covered, Its open to my subscribers to audit me at any moment. You will soon find out I cover large cap blue chip stocks (apart from 2 stocks) like CRM, MSFT, ORCL, FTNT, TSLA, TWLO and many others. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bR4KloyKmRXqY-Eh2nG-fs4-yRqDpfnkTpCYIgh1Q3E/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bR4KloyKmRXqY-Eh2nG-fs4-yRqDpfnkTpCYIgh1Q3E/edit#gid=0)\n4. He couldn\u2019t find my credentials on social media: I\u2019ve said this many times before that Tom Nash is a stage name, I am a Russian guy and this name is not my legal name. Exposing this seems to me a bit strange after I made a video explaining that months ago. My real social media is obviously not under this name and since I want to keep my privacy I won\u2019t disclose it ever. I want to protect my own identity. I got a family and kids so I think most of you would agree that is the smart move. Saying my credentials don't show up on my fake profile on linkedin is kinda funny...\n5. I did other youtube channels, including gaming, audio and youtube education: My youtube passion is not something new, I was doing youtube for years, including educational content and even an audio channel. I could have deleted these old channels but I keep them up since its NOT a secret lol. One channel is called gearly reviews and we posted once every few months. We actually have a few videos that got millions of views there and I\u2019m proud of that channel. Which I wish I had more time to work on. My youtube educational videos are mostly gone now since it\u2019s trash but some can be found here and there and they are cringe. I do still run a youtube group for creators and I posted about it many times on my channel asking people to join if they want to do youtube. It\u2019s sponsored by TubeBuddy and we plan to revive it and post much more content there to help creators. I always did youtube on the side as a hobby and obviously I was trying to find my audience and become a full time YouTube, this was always my dream and exposing this item is kinda pointless. I even had a gaming channel called gamernomics but it\u2019s gone now since I feel I was so cringe. I\u2019m still a massive gamer though even with 3 kids... for me saying I was always passionate about youtube and using the fact I tried to break through as proof I\u2019m a fraud is strange lol. Funny enough I only broke through when I quit my job and went all in on this channel without a safety net.\n6. My guru exposed videos: I loved doing guru exposed videos but I kinda shifted away from this since it\u2019s very taxing emotionally being negative and going at people. When I moved into the stock scene it wasn\u2019t as big and in fact my views took a hit. My Ignite and NKLA videos used to get massive views which my stock videos will never get but I love it so I\u2019ll keep doing it. It\u2019s true I have no courses or affiliate links on my channel but I do have channel membership and a big Patreon community, since I am trying to make it into a viable business, don\u2019t think there is something wrong here.\n7. As far as work, and what I did. It\u2019s very simple. After graduating from Umich I was lucky to even find a job in 2009. Started as an intern at a major investment bank for 40k per year and moved my way up. Eventually moved up to senior analyst. Never claimed I was managing director or a VP or a stock broker lol. I then moved back to my country and got a job at one of the BIG4 companies (EY, PWC, DTT, KPMG). Just so you know every big4 has a multiple divisions and I ended up working for the financial division doing valuations, due diligence and a lot of transnational work related to M&amp;A. My job was to look at financials and find out how valuable the company really is. Eventually burned out and quit to decide to go in on YT and here we are.\n\nNo hate from me to the OP. It\u2019s all good. Much love Tom.",

        "body": "Thanks for this addition.\n\nI guess the buzzword for vendor is depending on where you look as all I hear is that the management interface and the distribution of ruleset is so much better on the Check Point gear. That said Check Point is not only a firewall. It's an IPS blade with a firewall. Something (some of) the others charge extra for.\n\nThe sentiment for \"all cloud\" is not my thing. I don't believe in cloud-only for a cross-sector and industry as the replacement for on-prem. Cloud may work on a broad scale for some industries and sectors but I recon we'll see more agnostic and hybrid environments being the norm when we're done buzzwording (as if that ever happens in infosec lol). At some point in time regulation may follow but some things simply don't work well in the cloud (legislation and other outside factors).\n\nAbout IaC, I see Check Point being much more on-par than for example Cisco. I haven't worked with Fortinet or Palo Alto although we had a sales meeting with Palo Alto for some of the \"Next Gen Slideware\" they had which I (personal preference) did not like at all. I really do believe that the government wide investment into Cyber Security that Isreal has made will benefit the vendors from there. Cyberark may also be one to benefit although they are far to expensive for my liking atm.\n\nAbout Fortinet. I haven't had time to proper dig into them yet but the fundamentals python code I've got really have them as a candidate for a rocket in price.\n\nI'm glad to see a fellow Security-person here :-)",

        "body": "The tech sector is in a shit spot now. Explains why it has an even worse downturn. PLTR had a sell volume of 69M today at market open.\n\nPLTR might still be dropping until about 21 or 20 maximum imo. \n\nI hope it recovers though. It is a cybersecurity company that worked on US government military contracts and with the CIA, recently had a contract with IBM but IBM had a garbage last report (with the pervious ones also being bad) also, so I do not see much +++ in the following 1-2 weeks. After that it might get better I hope.\n\nIn the long run/big picture a tech company is always a good investment unless their employees are completely braindead. I wouldn't say they are so stupid in this example since they have worked with the military and they should not be lenient work partners imo.\n\nThe behavior pattern I have noticed with PLTR is that when all the other stocks are doing poor PLTR is still doing well or it is sometimes Workhorse GRP, the traders need something to fill their daily trades even on red days.\n\nThose days are mostly just up and down jumps and lots of short selling on a 1-5 minute time range.\n\nThey did unlock the stock from the IPO either today or it might be on Friday, not sure about this information though. \n\nAny time a \"hack\" attack happens or similar security breach, this stock also tends to have a somewhat of a rising. Similar with other companies for cybersecurity like Fortinet, Qualys and Splunk.\n\nIn general I would say to stay away from this until late evening Friday 21:55 and then buy and hope for next Monday market opener to be a better restart.\n\nNon legally binding advice.\n\nI do own the stock.",
