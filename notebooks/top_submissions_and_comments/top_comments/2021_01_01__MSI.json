The existence of Microsoft PCs didn't stop others from capturing share.\n\nI didn't say that the first company to market always loses, but they are not guaranteed market share.  On that note, when was the last time you bought a Motorola phone?  Or a Blackberry?  Hell, we can even look at the history of the automotive sector itself.\n\nTesla is sitting in a very bizarre spot right now where it is being valued as if it already has accomplished its lofty goals.  It will need to earn this valuation against a field of competitors which is something much harder in practice than in the wide, dollar-filled eyes of investors.  It's easier to imagine TSLA doing all these things than for them to *actually* do them.\n\nRegarding #2, you realize there are already non-auto manufacturing companies working on this, right?",

The difference is in this case it\u2019s like the Motorola razor is trying to take on the iPhone.  The current banking/payments system work really well.  \n\nThe Decentralized Finance (DeFi) theme sounds interesting and new - it\u2019s not it\u2019s just deregulated finance.  DeFi won\u2019t work in my view because regulators won\u2019t let it - Finance is an important foundation of the economy - we saw what happened in 2008 when it went off the rails.  In ten years I think we will see it\u2019s hard to disrupt highly regulated industries.  We are starting to see it already - Jack Dorsey is critical of new cryptocurrency regulation.  They are going to find that these regulations aren\u2019t a bug of the system they are a critical feature.\n\nTime will tell.",

        "body": "Starting from bottom. Your argument is correct. That is why Tesla announced it is creating cheaper \u201c25k model\u201d for each of China, EU, and USA separately that will cater to their respective market. \n\nYou are correct here as well. But currently, majority of Toyota\u2019s 10M sales come from US, Japan, EU, China and Tesla can achieve similar feat if they focus enough on these markets (except Japan). When other developing countries like Vietnam can afford cars, Toyota will sell way more than 10M cars, maybe around 15M in 6 years. I never said Toyota will fail, they currently make the best (ice and non-plug hybrid) cars after all. \n\nYour argument that Tesla isn\u2019t doing well in EU is completely incorrect. They are doing really well, with demand very high. Unfortunately for now, they still have to import cars from China, which itself is supply constraint. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still the 2nd best selling EV in EU despite being a lot more expensive due to import tax and transportation; and once giga Berlin goes online, things would get much clear. At current rate, Tesla can easily get 1.5M in EU in 6 years, especially after they introduce their budget hatchback model specifically designed for EU. \n\nAnd Japan and Korea aren\u2019t that much of nationalistic as you think. If someone can make a better car, they will buy it. Japanese manufacturers did make the best cars, so there was no need to buy earlier. I mean, Apple sells millions of iPhones in Japan despite Sony and Motorola having released decent phones but barely selling anything. Japan and Korea can still represent 200-250k sales, but that\u2019s not necessary for 10M target. USA, China, EU, UK, and Norway are the most promising market that can account for majority of 10M sales. And I believe Tesla is focusing on these markets for now anyways.",
