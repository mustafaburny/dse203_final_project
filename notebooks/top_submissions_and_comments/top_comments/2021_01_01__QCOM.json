It can't keep running hotter on the same process to try to match the performance from smaller processes working cohesively (AMD). And that's just for chips on x86, Apple now has brought ARM as a real alternative to that space as well. Intel doesn't even really tangibly exist on the mobile side or on tablets as it's Qualcomm and Apple running that show.

I wasn't invested in the highly speculative dotcom stuff, but many other companies got caught up in the bubble. I was primarily invested in Qualcomm.\n\nI hit my target in the summer of 1999, but I didn't sell right away, things were increasing at an unreal rate. I remember one day QCOM went up by more than 100 points. I made more on QCOM that day than my annual salary. By the fall, I was looking at huge capital gains and I decided to just hold out until the new year to sell that way I could delay paying the capital gains tax by another year.\n\nSo, I sold out of my position the first week of January. I know people say the bubble popped in March, but I remember the decline starting in January. I've always thought it was because of people like me, trying to delay tax payments by a year.",

In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",

I bought before the cylance acquisition because I thought I was being a genius thinking BB was basically a smaller qualcomm jr with all their parents. And I was super mad when qualcomm was in all that litigation with apple that I didn't buy on my thesis that it was super undervalued and the lawsuit was just giving bad vibes to the price. Well, cylance acquisition comes along and it jumps from like $8 to $10. I thought I was on a momentum train. Little did I realize I was on a train to baghold central. I held and it ate more shit. It wasn't until I forgot who told me to free up that capital and eat the 20%ish loss on it and get it back on another play. That's when everything changed. The problem was I kept seeing the $20k gone. Not that it was 20%. Now I think of everything in %. \n\nSo do I think the same way about BB? ABSOLUTELY NOT. FK JOHN CHEN. TOOK THAT ASSHOLE A YEAR TO REALIZE HE NEEDS TO SELL THE FKING PATENTS TO CELLPHONES WHEN THE FKING COMPANY DOESN'T EVEN MAKE THEM ANYMORE?! IN FACT, THEY FKING LICENSE THEIR NAME OUT FOR THE ONES YOU SEE TODAY!! I WAS WAITING FOREVER. AND I KNOW HELLA OTHER BAG HOLDERS WERE/ARE TOO. \n\nAm I bitter? Probably. Am I biased? Damn straight. But for real, the GME situation and the BB situation are not even in the same area code. They are not comparable situations. So in closing, FK JOHN CHEN. FK BRAINASIUM. I QUIT.",

I've been in since I saw it at $4 last year, thinking it is good to just hold in case it is a big 5G winner.\n\nHuawei is one of the big 5G equipment makers out there but they are [restricted](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-47041341) in parts of Europe and also in the US.  The restrictions in the US do expire this year, so if the new administration extends them, the news should cause all 5G stocks to go up just on that decision.\n\nThere is also the idea that once they get highly profitable again, they will reinstate the dividend which will likely cause the stock price to get a nice boost.  Their current P/E ratio is 46 so they really need to generate a ton of profits to get that down, but they have the potential.\n\nNokia also owns a lot of patents, but so do many others, and upholding them or enforcing them is probably very costly; it is not clear if the ones they hold are worth more than what everyone else has (Huawei, Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, ZTE, Ericsson, etc.)",

        "body": "Regarding VR..\n\nI really appreciate what Facebook has done for VR, and at or below cost to consumers which has really helped grow the audience size.  However, the \"sleeping\" giant here is Apple, and I'm not sure how well Facebook will be able to compete with whatever Apple eventually does.\n\nUnlike smartphones, where the fidelity of the user experience on a 3 year old phone isn't really that different from the latest phones today, the minimum fidelity required for VR to see massive adoption is *beyond* what current reasonably-priced hardware is capable of.\n\nVR gaming today is fun, but for games fidelity isn't nearly as important as gameplay.  An example of this is how Nintendo continues to create very successful consoles despite always being at least 1 generation behind its competitors in performance and fidelity.  \n\nBut most people just are not gamers.  For mass market appeal, VR/AR has to move beyond gaming to have experiences like virtual conferencing and multiplayer virtual tourism (which do already exist) that are *so realistic* that people prefer them to current flat screen options and are willing to pay for a new device just to have that capability.\n\nVR performance and fidelity is all about vertical integration, and Apple is undisputed king here.  The recent M1 chip is an example of that prowess, and it'll almost certainly be that Apple's AR/VR devices will be based on a future generation of it.  For a device you wear on your face, industry-leading fan-less performance per watt is a massive edge.\n\nThe rumor is that Facebook has been working on their own chips, to replace the Qualcomm CPU/GPUs they use today, but it's not easy to create this capability from scratch in just a few years.\n\nIn Facebook's favor though is the network effect and platform lock-in (lose purchases if you switch) of being one of the first to market with a device selling several million units.",

        "body": "&gt; Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. \n\n\nWhy? What math? 2020 is only year revenue went up. \n\n\n&gt; Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity.\n\n\nWhat rumors. There was the EV platform rumors but that\u2019s all. EV have sensors so sure. Automation as in self driving? Sure but QNX IVY isn\u2019t about self driving and would be very late to the game if it was. So industrial automation? \n\n\nCyber security with Cylance? It made $50m for them and cost $1.4b. \n\n\n&gt;FB suit\n\n\nHow much? \n\n\n&gt; SpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.\n\n\nSources. Links. Spacex - for what ? QNX rocket?  Zoom? For what? Data integrity when it already has a China backdoor? Qualcomm? For what ? \n\n\nBB has worked with some gov historically but specifically on what? \n\n\nSony partnership. Cool. Sony doesn\u2019t make cars. They made 1 and said they weren\u2019t selling it. BB also gets $5 a car fee. \n\n\n&gt; This all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.\n\nNobody wants to work there. They have lots of job postings for that reason. Would you rather work at BB and get paid less $ and get worthless options or work at GOOG and get valuable options and paid more $? \n\n\nThe way I see it is it potentially was overlooked and revenue is growing. That\u2019s the only possibility for it\u2019s up value to be real. \n\n\nStocks are overlooked all the time. \n\n\nMaybe no profit last 4yr because reinvesting and research expenses etc. and accounting write downs (non cash). But cash flow from ops is also negative I think, or not great. \n\n\nEV or not, car sales are probably not spiking any time soon so nothing changed on the sales front for BB IVY, unless these new deals are guaranteed revenue. We\u2019d have to know their details. \n\n\nTech price to sales is 5-10x. MSFT is at 10 P/S. Is BB on par with MSFT? \n\nBB was at 3-4 P/S and now is at 7.5 P/S which is more reasonable for them. (TTM - trailing 12mo) (https://ycharts.com/companies/BB/ps_ratio)\n\n\nP/S doesn\u2019t factor in growth of the future. If sales growth then the ratio will go down unless the stock goes down.\n\n\n If we can confirm based on the items above that BB sales will increase (which, without the details to confirm it I would argue yes; how much, unknown) then there is room for BB price to increase. \n\n\nBB price is fair to increase a bit from its current price as well to perhaps 8.50x P/S. That would put the stock at $14.11. \n\n\nThrow in some growth there and in a year it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to see **$18.43 share price. **\n\n\nAgain this assumes the initial above points are all vetted and the revenue is strong.",

Most people outside of finance had never heard about an \"ETF\". We were also seeing 6.5% CD rates in 2000. We didn't have iPhones back then, but my Lexus had a \"car phone\". Enjoyed the ride up in 1999, and saw much of that money erode come 2000. However, since I still had a job, I was able to continue to buy in 2000 when things were going down. Made my first $1M after 2 drawdown periods (1999 and 2008); $150k invested over 12 years (I'd try to put in $1k/month most months, and a bit extra when I could) turned into $1M.\n\nThere's just so much more information and knowledge available now, and the folks of today don't seem to have a problem with holding through drawdowns. I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns. I've never seen such an iron conviction before. Folks of today are not afraid of drawdowns or volatility. Additionally, between all of our corporations, we're pumping in billions of new dollars every single week into the market now.\n\nTimes have changed, and you're kidding yourself if you haven't seen the change.",

It bothered me that this stock has never been hardly over $60 in its whole life, and I've been using Nokia phones since they first came out. How does a phone company that was once number one in the world never have more than a $60 value in the market? Answer: the iPhone, and when it debuted in 2007, it sent 90% of NOK's value down the toilet. Virtually destroyed the company. What can it do now? What brings it back from the dead? \n\n5G. It's the new mania and it's going to take a lot of companies to the top again. Nokia is the leader of 5G technology thanks to their association with Qualcomm (the undisputed masters of 5G right now), and usually...well, in most cases, the one leading the group is always ahead. AT&amp;T had to delay their 5G slightly when it was ready to go in June 2020 (thanks, COVID =P) and they cover only about 17k cities and towns, (and you just know for them to say it like that, it's hardly a huge slice of the market and they know it \\^\\^) so guess who's lagging behind already? Meanwhile, NOK keeps gobbling up contracts around the world as of 2020, and there's already a whole host of positive news in this month alone.\n\nNOK is a great play, and don't be too surprised to see it get to $60 again. This is something to hold long-term.",

Startups had to enter into deals with OEMs (often competitors) to manufacture their chips. \n\n1987 : enter TSMC, pioneered the contract manufacturing model. Startups now had a partner which was 1.
