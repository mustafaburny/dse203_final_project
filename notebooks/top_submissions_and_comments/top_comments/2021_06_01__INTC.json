        "body": "Copying and pasting from an earlier conversation I had today:\n\nNvidia has a few CMP HX partner models preparing to launch - these are the mining specific cards. They have no display output which means they can't be used for gaming. Nvidia is also revising ALL current 30 series (except 3090 I believe) to a LHR (light hash rate) version which is a physical difference in the silicon. They are doing this to nerf ETH mining performance on their 30 series cards at the hardware level.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's CMP HX mining cards make no economic sense to mine on since they are way less power efficient, and have no resale value since they can't be used for gaming. However, if Nvidia completely locks down ETH hash rate on the 30 series, they can increase their TAM by preventing miners from cannibalizing their gaming sales. So far, the CMP HX cards look like they are built on 10 series architecture so they will be able to be produced cheaper and in parallel to 30 series.\n\nLastly, the ARM deal seems to be moving along. Qualcomm has voiced concerns and said they are ready to invest in ARM as a partner if the Nvidia deal falls through. Nvidia says it has 3 other silicon manufacturers who support the Nvidia deal but details aren't known yet. Nvidia's recent rise is likely due to the probability of the ARM deal actually becoming more likely.\n\nIn case you dont understand why the ARM deal is good for NVDA, it means that all ARM-based chip manufacturers are beholden to NVDA. ARM is the most dominant CPU architecture for all mobile CPUs including micro controllers in other devices. Apple, qualcomm, samsung, amd, intel, huawei, IBM all have ARM licenses\n\nIt allows NVDA to penetrate the mobile market. Nvidia has the highest profit margins on their mobile CPUs because they don't have to rely on partners to distribute chunky desktop cards. They sell the silicon directly. Every iphone and samsung galaxy could have an Nvidia-produced CPU and GPU.\n\nThe reason ARM is used for mobile is because of its power efficiency. If Nvidia knows what they are doing (they do) then they know how they can use their proprietary access to ARM to create ultra performant and efficient server chips, feeding into their datacenter revenue.\n\nNvidia has announced plans to enter the server CPU market. When they announced this, Intel and AMD stock tanked 5% or so. My bet is that they are already working with ARM to deliver their CPU server chips\n\nTL;DR - ARM deal going through would make NVDA pull a page out of 2020 TSLA's book. Downside is ARM deal delays, pricing in approval then having it get denied. Would crush the stock.",

They have struggled to deploy their newest technologies and are &gt;two years behind - executing and management of technical risk have been tough.  They have had to consider outsourcing operations to their competitors.\n\nI also think there are major potential headwinds with the direction chip companies are taking.  Take for example apple (M1), Tesla and google.  All are moving major applications from generalist chips where intel made their name to specialized chips designed to work with their(that companies) software.  Intel has to become a foundry to compete for this business (and has announced to invest to do just that) - but there will be more competition here for that.  Even servers which is where intel has been strong and showing some movement to custom chips.\n\nI think if they can sort out their technology scaling challenges they have great assets.  The new strategy from the exec team there seems decent And semi is expected to be strong for the next few years.  And their are some macro issues in their favor (concerns about too much tech concentration in Taiwan, lack of domestic (US) chip mfg.  But they have to get a good edge back and execute well or I think they have real risk of continuing to lose market share.\n\nTo those saying US government needs will fill.  until recently used IBMs old fab in fishkill ny for a lot of defense needs.  But missles don\u2019t need the most advanced chips like you find in computers (fishkill was 90/65nm vs TSMC which is announcing 2nm).

        "body": "AMD is in the logic gate design industry, NOT manufacturing. \n\nIntel kept their foundries which is why Intel has worse PE ratios compared to AMD and NVDA. Manufacturing is very capital intensive and low margin (generally). Obviously when they are all running at capacity, margins are great. Capacity is industry secret so nobody will ever know what capacity is and whether anyone is lying. There is basically no reason for foundries to advertise free capacity unless they are stupid. \n\nTSMC are killing it now though and gaining know how with EUV which is very valuable. Its also a strategically important industry which the Taiwan government will protect at all costs. Probably another reason why the US would go to war if PRC tries to invade. They want to keep China out of this bleeding edge technology. TSMC seem to be pumping chunks into Capex for plants in the US. God knows why they pick Arizona when they need water but hey ho. That said, I think there are better investments than TSMC. More on that later. \n\nAMD's main advantage is in CPU over Intel in x86. To this day, I cant allocate how much this is due to AMD being better in R&amp;D than Intel vs Intel giving up on EUV with ASML. Either way, Intel screwed up huge and looks to be about 2 years behind in tech. I read somewhere that Intel has got ASML lined up to provide some hardware for Intel in 2023. They may or may not regain competitive products around there since my gut is they prefer monolithic vs chiplet design and they need pellicles for that (yield reasons) and EUV/Pellicles seems to work now. Nothing to concern me for near future but long term, we will need to see what AMD has lined up for 2023 vs new monolithic dies from Intel. Their latest product stack (Emerald Rapids) slipping into 2023 is great for AMD. Still stuck on 10nm. KEK\n\nWhat the fuck is ASML? They produce the EUV machines for foundries. They have a monopoly on this. All foundries that want to use EUV must buy from ASML. ASML is printing money and cant invest it fast enough so gives dividends. ASML price has gone bananas but its probably still a decent buy imo. Their margins are huge because... they can be. Who else are foundries going to get EUV tech from? Exact entry price? I am going to wait for a small dip and then buy into it. I am late to the party for sure. Applied Materials also a supplier for foundries. No monopoloy like ASML but still very important supplier. \n\nSo why dont I like TSMC as much as ASML and Applied Materials? In the end, they are still a manufacturer. At the mercy of supply demand. Its cyclical. Decent investment but I prefer to invest into monopolies. \n\nNVDA? Priced too high for my liking but prob just still goes up like TSLA for unexplained reasons. They are KILLING it in GPU and datacentre. AMD exists in this space but NVDA just has the superior tech and mature software stack with CUDA. \n\nSo anyway, whats the TL:DR?\n\nSemi conductor market can only go up imo. Up chunks. Like more than analysts estimate. \n\nYou can capture this better through AMD and ASML than vs Intel (bad tech for now), NVDA (over priced for me but might still just go up). \n\nI am long AMD. Looking to hold for 10ish years. Maybe this bitch hits 400 a share or something once AMD holds 60% of datacentre CPU. \n\nDont play weeklies and stuff. Just buy the stock or if you must do options, do LEAPS. \n\n\"its all priced in\" - is it fuck. Still lots of gains to be had, just cant prediuct weekly prices. \n\nNot financial advice bla bla bla",

LT as in nearing decade rather than years.\n\nIMO INTC isn't good for the short term and you'd have to have a lot of faith in Gelsinger turning the ship around. Right now Intel is not undervalued but IMO fairly priced given the risks involved in investing in it. The price is right but I think OP is looking at the upside potential compared to the price and sees a deal. As someone holding the company and considering my holdings, I would say there is upside potential (esp if you hold long) but it's not \"undervalued\".\n\nThe reason why it's not \"undervalued\" is because it's losing and getting disrupted. It's a tech company in the sense that it's in the field of high tech semis, but it's NOT a tech company in the sense of growth and disrupting others. In fact it's looking like a dinosaur. TSM, CSM, Samsung, etcetc. AMD, NVDA, ARM, etcetc. All bombarding it from all sides. Cheaper &amp; faster manufacturing, 7nm/5mn foundries built and running, 7nm/5nm designed and selling, already developing 5nm/3nm, etctec. \n\nAnd that's before we get into the real problem: the FAAAMs &amp; BATs are looking for places to expand and the semi space is where many of them are looking. \n\n&gt;Apple recently stopped using Intel chips and have their in house designed M1/M2 chips manufactured by TSM. Apple isn't going back to INTC anytime soon. And Apple doesn't go away. Nokia/Motorola phones basically dead, watch industry forever changed, Ipad industry disrupted, app store still dominating, apple computers aren't made by someone else, etcetc. Intel cannot fight back against Apple and it will NEVER kill Apple. Maybe Apple gets too comfy and declines, but that's not something Intel can control. If anything, the last 20 years have shown Apple only gets stronger and better with each reiteration of their products.\n\n&gt;MSFT? Doing the same thing AAPL is doing. Intel ain't effecting, killing, or pushing out Microsoft either. MSFT is bigger, more corporate, more innovative, and has stronger ties to China which INTC does not have. INTC isn't going to kill the Xbox, windows, office, github, skype, linkedin, bing, etctec. Nope. INTC has it's hands full desperately struggling to catch up to AMD/NVD/SMG on development and SMG/TSM/CSM in manufacturing. \n\n&gt;AMZN? Already dominating everything. Has AWS needs. Will look to in-housing their chips if supply issues become a problem. AMZN make so much money it has to actively lose money going into new businesses to keep from paying boatloads of taxes. Right now it's shipping, but chips could be next now that it sees MSFT/AAPL doing it.\n\n&gt;GOOG? Already doing chips in their own way. Leader in AI. Can use chips in their own chromebooks/phones. Fighting a cloud war in AAPL which chips might come in handy. Also has tons of cash laying around.\n\n&gt;Now FB is in a war with AAPL with apple using it's products to lockout FB datamining. FB is complaining about Apple app store fees and monopoly. FB will look to ways to circumvent that by going into hardware. And thus they'll be incentivized to not use INTC or go into chips themselves.\n\n&gt;Chinese BATs looking to do the same. Japanese tech leaders playing defensive but not backing down. Europe doesn't have the same tech titans but will pull some legislative B.S. to protect their own markets.\n\nSee the real reason I say INTC isn't \"undervalued\" is because it's fairly valued given the very real threats that surround it on multiple sides. It's big, has US government backing, in a still growing industry, and can whether a beating. But INTC was INTC because it was a technology leader that disrupted the industry. It's technology lead was what kept AAPL using INTC chips and everyone off their back. It was their moat. And now that moat is disappearing if not gone with a lot of bigger, stronger, more innovative, more driven, better runned, and better funded companies that they have no answer to eating it's market share.",

Based on the comments in this thread and on this sub in general, you'd think Intel was on the brink of going under or about to be swallowed by AMD. I'd strongly suggest having a look at both companies' financials to get a better understanding of the situation.\n\nHere are some numbers (from 2020) to put things into perspective:\n\nFree cash flow (FCF): INTC $20 B - AMD $0.77 B\nRevenue: INTC $77.7 B - AMD $11.4 B\nOustanding shares (last 5 years): INTC -14% - AMD +52.8%\nPrice to FCF: INTC 15.5 - AMD 290\n\nIf the immense differences in revenue, FCF and valuation weren't enough, AMD also managed to dilute its shareholders by a whopping 53% over the past 5 years, while Intel actually bought back shares and thereby increased the equity per share. If you don't know what this means, I advise you to learn more because this severely impacts the returns you will see on your investment. It's about more than just the movement of the stock price.",

Some of these sectors, like cars, who were expecting decreased consumer demand instead witnesses unusually high demand, and they were unable to regain their slots. \n\nAlso building a chip plant takes at bare minimum five years and that is assuming the wait list for chip manufacturing equipment isn't already years (which, spoilers: it is). Intel's biggest asset is that they're a US company, and there's national security interest in on-shoring. So I expect the USG to bail them out by funding a major US chip production facility within the USA for mostly USG/DoD consumption. In the meantime AMD/TSM will continue to eat Intel's lunch, and their market share (which is a lagging indicator) will continue to shrink.   \n\nWhile I'm bullish on Intel over tens of years for the reason above, I'm bearish right now as I don't believe we've hit the bottom. P/E may actually get worse if earnings sink as Intel tries to compete with AMD's superior products in the enterprise/data-center space (i.e. deep discounts).    \n\nSo I may buy Intel but not at $57, maybe at $45~.",

Their multi core cpu like the 5950x is actually as good as intels i910900k processor for gaming if not just a cunt hair better...plus it blows intel out of the water for multicore uses but at 2x the price. I used intels 10900k in my gaming build as it is neck and neck for the best cpu for gaming for half the cost. I have no use for the amd 5950x because i dont do content creation or stream.

        "body": "You are failing to realize a few key bear considerations for AMD: \n\n-Every major software company is starting to look at bringing chip design in house in the same way that apple launched the M1 and left intel left to out to dry. Amazon\u2019s AWS for example doesn\u2019t want to pay AMD a heavy margin for their slightly modified general purpose ARM design that Amazon could do better/cheaper for their instances. It\u2019s public knowledge that they are building their own chips to use for AWS services. Microsoft doesn\u2019t want to use the power hungry and inefficient chips of yore either on Azure or the devices they are selling- you could even imagine them eventually bundling windows and windows chips to OEMs for a discount. \n\n-The Tesla deal is garbage. AMD sells more chips from Xbox sales in a day than they will sell in a year on premium Tesla models (S+X).\n\n-The real winners (other than big tech SW companies) are ASML (semi manufacturing devices used by intel, and TSMC among others) and NVDA (I believe that the ARM deal will go through). If the ARM deal goes through, every major player in the tech space will need to pay out licensing fees to NVDA if they are not using NVDA chips. That combined with SW development ecosystem NVDA offers makes it pretty compelling IMO.",

I don't make a whole lot of money so it's a perfect set up for me. I max it out, buy some solid names at good prices and try to hold them.\n\nThe plan is obviously retirement. But if anything comes up before then, I can take out money with no penalties and do what I need to do, maybe a down payment on a house one day.\n\nIf there's one thing I wish I did more, was take some risks for high returns. But I don't think now is the time for that. I hate holding a stock with no dividend and just watching it bounce around so I go with dividend payers. \n\nMy positions are: SWKS, LMT, AAPL, CSCO, QCOM, KLIC, INTC, KMI. A bit tech heavy but I know they will be relevant for years to come.\n\nI also have a problem buying a stock \"early\" and selling it before it really takes off. Broadcom and Align technologies are the two that come to mind.",
