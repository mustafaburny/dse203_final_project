Why do people call every semi-rational, logical, and at times evidential thing as a conspiracy theory related to stupidity or mental illness, when the US government and each state convict thousands of people each year of criminal and civil conspiracy?  When the government reps or the media say it, then its true cause those guys can't lie to you and commit conspiracy = cognizant dissonance.  lol, the SEC wouldn't allow naked shorting so of course AMC is only short the amount of shares in float.",

However, we have to be cognizant of the risks and difficulties involved in doing so. \n\nThink about what's the likelihood of me beating the market? What the likelihood of me underperforming the market? If I outperform, what returns can I reaonable get, if I underperform, what returns can I reasonable get. I would take it from there.\n\nAll the best :)",

        "body": "But I\u2019d you want an actual debate as opposed to random online shit-posting. (Which was my intention last night).  I post random crap to get reactions.  Sue me. \n\nIn my mind \u201cprivilege\u201d has some merits in some very instances.  And yes, my experiences are limited to mostly the US.  Which just by luck of chance happened to be where I was born.  I experience \u201cprivilege\u201d by generally getting the benefit of the doubt that I am not going to commit a crime wherever I am.  I can get pulled over and probably just get a warning.  I don\u2019t get randomly harassed by cops and business owners typically treat me with respect.  That is a basic privilege that I get simply by being born white.  The rest of it\u2026 no one knows how I grew up.  I grew up extremely poor.  I wasn\u2019t handed anything.  No inheritance or anything like that. As far as my views on the $200k not being \u201ca shit ton\u201d of my money, that was a bit of an exaggeration for effect, but also an accurate statement based on the cost of living in the US. Is it a \u201cprivilege\u201d that you need to earn $5M to be set for life in the US?  If I had been lucky enough to be born in a less expensive country, I could call it a day at the first million.  Everything is relative.  Had you commented\u2026 \u201cwe don\u2019t all live in really expensive places, $200k is still a ton of money here in Uganda\u201d, that would not have elicited a response.  Instead, you chose \u201ccheck you privilege\u201d which is generally code for \u201cyou sound like a pampered rich bastard so your opinion has no merit\u201d.  Perhaps you meant it differently, but that is how it is used consistently. As much as I like trolling the internet, I do also enjoy a decent intellectual debate.  I stand by my statement that \u201ccheck your privilege\u201d is a dismissive comment.  I am actually very introspective.  I\u2019ve spent a great deal of time \u201cchecking my privilege\u201d and identifying areas where it does seem to apply.  And areas where it doesn\u2019t.  It\u2019s an over-used phrase that I find offensive.  And yes\u2026 I\u2019ve thought long and hard about if it is offensive because it\u2019s too close to the truth.  And I don\u2019t think it is.  I am cognizant of the areas where it may apply to me and sensitive about the areas where I know it doesn\u2019t.  As far as my \u201cad hominem\u201d comment\u2026 that just personal experience.  People that use that phrase have been stuffy and pretentious.  Even snobby in their attitudes.  Perhaps you don\u2019t fit that pattern, but it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve identified.",
