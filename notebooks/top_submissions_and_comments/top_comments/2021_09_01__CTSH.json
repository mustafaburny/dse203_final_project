What if you fail and get 5-8%? Would that extend your retire years then?\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you. I think its very nice seeing someone learning the ropes of investing! However, we have to be cognizant of the risks and difficulties involved in doing so. \n\nThink about what's the likelihood of me beating the market? What the likelihood of me underperforming the market? If I outperform, what returns can I reaonable get, if I underperform, what returns can I reasonable get. I would take it from there.\n\nAll the best :)",
