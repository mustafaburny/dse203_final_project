Not 100% sure but looking at Apple and Amazon, their all time highest volume days are a mere $43b and $31b respectively.\n\n\nSo...

        "body": "Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:\n\n* Once again, Stimulus Talks are going well. Congress continues to edge along the market, with current package pricing around $900b and contentious items such as liability protection along with state and local funding are off the table. Chatter says a direct payment stimulus check is included BUT the amount has not been fully disclosed yet. It is likely to be LESS than $1,200 to keep the price tag of the package in check (likely $600 for the plebs). McConnell has noted that they will NOT leave town until a law is passed. After 6 months, we totes believe them.\n* BofA resumes coverage of MSFT with a bigly $256 price target, MSFT is up 2.4% during intraday high, despite AMZN pleading with the courts again to hold the 10b JEDI contract cuz Orange POTUS may have exerted undue influences on Pentagon's decision. Antitrust shit continues as Google is now being sued by TX AG over abuse of ad tech. (Who's still under FBI investigation for bribery and abuse of office. Let's see if POTUS pardons him if the ban hammer arrives now that the SCOTUS push went womp womp).\n* Zuck boi complained that Apple's new iOS 14 with stringent privacy policy will have a harmful impact on many \"small\" businesses that are struggling to stay afloat. Aka fuck you Tim Apple how am I going to sell data if you lock that shit up? Shares are flat for the day.\n* BA went slight red for the day after its CEO says via a memo that recovery may take 3 more years to achieve full recovery. Suspending annual merit salary increases in 2021 for most peeps. BA closed down 1.58% for the day at $255.87.\n* TLRY gets a bigly lift today thanks to a reverse merger deal with APHA, soon to close the saga on one of the memest of weed stock (WSB will remember fondly when it halted multiple times in a day). TLRY is up 26% on the news during intraday high while APHA is up 4.43%.\n* MT/Steel gang continues to pump in option land while the underlying is flat for the day, as call volume is well above normal and directionally bullish. 33k calls trading for the day, 24x more than expected volume as retail and funds get in on the steel train. Notable strike includes March and April $30c. Don't buy FDs you dumb fuck, the monthlies are cheap enough. Earnings is expected on Feb 11. Don't forget, someone's gotta be selling those options too.\n* WISH, the discount market place where you buy shitty ass scammy Alibaba shit and post it online for upvotes, debuted today with opening trade at $22.75, below its IPO pricing of $24. Shares are down almost 14% for the day as it fades to $20.65 during intraday trading and closed down -16.45% to $20.05. Turns out not every \"tech\" IPO can be a winner.\n* ABNB option trading debuted today with spreads as wide as my legs when Jpow offers me a brr. Shares ripped to as high as 12.4% during intraday, at $140. The stock closed up 10.57% for the day at $138.30. I had thought about a 140c FDs in the AM for about $1.6 a piece but pussied out. The strike touched intraday high of $6.90. Cool cool.\n* FOMC release was in expectation as the Fed held rates near zero cuz money is brr, while committing to continuing buying bonds (at least $120 bil worth) till economy gets back to full employment. They see a 4.2% growth next year and a fall of unemployment rate to \"only\" 5%. Volatility ensued as 2PM struck and WSB screech in disbelief that a major Fed announcement like this can impact their weeklies. Buy the dip, retards.\n* DJI closed down 435 pts to 0.15%, IXIC at +0.50% thanks to AMZN and MSFT, while SPX is at +0.18%. **GME closed 0.00%**. Be on the lookout for stimulus news which should resolve by the end of this week. Market moving numbers tomorrow: housing starts/permits, jobless claims, and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index all at at 8:30 AM ET. Quad Witching this Friday, Dec 18. The last time WSB went-all in on Quad Witching cuz hur dur MMs wont pay out the puts was April earlier this year. It didn't pan out. But turns out we were right eventually but for all the wrong reason. The best kind of correct!",

Tim Apple gaps up and opens at 2%+ this morning with shares going as high as 4.52% intraday. The stock closed at $127.88, up a beefy 5%, level unseen since earlier this September.\n* Meanwhile, the rest of big tech took an initial mini dump this morning while the indexes are solidly green cuz sEcToR roTAtiOn and stimulus hOpE but reversed to close mostly green (except for MSFT cuz hur dur MSFT $200c).\n* Earlier today, Pelosi asked for McConnell, Schumer, and McCarthy to a 4pm meeting, while current Congressional plan calls for splitting the $948 billion bill into two parts, a $748b in spending programs that are popular for both parties and the 2nd $160b bill with liability protection and aid to state plus local govt. Stimulus checks are STILL not in current plans (rofl). But don't worry, that public \"small business\" with a few thousand employees (not in same location) will no doubt be able to easily access forgivable PPP loans in the coming weeks!\n* Cramer talked about WSB today via a segment on TheStreet and WSB proceed to jizz over itself uncontrollably because one old bald dude talking mildly positive about WSB is *just* like the opposite sex touching our genital. This is what #WINNING in 2020 looks like, bois.\n* Chinese EV ADR/ADS jump bigly today thanks to who the fuck knows why, with XPEV at intraday high of 7.82%, NIO at 6.1%, LI at almost 5%, and KN-DI at 3%. The EV meme stocks all closed in positive territory despite pulling back from initial highs.\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR pulled back 2.97%, continuing in current channel while WSB triples down because ThIS iS a $50 sToNk. DBX, a new play by select WSBer ended the day red but don't worry, an acquisition news is just around the corner before your 12/18s expire worthless. Finally, GME is up 8.88%, likely buoyant by today's NPD report showing 35% increase in YoY November gaming spending thanks to the new gen console cycle release.\n* The Dow closed up more than 338 pts to 1.13%, Nasdaq up 155 pts to 1.25%, and S&amp;P up 47 pts to 1.29%. Will stimulus arrive? As Pelosi said by EOD: \"We'll see.\"\n* Tons of market moving events tomorrow: 8:30 AM retail sales, 9:45 AM PMI, business inventories and housing market index at 10:00 AM, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and finally Jpow speaks tomorrow at 2:30 PM ET after FOMC release at 2:00 PM. Jpow can be as dovish as he wants but without stimulus this market likely has only so much more leg to go in the near term.",

While the contentious election will likely to continue well past inauguration, most Americans are likely to move on (unless you're a fucking snowflake). \n* The problem Solvers Caucus continues to try and push their bipartisan relief bill along in Congress but faces the same challenges they've been facing with the leaders in each respective party unwilling to budge on their main demands (liability/lower price tag from McTurtle; state/local funding from Pelosi). Funny enough, talks of direct payments of $1,200 to Americans aren't as urgent now that the election is behind us and the only ones threatening to stall current govt funding bill over it is Sanders and Josh Hawley (MO GOP Senator).\n* Recent IPO ABNB and DASH both received downgrades earlier this morning, with Gordon Haskett moving Airbnb from Buy to Underperform with a $103 PT, a 26% downside. Shares were down almost 9% intraday morning to $127 as it closed the down -6.64%. Meanwhile, DASH was downgraded from Buy to Neutral at DA Davidson but with a higher price target of $150, up from $93. Shares of DASH closed -8.57%. Both analysts cites valuation as main catalyst for the downgrade. No doubt some WSBer is still bagholding from IPO highs. Don't worry fam, your baghold will earn some nice upvotes when you post the screenshots.\n* AZN drilled almost 7% intraday today with news of its $39 billion dollar deal for Alexion. SPCE shares fell 15% pre-market (and recovered to about -12% intraday) after its Dec 12 test flight failed to reach space due to rocket motor failure. GUH to all SPCE weeklies holder, esp that \"pleas fly again\" bro. Dump your OTM FDs bro, they're dead.\n* As rona continues to roam the country unabated, half-assed will we, wont we shut down measures are considered while aforementioned govt financial support continues in limbo in Congress. De Blasio has warned that NYC should prepare for full shutdown.\n* AAPL launched their Apple Fitness+ today, stock closed down -0.51% while PTON was up 4.1%. GOOGL suffered widespread outages this morning on Gmail, YouTube, and Google Dive, stock was flat for the day but ended at -1.27%. AMZN subsidiary Zoox reveal their autonomous robotaxi today while CA's AG is asking for the courts to order AMZN to comply with subpoenas for more information on their covid safety measures. \n* After fading for more than 30% in the past few days, CD Projekt Red is offering refund for PS4 and Xbox One buyers as the bug ridden game continues to receive backlash. OTGLY opened at more than 17% down but has \"recovered\" to about -9.31% as the day closed.\n* SPX went red for the day after initially opening green from vaccine rollout and touching intraday high of 0.9% up. The Dow also fell today thanks the pull back from components such as CVX and profit taking on DIS and general fear of renew lockdown measures. Chadsdaq manages to keep it green day thanks to a green day from select big tech AMZN, NFLX, et al., despite Tim Apple's red adventure (which partly contributed to SPX's fade to red as well). DJI closed down -0.62%, SPX -0.44%, and IXIC +0.50%.\n* Noteworthy marketing moving numbers and events tomorrow: Empire State Manufacturing Index / Import &amp; Export Prices at 8:30 AM ET and Fed's Industrial Production monthly index at 9:15 AM. On Wednesday, FOMC announcement at 2PM ET and Jpow speaks soon after at 2:30 PM ET. Just stfu and continue to brr, bro.",

Package includes bailout for airlines, new round of PPP \"loans\" and more. Market reacts muted to the passing of the pRiCe iN bill tho QQQ traded green for most of the day (after a quick trip to red town before noon), thanks mostly to AAPL. What would we do without Tim Apple honestly?\n* WSB GME gang has collectively nutted today, at least, for those who have diamond handed and/or load-up even more long position after the ER dump. The fabled GME squeeze may be happening in earnest as shares of the gaming retailer shot up as high as 26% during intraday high to $20 without any real additional news beyond Cohen adding to his position (revealed in a filing yesterday). As long as your entry and expiry wasn't beyond retarded, you should be making decent money on GME today. Popular expiry includes calls after April given that'll bake in the much touted Q4 ER period where new console cycle sale numbers will be revealed. WSB eagerly awaits for GME call bro to post his next update. Back of envelop math should have our bro back up about 800k at the very least. GME close the day up 25% to $19.46.\n* AAPL continues its rally from yesterday's closing hours and into AH as the stock is now also an EV play. Tim Apple is up 2.85% for the day (though intraday high was higher at almost 4%) and WSB eagerly awaits it to cross the 3 trillion market cap mark. Ez.\n* In a sign of ample liquidity in the market, IAC, the boomer \"tech/internet\" stock you probably haven't heard of announced that they will be spinning off their full Vimeo stake, which will IPO in Q2 of 2021. Shares of IAC is up 14.10% for the day and closed at $183.73.\n* Can't cuck the Zuck? Facebook offered state and federal investigators a quick rub in the form of creating a new social network in return for dropping those lame antitrust shenanigan. Somehow the govt declined the offer. Those fools. They could have brought back Friendster and MySpace but boomers are still stuck with Facebook and its flat earth and fan pages. Shares of FB continues to be pressured due to antitrust investigation and fell a bit further than general macro movements, with FB at -2% for the day, closing at $267.\n* In more big corp vs big brother action, the Feds are now after Walmart (again?), with the justice department suing WMT for fueling the opioid crisis cuz they didn't babysit people with iffy prescriptions (despite WMT internal pharmacists flagging these issues). Shares cratered -2% to low $143 but has since slowly recovered as this probably won't have any real material impact on WMT in the long term and will merely be settled with some sorta peasant amount in fines. WMT closed the day down -1.21% to $144.20\n* Sell the news appears to be in full swing for vaccine stocks as MRNA, BNTX, NVAX and others are getting pummeled through the day. MRNA was down about 9.66% to just under $125, BNTX was down -7.58% to $98, and NVAX was down -10.43% to $111 during intraday low points.\n* PTON scores a flurry of upgrades and price target increases as the fitness company returns into movement land, announcing that they will purchase fitness provider Precor for $420m. This gives Peloton much needed manufacturing capacity increase and the deal was met with positive reaction from the market. During intraday high, PTON was up as much as 13%+ to $165. Shares closed up 11.65% to $161. Notable PT upgrades: Wedbush $130 to $160, Stifel $144 to $160, KeyBanc $160 to $185, and Goldman Balls from $144 to $162. No doubt Citron is gonna post something about its valuation again in the near future.\n* In other WSB meme stock land, MT continues to trade flat even with an initial morning pop, despite the AM price target increase from KeyBanc, who upped the PT to $28 from $23 while keeping his overweight rating. For PLTR, the stock tested the new $29 channel and proceed to fade through out the day, with intraday low as much as -3.5% to just shy of $27. Shares closed the day down -1.65% at $28. For TSLA, share price continues its retreat on its 2nd day of SPX inclusion, with shares down about -1.46% to end the day at $640.\n* It's a short trading week as the market will close early Thursday so plan your FDs accordingly. Notable #s releasing tomorrow: durable goods and jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET, new home sales at 10 AM ET, and EIA draw report at 10:30 AM ET.

I believe they're currently overvalued, yet not going to drop significantly due to the growth in production they continue to show. Once they are selling 1M units a year, you can believe that the price will continue to increase. People know that this isn't GM, Honda, etc. but they see a future coming where a majority of all the EVs sold will be Tesla vehicles. All you have to do is sit in one or drive one, and you immediately can sense how much better of a customer experience it is than other modern vehicles. Part of the pricing I think is that people believe they're buying a piece of the next Amazon or the next Apple, in a moment before they truly dominated. Part of the price increase we can blame on shorts covering as well, but since then it's been kind of speculative and you can see illogical growth across the entire market due to QE money being put in the market by borrowers. I sold off a little bit of shares already to cover some margin that I had used earlier in the year, but I intend to hold for \\~10+ years. I do expect there to be a price drop some time in the next year, but I might use that as a buying opportunity to be honest. I don't believe that there will be much that shakes the stock if Elon doesn't die spontaneously, if they continue to generate a quarterly profit and outsell all their competitors even in a down market, if they continue to scale up unit production into the Millions, if they successfully launch tesla semi and cybertruck. I am truly not very concerned about competition and \"Tesla killers\". First, the market needs competition to scale. Tesla spends $0.00 on advertising, but imagine a world where you see EV commercials from the other manufacturers regularly. The entire pie for EVs will get bigger, and we know for a fact that many countries are looking to regulate out gas vehicles. Achieving these things will actually cause the price to increase, if anything, because people see Tesla as having first-mover advantage in the category. Tesla knows they're overvalued right now, and that's why Elon sent the email to his workers to keep focusing on saving money, and why they've raised capital. They'll be using the capital for their various gigafactory projects and to continue scaling. But, for real, only external shocks (like the bubble bursting) will deeply impact their stock price. I actually would appreciate a bit of reprieve from the increasing price because I think some slower growth would reduce volatility. Let's see what happens in the first 6 months of 2021!",

        "body": "Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:\n\n* Today's another lesson in \"buy the dip, retard\" as the index all opened bigly down but recovered by intraday. At its day's low, the DOW was down more than -400 pts, S&amp;P was -73 pts, and Chadsdaq was down -230 pts. Renew COVID fear punished morning paper hand tool bags as new strain of rona and UK lockdown prompted Europoors to panic sell. VIX skyrocketed up 30% much to WSB's chagrin. \n* Travel sector was especially punished as airline stocks took an initial big dive before slowly recovering from intraday lows. AAL closed the day down -2.48% at $16.10, DAL down -1.33% at $40.14, and UA finished flat at $15.09. This is despite the new stimulus bill will provide the industry with an additional 15 bil to restore jobs.\n* Bank sector continues their Friday AH performance with JPM's share buyback announcement immediately after Fed easing of restriction. JPM close the day up 3.75%, BAC up 3.73%, WFC up 1.86%, and C up 3.67%. Along with NKE's strong ER last Fri and the recovery of AAPL and others, the DOW was propelled back into green territory during intraday thanks to financial sector and printer going brr.\n* Over at S&amp;P and Nasdaq, Tim Apple turned a more than -2% day around into a green day, while MSFT becomes a fucking semiconductor stock as it rallies more than 2%, well above their $222 resistance. MSFT closed the day at +1.83%. During last hour of trading, Apple faded red but reports broke of it looking into EV production as early as 2024, with multiple details on battery and lidar design, etc. Yes, Tim Apple is now also an EV stock. Shares immediately shot back into green to close the day up 1.24% to $128.24. The hunt for their manufacturing partner should begin as it'll be the next meme stock.\n* Gene editing/CRISP stock continues to rally. As mentioned in a [previous recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbb812/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gffzab5/), SGMO, EDIT, CRSP all soared today hitting new meme status. If you've missed out on EDIT it may already been too late given premium levels and valuation is now beyond typical WSB yolo. EDIT is up more than 40% for the day from previous close of $64.41 to current intraday high of above $93. Profit taking eventually happened and EDIT closed the day up 29.89% at $83.66. Don't ask me about FOMO cuz all I have are SGMO shares instead of EDIT calls. FUCK.\n* Despite flirting with talks of you-know-what over the weekend, Elon chan ended the day down -6.49% with TSLA closing at $649.86 after its first day of trading from SPX inclusion. Boomers like Vanguard are potentially left bagholding after probably loading up almost 50 bil worth during the last minute of trading last Friday.\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR went bigly green, breaking thru the $27 resistance yet again and finally closing the day well above $28. Shares are up 9.78% at $28.48. GME went red after initially opening green from heavy premarket action, clawing back from intraday low to end the day at $15.52, down slightly at -0.64%. Reports of Ryan Cohen adding in more shares made GME gang nut (upping his stake from 10% to 13%), despite underlying not moving much. The short squeeze is looking more and more real everyday though as shares availability continue to dwindle. For steel/MT gang, the stock initially opened red but closed the day flat/slightly green - up 0.17% at $23 even.\n* Thanks to Tim Apple's late EOD EV pump, the DOW closed the day green up 36 pts at 0.12%, IXIC is slightly down -0.10%, SPX is down -0.39%, while RUT closed the day slightly green at 0.02%.\n* Stimulus is all be confirmed, though votes are still pending as Congress is having computer problems with uploading the full text of the bill online (I'm not even shitting you), votes are expected later tonight at around 8-10pm ET.\n\n(Last week Friday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/))",

Usually it\u2019s about bullshit, but here it\u2019s about playing the game that\u2019s kept millionaires rich off wage labor ranging from &lt;$.10/hr in prisons to $15/hr at \u201cbest\u201d for decades, the labor that produces, maintains, and supplies the products that determine these companies\u2019 value. Real people, behind screens, with a brain and heart that experience happiness, sadness, anxiety, surprise about trades and, much more importantly, about everything else  in life - rallying fucking PLTR with an overlay of LOTR\u2019s villains with Alex Karp and Thiel who run a corporation that succeeds based on how much civilian surveillance data it gives to ICE, FBI, CIA, and local police. And you know what who the fuck cares. They\u2019re going to do it anyway. Amazon, Apple, most of these corporations are social cancers. Check your understanding and belief in the \u201cmarket\u201d as something that benefits the majority of society, rather than extracts. This is getting in at the top. It\u2019s unreal that platforms like RH are cracking the game wide open.

If trillions can move as entries in a database, then the skyline shouldn\u2019t look the same over decades, our homes shouldn\u2019t, our cars shouldn\u2019t, and issues like hunger, homelessness, and poverty related to money at the level that dollars mean survival while at the top it\u2019s not even noticeable certainly shouldn\u2019t.

As battery capacity increases and the manufacturing processes are refined ICE cars will be viewed as we view steam engines today.\n\nThat doesn't explain TSLAs stock price, but you're wrong about the technology IMO. I think TSLA is a lot like Apple too. They're created a strong brand with tech enthusiasts as has been seen recently with people buying overpriced shorts and tequila just because of the TSLA branding.

I'll admit sometimes if they really hot i make my balance like $100million.\n\n\n2. Walk up to them and ask them to take a picture with your phone but leave paper trading account open. She will proceed to see your account balance while trying to take a photo.\n\n\n3. Then make it was mistake sayings \"oopsie, how embarrassing....im a professional stock man forgot to close it after selling $1 million worth apple shares.\"\n\n\n4. Watch their eyes to make sure they realize what is going on. That how you know they saw it. Then spit some bullshit game saying something like like you are a bush fund manager or something else dumb (these sloots are so dumb they have no idea its called a hedge fund lmao).\n\n5. Don't chat long and say you gotta run lots of stock stuff to do. Get their number and 90% of the time you'll be pumping your baby batter into their sugar walls.\n\n6, Use a burner phone and fake name. You don't want to be on that child support time. \n\nFeels good mane. especially when in reality i got like only $800 in my robinhood account. When sloots see a balance of $5, $10, or even $100 million you gonna fuk even if you the hunch back. And don't at me that terrible. This dumb broad are gold digging.

What will an Apple vehicle start at? 50k? will it even be able to pass any credible self-driving tests?\n\nOn top of this, they will need to begin building multiple manufacturing facilities. \n\nQuite frankly, the only way this flies IMO is if acquire a car manufacturer and start overhauling them immediately.",

        "body": "Everything is priced in.\n\nDon't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.",
