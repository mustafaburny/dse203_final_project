        "body": "&gt;Regardless of what your situation is, retirement planning should always be in the back of your mind, you're clearly not using the money now, and you can never save too much for retirement\n \nI couldn\u2019t find a way to convey without sounding like a brat but I tried to push the fact that we know nothing is set in stone but between my trust &amp; inevitable inheritance, ability to work whenever the kids go to school, my husbands survivor benefits plan for myself &amp; our kids if God forbids something happens to him, and he will go back to work after he retires in his 40\u2019s making at least 2x his current income, our healthcare will be dirt cheap until we die, and we already max out his TSP plan already, and Ive got 12 more years in a federal job until I can retire. I am just curious if there is something better. Retirement is very much on our radar, I didn\u2019t mean to come off as it wasn\u2019t. I feel like that part of our future fairly well thought out. \n\n&gt;You pulled out after the investments started dropping?\n\nWe did. The housing market moves super fast in the area where we will\nMind. We had a permissive TDY (house hunting trip) coming up later and wanted to have all our ducks in a row incase we found a house we liked. We were planning on pulling money for a downpayment anyway and when the market began to drop it seemed stupid to let it keep falling. We assumed we would turn right and around invest the money in a new home. Now the military has a stop movement on moves and we have no idea when we will actually be able to move. Living on base would make life less hectic.",
