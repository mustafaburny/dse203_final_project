        "body": "&gt; You cannot access your data in Snowflakes account without a Snowflake Warehouse. Just like in most database software paradigms of the last 30 years, your data is locked up in their proprietary data storage layer, and you will need their engine in order to make sense of the data. If you want to migrate to another architecture, this will make it difficult and costly, just ask any Teradata customer.\n\n&gt; Just like with most of the cloud data warehouse options that currently exist, you need their compute in order to read the data into any application. This essentially adds a toll booth to your data, everytime you want to access your data in the cloud, you will have to pay Snowflake to access it, not just the storage costs. Is this the type of pattern scalable? Can your business afford to bake in the costs of Snowflake into every use case? Is that a value add to your business?\n\nThe same can be said for AWS/Azure and by and large many tech software. If you use AWS, you're not moving to azure. If you use salesforce, you're locked in. If you use MSSQL, you're locked in. The question isn't about lock-in, it's about the benefits that the software provides and the availability of competitors to provide a better product. In the case of Snowflake as a product, they are quite good. Toll booths aren't an issue if they provide a benefit. Many will be willing to pay for the price if it means they get to increase ROI or reduce other cost such as time.\n\nThe largest investors shook management up in order to IPO to recover their investment\n\nIn early 2019 the startup was not on a recoverable trajectory, and Frank Slootman was brought in to help the investors recover their investment. They ended up gutting the customer success team, and instead use costly partners to fill in when their customers didn't have the expertise to get it done. While you can see the benefits on their books, are customers best served in this manner? Is this scalable past a couple of years?\n\nDo you have a source for this? This one is a legitimate concern.\n\n\n&gt; Data Warehousing is on the decline\nAsk anyone that has been involved in a data warehousing project, and you will definitely hear horror stories about delays and overruns due to unforeseen circumstances. The main issue with data warehousing is that it's like waterfall programming. You need to gather all your use cases and requirements before you start building. By the time you can start building, things might have changed. Changing mid build ends up costing more time and money.\n\nIt's not different to a risk factor of an enterprise CRM/ERP implementation too. Choosing the wrong CRM/ERP is painful but what is more painful is not having a functioning CRM/ERP. Data warehousing is a necessity and one that is actually growing because insights are gold. \n\nI work in tech, many of those concerns are really just a fact of life and is not a concern for snowflake specifically and can be the same for many enterprise projects.\n\nCompany is overvalue though.",

        "body": "A lot of your argument could have said about AWS several years ago.  Why would anyone pay for this when it's basically just renting servers for much more than I can buy them and run them myself?  Enterprises bought into public cloud because the services were easier to consume, easier to maintain, and easier to pay for over time.  They didn't do anything that revolutionary with the underlying tech.  They just made it significantly easier.\n\nI am also in complete disagreement about companies not gaining business value from data.  I work for a large enterprise doing sales and consulting.  I essentially have to be a data analyst on the side; because I use every single piece of data our company generates to help me decide where to go next, which customers to target with which products, and which products are actually being successful after I sell them.  Today, that is a really painful process.  Importing from spreadsheets here, taking out of CRM there, grabbing some public data over here.  Where do I put it all for analysis?  Let's throw it into a database or flat file, let's grab Tableu or PowerBI or something and try to get some insight.\n\nYou know what most people end up doing?  Try to make the data set small enough that they can handle it in Excel.\n\nThe large companies that did really invest in gaining deeper insights from data (not taking the spreadsheet approach) started buying up all these Hadoop farms, Oracle, Cloudera, Mongo, whatever the hot thing at the time.  Then went and learned a bunch of ingest and analysis tools.  Hired expensive data scientists, etc.  And, yeah, they did not get nearly the value out of that investment that they should have.  Not because the data wasn't valuable, but because getting the value out of it was way too complex.\n\nIf Snowflake improves this situation, they will really be onto something.  Although they have some big potential headwinds as I mentioned in my original post, I do not think they are merely growing just because they are spending money on marketing.  They obviously have something that enterprises desire right now.  And not just because the C-Suite at these companies have no idea what they're doing.",

They just came in and said \"what problems can we solve?\" and tried to just create work out of thin air. They had a technology platform for intaking large data sets and making sense of them, but it was being built and rebuilt by developers developing in a PRODUCTION environment (there was no test environment?!?). Because of this, any of the (sub-par) work they did for us would constantly break. \n\nThe suit/tie thing speaks to them not understanding or really caring about the culture of their clients.

It's not mandatory, we all can VPN in and do our remote meetings every morning.  Our office space is up for sale anyways because we weren't expanding at the rate we were hoping for (pre covid) and were going to move into a smaller space regardless in 2021.  \n\nhowever, larger companies like Facebook, Salesforce, Google, Apple, etc.. are also almost 100% remote and will be for the rest of 2020 and likely through part of 2021.  So for a chunk of the country and/or world that don't require people in person to do their job (like yourself in the medical field), it has changed things and millions of workers.  That isn't to say when life returns to \"normal\" and covid is gone we won't start doing what we used to do, but by that point, companies like listed above from a financial savings perspective may no longer feel the need to keep a requirement of coming into the office and/or even having a physical office space you need to be at everyday.  Shit is expensive.  \n\nI work in the food distribution industry.  Schools have been affected, restaurant sales have been affected. We are back to 2017 sales figures, when 2020 was on track to be a record profit for us.  So while life for you hasn't changed at all, it HAS changed for a lot of people in those industries.",

        "body": "Not for me:\n\n&gt; SoftBank\u2019s Bet on Tech Giants Fueled Powerful Market Rally\n&gt; \n&gt; Japanese conglomerate led by billionaire Masayoshi Son placed billions in options bets on fast-rising tech stocks\n&gt; \n&gt; Investors watching the vertigo-inducing rise\u2014and this week\u2019s fall\u2014of technology stocks are buzzing about a single trade, a giant but shadowy bet on Silicon Valley big enough to pull the market up with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The investor behind that trade, according to people familiar with the matter, is Japan\u2019s SoftBank 9984 -3.21% Group Corp., which bought options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks. Investors and analysts, aware of the activity but in the dark as to who is behind it, say it has turbocharged the tech sector, whose sheer size drives broader market moves.\n&gt; \n&gt; A SoftBank spokesperson declined to comment.\n&gt; \n&gt; NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\n&gt; Markets\n&gt; A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data.\n&gt; \n&gt; PREVIEW\n&gt; SUBSCRIBE\n&gt; The stock market rebounded to record highs this year despite serious pain in the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. Tech stocks led the charge as work, school and entertainment shifted online, but entered a new phase in recent weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before this week\u2019s retreat, Apple Inc. had gained nearly $700 billion in market value since the end of July and Tesla Inc. shares more than doubled, making the electric car maker one of world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regulatory filings show SoftBank bought nearly $4 billion of shares in tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc. this spring, plus a stake in Tesla. Not included in those disclosures is the massive options trade, which is built to pay off if the stock market rises to a certain level and then lock in gains, the people said.\n&gt; \n&gt; SoftBank bought a roughly equal amount of call options tied to the underlying shares it bought, as well as on other names, according to people familiar with the matter. It also sold call options at far higher prices. This allows SoftBank to profit from a near-term run-up in stocks and then reap those profits by unloading its position to willing counterparties.\n&gt; \n&gt; Investors pay a small premium to buy options, giving them exposure to a much larger notional amount of shares. In SoftBank\u2019s case, the roughly $4 billion in options generated an exposure of around $50 billion, according to the people familiar with the matter.\n&gt; \n&gt; A handful of massive tech stocks\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Google-owner Alphabet\u2014make up about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index. They take the broader stock market with them when they rise or fall. Their dramatic rally in recent weeks has pushed the stock market to new highs, but raised concerns of a dangerous unwind that could drag the market down with them.\n&gt; \n&gt; The possibility of such an unwind came into focus Friday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell sharply for the second day, dropping 1.3% and capping off its worst week since March.\n&gt; \n&gt; Traders say the market dynamics could be partially explained by investments like SoftBank\u2019s. Options activity has been so robust that traders have said it has helped intensify the rally in tech stocks and unleashed unusual dynamics across markets. SoftBank\u2019s options positions were reported earlier by the Financial Times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Options strategies were at play in gains in stocks like Salesforce.com Inc., which jumped 26% in one day after its earnings, traders said. Options are contracts that allow investors to buy or sell shares at a specific price, later in time. Call options confer the right to buy, while puts give the right to sell. Traders can tap these derivatives contracts to make directional bets on stocks or hedge their portfolios.\n&gt; \n&gt; Investors buy options contracts tied to individual stocks or to broad indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite. When banks and brokerages arrange options for investors, they are left with their own exposure to the markets.\n&gt; \n&gt; To zero that exposure out, options dealers buy derivatives and stocks. In the case of call options, this can give stocks and indexes another boost higher. As shares jump, they need to hedge more, adding fuel to the fire. Such hedging activity can also intensify moves when markets head lower.\n&gt; \n&gt; MORE ON SOFTBANK\n&gt; SoftBank to Sell $14 Billion Stake in Telecom Unit\n&gt; SoftBank Returns to Black with $12 Billion Profit\n&gt; SoftBank to Sell $41 Billion in Assets, Plans Share Buyback\n&gt; According to traders, there have been mammoth options trades that include buying call options on stocks like Amazon.com Inc., Adobe Inc., Netflix Inc., Facebook Inc. Microsoft Corp, generating chatter across Wall Street.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of that options activity has come from individual investors, who have been lured by free trades on sites such as Robinhood Markets Inc. SoftBank\u2019s role indicates large institutions are also playing a role in the frenzy of tech options trading.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s exacerbating moves,\u201d said Danny Kirsch, head of options at brokerage Cornerstone Macro, of the surge in tech options activity. \u201cThat\u2019s why these moves are getting very stretched both ways.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; SoftBank is best known for its $100 billion Vision Fund, which invests in startups including Uber Technologies Inc. and TikTok owner Bytedance. But in July its founder and CEO, Masayoshi Son, announced a new unit to invest in public markets, similar to a hedge fund in its scope and tactics.\n&gt; \n&gt; Part of that unit includes a $555 million, 12-year fund, one-third of which is Mr. Son\u2019s personal money. It adds another tentacle to SoftBank\u2019s globe-trotting, asset-spanning investment ambitions. Mr. Son, often given to bouts of whimsy, hid a clue in the name: 555 in Japanese is pronounced \u201cgo, go, go.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; SoftBank only recently emerged from a serious rough patch. The company\u2019s bet on office landlord WeWork soured, requiring SoftBank to bail it out. Concentrated investments in ride hailing startups were hammered when the pandemic shut down travel. It reported a $9 billion loss in the fiscal year ended March, its worst year ever.\n&gt; \n&gt; SoftBank\u2019s $100 Billion Bet\n&gt; YOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n&gt; \n&gt; UP NEXT\n&gt; \n&gt; SoftBank\u2019s $100 Billion Bet\n&gt; SoftBank\u2019s $100 Billion Bet\n&gt; SoftBank\u2019s longtime strategy of dumping mountains of cash on promising young companies to create big winners failed dramatically at WeWork and is inviting scrutiny into the fund\u2019s other investments. Here\u2019s a look at Vision Fund\u2019s structure, and how its fast paced investment strategy could make it risky.\n&gt; Softbank\u2019s shares plummeted in March and the company announced a major shift in strategy. It would unload more than $40 billion in legacy assets. That number is now more than $50 billion and will include the sale of its stakes in T-Mobile US Inc., Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and SoftBank\u2019s Japanese telecom unit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Much of that cash was originally earmarked for share buybacks and debt redemption. But SoftBank paused the buyback plan it announced in March after its shares rocketed higher. Mr. Son said SoftBank is in no hurry to repurchase more of its roughly $47 billion in bonds, since the company has enough cash to cover redemptions for the next two years, and bondholders don\u2019t particularly want to sell.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is a departure for Mr. Son, who is known for long-term bets on young tech firms, including his $20 million bet on Alibaba in 2000. The fund will instead invest primarily in highly liquid, publicly traded companies, making extensive use of derivatives and leverage to boost returns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some SoftBank shareholders are uneasy about the new stock trading unit. They invest in tech stocks themselves, and are perplexed that SoftBank is now aiming to do the same thing, according to SoftBank investors. Mr. Son, who has a one-third stake in the stock-trading fund, promised to make up a portion of shortfalls in the fund if it lost money at the end of its 12-to-14 year life, according to the company.\n&gt; \n&gt; When questioned about the stake at a virtual investors\u2019 meeting last month, Mr. Son said he wanted to take risk and get upside, according to two people familiar with the gathering. \u201cI\u2019m not a bonus and salary guy,\u201d he told the listeners, one of those people said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com, Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com, Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com and Phred Dvorak at phred.dvorak@wsj.com",

By looking at the overall profitability? Sure, AWS has a much higher profit margin but that doesn't say anything about whether or not they are subsidizing products on retail. Amazon e-commerce, by design, is reinvesting all the cash back into the business for top-line growth. E-commerce divison itself has so many other businesses within it - profits from TV could be subsidizing shoes or phone cables. We only see the overall profits of the _entire_ e-commerce divison.  Also, the marketplace division is significant chunk of the e-commerce revenue (Amazon only counts the fees they charge 3rd parties as revenue). Profit margins for those will be a lot better than that of the first-party retail business as Amazon doesn't have to carry inventory at all. Also, advertising is another fast growing segment with higher profit-margins.I am not sure if we have enough data to make any comment regarding who is subsidizing what.\n\nAlso, AWS itself faces very serious competition from Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle etc They are releasing a tonne of new features every year. Why will they not want use the cash from AWS for growing AWS but subsidize toilet-paper? Seems odd to me.\n\nFrom what I understand the profitability of AWS is providing a cover for Amazon from a Wall Street standpoint - \"Here have some profits, let us concentrate on growth.\"\n\nI also don't see how breaking up Amazon into AWS and E-commerce creates room for additional innovation. There is very serious competition for both the businesses.",

        "body": "Absolutely brilliant write up. Tech equities became really expensive and I was looking for some value alternatives in tech sector as well. HPE definitely stood out but initially I was quite skeptical as I thought this would be company that sells servers or networking equipment. Upon investigating it I'm super intrigued and will open position next week.  \n\nI love that they detached from legacy PC and printers business, I love that early on they spun off their services &amp; consulting business, I love that they offloaded their legacy software business to Micro Focus (poor guys are struggling to sell it now) and I love that they are not competing with Azure or AWS but instead specialise in their own niche. I think that HPE's hybrid cloud solution is probably the best offering in industry right now. IBM, AWS and Google Cloud offer hybrid solutions but it looks like they are very nascent offerings compared to HPE's.\n\nI also love acquisitions they been making. Like you mentioned Silver Peak and Cray (which were very smart acquisitions) but also BlueData (AI &amp; big data analysis), Plexxi (hybrid networking) and others.\n\nAlso, their focus on the edge and hybrid seems to be very well timed. Edge computing is still in its early stages but will undoubtedly expand in the future. A lot of people talk about hybrid as stepping stone for legacy infrastructures which is true. However, with data privacy and data security regulations becoming stricter hybrid will become way more than just stepping stone to full cloud. In Europe it already matters great deal where are you servers located and who can access them.\n\nFinally, HPE feels like it could be story similar to Microsoft. That is, Microsoft was perceived as this legacy, stagnant organization and it was trading at price reflecting that sentiment. Until their cloud offering changed everything. If all goes well with HPE it could be very similar story and brilliant entry point right now.\n\nP.S.\n\nSpeaking of undervalued tech equities. Do you have any thoughts on Seagate? They are trading at quite low multiples and with growing cloud, data storage will have to grow too. On the  other hand HDDs are legacy hardware and they are not very strong at making SSDs yet.",

        "body": "I bought some stock on June 1st, not the best day price wise but it\u2019s the stock I plan to hold the longest out of my whole portfolio, except for MSFT maybe. I made a DD for myself and made a brief summary around April. Most of it is based on their 10-K last year and their first 10-Q of the year. The key here is that this has been seen as a dinosaur for the past decade, due to lack of innovation, terrible management decisions (crazy high EPS and a buyback program that should have been cut long ago), and recruiting issues. A new CEO (Arvind Krishna) and a switch to the cloud (and quantum computing for the 2030s at least) are the key changes that could drive change. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit messy, was not meant to be posted when I wrote it : \n\nIBM : New CEO Arvid Krishna has my trust, hope he will change top and mid tier management (which did weird accounting tricks like the pseudo Lenovo \u00ab\u00a0sale/buy\u00a0\u00bb, laid off workforce for no reason, did not R&amp;D enough, focused on business services and consulting too much, had the crazy 20$ EPS goal, etc\u2026). Krishna pushed Red Hat acquisition (open source enterprise software, will allow them to become hybrid cloud providers, hybrid cloud is interoperable (BFF example), scalable (ERP switch to 3rd parties), portable, and secure (user data still in private cloud)). Krishna was senior VP for cloud and cognitive software. \nIBM has switched industries several times throughout its life : time clocks, then tabulating machine, then typewriter, then mainframe (good changes), then personal computers (good initially but then poor because used competitors\u2019 chips), etc\u2026 Cloud/AI could be their next successful switch (1/3rd of revenue in 2019, still increasing). Quantum Computing too, as they\u2019ve strongly positioned themselves as industry leaders, but that\u2019s in the very, very long run.\nWhile not the most important aspect, company is a dividend aristocrat (increasing div payout for 25 years), but what matters is that div payment was never removed, even though I think it should have been decreased during the struggles of the 2010s and instead reinvested in R&amp;D, they should have also paused their share buyback program. Financials : P/E around 10 (very good for a tech company), P/BV is 5.5 (good for a tech company, especially one transitioning to less tangible assets), net income slowly increasing, current ratio of nearly 1 at end of 03/31 which is decent given Red Hat acquisition and coronavirus, D/E is 2.62 (that one is indeed bad, but they got cash I guess, still not great).",

        "body": "Bit of a personal anecdote here:\n\nSo I have a degree in IT with a focus on Computer Networking.\n\nI once interviewed for IBM because they had positions open for Network Admins.  Unfortunately, when I sat down and looked over their list of jobs I discovered that they were only looking for senior level positions (something they did not mention in the email they sent to my university).\n\nI decided to interview anyway because I was already there in suit and tie so I wasn't about to get all dressed up for nothing.\n\nThe interview went well, but the guy told me he just didn't have anything for me at the time.\n\nI decided to walk around afterwards and saw a guy interviewing for entry level programmers.  My campus did not offer a Software degree (they offered it at a different campus), but I did have to take 9 credits in basic programming which was Java, C++, and HTML.  I had already taken the Java and C++ classes.\n\nI sit down with the guy and we get to talking.\n\nHe asks my background in coding.  I tell him one intro in Java and C++ so far.\n\nHe asks why am I interviewing if my degree is not focused on coding.  I tell him because those two classes opened my eyes to something that I didn't even know I wanted before.  I love creating stuff with code, I find it cathartic to sit and stare at code, getting lost in it while trying to figure out where my errors are, the absolute joy of finally getting it to compile and run.  I even started to make some basic programs at home in my free time.\n\nHe asks me if I have any of my work to show him.  I did not bring any copies of my code because I wasn't even thinking about the possibility of interviewing for any other positions (let this be a lesson to anyone who's still getting their degree, bring everything!).\n\nI tell him I did have it on a thumb drive that I carry around in my briefcase, but of course he waves his hand and says that's a security issue (totally agreed).\n\nHe asks me what a function is.  I draw a blank.  I ended up stammering out something like, \"it's the part of the code that does stuff\".  Not necessarily wrong, but more of an ELI5 definition.\n\nHe shows me some code and asks what I can decipher from it.  It's a function that takes a variable, runs it through a formula, returns a variable, and then loops 4 more times using the new return variable each time, and finally shows a set of the return variables at the print out.  He confirmed that I was right.\n\nHe asks me what that sets of numbers is called.  Obviously it's an array, and I had heard the term before, but again I did not know at the time.  He frowns and says something along the lines of, \"You really don't know basic terminology.  You should work on that.\"\n\nWe shook hands and parted ways, never got a call back.  Now, I know I messed up by not having some of my work printed out, and not being up on the terminology.  But it really rubbed me raw that this guy was so hung up on terminology, knowing that coding was like 5% of my entire degree, and yet I still had a basic working knowledge of programming to at least be able to read and understand what was going on, and that I was passionate enough about it to go home and write some basic programs of my own.\n\nNow I don't know that the lack of terminology was the ultimate reason I was turned down.  I do know that they were looking to start up a class that would take about 3 years to go through, and they were going to teach a proprietary language that was similar to Java.  Obviously, the terminology would have been brought up again multiple times in that 3 year program.  The only clue I had for why I was turned down was the lack of lingo.\n\nI am now a manager at a FinTech company, and I don't ask \"lingo\" questions of interviewees.  I want to know if they understand the meat and potatoes of what the job entails because, to me, that means so much more.  Lingo will happen over time as they do the job.\n\nI'm not saying that is all the OP was concerned about in their interviews, but they certainly seem to think it's a flaw in an interviewee that makes them unsuitable for hiring.",

AMD is certainly catching up and will carve off some fractions of the market in the AI/ML &amp; datacenter businesses.\n\nThe ARM acquisition, if it happens, will confer a competitive advantage like no other. As an NVDA stockholder I wish this happens. As a Brit working in and loving tech, I am slowly dying on the inside... \n\nSomething to remember is that this is a fast expanding market and not a saturated one, there's room for multiple players to grow and win at the same time. \n\nThat being said, I still think Intel will likely be the next IBM.

I know a lot of people who work there. They\u2019re not going to go under overnight and they don\u2019t ONLY sell chips. They\u2019ll pivot and react accordingly.

Picking something that explodes like that will be a lucky pick though, some of it\u2019s not even rational right now. \n\nI still think tsla, amd, and nvda have places to go though. Musk is just full of ideas, if 1 pans out for every 100, that could shake up the world as we know it. Amd will take over intels market eventually, they\u2019re a head of the game, younger, fresher, intel just seems dated to me, lacking, it got high off its success and hasn\u2019t thought straight since. Nvda is still making moves and growing fast and they have a handful of nice deals coming in the next few years.",
