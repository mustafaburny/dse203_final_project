Invest 90% of your portfolio in EV, Renewables, Alt Energy, and 10% in Tech\n4. Use the Roth IRA conversation latter, staying within your tax bracket move your positions over to the ROTH annually\n5. Reevaluate your portfolio in 4 years time from now.\n\nDo Weekly and Monthly Candlestick Chart Technical Analysis on your investments.\n\nStocks to consider: TSLA, AAPL, BEEM, GEVO, HYLN (Carful with this one), CLSK, FCEL, PLUG, WKHS (carful with one too), QS, CHPT, BEPC, REGI, FANG, ENPH... lol list goes on for miles. But you get my point. That's what I would anyway...\n\nPS... Probably a good idea to leverage some crypto too. DOGE, because it's going to moon the next 5 years, BTC (if you can afford it), ETH.
