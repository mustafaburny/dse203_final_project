        "body": "Are you risk averse? Do you have a history of low-self-control during gambling? Are you looking for a set-and-forget strategy that requires little mind share and little management?\n\nAre you looking to turn 40k into 100k in a short period of time? How desperately would you need the 40k in 3 months? in 12 months? in 3 years?\n\nEveryone here is recommending VOO and VTI because its the best \"set and forget\" strategy. If you want low stress, benchmarked returns, reliable growth, pick this. Any other strategy has good reason to think that it won't beat a VOO/VTI strategy.\n\nBut if you're feeling more appetite for risk, I would take that 40k and invest it in 4 different stocks in completely different sectors. I would pick one of the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and drop 10k in there. Those stocks are ripping right now, and their market dominance is really showing. I would pick a high growth stock in a sector you enjoy. I personally like cloud software and cyber security stocks (ie. CRWD, NET, TWLO, etc). I think green energy is beaten down real good and will see good returns over the next 4 years. Take a look at companies in that space (ie. TSLA, CHPT, ENPH, ICLN?, etc). And fintech is pretty hot as well with higher risk plays in this space (ie. SQ, IPOE, FUTU, COIN, etc).\n\nThere are so many sectors and so many stocks that it can be easily overwhelming.\n\n\nBut my personal advice? Take $30k and dump it into VOO or VTI. Take the remaining 10k and pick 4 stocks you REALLY REALLY like. Something you use every day, something your personally passionate about, something that you will defend to your dying breathe at dinner parties and barbecues. Then buy $2500 of each of those 4  stocks.\n\nThen benchmark your individual stock picking performance against VOO/VTI. Are you better than broad market or worst?",

I would say that their microinverters are the defacto standard in the industry. And they've been coupling it with smart software to redirect power into battery charging, grid and home use.\n\nUnfortunately, the home I live in doesn't have great sun to benefit from solar, so I don't have personal experience with Enphase.\n\n\nHonestly, my biggest worry is that they've run up so fast and aggressively in a short period of time, that they're due for even more pullback.\n\nTheir revenue growth is amazing from their 10k:\nhttps://investor.enphase.com/node/18836/html#ib51ac078944f40aabcb529ec51955ccf_487\n\nAnd their margins are becoming impressive. Their margins have improved from 30% in 2018 to 45% in 2020.  \n\nBut does this all justify their PE and PS ratio?\n\nI tend to ignore PE ratios in growing companies because there are so many ways to fuck with the accounting numbers. The PS ratio is okay but also, doesn't take into account margins and profitability.\n\nWhen I have doubts like this, I like to look at cash flow. The biggest thing that stands out to me in their 2019 to 2020 balance sheet is the increase of their cash position. They've grown their cash position from $251M to $650M. They also have a very low goodwill on their balance sheet which gives me confidence that they aren't propping up their assets with fluff. Unfortunately, in conjunction with their cash position, they also have a huge increase in their debt position from $2M to $325M. \n\nSo maybe this offsets the cash positivity?\n\nAnalysts have price targets over 200 on median for ENPH:  https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=enph\n\nGenerally, this doesn't mean anything to me, but it gives me a weird sense of confidence that ENPH can still run.\n\n\nThe biggest worry I have for ENPH right now is that SPWR and MAXN got absolutely clobbered after their earnings. Both had lower than expectations for revenues and earnings. And since SPWR and MAXN were partnered with ENPH to deliver solar panels:\n\nhttps://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2020/07/with-maxeon-spin-off-sunpower-takes-enphase-ac-module-to-global-market/\n\nIt makes me really worry that ENPH will have shit earnings in Q1.",

First thought was selling it all and getting 100 shares of ICLN and selling covered calls with it (which would be about 10% of the value of my portfolio). Second thought was putting some (about half) into ICLN and half into my other stocks. I do still want exposure to the sector.",
