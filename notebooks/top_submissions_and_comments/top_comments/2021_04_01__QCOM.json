        "body": "Good morning contrarians!\n\nFutures are pointing higher this morning. Tech stocks are leading the way, with the Nasdaq up 1%. Small caps and S&amp;P 500 are 0.7% higher. Dow Industrials pointing to a gain of 0.4%. That\u2019s as of 0630.\n\nEarnings appear to be one driver here, after Facebook, Apple, and Qualcomm blew away estimates yesterday. Some good news on the reopening front, with the CDC saying cruise ships can begin their voyages again in July.\n\nMany more earnings on tap today: Altria, Caterpillar, Northrop Grumman, McDonald\u2019s, Mastercard, and Merck before or during market hours. Amazon and Twitter after the close. That\u2019s just the highlights and some of the bigger names.\n\nOn the economic data front we have initial jobless claims at 0830. Those have been trending in the right direction, though estimates are for the number to come in roughly equal to last week (530k or so). You\u2019ll be hearing a lot about the GDP report but that is backward-looking and not of particular interest to me.\n\nYesterday we had the Fed say and do just about everything that was anticipated. Markets still didn\u2019t like it, for whatever reason. Maybe because Powell finally acknowledged things were \u2018frothy\u2019 in capital markets. But the Fed remains accommodative, and the federal government is coming in with even more stimulus. Hard to see how this will not result in risk assets moving higher, especially with earnings continuing to beat estimates.\n\nIs this the melt-up we\u2019ve been waiting for? You tell me.",

Obviously do your own DD:\n\nAMD: Semi-conductors. I think the stock will drop after earnings (even after beating expectations and positive outlook), but then rally HARD. It's getting a ton of market share. \n\nMVIS: Microcap stock, they do LIDAR and people here will absolutely not stop talking about them. \n\nZYXI: Based on what I read, prices dropped last February as the company fell short of analyst expectations... but I do also have somewhat of a soft spot for what they do (pain relief). \n\nMNMD: Speaking of pain relief, this is another stock WSB will not talking about. Expected to start trading on NASDAQ on Tuesday. Magic mushrooms.\n\nQCOM: idk just a giant tech company, solid forward P/E and PEG ratios (based on Y! Finance data).\n\nWPC: REIT. Sells long-term leases. Also has a higher dividend yield than SPG. Got hit hard by COVID. I think there's a lot of room to run still.\n\nUXIN: company that sells used cars in China, and holy bejeesus this thing exploded last week. It's still at such a relatively low price that I might just FOMO into some of these.\n\nDisclaimer: I have positions in AMD with a short-term neutral-bearish outlook. I plan to open positions in some of these in the next 72 hours.",

I mean 5Gs been out for a little while now and no its not full force working at its full potential but, Apple, Qualcomm, Verizon, and shit even ATT are all better suited to have any meaninful results from the 5G rollout.

In mid-late Jan, there was like a 10% drop -  \"I am a f-ing genius, rushed in to buy the dip\"; by mid March-April, lost $300K and got out it.\n\nIt taught me a valuable lesson, **max out retirement accounts** with low cost mutual funds and **save 15% cash of yearly income** for emergencies, after that than **purchase blue chips names and reinvest dividends**.\n\nThen and only then  develop a \\~10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD.  For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current.\n\nIt also taught me to have a strategy on both the upside run and to manage downside risk (if any drops by \\~15% I am out but will watch).  On the upside, I take profits at 25% and if its 50%, I sell 1/2 - 1/3 and let the remainder ride and not really tracking it. (Today those stocks include FB, BABA, CC, AMD, and LLY.)\n\nSo when the crash happen in 2008, I was well positioned and rode it out.  Retiring early and been enjoying the good life.\n\nToday, I have a speculative portfolio to keep my mind active.\n\nGood Luck.\n\nPS:  I purchased my house right before the bubble at a fair price.  I am worried today that many people are getting over-extended by purchasing home that they really cannot afford because of low interest rates.",

No one sees when the market will crash ahead of time,  well, some people see it, but also ten other crashes that don't happen.  Whatever,  dividends help you profit when the crash happens, most companies keep the dividend,  you'll lose a couple,  but most of them keep paying you allowing you to buy more stocks when they really are crazy cheap.   That gives you the peace of mind to stay fully invested through the fake crashes too.  I rarely buy a stock if it doesn't pay a dividend and it's done well for me.\n\nYou don't get spaceships, but they do go up also,  and they rarely take massive losses.   Some of my good dividend stocks over the last ten years have been PFE, QCOM and SO.  both have more than doubled while paying me.  Honestly, I've had a couple of losers too, just RIG and WFC, but overall I'm very happy.",

If the rumored benchmarks turn out to be true and the price right, that\u2018s gonna be interesting to watch. \n\nAMD feels a bit sidelined at the moment. Not able to keep up with raytracing performance of the RTX, nobody cares about OpenCL for deep learning and their consumer GPUs aren\u2018t available to jump into the gap the RTX shortage created. Plus their \u201eprofessional\u201c GPUs are just embarrassing. HBM2 is nice and all but workstation GPUs with a max of 8GB VRAM? Please...\n\nThey\u2018re gonna do good on desktop and server Ryzens, though, so maybe slightly bullish?\n\nQualcomm, I have no idea. But I guess as long as there\u2018s Android phones, they gonna make money. Which good for Nvidia cause licensing. So double bullish I guess.^^",

All companies I have worked for give iPhones to employees and not android phones because android is much easier to gain access to. Also, Apple CPU technology is leaps ahead of anything Qualcomm is putting in Android phones so iPhones tend to run smoother for longer, and for some people, performance is the most important aspect of owning a phone. Imessage is still leaps ahead of anything android is doing with SMS. The price argument is no longer valid as iphone released the Iphone SE which is meant to compete with cheaper android phones at 399. I'll throw in last point which is more people buy apps on iphones so apps generally run better on iphones because devs spend more time optimizing for a platform they can make money on.",

This happend in 2000 when companies like pets.com or qcom and many of the very unestablished, unprofitable fell first in Dec 1999 followed by the rest of tech in March and the s&amp;p in September, so if we saw these stocks fall in February we could see indcies decline next year but we are in the process of topping, and topping is not one as a whole, the mortgage burst started in late 06 but the crash happend a year later. and I am using historical trends not my opinion.",

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

TSM, Samsung and INTC have near-term headwinds in terms of earnings based on semiconductor demand simply because it takes so long to expand capacity. The front-end winners in current semi production efforts are going to be those who supply the tools, products and services that go into these fabs that are planned for construction: AMAT, ASML, TER, LRCX, to name a few. Secondary effects on earnings from this will come 1-2-3 years down the line for the semi manufacturers themselves, depending on whether or not they are expanding/upgrading an existing facility, or building one from the ground up.\n\nThe end-users of these semiconductor products (GM, F, NVDA, AMD, etc.) will be the last ones to benefit from expanded chipmaking capacity, as easing the demand crunch allows them to resume normal sales levels. Note that for auto mfrs, this has a ripple effect on rental car companies, who sold all of their fleets in fire sales last year and now can't replace them because the auto mfrs can't make cars.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is booked up for the foreseeable future; these bookings have prices agreed well in advance, and are almost certainly not subject to TSMC's recent statements that they plan to increase prices; that will happen with new bookings down the line.",

I follow my core, top tier positions much more closely than these smaller players.  All three of these are modest positions held for near term trade purposes.  I believe US fed policy reform is going to trigger a sector wide melt up.  And that an m&amp;a phase will randomly amplify the upside (briefly) for some of the mid tiers. Which is why I've spread a few chips around that craps table on AYR, VRNO, CCHW and TER.  I'm not married to them. Won't hold long.

You should keep that separate from your opinion on it.\n\nYou should be psychologically and emotionally able to say, \"I recognize that the stock is currently over-valued, but I think it has a better future than the professionals realize, so I still like it at this price.\"\n\nWhen you're completely honest about your evaluation, you end up with better information about what your opinion actually is. In this case, do you actually have better information about Apple's future than everybody else? Is there some popular idea about Apple that pulls the stock price down, that you think is incorrect? Are they planning to move into some new area of business that you understand, and most people don't realize is important?\n\nFor example, AMD. My day job is firmware engineer. AMD put out a press release earlier this year about two new patents. All the analysis I read, both in the stock market, and on the engineering websites, presumed these are two different, unrelated things, that they just coincidentally talked about on the same day. I disagree; I think they're part of one new future product, that is also related to their Xilinx acquisition, and will bring real advantages to their server products. Right now their server market share is only 10%; the forecasts are that they will increase this to 20% in about 18 months. If they come out with a new product that enhances their competitive position in this area right when they're also already expanding their market share, that could be a huge driver for them and for the stock. So I think the stock is really worth at least 15% more than it can be objectively valued at now. But that doesn't mean it is undervalued now; just that I have a higher price target!\n\nAnother example is if a hedge fund releases research report that bad-mouths a company, and the stock goes down, and you read the report (most people don't even read it, they just sell!) and you think the report doesn't actually accuse them of anything. So then you might reasonably have a different evaluation than others.\n\nAs with all other parts of trading and investing, psychology is the most critical aspect of success. Don't be credulous of your own opinions; and treat your emotions with skepticism. When you love a stock, be nervous about your evaluation. You want to trade on what you rationally think will go up, not what you love.\ud83d\udc7c",

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC, BTCX or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

I'll try to explain it buy using Cardano. \n\nA Cardano wallet is accessible through Yoroi and Daedalus and those two allow you to make transactions on the network (sending / staking). So your adress is where it is stored, but the software allows you to mutate the contents. \n\nNow.. if you are still reading :)\n\nWhichever is good for you depends on what you want. First you have to realise the fees.. \n\nEach exchange has fees, trading fees and transfer fees as well as minimum transfer amounts, this scheme varies. Depending on which coins you are interested in, you will find a subset of exchanges with their own set of values for this. \n\nSecond, some coins allow for staking (you can roughly translate this as a short term fixed deposit which gives you a return on investment). This can be done on some exchanges (Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken), but again, they facilitate, they take. There are some cases where it is preferable though, i.e. when you don't have the minimum required amount to stake.\n\nWell that's all for now :) If you want more info, send a DM or visit us at the cryptocurrency sub.",

        "body": "Same. I went back and \"replayed\" all my losses or my panic sells. That's what got me to trust the process.\n\nI opened a  3915/3940/4065/4090 Iron Condor the Thursday before Easter. Thought the long weekend would help me with theta. Didn't pay attention to the jobs report coming out that Friday. Monday comes and SPX spikes. Rolled up my puts to 4025/4050 for more premium and to try to mitigate losses. Should have bailed earlier in the day at a $2k loss, but waited it out, ended up taking a $3.8k loss. Made it all back through the week and ended up +$300 by that Friday. But that is the only time I would have lost. But only because I didn't pay attention to upcoming market events.\n\nOpened a 0DTE 4100/4120 on 4/14. Was still stinging from the $4k loss a week before. Watched it dropping. Literally spend 2 hours in a gaming setup with fingers on the up/down keys and hand on the mouse adjusting my limits. Rode it from a $4k loss to $60 gain to $2k loss, roller coaster. Closed at a $159 loss with 45 seconds left in the trading day. Closed at 4124, so I would have been fine. But had $20k collateral riding on it and couldn't risk that for a $550 premium.\n\nThen monday, opened a 0DTE  4165/4175 spread. Panicked and sold at a $700 loss. Recovered right after I sold and closed at 4191. So would have been fine. That's what changed my thinking to letting it play out and trusting the deltas.\n\nsince 3/22, I've run 31 credit spreads and 16 iron condors. only had the 3 total losses above and 2 of them would have been gains if i had trusted the process. Even with the losses, I'm still up $8,800 in a month and a half.",

First I need to sleep on time so I can actually be awake to trade \ud83e\udd23\n\nThere are a lot of channels on YouTube, none quite like this guy. I recommend watching his oldest stuff. He mentions his big strategy almost every video. I recommend taking the free \"cycles timing indicator\" seminar too.\n\nAnyway if you can find his entire strategy and learn how to apply it, the pieces are scattered through several videos. Learn to read momentum.\n\nHe likes to find rare indicators for new videos. Honestly he could continue just making videos with the same examples and it would still be a good channel. Just relearning the same few keys over and over.\n\nAgain, mindset. Be humble, but not impatient.\n\nIf I see an entry developing but I'm too early, I often either get stopped out just before profit, or my profit isn't great (like under 1% or under risk). In those cases I've been taking slightly larger risk so I don't get stopped (and I don't place a stop loss, I just watch like a hawk). The thing that helped me here is \"would I enter here if I was going to buy options to take this trade?\" and normally I get a better entry because I want everything to be perfect. Just getting past the options spread can be tough in an hour or two.\n\nSo perfecting the entry makes more money and reduces risk. If a trade isn't going to work out, it should be obvious soon by the indicators, they'll negate the entry relatively soon.\n\nThe PDT rule helps in the beginning because you only get 2 or 3 shots per week. So you're looking for the perfect entry. Or if you have a margin account you can trade with unsettled funds. I like to hold stocks overnight, then sell during the day, and buy back later. This doesn't count as a daytrade so I can take 5 trades per week.\n\nIf everything goes well I should have over 25k in my account within the next 100 trades or so, maybe by the end of the year. Really looking forward to making up all my losses and then some",

I certainly can\u2019t keep borrowing from a different bank to pay off the debt on the first bank.  There\u2019s collateral.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know if the bank that\u2019s earning interest is really getting paid in your scenario, but I\u2019m assuming that this debt is just getting kicked down the road.  Eventually, there\u2019s going to be a tipping point where the borrower can\u2019t borrow any more to pay the interest, and the bank is going to want to collect their earnings.\n\nSo, maybe they can roll it for a while, which is what they\u2019re doing.  But eventually somebody is going to say, check please.  And the borrower won\u2019t be able to pay, and then there will be a cascade.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to call it a \u201cmargin call\u201d that\u2019s fine.

Last March this thing was a dead horse at 6 bucks then all hell broke loose .\n\n...multiple factors contributed to the greatest run on ammo as long as I have been in the industry ..8 years now. ..national emergency with Covid, Civil Unrest, Police Brutality..looting in Santa Monica, CA of all places, Massive influx of new buyers..the list goes on. \n\nObama was no match for this.  \n\nIt started March 12th 2020 and has been outrageous sales EVERY SINGLE day 417 days in a row!!!!!. Can't keep anyting in stock. Vista has a massive market share(Federal, Blazer, CCI, Speer, American Eagle and now Remington) This is THE ammo stock. They also hold the keys to primer manufacturing which is the reason we are in this mess. The primer shortage caused a backlog and then 10 million new gun buyers wanted to feed their new toys. \n\nSuper Demand City and no Supply easy math. As far as timing..this thing still has some juice left in it I believe and that's because they've had some price increases and recently stated they are behind a billion dollars in orders.\n\nPrice Targets range from 35-49. A consensus buy across the board on most outlets.  I believe all time high was 52 and change..it has a serious shot at beating that.  I have personally spent a year watching and running with this stock.  Seriously hours daily researching this for over a year.\n\nThe negative is there is low volume to move this thing. It's insane. It has taken a big jump, but over 14 months.\n\nThe earnings probably hit 575 million in this report and might break earnings record. It was at 38 not too long ago.  I've owned this since last March at an average of 7.80. I have taken profits twice so far. I now have stock and 35 dollar calls to hit May 21st which are green and also some 40 dollar hail mary calls as well. Those could be dreamers, but I work in this field and it never ends. Phones ringing off the hook..lines all day long.

This will only continue as more and more serious institutions start to get it and don't want china to control them. \n\n&gt;The ecological impact of running computers to support BTC is insane and currently unsustainable.\n\nEnergy consumption of Bitcoin is lower then our current monetary system (banks, visa etc) in relative terms. There's also a clear trend to sustainable energy usage since mining is location independent and is a way to profit off of otherwise unusable land and wasted energy (deserts/surplus of the power grid etc.)\n\n&gt;Nobody knows the exact origin of BTC, so nobody really knows if there is a back door to hack\n\nKnowing who Satoshi is is irrelevant in terms of hacking. The entire code of the protocol is public since it started. Bitcoin is an open source project and anyone can look at the code if they want to. There are no backdoors and there's no way to build one unless you want the whole world to see it. \n\n&gt;there are a number of early early adopters that hold a huge amount and can tank the market anytime they decide to sell their billions of dollars worth of BTC\n\nOnly point that's fair imo. Although there's something to be said that the market can tank it by now and it won't be the end of Bitcoin. Also I doubt these individuals would voluntarily trigger a market crash by selling billions at once. They obviously believe in Bitcoin's future or lost their keys otherwise they wouldn't have stayed committed to their holdings for this long. \n\n&gt;I think blockchain is a tech that is here to stay, but current versions are basically beta tests.\n\nSmart contract platforms and everything build on them are still in beta/early adopter territory but Bitcoin isn't. Banks and the biggest financial institutions don't adopt technologies that are in \"beta\" Bitcoin is a trillion dollar asset and on it's way to cross the chasm to the early majority.",

Interesting but full of conjecture and vague suppositions, typical for that kind of pitch \"people disagree with me but this is because they are stupid and are part of the machine\"\n\n If VCs where prone to believe every similar line of reason they read like Dan's they would invest after every one of thousands of hockey stick presentations they see. Here is one such gem based on emotional appeal to the outsider:\n\n\"The idea that Satoshi perfectly crafted Bitcoin on the first try is unfathomable for them to consider.\" \n\nTo which the first commentor correctly replies \"Because it's unfathomable that this is true\" and there you have the summary of the two sides of the argument.\n\nEven a brief browse through the Wikipedia entry for Bitcoin will tell you as much based on its history.\n\nThere are so many other problems with BtC but let's just choose one and let's also apply another line if reasoning: how secure is it in a physical sense? People are keeping their keys on physical media in safety deposit boxes at multiple banks because they are rightly concerned people can and would kill them for their Bitcoin or otherwise steal it. Many people who used services for their wallet have been burnt hard. We have laws about the fiet money proceeds of such crimes but people who own BTC do well to be concerned. Whose jurisdiction does solving a theft of Bitcoin actually fall under? Where exactly is Satoshi if he is even a real person? If he is not dead it's pretty dangerous to be him.\n\nThe truth is that BTC is flawed and will be changed/replaced as people solve problems with it. As such it will become obsolete or be updated and when that happens it will be vulnerable and Dans reasoning is flawed on this basis.\n\nI have no doubt there is utility for crypto. I just think investing in any particular technology as an investment asset will be demonstrated to be a huge mistake in 15 years when when we look back on the crypto bubble of 20xx. Many of the Dotcom companies had value there was still a bubble. Except now with crypto we have perfected this bubble. For Dotcom and firms pretended to have value and products or services. \n\nBottom line: Dan is invested",

        "body": "Remind of the time when people could autonomously stake their tulip bulbs to earn passive income, become a liquidity provider, yield farm, swap between tulips or lend 24/7 all from home without a centralized account ie. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?\n\nOnce you've driven off the fiat ramp, you actually own and control your crypto keys, which can't be said about a centralized bank account. No one needs to verify or check that you're swapping some ETH for another token or buying an NFT to trade. There's no transaction limits. However, there is a varying degree of responsibility (security practices, properly tracking and paying taxes, etc) and a learning curve to get over.\n\nI remember the time it clicked for me: I was able to pay and settle an advertising deal in a few seconds to another country with just their ETH address. No IBAN or SWIFT or adding a payee and waiting for a wire transfer to execute and settle. You can transmit value from one address to another without a middle person and transparency track the transaction. The receiving party can opt to convert their crypto to fiat or a stablecoin, which is pegged to fiat but can be exchanged through various chains and later converted to fiat and into a traditional bank account.\n\nCrypto happened to change my life forever. I got in and out when I did, but there's always someone else who got in earlier or lower than you--you'll rarely sell at the top. Accepting the reality of your decisions is an individualistic emotional exercise. The markets have been working in bull/bear cycles so far; gains are gains after all. Set your goals and try to stick with them or just wait things out until something becomes significant to your situation. Do not take this as investment advice but I would want to see a many month trend of lower prices to buy in long term. Now or anytime is great for short term activity despite the historically high prices.\n\nThe whole thing of crypto having no intrinsic value is a pretty sloppy argument that I've been hearing for years. Crypto isn't traditional finance or regulated as such. I don't believe anything has intrinsic value. An individual and society give value to things. Sometimes you don't need a persistent or objective value to make gains in the short term. If you're getting stuck at this part, maybe crypto isn't for you in this form.\n\nAll of the naysayers out there have their own beliefs and opinions. Some of my friends felt the same 4-5 years ago and I wonder if they ever came around. Not everyone is going to be ready at the same time. You can be scared about something new or not understand it, but that doesn't make anything more or less true. It also doesn't get you closer to exploring a new frontier. I can attest that through the noise, there is enough incentive that everyone should at least hedge a little into crypto. Just owning a little gives an inherent incentive to learn more about what you bought. You may not like it or understand everything, but it's an experience where you will at least come out knowing more than you started with, even if your portfolio goes into the dumps for a while.\n\nObviously 10,000+ coins won't all have value in the future. Many are just clones or created as iterations of other ideas and code. I still dabble with things and own a little of various coins that are both well-known and just for fun as moonshot bets. I believe in a cashless society and crypto is in the frontier of facilitating that eventual transition into the future decades. How big of a part it will play is anyone's guess.",

        "body": "Yes, as a Canadian, there are multiple exchanges available to us such as Newton, ShakePay, NDAX, WealthSimple Crypto, and some Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",
