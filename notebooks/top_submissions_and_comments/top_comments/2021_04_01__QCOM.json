That felt fucking great.\n\nStill have WAY too many eggs in the AAPL basket for calls, but loaded up on shares at $119 too, so even if I shit the bed with calls I\u2019ve forced myself to actually hold some stock. Trying to get to 100 shares to sell some nice calls once it gets to $127.\n\nGrabbed September calls of CVS, Comcast, Pfizer, and Coke during their dips today. Also, loaded up some August UWM calls for pocket change. Almost bought a few hundred shares of UWM, but the options were practically free. \n\nReally, honestly believe that stock should be trading at $20 and cannot for the life of me figure out it\u2019s horrid performance.",

You\u2019re welcome \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4417169-ase-technology-vs-amkor-an-analysis-on-worlds-leading-osats\n\n\u201cStrategic Alliance between ASE and TSMC\nASE is based in Taiwan, one of the leading centers for outsourced semiconductor and electronics manufacturing in the world. Its close geographical proximity allows the company to benefit from strong manufacturing activity. It has maintained a strategic alliance with TSMC since 1997, the largest dedicated foundry with a market share of 56% of the foundry market revenues. The alliance has made ASE the preferred provider of packaging and testing services for TSMC clients. This allows ASE to benefit by leveraging TSMC's clients of leading companies including Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, Nvidia (NVDA), MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTKF), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as clients who account for nearly half of ASE's revenues. Apple, Qualcomm and MediaTek are major players in the smartphone processor market and are developing 5G chipsets that require advanced packaging capabilities which ASE can provide. Given the long-standing relationship between TSMC and ASE, we expect the alliance between both companies to continue as it enables them to provide a total semiconductor manufacturing solution and the close geographic advantage between both market leaders. This means that ASE should be able to continue counting on TSMC's clients of leading chipmakers.\u201d",
