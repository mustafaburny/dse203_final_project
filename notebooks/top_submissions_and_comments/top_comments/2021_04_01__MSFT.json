        "body": "$MVIS\n\nOne argument I keep seeing against this stock is that it already ran 3000% or whatever over a year. This company was struggling during Covid with product partners pulling out of deals. They have been spending money developing their best-in-class lidar over several years. The company was and still is being shorted into the ground for not having much revenue.\n\nThe same shit was being pulled with GME, except because MVIS is a smaller company, shorts could really go to town and drag the share price into the dirt. The share price last year was NOT indicative whatsoever of the value of this company.\n\nTheir lidar technology is ahead of any other lidar manufacturer (and yet MVIS has the lowest market cap), their technology is in Hololens2 (~$22billion army deal) and they have a fuck ton of patents (AR/VR &amp; AV). Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, they all need their tech and MVIS is up for sale.\n\nThe real value of MVIS is signifcantly higher than the current share price indicates and MVIS is ready this year to show what they got. Shorts better get out or they will get burnt hard.\n\nTLDR: Fuck shorts man.",

I would NOT buy a significant amount at the current price. Anyone who does is taking on SIGNIFICANT risk. There is not fundamental OR definitive theoretical case for the current price. One must theorize that GME will outcompete Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, etc. for digital sales. It must outcompete emerging cyrptogaming. It must entice people out of their home battle stations into public spaces to play games.\n\nIt's not a super strong plan. It IS a plan. It is just hard to justify the current price level.\n\nThe 208% will trick some schmucks into investing money they can't lose. It will be painful for them. I can see the stock living at or below these levels for 3-5 years. Just look at TSLA as an example of a stock that rose on the wind of a narrative. It took a decade to find stability. I hope the people investing now have the cajones to endure a multimonth/year bear market.\n\nEdit: I bought at 340 and sold at 240 based on the SS theory. I bought at 70 and sold at 195 based on the momentum of the masses. I believe in the company, just not at these levels right now. I hope people buying at these levels can live without the money for a few years, because if this thing enters a bear market, it will hurt for a while.",

You should still have some balance to your portfolio, it's just that maybe you don't need bonds, not that you should have most of your portfolio in high risk stocks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething that is often missed about younger investors is that capital preservation is key, because of the power of compounding. Yeah, you can 2000% if you get lucky and time it right, but you could just as easily lose 50%, and then you have to double your money just to get back to where you were. If you can make 10%+ over 30, 40 years, you'll retire a multi-millionaire most likely, and you really don't have to take crazy risks for that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInnovation, including e-sports... There's a lot of hype, stupid valuations and unproven businesses in that sector. Even if your investments are profitable, it's plausible your opportunity cost is great. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt might be worth setting some goals. For example, I have 5% put aside for speculative investments, and my aim is to have 70% of my holdings in solid companies (these range from JNJ to MSFT - basically stable companies with solid track records and decent growth), and then 15% in higher risk (of which 1/3 of that speculative) and 15% in low risk, think AT&amp;T, National Grid, etc. Perhaps cap yourself to no more than say 8% in one company - especially until you're really confident - and 25% in one sector. I'm in my early 30s and also new, plus I'm playing with not just my money but my wife's, so being careful... Tweak those numbers how you see fit, but it's good to have an honest review of your portfolio IMO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso within those sectors, ask why you are owning a stock. If you can't give a 60 second summary to your mother, look for an exit. Have an idea of your buy in, your sale point, is it a turnaround or a value play or etc. Understand the numbers likewise and do some due diligence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately your money but your seeking out advise so there's my 2 cents. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",

Not only do I not agree with you, but you didnt really write anything to justify your \"analysis,\" and (I felt) instead just leaned on your \"economics degree\" to lend you credibility?\n\nCould you explain what you disagree about exactly?\n\nNo, my economics degree doesn't lend me credibility.  That's why I left a few disclaimers saying to take this all with a grain of salt.  But I did feel like it was worth mentioning because inevitably people would say, as you did, that \"he's only been investing for 2 months\".

If I didn't feel like it gave me any insight I wouldn't have mentioned it.\n\n&gt; I've seen you elsewhere claiming that you wrote this to \"help noobs\" but what's helpful is clarity, transparency, and depth. /My2cents\n\nNo.  I encourage you to dig deeper into that exchange.

That said, I do think what I posted was insightful for, say, some 18 year old kid who bought GME last month and has no clue what a stock is.  Those people are around here; I've interacted with a few of them.\n\nBut no, this was not meant to be game changing or super insightful or anything.  I just felt like sharing and felt that a disclaimer was a good idea because I'm *aware* that it's not very detailed or anything.  If you'd like to argue with any of my points, I'm all ears.",

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes. You\u2019ve been warned (Voltswagen, er Volkswagen did a good job of preparing you for that as well).",

        "body": " TL:DR - looking for feedback on a simple hi return stock screen and thoughts on how to rank results.\n\nEarly 60's, simple, diversified, buy and hold retirement portfolio approach my whole life. Looking at working probably another 5-10 years and starting to get a lot more active in my portfolio. Nothing crazy and I'm fundamentally a conservative+ investor, but I do not subscribe to moving 100% into ultra safe right before retirement. Portfolio size is low 7 figure for reference.\n\nOver the past few months I subscribed to a couple of authors on Seeking Alpha and have tried out a few strategies with minimal exposure and have a good idea of how to use some of the approaches in my portfolio. I want to develop my own screens because at least on Seeking Alpha, the authors I've found charge a small monthly fee for their updates. It's nothing huge, and for me at least has been worth seeing their approaches, but nothing I want to pay for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm going to put together a dividend screen/strategy and a \"better than cash\" parking lot strategy. Pretty basic and straightforward. I also just got started on putting together a screen to identify a more hi growth strategy - thought being on a monthly basis invest in the top 4 stocks that fall out of the screen. Would love some feedback on the screen (I'm stock knowledgeable, but certainly not an expert). When looking at the screen and giving feedback keep in mind my objective: not looking for the perfect approach or for mega returns, I'm an 80/20 kinda guy so looking for a decent, simple to execute strategy to reliably give back a growth-class return. (And using the Fidelity screener as that's where my portfolio is).\n\nScreen as it stand currently:\n\n* Tagging Energy, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Industrials sectors\n* Market cap down to Medium (as defined by Fidelity: 6-33B)\n* 13 week price performance down to 13%\n* 3 yr annualized Beta of 1.1 and up (conflicted on whether this really helps the screen)\n* Very Bullish or Bullish analyst recommendations (Summary score from StarMine)\n* Forward EPS 3-5 yrs high to very high (16.5% and up)\n* EPS growth Projected year versus last year high to very high (40% and up)\n\nAs an example, running that screen today resulted in a list of 7 stocks (sorry not allowed to link image or would give you a shot of the fundamentals):\n\n1. AMAT - Applied materials\n2. FANG - Diamondback Energy\n3. EOG - EOG Resources\n4. NXPI - NXP SemiConductor\n5. KKR - KKR &amp; Co\n6. LRCX - LAM Research Corp\n7. MU - Micron Technology\n\nSo the thought would be to run this first day of every month and put a set amount in the top 4 stocks in the filter. I would guess some stocks might stay in for months, some might rotate in and out quickly.\n\nMy question is basically around how to rank. So do I just pick a screening metric (or some other metric) and do a simple rank on that metric to determine top 4, or do I create a formula to weight and aggregate multiple metrics into an overall score and rank on that?\n\nSorry for the long post - thank you to those who stuck with it and are willing to share your thoughts.",

S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat. That\u2019s as of 0630.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes. You\u2019ve been warned (Voltswagen, er Volkswagen did a good job of preparing you for that as well).",

        "body": "I'm focusing on all of tech, but primarily companies I know. Even if Powell raises federal interest rates early and we have another setback, which he has said over and over he won't so I believe him, interest rates are going to be very low for a few years. \n\nFirst let me summarized why I believed the cycle was already on the verge of turning back to tech, posted earlier in the week in an Ark thread.\n\nDisclaimer, assume I have a position on every stock in this topic, even the retails.\n\nApple and Amazon started falling from their ATH quite awhile ago actually, before the rest of the tech correction. They bottomed out around 118 and 3000, both dipping below those marks even but not for long. Then they started to show resistance and basically trade sideways around 120 and 3050 while the rest of tech continued to sink, and finally early this week they were even rising and beating the market. This all showed a bottom out to me.\n\nDisney was my reopening stock, crushing it and breaking ATH. The news and this sub was all about DIS and other reopenings/retail/cyclicals. But then they started to fall back on positive earnings. They got a one hour bump from positive park news, the next time they got zero bump from positive park news, and they fell a good 10% from their ATH.\n\nBy the time Roku hit 300, Etsy below 200, SQ at 200, it was time to put all money possible in. Even if they keep going down, at that point I don't believe they can go too much farther, as they were at their prices from last Fall, much like Apple and Amazon had bottomed out there. These stocks are going to fall to summer prices while TGT soars indefinitely past its ATH high?  Fine I'll keep buying down, but I don't think so. Now we have lulu being shorted as soon as they beat earnings and there's nothing but positive news, the same thing that was happening to the companies like Apple a couple months ago.\n\nThe bond yields should climb some more and stabilize closer to 2, maybe even in the near future, so there might be some more choppiness ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even that bad and we already got most of that priced in though.\n\nFAANG of course is recommended, although I did think it was interesting Biden called out Amazon twice in the infrastructure speech and there may be bipartisan agreement against some of these companies. It's not like I see any major problems here, but I think their cash reserves will matter more in a year or so, so they're just buy as you can per usual.\n\nMy favorites are the household names or dependable tech stocks that are still way below their ATHs. I'm deep and long on Roku, just search the sub for the excellent DD about Roku if you don't really know what they're about. Their industry is mid-game, so room to grow, but also at a point where Roku has spent the money to secure their position, with an agreement with every major streaming service, pretty much every non-first or discount tier smart TV brand, and now their own advertisement company which is where their money flow will come, as they both help the streaming services make money while getting a cut. They crushed earnings and gave a better than expected outlook but fell $180, all I could post was to buy at point. They are not a gimmick, they are over 70% institutionally owned.\n\nSquare, PayPal, Zoom, Tesla, Etsy, Pinterest, pick your poison, there's more than I can think off the top of my head. I'm picking as many of these household tech stocks that have been around for years and will be around for years to come. I don't see a reason to get safer investments while these stocks are 50-75% from ATHs if you can ride it out long enough for them to climb again. I'll even throw out an Uber mention despite their bump in UK, because this is a household name product.  I hate apps, but I'm not deleting by Uber app anytime soon. Longevity and % of dip is what I'm focused on when it comes to taking on perceived risk.\n\nThen you can look at stocks I don't even like such as LMND and FSLY. Fastly is still almost 50% from its ATH, sure I'll take a small position there. A short time of rising with the rest of the market and one positive news story and they'll be back to at least $85 or $90, surely.\n\nPeople are over the semiconductor shortage by now after MU yesterday, right? Surely semiconductors, ev charging, clean energy, uranium, etc has room to climb even if they can't boom as fast as they did previously? \n\nSoftware companies? Sure. HPE was unaffected lately.check that chart. I guess it's because they pay dividends, all I know is they're working on every futuristic cloud and software idea. I won't even talk someone out of PLTR, we know it's going to continue being pumped daily on Reddit lol, but it's also by far the lowest Institutionally owned stock in this post I'm sure. MDB should be a good one again although it already got 8.5% since Thursday opening,it's 75% from its ATH and the company is going to be around for awhile.\n\nI don't know your companies, and I like to focus on what I know, but I will look into them too. I don't think this tech storm lasts too much longer, and regardless of how long it lasts I'm riding it out if I believe the company will be a well known name five years down the road.\n\nHappy day off everyone, hopefully the next quarter is good to you all. Just get SPY or something if you want to safely grow your money, I think that route will be very good to you this year and beyond as well.",

Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes. You\u2019ve been warned (Voltswagen, er Volkswagen did a good job of preparing you for that as well).",
