        "body": "Microsoft already has the chat system integrated into Xbox and Windoes 10 (and mobile?) for gaming. While Console players use it (because Discord isn't easy to use with console), everyone I know on PC uses Discord. Most gaming communities for streaming are on Discord. Most companies have support channels on Discord. \n\nDiscord users would refuse to switch simply because everyone they chat with is already on Discord. The same thing happened when Mincrosoft tried to compete with Twitch by creating Mixer. Microsoft even bought out the top streamers and nobody from the community followed. They ended up shutting Mixer down because they knew they couldn't compete with Twitch. \n\nThe same thing would happen with Microsoft Gaming Console Chat if they tried to compete more with Discord. Discord holds the majority of users for gaming chat, and they know this. Microsoft know this which is where the offer came from. That's probably why Discord refused the offer. 10bn? Naw Discord can make that in revenue in no time at all. Especially since Covid hit any everything was forced to move online. \n\nTL:DR Even if Microsoft offered a better solution, people wouldn't switch.",

If you take some time and read, it will educate you on the company.

Please look at this DD which compares specs with competitors : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljgtxj/mvis_shiny_laser_go_pew_no_but_seriously_they_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n2.\t\u2060Augmented Reality: MVIS tech is in the hololens, this is a fact. S2UPID on YouTube , also on Reddit had torn open the hololens and clearly showed the parts labelled MVIS. Microsoft had 22Billion deal for Hololens. Microsoft is reliant on MVIS in this sense\n3.\t\u2060Buyout : do I even need to explain this one ?

Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power BI can easily do all the of the same data transformation/modeling/blending/reporting without buying any licenses. It can't mimic Alteryx's data science packages but does any professional actually use those instead of python/R?\n2. Alteryx has much friendlier UI/UX but the MS Office team has been doing an incredible job with Office 365 making it super user friendly and powerful. I could easily see them creating a slick O365 product for codeless data blending and analytics. Or just tie Power Apps, Flow, and Data Factory together into a single, simple UX. \n3. Adding an Alteryx copycat to the O365 family with out-of-the-box connectivity to all the other O365 services seems like a huge perk. Seamless integration between Excel, One Drive, Power BI, and Active Directory sounds super nice to me.\n\nAnecdotally, I'm Alteryx Core certified and fluent in M and python. A lot of times for data transformation I'll go with power query just because the native Excel integration makes it quick and easy. For more advanced jobs I'll go to python for the flexibility. The only standout thing about Alteryx to me is its user friendliness which I think Microsoft is more than capable of matching at some point.",
