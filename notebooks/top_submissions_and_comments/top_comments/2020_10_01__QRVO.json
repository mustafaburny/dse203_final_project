The company is expected to guide for Q1 revenues of $100.4 bln (-9.4% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q1 gross margins of 37.8% vs. 38.4% last year.       \n* The company has not missed EPS or revenues in the last several quarters. Apple performed well across its bevy of offerings in Q3. iPhone revenues +1.5% yr/yr to $26.4 bln vs $22.0 bln estimates; Services revenues +14.8% yr/yr to $13.2 bln vs $13 bln ests; iPad +22% yr/yr to $7.08 bln; Mac revs +31% yr/yr to $6.6 bln; Wearables +16% yr/yr to $6.6 bln. Apple is benefitting from the shift to at-home work/school, which has pushed people to buy new products, apps and services. The economic stimulus measures and the lifting of          stay-at-home restrictions were tailwinds in May and June.       \n* AAPL has a $1.94 trillion valuation and currently trades at 34 times FY20 earnings.       \n* Based on the weekly AAPL Weekly Oct30 $113 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of \\~5% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).       \n* Suppliers to keep on note include: **SWKS**, **CRUS**, **AVGO**, **QRVO**, **TSM**, and **QCOM**, among others (SMH); **SSNLF**, **LPL** (for displays) and **LITE**, FNSR and **IIVI** (for FaceID).",

        "body": "QRVO and SWKS are in my Roth portfolio but only shares. I also have smaller stakes of INSG and MRVL (and cien, amt etc). I wasn't trying to promote or even really suggest buying n0k beyond the fact they have 3 things going for them that have landed them on my more ambitious portfolio, where I buy calls/LEAPS and lately lose money on. First two are safety related in an uncertain 5G future. They're very undervalued, when their dividend comes back they'll be lucrative and if it's just that I'll transfer shares to my roth. They won't go bankrupt, Finland and Europe have too much stake in them. Third is potential. They lost a major verizon contract yet won 100 other 5G ones. Theyre giving out a lot of tastes. They're also an acquisition target yet a merger with say er!c could potentially allow them to become formidable in the sphere. \n\nTheir past management has been atrocious, they do carry a lot of debt, and when I initially excercised a few call options on them this summer I figured I'd leave it as such. when my stop loss was triggered I learned of the new ceo's strategy and am looking at them in a different light. I think they could be a direct or indirect recipient of US 5G infrastructure investment and see a sizable upside, which is why I'm still holding a thousand (recently acquired) shares. Again, very different from qc0m and aforementioned 5G plays but not dismissable for me. Of course, if it's still trading like this come January I'll sell and hold leaps but I think something will. They're not special i just dont see the same downside risks, some of which feel like I'm betting on horses.",
