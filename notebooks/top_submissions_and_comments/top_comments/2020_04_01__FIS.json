        "body": "I'm not a pro so take free advice for what it is.  I've been investing for 25 years and have done well over time.\n\nFor my accounts that I personally manage, I am currently invested in:\n\n\\- Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index  (Large Cap stocks)  \n\\- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (diversified across Growth/Value and Large, Mid, Small Cap)  \n\\- Vanguard Total Bond Market Index\n\nNOTE: This is not a well-diversified portfolio, It's done great for that last few years because of market conditions. Not because of broad diversification to mitigate too much exposure in any one asset class.   My larger accounts are more diversified, but this is a good starting point.\n\nFor the Indexes above, I'd look at maybe 50% , 40%, 10% allocation respectively  or even 50%, 45%, 5% allocation since you're 17. You're young, you can go with an aggressive allocation (Stocks vs. Bonds) on risk and wait out the market dips to rebound.  You will likely see 3 or 4 recessions in your lifetime.  DON'T PANIC.  DON'T SELL at distressed times if you can leave the money there and wait for the market to recover. If the market doesn't recover, we all have much bigger problems.\n\nLater on (or now) you might want to also consider adding  some index funds that are for REIT (institutional Real Estate investing), Emerging markets, and International stocks.  I would do each of those at a much lower % of your total portfolio, say 5-10%  each,  especially with the current market conditions. You can always rebalance to a more balanced allocation when the market conditions warrant it.\n\nThere are other good Index funds with Fidelity as mentioned, I just happen to have started with Vanguard   ( Vanguard founder Jack Bogle is regarded as the father of low  cost Index investing.  \n\nLook at expense ratios (costs for running the fund) and what asset classes are in the Index fund. Since Index funds are auto-managed by allocation, i wouldn't worry too much about historical performance as much as what distribution of exposure/asset class the Index has versus what you want to have in your overall portfolio.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n* Historically, the overall market has always gone up, there are cyclical recessions. (historical performance is not a guarantee of past performance, blah blah blah... i'll put my money on the statistics.\n* Historically trying to time the market is not successful.\n* 97% of more expensive managed funds do not out-perform the indexes (So index is a good strategy)\n* And the 3% that do out-perform indexes are not the same funds year-to-year.\n\nYou are way ahead of the game at 17, good for you! I've been investing since I was 24 making $8.50/hr driving a beater car running on 3 cylinders.  I'm now 50.  Compounding works.  Investing over time works.\n\nThat's my input, it's worked well for me. Your mileage may vary.\n\nGood luck and have fun!",

I opened a Roth IRA (with Fidelity) and put $1000 in to start and I plan on putting at least $150 per month while I\u2019m working. I invest it into one of Fidelity\u2019s growth mutual funds (I put it into FBGRX - Fidelity Blue Chip Growth) because it has 15.66% average annual returns over the last 10 years with pretty low fees (0.8%). Do know that the higher returns means there\u2019s a little higher risk involved than with other mutual funds (but I\u2019m fine with that because it\u2019ll be beneficial in the long term). Depends on how you feel - also do some research of your own before putting your money into a mutual fund.\n\nI have also put about $2000 into a Robinhood account, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest putting even close to that - I lost $730 on a dumb option play my 2nd day trading. It\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll lose money, get it out of the way early to recognize that. I would recommend not investing any more than 20% of what money you are willing to lose when you start - just to get a feel for it. I currently have $1300 left in my robinhood account and I\u2019m not investing any more than $250 at any given point.\n\nTake all of this with a pinch of salt because I am also only an 18 year old so I might not be doing the best things with my money, but I wanted to give you this advice because you could benefit (especially from the Roth IRA part I hope).\n\nGood Luck with your investing!!",

        "body": "I'm not a pro so take free advice for what it is.  I've been investing for 25 years and have done well over time.\n\nFor my accounts that I personally manage, I am currently invested in:\n\n\\- Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index  (Large Cap stocks)  \n\\- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (diversified across Growth/Value and Large, Mid, Small Cap)  \n\\- Vanguard Total Bond Market Index\n\nNOTE: This is not a well-diversified portfolio, It's done great for that last few years because of market conditions. Not because of broad diversification to mitigate too much exposure in any one asset class.   My larger accounts are more diversified, but this is a good starting point.\n\nFor the Indexes above, I'd look at maybe 50% , 40%, 10% allocation respectively  or even 50%, 45%, 5% allocation since you're 17. You're young, you can go with an aggressive allocation (Stocks vs. Bonds) on risk and wait out the market dips to rebound.  You will likely see 3 or 4 recessions in your lifetime.  DON'T PANIC.  DON'T SELL at distressed times if you can leave the money there and wait for the market to recover. If the market doesn't recover, we all have much bigger problems.\n\nLater on (or now) you might want to also consider adding  some index funds that are for REIT (institutional Real Estate investing), Emerging markets, and International stocks.  I would do each of those at a much lower % of your total portfolio, say 5-10%  each,  especially with the current market conditions. You can always rebalance to a more balanced allocation when the market conditions warrant it.\n\nThere are other good Index funds with Fidelity as mentioned, I just happen to have started with Vanguard   ( Vanguard founder Jack Bogle is regarded as the father of low  cost Index investing.  \n\nLook at expense ratios (costs for running the fund) and what asset classes are in the Index fund. Since Index funds are auto-managed by allocation, i wouldn't worry too much about historical performance as much as what distribution of exposure/asset class the Index has versus what you want to have in your overall portfolio.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n* Historically, the overall market has always gone up, there are cyclical recessions. (historical performance is not a guarantee of past performance, blah blah blah... i'll put my money on the statistics.\n* Historically trying to time the market is not successful.\n* 97% of more expensive managed funds do not out-perform the indexes (So index is a good strategy)\n* And the 3% that do out-perform indexes are not the same funds year-to-year.\n\nYou are way ahead of the game at 17, good for you! I've been investing since I was 24 making $8.50/hr driving a beater car running on 3 cylinders.  I'm now 50.  Compounding works.  Investing over time works.\n\nThat's my input, it's worked well for me. Your mileage may vary.\n\nGood luck and have fun!",
