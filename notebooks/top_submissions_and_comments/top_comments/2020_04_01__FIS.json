RH is apple for stocks.\n\nOther brokerages could take a hint from RH. ToS Desktop is advanced but it's very confusing, and half the stuff doesn't even work right. I still haven't found a trading app I love (RH is *too* simple - not enough features). Fidelity active trader is great but there are a few things missing. Fidelity's mobile app is garbage bc you can't do anything beyond a very basic trade. TOS mobile is pretty good, but buggy and more confusing than it needs to be. I'm still looking for a good broker that doesn't have huge commissions and has a great app.\n\n Also, RH obviously sucks for their compliance department (unlimited leverage feature) and reliability issues, but I don't think first time investors care about that.",

He said it was a good place for help with the stock market.\n\nI called my broker this morning because John who plays dominoes at the VFW told me that Boeing (the airplane company) and Disney (they have amusement parks) were trading very low and it would be a great time to buy!  It sounds crazy I know, William says buying stocks is called a \"YOLO\" (Bing says this means \"you only live once\" L-O-L!)\n\nMy stock broker (James at Fidelity at the Oklahoma City location, off of 4th St. near the new McDonalds) said that I had to update my \"account security questions\" and I dont know what that meant.  I am going to fax him some questions to use like \"What is my favorite hole at the City Club\".  But then James said I had to log into the \"web portal\" to change it.\n\nSince my grandson (William) said this was a good place for finance advice could anyone help me understand how to log in to the \"web portal\"?  \n\n\nEdit:  I will be speaking with William's mother and making sure he does not continue viewing this discussion web site, it is very crass with some foul language and people do not seem very helpful",

        "body": "Fewer can be just as effective as many, it just depends on which indices you're looking at. One popular investing strategy is a 3 fund portfolio: a US total market index fund + an international market fund + a bond fund gives excellent diversification. Ratios can be adjusted as you desire. [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund\\_portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) It can be simplified into 2 funds if you use VT or VTWAX + a bond fund, or expanded by adding an international bond fund. It can be used as the core of your portfolio and added to if you wish, such as many people adding extra REITs. Edit: Internally, target date index funds either use or effectively use a 3 fund portfolio (Fidelity's is until closer to retirement where I think they also start adding in TIPS, Vanguard's is a 3 fund + international bonds then adds TIPS as well I believe, Schwab's is several of their ETFs that combined would come out to a 3 fund + REITs early on).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this is outside an employer plan, you do not want to use any mutual funds from a company other than your brokerage (so don't use VTSAX at Fidelity or FTIHX at Vanguard) as you'll be hit with a commission (commission free doesn't apply to mutual funds from other companies). Using ETFs would be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsing similar index funds from different companies would do nothing for diversification. So VTSAX (or VTI) + FSKAX is pointless  from a diversification standpoint. You also generally don't want to use a US total market fund + an S&amp;P 500 fund, as by weight roughly 80% of the total market fund would be the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also multiple definitions of DCA, one of which is \"investing regular amounts over time\" (so investing money from each paycheck would count) and the other is specifically talking about only splitting up money you already have on hand (so investing as you earn wouldn't). Investing as you have the money available to do so is best 66% of the time, DCA as in the first definition would usually not be ideal.",

They give you a free stock for signing up, one for depositing $100, and three when you refer your first person. You get two for everyone else you refer. Let me know if you want a link or you can just download it and sign up. I like all of the data they provide it can be a little overwhelming at first but useful once you get the hang of it.\n\nEdit: they have a desktop app as well that they advertise useful for day trading. I would also recommend fidelity but I have a margin account with them have the same day trade limit but I like their active trader pro platform. I keep that open with Robinhood to track live stocks and not fall for Robinhood\u2019s delay. They live data is pretty close to webull so you can\u2019t go wrong with either imo.",

        "body": "I will use Fidelity as an example of a company you might be referring to.\n\nThey have free trades on equities and free trades on their own funds and free trades on iShares funds.\n\nThose funds include FZROX which has 0% fees ever.\n\nThus you can buy the funds for free and then not get any fees while you hold the funds and then not pay any fees when you sell the funds.\n\nWhy would Fidelity offer this?\n\nFirstly, the Fidelity company has an arm that deals in \"paid advisory services\".  Fidelity will probably try to upsell you on that if they think you are in the right place for it.\n\nIf you are already a Fidelity customer, and you either decide you want paid services on your own OR they convince you that you need paid services, then you are more likely to choose Fidelity to provide those paid services.\n\nIf they can get some people upsold on those services, then the free trades already paid for themselves.\n\nAlso, it is important to note here that what constitutes a trade for you may not necessarily constitute a trade for Fidelity.\n\nIf you sell 100x FZROX and some other Fidelity customer buys 100x FZROX, then Fidelity doesn't have to hit the trading floor for anything.  They can just shift around some 1s and 0s administratively.  That saves them a lot of money.  They have millions of customers buying/selling and they can just shift numbers around so that they have to spend a lot less time on the NYSE (or whatever) trading floor.\n\nSecondly, Fidelity members often have large amounts sitting in cash in their accounts.  Depending on what you choose to do with that money, Fidelity might be able to borrow that money from you and pay you flat interest on it.  If they can use that money profitably, they come out ahead.  That can offset fees that they have to pay to trade (on NYSE or whatever) or pay their staff.\n\nThirdly, Fidelity can play similar games to #2 but with investments.  To some extent they can buy/short with your assets as long as it doesn't result in you losing any money.  This doesn't cost you anything, but it's potentially a source of income for Fidelity.  To the extent that they can play these games between 2x of their own customers, they can do it internally similar to #1.\n\nFourthly, Fidelity has costs that don't necessarily scale with the size of their business.  The cost to put a guy on the NYSE floor is the same regardless if Fidelity has one customer or a million.  If Fidelity can grow their asset base faster than they can grow their expenses, they will get more economies of scale and that helps them reduce relative costs.\n\nFifthly, Fidelity is privately owned and they can do whatever they feel like, even if it isn't profitable.  If their activities are a loss to the owners in the short term and the owners don't care, then /shrug.\n\nSixthly, Fidelity may be playing a long game here.  If they can squeeze some competitors out of the market by pricing things below cost, they may hope to make that back up later after some competitors are put out of business.  This would be anti-competitive, but they may try to do it anyway.\n\nThe answer you want is a combination of all of the above.",

I only kinda understand why Vanguard is appealing, but I also want to make the choice that\u2019s easily digestible for an investment newbie.\n\nWhen I search for people\u2019s opinions here, there\u2019s a lot of contrast that is informative but ultimately doesn\u2019t sway my decision because I just don\u2019t feel educated enough to understand the pros/cons of each service. What would you advise? Thanks for any replies.",

        "body": "read books. a good book can go into far more detail than the best online resources. a few I've particularly enjoyed, with some rambling commentary because I'm stuck at home: \n\n- The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. somewhat dated but historically important and still has good advice. Graham pioneered value investing, a strategy of buying stocks that are on sale or priced low relative to an analysis of the company's 'fundamentals': income, earnings, profits, and 'book value' (the total of all assets minus all debts if everything was sold). historically and over long periods, value investing has tended to out perform every other strategy. \n\n- The Superinvestors of Graham and Doddsville, a 1984 article about value investing by Warren Buffett. he was one of Graham's students and is probably the most famous and successful investor of modern times. https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/articles/columbia-business/superinvestors  Buffett's letters to investors in his company Berkshire-Hathaway are also worth reading. https://berkshirehathaway.com/reports.html\n\n- All of Peter Lynch's books: One Up on Wall Street, Beating the Street; Learn to Earn is aimed at teenagers and has simplified versions of the same data. Lynch was one of the most successful investors in history while managing the Magellan Fund at Fidelity. Lynch's books are also somewhat dated, such as due to the internet it's a lot easier to find info vs. in the 1990s when Lynch wrote and you had to read the Value Line newsletter for in-depth stock/company info. But a lot of what Lynch says is still relevant today. **Especially**: don't chase trends or the hot new startups particularly in IT/computers or biotech (re-reading these books recently it was as if he was describing all the hot new cannabis companies). Instead the best investments are usually boring, established, well-managed, low-debt companies with moderate growth (too-fast growth is a red flag) and an advantage or niche to ward off competition. most of his best picks were not exciting or glamorous companies: Taco Bell, Dunkin Donuts, Wal Mart, La Quinta hotels, various well-managed Savings &amp; Loan associations or railroad lines, and Crown Cork and Seal which makes bottle caps and beverage containers ... all boring established companies with a niche. e.g., Taco Bell was the first Mexican fast food chain when American was dominated by burger joints, railroads have a sort of built-in regional monoploy and even today can be insanely profitable, La Quinta was the first mid-price hotel chain when there was a gap between luxury Hiltons &amp; ultra-cheap Motel 6. Lynch says you want to invest in a company that an idiot could manage, because eventually an idiot with an MBA will be managing it. Lynch says there's a place for amateur stock picking, citing an amateur group that beat the markets 60-70% of the time IIRC, but he advises a very small portfolio of at least 5 and no more than 10-12 stocks. With 5 well-selected stocks he says you'll usually get 1 underperformer and 1 out-performer with the rest performing well but not spectularly. But the hobbist simply doesn't have the time for a detailed analysis/comparison of more than ~10 stocks. \n\n- Big Money Thinks Small by Joel Tillinghast. He worked with Lynch at Fidelity and manages the Low Price Stock Fund which specializes in small and mid size company value stocks. (interesting tidbit: Tillinghast writes how back in the day the economist John Maynard Keynes failed misterably as an investor when he tried to predict large market trands, but started beating the UK market when he turned to what people today would described as small and mid cap value investing). Tillinghast's fund had a rough few years recently (he tends to underperform in the final years of bear markets) but the fund has a history of out-performing the market. \n\n- Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman, a hedge fund manager and value investor who has a history of out-performance. this is out of print and absurdly expensive, but PDF scans are easy to find online. https://www.valueplays.net/wp-content/uploads/Margin.of.Safety.by.Seth.Klarman.1991.FullScan.pdf\n\n- Lessons from the Greatest Stock Traders of All Time by John Boik. profiles of a dozen prominent successful stock traders from throughout the 20th Century.\n\n- Ken Fisher has written some good stuff, his The Little Book of Market Myths is free online  https://www.kenfisher.com/books/little-book-market-myths\n\n- Reminiscenses of a Stock Operator, by Edwin Lefevre. partly of historical interest about the early days of Wall Street before the 1929 crash, but it's very readable and has some practical insights into the mindset or psychology of investors, such as the risk of making decisions based on hot tips. http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60979\n\n- John Bogle's  Little Book of Common Sense Investing Advice and Bogle on Investing. He didn't invent index funds, buthe did popularize them for the everyday investor via Vanguard and was a very influential guy who based histheories on the Efficent Market Hypothesis (EMH, the idea that assets are priced accurately by the collective decisions of all investors in the market, so there's no use trying to beat the market over the long term). See also the Boggleheads Guide to Investing by some of Bogle's most prominent followers.\n\n- Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel a Princeton professor. presents the Random Walk Hypothesis that says stock prices move in an unpredicatble or random manner so you should just buy low-cost index funds rather than anything that's trying to beat the market averages. \n\n- When Genius Failed by Roger Lowenstein. About the collapse of a hedge fund with Nobel Prize winners and other assorted smart guys on staff. a good study of hubris, failing to consider risks, and the dangers of leverage. \n\n- What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars by Jim Paul. About an investor who well, lost a bit more than a million bucks via futures trading. Another cautionary tale.\n\n- All of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's books (Fooled By Randomness, The Black Swan, AntiFragile, Skin in the Game). these books touch on investing but are not investing books per se, he writes about risk and probability from several different angles. He was a Wall Street options trader and one of the few people who saw the 2008 housing crash and managed to profit from it. \n\n- the Ascent of Money by Niall Ferguson. he's a historian and this also isn't an investing book per se, but explains the origins and development of modern banking, bonds, stocks and insurance. \n\n- The Millionaire Next Door, the Millionaire Mind and Stop Acting Rich by Thomas J. Stanley. not investing books per se, but very important to understand if you want to be wealthy. Stanley was a finance professor who in the 1970s and '80s did some of the first systematic research into high wealth Americans. to his surprise, he found there are more millionaires per-capita in blue-collar and middle class neighborhoods than in upscale or white-collar neighborhoods. the TL;DR is that doctors and CEOs might earn more money than teachers, plumbers or farmers but the high-income earners are more likely so spend too much on lifestyle and status items like expensive foreign cars, Rolex watches, etc, and lower-income middle class people are statistically more likely to have a net worth of $1 million or more. based on their percentages of the general population, MDs are under-represented as millionaires while teachers and farmers are over-represented. Millionaire Next Door (1991) outlines the premise and Stop Acting Rich basically updates it with more recent data from 2009. Millionaire Mind is about those worth $10 million or more. \n\nnote that these books can contradict each other. The Bogle books and Random Walk recommend buying the whole market in low-fee index funds, and they subscribe to the EMH. but Lynch, Graham, Klarman and Tillinghast say buy individual companies with certain traits. Peter Lynch is skeptical of academic theorizing generally and attributes most of his success to un-learning what was taught in his MBA program; he says Random Walk is garbage &amp; EMH is highly dubious. Klarman notes that value investing is based on a rejection of the EMH. Tillinghast thinks the EMH has merit in a soft or weak form, but also proposes that the regular existence of bubbles and the fact that value invesging tends to beat the market over time show that the EMH is not foolproof. Buffet perhaps contradicts himself: in 1984 he outlined in detail how good value invesging can beat the market by applying the same analysis to different assets, but he's also recommended the typical investor should lean on low fee indexes. The point is a good education, formal or amateur, should involve reading a lot of information some of which clashes and analyzing or synthesizing it to reach your own conclusions. \n\nI feel compelled to stress that I don't buy or trade single stocks, despite reading a lot on the topic. I think it's too high risk, I'm 100% in boring established mutual funds. mostly indexes with substantial minority holdings in some established lower-fee growth, value and sector funds. if someone insists on single stocks, there's an old rule of thumb to keep it at a max of 10-15% of the overall portfolio.\n\nMorningstar has a good podcast called The Long View, with ~60 minute interviews with various investors and finance types. again, they can contradict each other but also have long and successful careers in their respective worlds. \n\nvirtually every investing company has a variety of articles and other literature on their websites, sometimes by in-house employees and other times reprints of other stuff. poke around the websites of Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, State St, BlackRock, Dimensional Funds Advisors, American Funds, Dodge &amp; Cox, Wasatch Funds, Ivy Funds, Eaton Vance, Voya, etc...",

        "body": "I look at it like this: If you have a 10% chance of losing $50, consider it as if you have lost a straight $5.\n\nSo a 20% chance of losing 50%, means a 10% downside; a 80% chance of making 3.5%, means a 2.8% upside. So you are 5x skewed in the downside direction. At this point it's your call. What I do is this: if you're leveraged 5x in the down direction, don't you want to inverse that for your portfolio? Take out 80% of it.\n\nIn the same way, when you have positive leverage, and you're borrowing 2x from the bank, you should be 2x as confident that the stocks are gonna be going up. If you're 5x as confident that they're going to go down, shrink your leverage to be 1/5.\n\nIt's the same thing for individual stocks. I think Ally has an upside of 2x this year, and WDC has an upside of 1.8x. My portfolio is balanced accordingly. It's like a parimutuel bet. Put your money on the \"horses\" (stocks) in proportion to their expected return. There are many opportunities to make money in excess of what the stock market does on average.\n\nSo you see how quickly this particular bet becomes more and more clear what to do though. If you thought a 60% chance of a pullback, you're looking at 30% downside and 1.4% upside, around 22x negative leverage, implying that you should move to 95% cash.\n\nThe market is usually not on the edge of collapsing from a global pandemic, so usually these sorts of analysis are not so incredible. But in this case, the math demonstrates that the choice is clear; it is a hugely lopsided gamble in favor of removing your money. By keeping your money in, if you thought at all that the stocks would correct themselves, you were making a big bet for a small return",
