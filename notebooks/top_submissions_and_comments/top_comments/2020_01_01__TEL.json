        "body": "Depends on the Iranian response.\n\n If they block or mine the Strait of Hormuz for an extended period of time, reduced supply should cause oil prices to rise because 40% of the world's crude flows through that waterway. Seems like the winners would be oil companies whose oil is mostly sourced from non-middle east countries. Oil transport companies in general might take a hit, especially the ones who ply that route most heavily. If the Iranians attack shipping, it could negatively affect the bottom line for insurance companies providing coverage to the transporters.\n\nIf Iran uses its proxies to lob missiles at Israel, Tel Aviv and the area known as the Silicon Wadi (Israel's silicon valley) could be targeted. That could depress the prices of some Israeli tech stocks. Don't know if that would be enough of a blip to cause Raytheon stock to tick up, but its a possibility. Raytheon's a key provider for the Iron Dome defense system. Saudi Arabia has deep pockets and might decide to spend on short range missile defense. \n\nIf Iran uses it's proxies to attack U.S troops and citizens in the Middle East, I don't think that's a real market mover. We have, sadly, become so inured to violence and terrorism the panic factor has diminished greatly. \n\nIf Iran attacks U.S warships with it's fleet of patrol boats, or missles, and manages to sink one, then all bets are off. I think bombing of Iran follows, probably their ports and military facilities and nuclear research centers. That would be the time to buy gold and defense contractors.\n\nIf Iran mount's an all out cyber attack at U.S infrastructure and financial institutions, the very markets themselves could become unreliable. If we can't trade or manage funds transfers, that's a knife in the underbelly of the U.S economy. How this plays out depends on how fast we recover. Markets tank across the board. While it's tanked, I'd be inclined to buy U.S defense contractors, gold, and cyber-security firms\u2014or just a bunch of blue chips while they were on sale.\n\nThis is one thing I hate about investing. It sometimes feels like we try to profit from the woes of others. But if we have people who count on us for their welfare, distasteful as it might be,  we have to look at the world as it is and make decisions accordingly. My sincere hope is that none of the things above happen. I would gladly eschew any profit I might make if that would prevent violence. Sadly, it would not.",
