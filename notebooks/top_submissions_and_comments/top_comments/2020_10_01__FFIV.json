        "body": "I do this kind of thing for a living and it\u2019s not my first DDoS rodeo. I\u2019ve lived through several waves of these attacks and seen multiple generations of solutions.  At first we had to figure out how to do it ourselves with on-prem solutions like Radware and Arbor.  Next you had scrappy upstarts like Prolexic that used those techs to build scrubbing centers and offered services to those that couldn\u2019t protect themselves.  Then there was a wave of acquisitions and others trying scale the scrubbing center idea (e.g. Akamai buying Prolexic, carriers adding DDoS services). Now we have some entrenched players like Akamai, CloudFlare and some of the carriers, but I recently noticed that players like A-10, Radware and F5 are getting in the game with hybrid cloud/on-prem DDoS solutions.  From a technical perspective, these are an improvement over the 3 layers of defense I mentioned above because there is an on-perm component, but practically I think only a relatively small subset of customers will need this level of protection. \n\nGenerally some mix of A-10, Radware and Arbor will probably be the technologies the big players like Akamai, CloudFlare, Lumen and even Fastly use to deliver their services. So as these solutions providers build out there networks and scrubbing centers A-10 and the other hardware vendors could benefit in the same way a steel company will benefit when car sales trend up. \n\nThat said, A-10 is a pretty niche player. I run a team at a Fortune 50 multi-national and I\u2019ve only ever used a single pair of A-10 boxes on my network and those were eventually replaced by a feature on Palo Alto firewalls.  I suppose they could be an acquisition target if their tech is good, but I think they\u2019ll have a hard time competing against carriers and CDNs over time because the latter will have an easier time cross selling and up selling. I know I would rather expand services with a current vendor and push for volume discounts than go through the pain of cutting a contract with a new vendor for a niche tech.",

To take a week to \"fix\" a known issue is also not something that sparks confidence.\n\n2. That's not a fix to an issue\n\n3. Not a fix\n\n4. I asked Amber if they had any sponsors when I was concerned about where the prize money was coming from. It was answered with crickets.\n\n5. Chat was filled with nothing but racist epitates, political noise, and sexual innuendo on every game. Who is going to want to sponsor that?\n\n6. Again, who is going to pay to advertise here? Avg of 600-700 players and the company has admitted many of those are bots. No one is going to pay to advertise to the members of /r/clis\n\n7. A knowledge member described exactly how such a hack could take place and what a rookie programming mistake it was. Doesn't inspire confidence when providing a company with my personal information.\n\n8. Probably but hasn't.\n\n9. When I'm investing my money yes I expect the company to be able to monetize at launch. On launch you could purchase coins, cancel the purchase and still keep the coins. Now there is no option at all. I stand by the fact that no one in their right mind will purchase coins. If the top 50 get paid and 100 out of 600 players get 10/10 in an insane time removing wrong answers won't help someone win. Even if they got the answer right they couldn't do it fast enough.They have had nothing but empty promises.\n\n10. The first game I got 4th for $48. Withdrew to PayPal that night and have received zero dollars. I am aware every player was told they won money that first game (another flaw) but I actually did and have the screenshot.\n\nI firmly believe we as retail investors should look out for each other. That's what this sub is about. Calling out good opportunities and warning about bad ones.\n\nIf you want to diamond hands and hold them good on you I hope it goes to the moon. I think it's headed the opposite way and would like to provide information to others that might help them.\n\nMy post is not about hurting CLIS, it's about sharing information to retail investors like myself. I've made a lot of money on /r/pennystocks because people can share information.",

UP!\n\nI do not have a current position in this and haven\u2019t for quite a bit. Is there money to be made here, maybe, is there money to be lost, definitely.\n\nI would be very very wary before the next earnings comes out.\n\nThis $1.5 million buy back has been going on since early September. \n\nVerified from Transfer Agent on OTCMarkets\n\nOS start as of 9/1 - 1,668,839,113\n\nOS today 10/2 - 1,874,269,389\n\nThat is an increase of about 12% in OS or a bit over 205 MILLION! \n\n$1.5mil in shares at $0.004 would be 375 million shares... if they only managed to do 1/3 that should still be a reduction of 125mil\n\nIf you\u2019re determined to light your money on fire you could PayPal or Venmo me some instead. \n\nSeriously though make sure to be aware of the next update in November for OS or in the Q3 ER. No I don\u2019t know when the next ER will come out. \n\nSomeone should really ask the CEO how shares go up when they\u2019re buying back. You could also ask that pumper on Twitter and iHub who keeps saying he is buying millions at a time. \n\nPlease also take the time to learn to read OTCMarkets, tons of free info there.\n\nScreenshots from OTC\nhttps://ibb.co/d6pFRXv\nhttps://ibb.co/HHGRM8L\n\nGood luck y\u2019all",
