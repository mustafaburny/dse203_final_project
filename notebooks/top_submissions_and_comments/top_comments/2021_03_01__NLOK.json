To circumvent that you would need to hold the US version (VOO) in an RRSP.  \n\n\n\\#4. Commenter mentions XEQT. It's an all-in-one equity ETF that covers the world markets. It rebalances itself for low fees so you don't have to do it. An ETF like XEQT is closer to investing in an index fund (its several indexes, actually) than holding a bunch of company stocks.\n\n\\#5 Wealthsimple is the \"simplest\" platform with the lowest cost (free buy/sell on stocks and etf) if you keep to canadian currency. Questrade has more features (like holding a USD account), but some fees. An other one would be Interactive brokers if you do very active trading. The others are ran by the banks and mutuals.\n\n \\#6: Contribution room to TFSA and RRSP are decided by the govt and start at age 18. Check \"retirement savings plan\" and \"tax free savings account\" here [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/savings-and-pension-plans.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/savings-and-pension-plans.html) for more information. You annual limits will be shown on your personal CRA account page (or is it called \"dossier\"?) if you have one.  \n\n\nAlot of people on reddit recommend maxing TFSA 1st, then RRSP, but I've seen different recommendations. I'd say do so if you earn under the median income, and reverse it if you are above it.   \n\n\n \\#7: I think Wealthsimple does NOT allow you to have an account in USD, so you have to buy USD stocks at whatever rate they impose. If you want to know more on buying in USD or mainting a USD account, search for \"Norton Gambit\".  \n\n\n\\#8 : an ETF is a fund, or a package of stocks, that is on the markets just like a stock. Some ETFs follow market indexes, like Index Funds do (think thousands of stocks). Both have their pros/cons, but ETFs tend to have lower fees. The idea of investing in broad indexes is that most traders and fund managers do not outperform the market (we have 100+ years of data to demonstrate so) and any overperformance achieved tends to be temporary and balanced out by future underperformance. In other terms : the more you trade actively the lower your returns tend to be. For every person on WSB that posts a 1000% return on a meme stock there is 1 or more that do not post that they lost nearly everything. As for fund managers, they tend to take your money and place them in index fund or ETF in your place then charge you a 1,5% or + fee. So if the fund made 9% return you receive 7.5% instead. A recommended reading on this would be Bogle's book  \"The Little Book of Common Sense Investing\".   \n\n\nI'm just a guy on the internet and none of these are professional recommendations.",

The conversation suddenly becomes, why pay \"X vendor $300,000 for this thing, when Microsoft will include it in a suite of 4 other things for $120,000 more?\" \n\nThey're also putting a billion dollars a year into security R&amp;D, and they're slowly starting to compete with more cybersecurity vendors.\n\nWindows Defender has a Vulnerability component: competes with Rapid7 and Tenable.\n\nAzure Sentinel will eventually compete with Splunk (not there yet, IMO, but eventually)\n\nWindows Defender also has a EDR and AV component: competes with Crowdstrike, SentinelOne, (VMware) Carbon Black, McAfee, Broadcom/Symantec, etc...",

Except 2020 the real estate wholesaling market there is no inventory to wholesale.\n\nSo what a wholesaler does or an I buyer in this case is they find a motivated seller who is willing to sell their home to them for a huge discount.\n\nThe formula is 70% of house value- repair cost- wholesaling fee.\n\nThe wholesaler then turns around and assigns the contract to the flipper cash buyer and the wholesaling fee is their profit.\n\nNow ibuyers are wholesalers except everything is done online. So instead of offering 70% of home value they might offer 60% with a contingency that the final buyer gets a walk through.\n\nNow your probably asking why somebody would be willing to sell their home for so much less then it is actually worth.\n\nWell that's why it depends upon finding motivated sellers. These are tax delinquents, facing foreclosure, in need of significant repairs, etc. Your helping them by being able to close quickly and as-is.\n\nIt might change for wholesalers once the foreclosure moratium is lifted there might be more inventory then, but I've heard they are just going add the unpaid loans onto the back end and restructure them and if we have a bull market well then that means less inventory. \n\nWholesaling and I buying is best during market crashes when a lot of people are losing their home.\n\nGoogle Jerry Norton he is a big wholesaler or biggerpockets.com if you want to learn more.",

BIG MISTAKE.  Do not do that.  \n\nTake time off, decide on a rational INVESTMENT strategy and get back in when you are ready.\n\nLosing significant sums of money is a life event... like getting fired, getting married, etc.  Acknowledge that, take time off, reflect... embrace how you are feeling now so you remember what it feels like next time you want to yolo.\n\nLets also accept the fact most of us are gambling... perhaps you (and me for that matter) need to think long and hard about (y)our motives for that yolo.  Get rich quick or slow and steady for retirement?  \n\nLastly, staying on WSB and other similar subs is unhealthy during your time off.  Seeing gain porn is the worst thing you can see right now... it will make you want to jump right back in.

For example, if they sell a contract with a delta of 0.5, they will buy 50 shares. That way, if the share price goes up a dollar, they will break even (-$50 on the call and +$50 on the shares). And vice versa if the price drops a dollar.\n\nHowever, you also have to take gamma into affect. Delta does not remain constant as the price fluctuates. Take the same example and assume gamma is 0.1. Let's say the price raises a dollar. The MM comes out even as explained. But because of the gamma, delta is now 0.6 and the MM is no longer delta neutral. They must buy another 10 shares. OK, fine, so they do that and they are neutral again. HOWEVER, if they have to do so in such a large volume that it actually raises the share price, it can have a compounding effect: buying shares to delta hedge raises the price, which raises the number of shares they need to hedge. This is a gamma squeeze.",

Not only can it lead to you becoming a bag holder, but the SEC frowns upon the \u201cwe talk\u201d you mentioned in your post. I do not mean this in any rude way but everyone makes their decisions themselves and is ultimately for themselves. We are not a pack here in WSB. We are individual investors who do not coordinate in any way on a stock. \n\nIf you see information that is scattered, like you mentioned, it is imperative to do your own research and figure out what is true and what is not. Not everyone who got in early on RKT did DD but the people who got in last week and knew about this definitely did. \n\nAs far as UWMC goes, I have seen a few posts about it but nothing close to the amount on RKT or GME. I plan on doing my own DD on UWMC tonight before deciding to go in tomorrow morning. \n\nI have no positions in UWMC as of now but I am intrigued enough to do some DD and possibly get in tomorrow. \n\nAnother major point to keep in mind, if you do get into something like RKT, make sure you have a PT in mind and do not be greedy. My EOW PT for RKT was hit today and I cashed out to secure my profits. Could it continue its run the rest of the week? Absolutely. Could it pullback and decline the rest of the week? Absolutely. If you plan on getting into UWMC, plan on how you will get out. Everyone likes to talk about how losses aren\u2019t realized until you sell. But the same goes for gains. It\u2019s great seeing green in your account but until you sell, it\u2019s not real.\n\nAlso, this is a casino.",

Even on this sub you can find them, but mostly just the good outcomes- people don't post/brag about the horrors so much. \n\nI do remember a post a year or so ago on this sub by someone that inherited a bunch of money from their grandpa and 'YOLOing' most of it by shorting Carvana when it was $100ish... with aims to hold it til at least the 2020 election.  If they did they'd have seen it grow to over $200 per share and it's now sitting at nearly $300 per share.  \n\nI virtually high-five anyone that makes out well on these bets as you did.

With that said, I will update this again tomorrow morning based off the values after hours.\n\nSo below is an expansion of my previously posted theory that we are following the same trend. Note DFF is differential difference factor. The Difference factor is the a comparison of the value from the current run divided by the value from the January run. The DDF is a comparison of the day to day change for the current run divided by the day to day change for the January run.\n\nClosing Values From the January Run Up Compared to March Run Up\n\n1/11/21 / 19.94 || 2/22/21 / 46.00 || Difference Factor 2.31 \n\n1/12/21 / 19.95 || 2/23/21 / 44.97 || Difference Factor 2.25 [Day2Day Change -0.01||-1.03; DDF 10300]\n\n1/13/21 / 31.40 || 2/24/21 / 91.71 || Difference Factor 2.92 [Day2Day Change 11.45||46.74; DDF 4.08 ]\n\n1/14/21 / 39.91 || 2/25/21 / 108.73 || Difference Factor 2.72 [Day2Day Change 8.51||17.02; DDF 2]\n\n1/15/21 / 35.50 || 2/26/21 / 101.74 || Difference Factor 2.87 [Day2Day Change -4.41||-6.99; DDF 1.59]\n\n1/19/21 / 39.36 || 3/1/21 / 120.41 || Difference Factor 3.07 [Day2Day Change 3.86||18.67; DFF 4.84]\n\n1/20/21 / 39.12 || 3/2/21 / 118.00 || Difference Factor 3.02 [Day2Day Change -0.24||-2.41; DFF 10.04]\n\n1/21/21 / 43.03 || 3/3/21 / 124.18 || Difference Factor 2.89 [Day2Day Change 3.91||6.18; DFF 1.58]\n\n1/22/21 / 65.01 || 3/4/21  / 132.37 || Difference Factor 1.59 [Day2Day Change 21.98||8.19; DFF 0.37](&lt;- we are here)\n\n1/25/21 / 76.79 || 3/5/21\n\n1/26/21 / 147.98 || 3/8/21\n\n1/27/21 / 347.51 || 3/9/21\n\nThe average difference factor is 2.63, the maximum is 3.07, and the minimum is 1.59. The standard deviation is 0.49.\n\nThe reason I say we are following the January pattern is because of two factors; 1) the difference factor is generally around the average difference factor 2) the day to day changes generally follow the same \"pattern\" as January (on days that had negative change in January, there was negative change now, and this is true for increases and stagnant days).\n\nPreviously I assumed a 10% margin of error because I was mostly doing back of envelope calculations only looking at key points. From here on out I will consider the margin of error equal to the standard deviation divided by the average difference factor, which is currently 18.51%. Unfortunately it seems that we are beginning to see a breakdown of my hypothesis, so the error is getting higher. Based off these values here are my estimates for the next few trading days.\n\n3/5/21 / $201.96 +/-$37.38\n\n3/8/21 / $289.19 +/-$53.53\n\n3/9/21 / $913.95 +/-$169.17\n\n**PEAK VALUE**  Previous run / $483.00 || This run / $1270.29 +/-$235.13\n\nThe peak value should occure between opening bell March 8th and closing bell March 10th, based off what happened on the January run.\n\nI will be updating this as the next few days progress. The current outlook is that the hypothesis is breaking down, and my calculations have to account for that with a larger margin of error. Chances are that by Monday my model won't track the current trajectory at all. That being said, keep my calculations in mind and watch the stock!",

        "body": "**SUMMARY OF GME SHORT INCLUDING KEY DATES AND RESOURCES**\n\nIf you're here for the short...\n\nFINRA, a US government backed non-for-profit, reports SI% on stocks on a regular cadence. The numbers are calculated and provided to investment agencies/firms, which are cascaded to the public. It's my understanding that the raw data is provided, so some agencies provide different SI%.\n\nFINRA SI Reporting Schedule\n\n[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)\n\nNext time numbers get to the public is 3/9. That means we'll find out if the short is still on (more than likely is - in fact, there are still firms shorting the stock even now, betting that we won't continue to hold long enough for them to get executed).\n\nYou find out about if the short is still on by visiting multiple credible sites, and making your own judgement about what the SI% is based on the firms findings.\n\n[https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)\n\n[https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0)\n\nThere are others. If someone posts them in the comments I'll add them to this next time I post.\n\nRight now, based on the average of these 2 sites, we have about a 40-50% Short %. This is how we will end commanding the price, as long as we hold. When they come to collect these shares, and they must be collected, they will have to buy the shares from us, at whatever price we've set.\n\nNow they could short their short, in order to buy themselves more time. But that also gives US more time to accumulate real shares. So again, a few weeks later when the calls come up, they must again either pay us, or short their short, that they'd already shorted. This would be reflected in the SI% going above 100%.\n\nIf the SI% has increased when posted on 3/9, the short is more than on - it's growing, hold. If it's the same, hold. If it's &lt; 20% **on every site**, things get real questionable imo.\n\nSI% gets updated every 2 weeks. Those are the big landmarks. And each Friday, calls are executed, which is when shorts may start collecting shares, in order to payout. I believe they have until Tuesday to fully pay out all executed shares.\n\nAt the moment, the price has been very stable, which is excellent. And today isn't likely to be a big key event date, it's likely that shorters aren't buying yet, waiting longer before they MUST collect. So a flat day like today is totally normal. Tomorrow will likely be similar. We may even see a dip. Anything below &lt; $120 is a discount imo (considering that has been our floor for 3 days now). At 45% SI, all seriousness, I believe $500+ is not a meme. And it could certainly go WAY higher, if we all held together.\n\nThis is basically how it works, I think. There are people way smarter than me here, and I wouldn't be surprised if I was off on a few things. I'm not an advisor; this isn't financial advice. Just a dumb ape who wrote this up as a comment to someone who asked how this works and wanted to share. Let's build on this post together and keep it circulating. I also like the stock.\n\nFeel free to edit, expand, and share. Just be sure to include your resources.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8dWe need to educate fellow ape.

        "body": "No surprise here. US - China divide will only increase and tech war will intensify further. I think good way to exploit it might be to invest in US domestic manufacturers. With that in mind I have positions in GM, Intel and similar companies that have US plants. This is also contrarian play as these and other similar companies are hated at the moment and are cheap. Well not so cheap now but we're cheap when I was entering long positions. Another good angle is to invest in US defense contractors. Defence budgets will only go up and those companies actually treat shareholders very well. Just today while my tech equities were killed, GD (have long position) announced 8% dividend increase. Nice. For anyone interested in this I highly recommend Ray Dalio's latest articles on world powers.",
