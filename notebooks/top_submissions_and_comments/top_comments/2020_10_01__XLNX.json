        "body": "TL;DR IF the general consensus is\\becomes that the buyout is almost for certain, bigly calls on XLNX. Don't read this so I can tell you I told you so.  \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44 \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD is hotter then Mugatu right now and with the latest news i'm sure a bunch of you fucks were also wondering what might happen if this buyout occurs. I have studied in the hyperbolic time chamber and return with wisdom of ages. Behold.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD cash on hand for the quarter ending June 30, 2020: $1.775B (1)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nXLNX has a market cap of ~25B (2)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nClearly, AMD does not have anywhere near the amount of cash on hand for the acquisition and will have to resort to doing it with shares. Generally speaking, acquisitions like this seem to add a premium onto the shares to make it compelling for the company being bought out to take their offer. As XLNX has a market cap of 25B, seeing something like 29-30B in shares offered isn't unreasonable.\n&amp;nbsp;\nHere's what looks like will happen if the offering is 30B in shares when AMD is trading @ 90 to make math easy. AMD will issue something like 333,333,333 new shares, you read that right, and exchange them for all of XLNX's shares. As of right now, that's over a quarter of how many shares are currently outstanding. If the market seems certain the buyout will happen, XLNX will fucking moon and trade near 2x what AMD trades at theoretically until the buyout happens as shareholders of XLNX will receive multiples of AMD if i'm not mistaken. Do your own DD.\nSources:  \n\n\n(1) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/cash-on-hand  \n\n(2) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XLNX/xilinx/market-cap\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPS: I'm only posting it in this thread and not it's seperate post so I can be a greedy little fucking gremlin and keep the mad gains to myself whilst simultaneously being able to say \"Technically I told you so\".\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",

Basically, there are questions on how well AMD can integrate Xilinx into their products. And if they can't , then their overall growth which wallstreet wants to be like 20% YOY is going to be quite reduced by a much smaller growth company in Xilinx.\n\nall that said here is my sage wisdom:\n\nno DD in the world would've prepared you for AMD. AMD's earnings alone were worth a strong shoot up to 90, on top of that their GPU unveiling is extremely promising for a good NVDA competition, assuming they didn't cherry pick too much for their benchmarking.\n\n but guess what, we all knew xilinx was a possibility, but i don't think too many people expected it this week, esp not during ER.\n\nIn the end, ER is always a gamble there is almost no DD you can do to help your chances with ER. \n\nAMD: good revenue, good profit, good growth in key areas, beat on metrics across the board, improved next q outlook, no major personnel change, **acquisition which wallstreet is apprehensive of.** All that leads to a drop.\n\nMSFT: Smashed through metrics, great growth in key areas. Post ER fall.\n\nunless you can both figure out how well they are going to do, which is hard enough on its own, determine overall market sentiment towards them, and figure out if it is priced in or not, you're probably always going to at best getting a 50/50 chance on ER.\n\nMoral of the story, if you're playing ER, play with money that you can lose, and avoid IV crush be doing spreads instead of naked long calls.",
