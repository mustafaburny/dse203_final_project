        "body": "Other can answer with the more intangible items. From a financial perspective, let's take a look at the 10K's of each company (since this is the last filing of NVDA). Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:\n\nRevenue:\n\nNVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)\n\nGross Profit:\n\nNVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)\n\nIncome Before Taxes:\n\nNVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).\n\nNet Income:\n\nNVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).\n\nSo what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference.",

        "body": "Fear of inflation is inducing a rotation out of growth. Tech (especially FAAAN/MG-ish stocks) are seeing  TREMENDOUS earnings reports and then either immediately staying flat or seeing a steep discount. AMD not only had a great quarter, but changed guidance from 37% growth for the year to 50% growth. The result? AMD is down 15% since the high on their earnings day. Same with MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, and even NVDA. PLTR is going with the market.  \n\n\nAdditionally, PLTR has no reason for price to increase right now, outside of the market/sector drop. They are significantly over-priced. I don't think the price is likely to drop down to a saner value. I think it's more likely to hold and stick around 20-30 *until the fundamentals  rise to justify the price*.  Everyone suspects they should have a pretty good quarter. That'll be good. They'll need several of those consecutively for the market to respond. Every few new big contracts and news stories, they gain another analyst adding them to their coverage. Enough really great quarters of growth (say, another year worth) and the market will start responding.  \n\n\nThose of us invested now -- and those like Cathie Woods -- are playing the hunch and taking the risk that we are recognizing the potential of the company before the rest of the market has caught on to it. While they're waiting for results to move the price, we're betting on results. We could be wrong. Probably not, but we could be.  \n\n\nAnyway, I have been calling this for weeks. Nobody -- not even the CEO -- has implied that PLTR is a short term profit play. Everyone knows you hold PLTR for the long term, if you have conviction in the company. And yet, you have all these people going \"HURR DURR PLTR TO THE MOON ON EARNINGS DAY!\" and \"HURR PLTR 50/100/150 by END OF YEAR\".  \n\n\nFor weeks, I've been saying this: ***PLTR will drop to 20 before earnings and then it will moon... back to 24 or so, where we are today***.  \n\n\nWe've done the \"reached 19/20\" part. I expect good earnings on 5/11. I no longer think we'll see a lift back to 24 or 25 on earnings, though. Not in the current senseless market. I think we'll see it trade flat after earnings or possibly very slightly higher for a day... and then all the \"HURR DURR PLTR 50 BY END OF YEAR\" people will get impatient (despite being warned since the beginning) and start selling off... leaving us back down to around  wherever we are just before the earnings report.  \n\n\nIf you don't have conviction in PLTR, don't invest. If you do, leave your position alone and relax for a few years.  \n\n\n***11% of  portfolio is PLTR at 23.98***",

        "body": "Idiots in this thread, Jesus. Shortage issues? AMDs market share gains have slowed down due to shortages, they're selling every chip they can make.\n\nWhen supply catches up to demand (which isn't happening for another year at least), their sheets will still look great because they'll start chipping away at Intel and Nvidias market share. With the Xilinx merger they'll become the largest customer at TSMC. As they start transitioning to 5 nm, they'll be able to allocate 7nm to lower margin GPU products, a segment which is currently neglected due to shortages, both by Nvidia and AMD.\n\nBesides that, they just announced a $4b share buyback. AMD have never had this kind of free cash before. This is going to prevent any sub $70 targets, unless there's a very sudden macro cause, and even then they'll eat it up because they want to buy the shares at a decent price. The reason they're doing share buybacks and not investing in the company? They have no factories, so they don't need capital to increase production levels. They've already effectively maxed out on R&amp;D, and as Intel have proven over the last 4 years, you can't throw extra money at semiconductor R&amp;D to get better results.\n\nTheir product roadmap for the next 5 years is amazing and they have a proven track record of delivering.\n\nThey said themselves that their gpu lineup should get another 50%+ per/watt improvement next gen, and leakers who have been pretty reliable previously are pointing to much higher numbers.\n\nIn the CPU space, Intel's next two generations are no threat whatsoever, and AMDs iterative design approach means consistent gains in performance and power consumption every year. Intel's 10nm laptop CPUs can increase their performance by 10% for a 50% power consumption tradeoff. It proves how bad the state of their foundries really is.\n\nThe Xilinx merger is a big brain play if it goes through, which it should. It gives them the FPGAs necessary to chip away at Nvidias monopoly on machine learning. Xilinx already easily outperforms Nvidia here, but Nvidia has an ecosystem that needs to be broken. As we move towards smaller processing nodes, transistor size reductions will no longer be the way to get better performance. A mix of FPGAs, ASICs, and general compute units is the future. That's what AMD have recognised and why they're building an arsenal of integrated CPU and GPU products now. They're building the experience required to meet the demands of the future.\n\nI don't have much money so I've got 265 shares via CFDs on 5x leverage. Assuming the Xilinx merger is successful, $100-130 EOY is easily manageable imo. It will likely take a hit after the merger as Xilinx owners sell their converted shares, but that's to be expected. With the guidance AMD have for this year it's also plausible they may increase the buyback program depending on demand/shortages, which could alleviate Xilinx sellers.",

        "body": "Yes on the strike price. If its 600 on the day of split, it will be 150 after the split and your contract will be at 400 shares rather than 100. If the premium is $20 on the day of the split, it will be 5 at the end of it. You'll still have the same value of the option, all other things being equal (i.e. theta decay still occurs at the normal rate, and IV can change as well).  \n\n\nThe whole point of doing this sort of split is because NVDA thinks its stock is unaffordable for the class of investors that it caters to. This increases the overall liquidity of their stock by allowing more people to trade whole shares, and allow more people to accumulate 100 share so they can afford to trade options contracts more easily.",

Now you have businesses with warehouses full of mining equipment that are also listed on the stock market. Not to mention China and the US are in a tech race. Personally I think until mining cryptos becomes unprofitable OR the semiconductor manufacturers get more plants online (why would they? They love the shortage, very profitable) then I don't think the semiconductor stocks will come down anytime soon. \n\nAs far as I know though Nvidia is trying to throttle it's GPUs mining capabilities through driver updates on newer cards, they say their gaming GPUs are ment for gamers, not miners. But like anything there's always a way around it",

        "body": "Dude, that shows how little you know about $BB. They haven't been making phones for years. If you are going to say company is worth dick because they have outdated phones, have the decency to do some research first.\n\nI'll just point out a few of the reasons:\n\nQNX: the most secure and #1 automotive embedded OS used in over 175MM vehicles today, medical systems, droids and many other connected devices. Automakers using QNX: GM, Hyundai, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, Chrysler, Porsche, Skoda, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Bentley, Holden, Land Rover, BMW, Mini, Honda, Acura, Nissan, Ford, Mercedes, Saab ,Xpeng, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Toyota, Jeep, Volkswagen, Audi, Kia, Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Fiat, Lexus, Jaguar, [Plus.AI](https://Plus.AI), Peterbilt, Subary, Byton, Peugeot, LUCID, Daimler, FCA, NIO, SsangYong, Suzuki, Chery, Volvo, Scania, Baidu, Nvidia, Intel and more. This list is only for the auto industry. There are many other companies and OEMs using QNX.\n\nIf you are referring to IVY when you say phantomware. Although it isn't  launched yet, it's been in development for years in partnership with Amazon, they have design wins with 23 of the 25 EV companies already and if you look at page 13 of the following deck ([https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/BBAS-2021-Presentations.pdf](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/BBAS-2021-Presentations.pdf)),  you'll see a preview of companies that are already integrating with IVY. IVY will also bring recurring monthly revenue as opposed to the one time license fee that QNX generates. Chen has also indicated that IVY will evolve into supporting smart cities.\n\nI would recommend that you actually read through the entire deck. \n\nWhat other products do they have in market today? How about:\n\n* Blackberry Alert - critical event management\n* Blackberry protect - Endpoint protection\n* Blackberry Persona - Behaviour and risk analytics\n* Blackberry Optics - thread detection &amp; response\n* Blackberry Gateway - network security and analytics\n* BlackBerry UEM - Endpoint control and management\n\nEach and every one of those offerings are wort researching but I'll let you do that if you are even interested in $BB. \n\n$BB are leaders when it comes to patents owned relating to AI/ML Cyber Security with 63% of patents. Next up is Carbon black with only 26% of patents. Crowdstrike only has 11%.\n\n$BB has government security certifications that no one else has obtained. (ex: NSA, CSfC, DoDIN and FedRAMP)\n\nAll 7 of the G7 Governments and 18 of the G20 governments are blackberry customers and I'm not talking about phones here.\n\nThey've been focusing on transformation for the last 8 years (which CEO John Chen is renowned for doing).\n\nNow they are ready for growth and are starting to market their products. \n\nWatch this video from this year's Needham virtual technology &amp; media conference to hear Tom Eacobacci's insight into how they will market their products [https://youtu.be/Ik7hYuH8sS4](https://youtu.be/Ik7hYuH8sS4)\n\nThese are only a few reasons why their future looks bright. You don't have to search much to find details on other factors like the Facebook settlement, patent sale for mobile related patents they no longer need, recent partnerships, IVY fund... ... ...\n\nStill think they are worth Dick? Reason why they are so undervalued is because people still think they make cell phones and fail to see the potential. To be honest, that is great news for us bulls because if everyone realized what $BB is up to, we wouldn't have the opportunity to buy it at these low prices. I guess I should say thank you?",

Any technology they show us would be the equivalent of magic in our eyes. Like showing a 13th century knight a surface to air missle or a monk working on moveable type an iphone. It might take generations to understand it.\n\nSome talking points: \n\n1) If they don't want to eat us (there are easier ways to create protein than catching and processing a meat sack) but want to exploit resources, then perhaps they want to trade, buy extractive industries (mining, heavy equipment).\n\n2) If they don't have the concept of trade, and only take by force, then we're toast anyway. Buy bugout gear and live off the grid for as long as you can. Patriot Supply and Readywise are not publicly traded, but Coleman is as part of Newell Brands (NWL) and just had a stock split. Any of the gun manufacturers would likely do well, IF they were publicly traded. Only Ruger (RGR and Colt (Olin mnfg OLN) will do you any good before the market tanks due to the aforementioned bugout.\n\n3) If they are just studying us, and had an equivalent of a NSF grant to study indigenous species, and stupidly left some equipment behind, then, by all means, find out if Lockhead-Martin, GE, SpaceX etc, got access to it and quietly invest. If the DOD got the item first, go Lockhead-Martin or General Dynamics. Otherwise, if the item was IT related, especially storage, NVIDIA, Intel, etc. If it was communications, maybe a SPAC like FIVG, or Raytheon.\n\n4) If they turn out to be benevolent, and want us as a \"partner\" of some sort, then we go with the space tech and extractive models. a) Extracting elements from asteroids is substantially cheaper once you are out there, but you have to get people, resources, support and some medium of exchange out there. Buy SPCX, since Musk has the vision. b) You also will need a bunch of new psychiatrists since this won't be easy for anyone to deal with. c) Designers for all the alien themed clothing, cars and tchotchkes that will emerge. d) engineers and mathematicians to make sure space vehicles don't end up in the sun.  \n\nThanks for reading this far into the endless drivel. \n\nTL: DR\n\nIf we're not food or slaves, then buy rockets.\n\nGood luck.",

With regards to personal computing, Intel has led on the central processor front for decades in terms of market share, partnerships with oems, and performance. At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. \n\nAfter building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. \n\nTL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has. If you can consider them a David lol. But they're accelerating in terms of development and market share. I'm so long on AMD.",

        "body": "Reading other comments - I won\u2019t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. \n\nIntel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. \n\nHence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won\u2019t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. \n\nIntel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. \n\nAlso the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. \n\nAs I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. \n\nIs NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. \n\nNow regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. \n\nAnd regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel\u2019s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. \n\nFull disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.",

Plus their forward P/E is justified from their insane growth, which has been happening even despite the chip shortage. There is a high demand for their current products that will only grow and they are getting into CPUs now. And even more forward looking, they are the overwhelming leader in AI with CUDA so I just don't see their growth slowing any time soon. IMO, their valuation is more than fair given their future growth trajectory.",

(TSE:9984) for $40 billion.10 Arm is a U.K.-based semiconductor and software design company specializing in CPU architecture. Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''\n\nLooks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.\n\nWhich company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ? Will AMD still be producing better chips than their last one ? Is AMD going to be around or are Intel, Apple and Nvidia going to push breakthrough things AMD can't possibly match ? AMD is quite scarier and riskier investment in that regard.

Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:\n\nRevenue:\n\nNVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)\n\nGross Profit:\n\nNVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)\n\nIncome Before Taxes:\n\nNVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).\n\nNet Income:\n\nNVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).\n\nSo what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference.",

They usually recommend solid companies with lots of future growth it\u2019s up to you to figure out what a good entry point is.  Long term 3-5 years like they suggest maybe that\u2019s not that important either.  \n\nI\u2019m trying to think about some of the companies I\u2019ve looked into since I joined.  Shopify, Nvidia, Crowdstrike, Tesla, Amazon, Disney (before the Disney plus numbers hit) Taiwan semi conductor (before the chip shortage) Blizzard, Bandwidth, there were a lot more but these were the ones I either researched or bought shares of and during that time most of these beat any of the indexes\n\nPS. Most of their picks are well known on Reddit already",

I think people expect these companies to do so well that when they do just well, it's just not enough, and they get out, plus there's a bunch of FUD out there, and it's easy to tank a stock by spreading it. But AMD is an outlier IMO. They've proven to do very well over the years, and they've become a huge player. Intel is in big trouble with Apple M1, and AMD has always been in between Intel and NVIDIA. In a few years we'll see the same shift from NVIDIA to AMD that we saw from Intel to AMD. It's a matter of time. Chips is a good market, these companies can adapt to the market and adapt over time.",
