        "body": "Reading other comments - I won\u2019t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. \n\nIntel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. \n\nHence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won\u2019t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. \n\nIntel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. \n\nAlso the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. \n\nAs I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. \n\nIs NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. \n\nNow regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. \n\nAnd regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel\u2019s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. \n\nFull disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.",

But companies like AVGO, AMAT, LRCX, KLAC are good growth stocks even here. \n\nWS is suggesting tht ppl take their money out of stocks like LRCX with a p/e in the 20s and an outstanding balance sheet and fwd growth both short and long term and buy into \u201cre opening\u201d stocks like ELY and BAC with p/e in the the 40s? Not likely to grow like SMEs.\nOn what planet is this good investment advice?  And yes I own shares of LRCX. Just sold all of my BAC shares.",

That\u2019s one of the things that drew my attention to QCOM at first - how undervalued they are for what they currently are and what they are moving quickly into over these next few quarters. I honestly think it\u2019s one of the best value plays in the market and one of the most well positioned growth plays at the same time. \n\nJust one data point, but telling: \n\nP/E of popular semis:\nQCOM - 19.21 \nNXPI - 127.22\nAVGO - 51.41\nTSM - 30.84\nNVDA - 83.2 \n\n...you get the idea. QCOM is one of the best valued (by far) plus growth plus monopolized patent power plus fundamentals. \n\nBut your points about tech hassle spilling over are valid for sure. QCOM should be less impacted bc it\u2019s not overvalued and it has killer cash flow and inflation protection. The major hurdle honestly seems to be it just not being a sexy meme stock or a flashy boom/bust type position. So depends how much love and interest the market gives it, but June/July entry or not minding boring middle of the road performance (i\u2019m guessing) until around then is when you\u2019d want to get options and shares positioned for max advantage. \n\n\n(That was long winded but hopefully helpful.
