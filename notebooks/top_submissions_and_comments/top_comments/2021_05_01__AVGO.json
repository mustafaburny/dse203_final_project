But companies like AVGO, AMAT, LRCX, KLAC are good growth stocks even here. \n\nWS is suggesting tht ppl take their money out of stocks like LRCX with a p/e in the 20s and an outstanding balance sheet and fwd growth both short and long term and buy into \u201cre opening\u201d stocks like ELY and BAC with p/e in the the 40s? Not likely to grow like SMEs.\nOn what planet is this good investment advice?  And yes I own shares of LRCX. Just sold all of my BAC shares.",

If you used the metric you used above to construct a portfolio for 2015, how many of the stocks you just listed above would be in your that portfolio?\n\nThis is an excellent question.  I went back to my spreadsheet and disregarded the returns from 2016-2020.  Here are the differences by sector:\n\n* CHTR instead of GOOG\n* WBA instead of TGT\n* GILD and BIIB instead of DHR and TMO\n* LMT and RTX instead of HON and UNP\n* AVGO and CRM instead of AAPL and NVDA\n\nSo yeah, 8 of the 20 stocks would be different.

That\u2019s one of the things that drew my attention to QCOM at first - how undervalued they are for what they currently are and what they are moving quickly into over these next few quarters. I honestly think it\u2019s one of the best value plays in the market and one of the most well positioned growth plays at the same time. \n\nJust one data point, but telling: \n\nP/E of popular semis:\nQCOM - 19.21 \nNXPI - 127.22\nAVGO - 51.41\nTSM - 30.84\nNVDA - 83.2 \n\n...you get the idea. QCOM is one of the best valued (by far) plus growth plus monopolized patent power plus fundamentals. \n\nBut your points about tech hassle spilling over are valid for sure. QCOM should be less impacted bc it\u2019s not overvalued and it has killer cash flow and inflation protection. The major hurdle honestly seems to be it just not being a sexy meme stock or a flashy boom/bust type position. So depends how much love and interest the market gives it, but June/July entry or not minding boring middle of the road performance (i\u2019m guessing) until around then is when you\u2019d want to get options and shares positioned for max advantage. \n\n\n(That was long winded but hopefully helpful.
