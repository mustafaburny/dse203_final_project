        "body": "Didn\u2019t feel like putting my full due dilligence in but this pretty much sums it up well enough from another PSFE post. The main tidbit not touched on entirely here is the dominance they have in the iGaming market. This industry is expected to grow to upwards of 40 billion in the next few years and PSFE is positioned very well to take advantage. Of course the iGaming market has some regulatory hoops to jump through but we\u2019re seeing trends throughout at least the US that state regulators are warming up to the idea of allowing easy access to sports gambling with restrictions being eased in multiple states in the past year\n\nJust added to Russell 3000 and 1000. Found bottom support and getting ready to build upward momentum imo.\n\nThis is what I like about it: Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPartnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.\n\nVoted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n\nPaysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin &amp; 26 other crypto-currencies) and was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.\n\nUnlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\nIn Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.\n\nRecent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n\nPaysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn\u2019t include planned inorganic M&amp;A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020\u2019s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth.\n\nBuy rating from all seven analysts covering Paysafe, with 50-70% upside from current price but, with everything noted above, it\u2019s clear that Paysafe would still be significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of ~12.5% (in Paysafe\u2019s 10-13% range):\n\n\nPaysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n\nValuation Notes:\n\nRemoved all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+ Unlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow. Paysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group Paysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them \n\nChairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, Bill Foley, has a proven track record in generating value for his investors through rapid synergistic inorganic growth. This is a key strategic pillar for Paysafe. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d",
