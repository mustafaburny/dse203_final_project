        "body": "My take on stock investing in general is it really works in levels. You do not touch the higher levels of investing until you have a firm understanding and success at the lower. \nThe lowest level is ETF investing, easy to learn easy to toss money at and make returns. Also builds a strong base to work from\n\n The 2nd is individual stock, once you really learned to analyze investment data. You can also work on the emotional side of your investments in this area like not panicking during a selloff or becoming to elated in your gains not to sell.\n\nThe 3rd level is learning the various trading options such as limits, stop losses and margins. Really it can be bundled into the 2nd BUT these things are generally more important for traders rather Investors.\n\nFinally we get to options, if you don't have a firm grasp and decent experience with the above then you need to stay the hell away from options. They are the ultimate trap to newbie investors who see dipshits on WSB gambling away there entire savings. HOWEVER, a reasonable experienced investor whom can make sound decisions in there investments in the previous level can  infact benefit from limited option trading (can never recommend an all in). \n\nI for one am sitting on some delicious AMD 87.5 leap calls that don't expire til next June. I felt they were a reasonable investment as the XLNX merger was already know.",

Look into the management of these companies and you'll see AMD has a track record now and a plan for the future which they rarely completely miss on.

PCs dominated the sector for decades but in 2018 you could see that era was coming to an end. PCs are the only area we\u2019re intels 10 nm process node competes. By the time 7 nm is in production tsm will have released 3 nm. A few years ago intel was only one process node behind but now they are 2.\n\nMaybe the best example of this is my best friend who is not an engineer owning a ton of intel he bought the upward swing of the dip in 2019 and got it for 48. I convinced him to rotate that position into Amd and the best way to do that was xlnx based on price ratio of the two. He was able to get out at 57. He made 18.75% holding a stock for two years during one of the most historic bull runs ever and even an order of magnitude more historic for semiconductor stocks. He rotated all of it into xlnx at 120 and in a few months is up 79%. The delta between Amd price appreciation and intel might not always be that crazy and that fast but for the next two or so years I think most semiconductor stocks will outpace intel gains wise.",

They had to dump all the power they could into the CPU to be able to compete with current-gen AMD.  AMD is about to release next gen in 3 months with general expectation to crush Intel's latest gen for the desktop market.  \n\nleading to point 8...\n\n8. AMD's Epyc server has ran away from Intel as competition -- it's no longer even close.  AMD just announced yesterday their next gen Epyc is expected to have \\~50% uplift (in *common* workloads, so VM heavy crap); and the following gen to double their core count to 128 cores. Intel's best is a 38 core CPU which cost more and substantially less powerful then current/last gen AMD Epycs.

They have technological advantage here. \n\nFurthermore with their new MI200 datacenter GPU they are challenging nvidia in this area as well.\n\nSo overall AMD is better choice, they have a good roadmap, rising margins, rising revenues, they are expanding to new markets (Xilinx) and so far they\u2019ve delivered their promises. \nDisclaimer: my biggest position is AMD shares",
