Tesla dropped a hundred more and I decided not to have my mom lose money for wsb loss porn and I sold along with her at break even. I thought this crash was going to be a long term bear market and as someone who held Tesla stock since 2016, I knew being stuck at $2-300 range for years was possible again and that first parabolic move to $900 was nuts and unusual. \n\nAnyways, I broke the golden rule and checked what those calls would be worth now. $1.5 million.

MA is able to easily work with multiple of those companies and they're using their global presence pretty well, that's why they're my pick for the fintech industry.\n\nThey launched Mastercard Accelerate last year, implementing those online paying platforms and letting start-ups take advantage of their global presence to grow and transform very fast. Last year they acquired Ethoca (managing e-commerce fraud) and Vyze (platform to connect merchants with multiple renders, giving them the opportunity to get those financial needs for start-ups). MA is basically helping start-ups to grow faster, which will result in more financial transactions in the future.\n\nLast but not least, they like to focus on expanding to countries where there isn't much competition yet. They are expanding their exposure to Middle East and Africa, working with local networks and e-commerce platforms. They are in a strong position to capitalize those regions in the future and take on market leader Visa even more.\n\nThey get compared a lot to Visa, so I'll expand on that subject a bit as well. While V is focussing on performance and speed, MA plays the cyber security card. They are already working on ways to implement cryptocurrency and Mastercard tend to have more growth potential vs stability from market leader Visa. While V is in the lead, MA is more widely used by fintech companies, which shows potential take-over in the future. Next to their credit services, they also own debit service Maestro, which is widely used in Europe.\n\n**Financial**\n\nReturns as high as 150% (ROE) and 60% (ROIC). Very large margins and perfectly stable balance sheet. High EPS growth YoY, 53% and 42% in the last two years. Quick ratio 1.87. V has more assets and even bigger margins, however MA wins in returns and cash. In terms of more growth, I like to focus on those last numbers more.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIt's a blue chip at a $300B market cap. Their growth potential might be limited, although I see them as one of the better picks between blue chips.",

        "body": "There are a lot of differen't opinions on this thread but most of the strongest voices here seem to have a one-track mind and look at the market as black and white, when nothing is ever so simple.\n\nTo make a proper speculation it's really important to fully understand what's going on and what makes up the economy and Macroeconomics 101, and I can't emphasize the latter enough because every bull who thinks their bull stocks will keep growing in perpetuity assumes those companies exists in a vacuum and nothing negative in the broader economy will come back to bite them in the ass.\n\nSome TL;DR points:\n\n1. **We are absolutely in a bubble.**\n\n\\- Just look at PE ratios, overall economic sentiments, there is zero reason in a value-based investment that we are hitting all-time highs.\n\n**2) A bubble is not going to burst without not even just one event, but a cascade of events.**\n\n\\- Look at DotCom and 2008 financial crisis. The triggering effect was a big ripple from a cascade of events that were for one reason or another bound to happen.\n\n**3) You can't predict when the bubble will burst.**\n\n\\- Just not happening. It comes down to your level of risk tolerance, how you diversify your portfolio so that when it does it, that portfolio will recover just as most people did in March.\n\n**4) Wall Street is not Main Street.**\n\n\\- Though I primarily subscribe to Mohamed El-Erian, to quote/paraphrase Bill Ackman, \"Wall Street may be hitting all-time highs. However, if you create an index for Main Street, it is down 80%.\"\n\nAccording to the SBA, 99.7% of the US comprise of small businesses. Most of these will not be listed on the stock market.\n\nThe best indicators you can get is probably look at commercial rental properties.\n\n**5) Wall Street indices/indicators are mostly comprise of top performers who are at least in part digital and all globalized. This is not representative of even established small corporations.**\n\n\\- Even if you were to focus on Dow Jones and S&amp;P etc. solely, you are not getting a full picture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\nMy thoughts on the disconnect between the stock market and sentiments:\n\n1. **Macroeconomic effects takes time to materialize.**\n\n1a) With or without stimulus checks, most people have some level of reserves. Even those living paycheck to paycheck, they can get creative, and the quarantine itself creates more ways to save on expenses. I'm sure a lot of people are also working with their landlords to weather through the pandemic. Smart landlords know that even if they are unhappy with it, 1) They're not likely to be able to find new tenants during this time 2) Even if they really wanted to evict, that process may be a serious PITA because of the pandemic.\n\nIt's only been 6 months. If those reserves and creativity are to dry up, we'll see it in the next 6 months. The past 6 is not a good indicator of anything at all.\n\n1b) Small Businesses, PPP, or responsible ma &amp; pa stores or what have you probably tried their best to take care of their businesses and employees the past 6 months mitigating the larger effects of unemployment. Sure, the economy is \"opening up\", but retail consumers have not come back. The new equilibrium has changed and the cascading effects has yet to be seen.\n\n1c) Only after busineses go through a full finacial cycle or exhaust their reserves will you see mass layoffs, in turn means people can't pay, which in turn means other businesses will receive less revenue because of lack of spending, and the spiral continues.\n\nTHIS is the real macroeconomic effect. This happens at scale and takes time. 6 months is absolutely nothing at the macro scale.\n\nThink about it, at the macroeconomic scale it doesn't matter if a few businesses are thriving. If the rest of the economy is failing, people have no money to spend on the big businesses. This is a huge ticking time bomb you will not see on the stock market \\*now\\* but it will be felt later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2) The Stock Market is being propped up by more than the Fed**\n\n2a) One hugely significant thing people are not talking about is toward the end of 2019 all major brokerages eliminated the commission fees for stock trading. This HUGELY increased money velocity on the stock market because there's no perceived costs or barrier to entry to trade. When you rapidly trade stocks between people the slightest positive outlook will lead to much more rapid growth, even if you assume only existing participants are trading.\n\nBut that's not all, retail investors exploded BECAUSE it costs nothing to trade. They may had been hesitant and sat in the sidelines in the past, but where value-investors are hoarding cash? These formerly sidelined retail investors/non-investors are pouring in, their cash contribution easily rivals what cash previously taken out.\n\n2b) The Stimulus packages are being thrown into the stock market rather than the economy.\n\nThe stimulus packages came in too early for most people who had no fear of their job security (yet) and had not felt the squeeze in their usual spending. It was not selective enough so many middle class and those in hi-tech just wound up with money they didn't know what to do with. With extra cash on hand they bid the stock market because that's what everyon'es doing, right?\n\nThis is latently harmful to the macroeconomy, because bidding up stock prices doesn't inherently produce value, its actually spending them on the economy that does.\n\n2c) Rise of retail investors\n\nWith no where to go, people who normally have budget for travel or casinos, or other forms of social activities/make-up etc. that don't make sense in the social distancing era they move their money into \\*drumroll\\* stock market, rather than purchase alternative consumer goods.\n\nAgain, like 2b with the stimulus checks, this inflates the stock price but does not produce economic value. While the US economy is in a deflationary period, the stock market is absolutely in an inflationary period. No wonder Berkshire Hathaway who swore off gold decided to buy gold.",

        "body": "My understanding is the Square wants to position itself as a sort of complete ecosystem for a cashless/cardless society. It certainly has tons of competitors for this but IMO its advantage lies in the fact that nobody else has such wide spread POS capabilities AND a popular payment app (Cash App). As you mention, Square is also trying to become a bank and I am sure they will eventually offer a brokerage option on their app - imagine a Robinhood app only people can also instantly send and receive money from their account and use it to make payments to merchants - this IMO is the end game.\n\n\nSo the goal is to eliminate the need for using any other financial app or service, any paper money, and even physical cards whatsoever. You pay businesses directly to their POS device from your Cash App, you send and receive money to friends with Cash App, your account with Cash App has brokerage capabilities so you invest your money in it (maybe you open an IRA on there too), if you need a loan you get one directly from the Cash App, if you need credit instead of having a credit \"card\" you just have a line of credit you can spend from the Cash App directly to merchants or friends, and so on - complete and seamless integration of everything into one app.\n\n\nAgain, back to Square's big advantage - they already have an app and it is widely used AND they have a big POS presence. Obviously V/MA have a huge POS presence but they have no wildly popular app to integrate with. Paypal has Venmo and is very well integrated online but they don't really have much POS capability that I know of - can you pay at many physical locations via paypal? Maybe you can and I am just unaware. But Square is used by tons of merchants for payment all over and the Cash App is getting even more popular. Nobody else has these two key advantages. So if Square can add brokerage and banking capabilities to the Cash App and if direct payments from the Cash App to merchants takes off (in place of using cash/cards) then I think it can really take off.",

It doesn't hurt to have a few indicators MA, MACD and etc.   I don't trade on the indicators but I use them as a reality check.   \n\nBe very mindful of volatility.  Staying out when volatility is low is key.  If the volatility rises after you enter then you get killed on the spread.

There's been a bullish trend since May. A golden cross is impending. The 200 MA is providing great support. RSI is very low. Day traders may hate this POS, but I only see positive data for swing traders and longs. Looking forward to see how the 50 MA can help us post golden cross.",

While the big tech companies have the capability to do get into this market, I do not see them pursuing a financial venture  like this,  especially capital lending. I can see the same with Visa and Mastercard feeling the same.\n\nAlso regarding visa and Mastercard,  they are payment processors,  they do not hold any of the risk since they are not the lenders. Again, not really their business motto.\n\nAs far as Cash App, a lot of the younger people I ha e talked with prefer to use the app instead of opening up a regular bank account.\n\nI think we also have to consider the international markets. While our banking system in the U.S. is great, other countries don't have access to great banks. Also, lot of cash counterfeiting and enormous banking fees. I believe the market distrubtion SQ will have outside of the U.S. will be huge.\n\nI am long SQ and my bigger concern is PayPal coming into the space. Even then, the market is large enough for more than one player.  Just like Apple iPhones and Samsung, or Facebook and Google for ad revenue.  I believe SQ has a great future and have been executing perfectly. \n\nI might be wrong, but this has just been my thoughts on it.",

For most people, buying and holding diversified funds and not worrying about TA is the best strategy.\n\nIf you want to stock pick, it would be good to learn basic TA like resistance levels so that you can estimate good entries and stop losses, but focus on fundamental factors.\n\nFor example, TA tells me that Amazon will have a good week next week, but only if the stock market holds up. If the entire market crashes because of some political issue, Amazon's breakout will fail. These additional concerns mean that you have to be able to pay attention to your portfolio at all times with TA. \n\nIf you invest fundamentally, you can just say you think Amazon is a good company and want to buy in and hold. With basic technical analysis, you can protect yourself from a major drop by setting a stop loss at slightly below the 50 or 200 MA (notice how [in its chart since March](https://imgur.com/I68sC2X), Amazon has never dropped below the green 50 MA line. Something big would have to happen for it to drop to the orange 200 MA line or lower). This is a lot less stress!\n\nAnd for even less stress, and the best strategy for most people, just buy and hold diversified funds so that you don't have to worry about this at all.",

And if it wasnt because its already bleed so hard that i might as well let it burn out, i'd say i jinxed that call before it even had a chance!  \n\n\nNo but really.. i hope your calls play out, dont base your desicions on mad rambelings of a soar loser like me. Selling before earnings? VERY Good idea, dont hold through, even on the off chance something might explode. Get that IV to work for you! I might suggest switching to spreads if your account is small since theta wont be as big of a problem.",

Once you build for one specific purpose, it takes a lot to reconstruct and revamp into something else while risk losing the core business competitive advantage.\n\nIt's also challenging one of the most powerful sector, banks, eventually they will join in the fight.\n\nThe only competitor imo is PayPal. But the market is much bigger than just PayPal and Square imo, the global market potential is massive.\n\nImo there will be one or two more eventual big competitors, but that's why square has paved most of the groundworks and any potential fights against banks\n\nHaving one app to transfer money, store, invest, and with a better reward system than traditional banks etc are important but imo there would be so much more as more sellers join the ecosystem.",
