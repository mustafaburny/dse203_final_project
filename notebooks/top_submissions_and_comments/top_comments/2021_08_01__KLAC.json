There are plenty of examples of widely used software that are not open sourced and easily outcompete the open source counterparts. Windows and Mac in Desktop/Laptop space. Office by Microsoft. Database products by AWS/Oracle. Content creation software by Adobe. Many more.\n\n\\&gt; it's Apple vs. the world.\n\nAnd Apple has won in *every single* field they have entered. Self-driving and VR are upcoming techs, but just because its Apple vs world doesn't mean Apple will be at a huge disadvantage. Indeed, it is the world that is at disadvantage when Apple enters a field.\n\n\\&gt; Apple also charges a fee to develop apps. It's free on Android.\n\nDespite iOS being less than 20% of market, more than 50% of revenue developers make are on iOS. Not sure what fee are you talking about, but the fact that iOS is still a priority for developers despite them having to pay a fee actually puts Android in bad light.\n\n\\&gt; iOS it is a massive pain\n\n99% of people on this planet just download from App Store directly, whether it is iOS or Android.\n\n\\&gt; The reality is they're losing margin on their phones\n\niPhones are the most profitable item at Apple, accounting for majority of their profits. If you think that they are committing a financial fraud by reporting $20B+ profits from iPhone sales instead of a loss, then I don't know what to say. This would be the biggest scam in the history of mankind.\n\n\\&gt; Also we are at peak phones now - I only see downward pressure on margins due to the competition\n\nActually, if you think that smartphone sales are at peak (which is incorrect), then Apple is even more likely to maintain sales (generally, people who buy cheap &lt;$400 Android are less likely to buy a phone when new one comes out when old one works just fine).\n\n\\&gt; I always felt their original PE ratio\n\nPE ratio is high for companies who have high growth potential. Microsoft has been doing not bad in cloud segment and cloud segment market is not even at 5% potential. Now obviously, *you* don't think Apple and Microsoft will grow in future, but others do; so naturally, you would say their PE ratio is high.\n\n\\&gt; This was true years ago. Not true anymore.\n\nBased on sales of phones with cost &gt;= $700, Apple dominates and they do that with iPhone 12 more than they did with any other iPhone apart from iPhone 6.",
