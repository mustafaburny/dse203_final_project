Zoom's network scaled to this extra customer base with minimal problems\n* The CEO offered the tool to educators free of charge. Sure, it doesn't have the same edutech features of some other tools, but suddenly every educator and student installed Zoom on computers and adapted to their format and style. Zoom's network scaled to this extra customer base *with minimal problems*\n* The tool became a de facto tool for connecting with friends, surpassing Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts (or whatever it is called today), and other market leaders. Suddenly it isn't just a productivity software company, but also a social network (and Zoom's privacy policy means they can capitalize on being a social network). Zoom's network scaled to this extra customer base ***with minimal problems***\n\nImagine every place that serves food in a town closes except for a single sports bar/wing joint. People desperate for any food will flock to that wing joint, and suddenly they're getting 5x the orders unexpectedly. Now imagine that wing joint served every customer on time without hiring any extra cooks or compromising its quality for a single customer. Maybe that wing joint is worth more than previously evaluated? Sure, the other restaurants will reopen at some point, but the wing joint will still be more popular than it was before.\n\nHere's the biggest kicker: everyone is satisfied when the product is dirt cheap and kind of sucks! Zoom now has a diverse customer base, so they can offer Secure Zoom for legal proceedings (or maybe Congressional sessions during a Quarantine?), Zoom for Happy Hours and other social occasions, Zoom for Classrooms... the possibilities are endless and the software developers seem to be savvy enough to implement features while in social isolation.\n\nAll of this success while Microsoft is struggling to explain what Teams is (in between their outages) and Citrix is making design decisions that would embarrass IE6.",

The app will show you +1.00 (or however it moves, based on the open all day) on each option for the remainder of the trading day. Even though you started at a different price from open.\n\nIs your account balance right? Yes it is. But you almost need to know what you paid if you want to day trade. If not, it's back and forth to the order history, which sucks to filter and figure out how you might be doing.\n\nIf you are going to long date options, the next day, everything is good.\n\nThanks for coming to my SCHWAB talk.",

Here's the rub: as low as a 35% reduction in global emissions results in an immediate (this year) 0.5-1c global average temperature rise due to loss of global dimming/aerosol masking effect. What do you think happens when industry and transpo is disrupted severely by the virus? A massive reduction in emissions.\n\nMost people have no idea about this bit. We're fucked this year duder, this is the catalyst for global collapse (not this year, but in the very near future), though most don't see it yet (partly due to the fact that most people don't understand indirect consequences like the above).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context, the decadal global avg temp rise from 1951-2012 was 0.12c. DECADAL. We may be seeing 0.5-1c THIS YEAR. I'm sure you can decipher the general ramifications here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the 2nd rub: World leaders literally cannot be unaware of this conundrum. It's beyond the realm of reason that this isn't acutely understood by the people running show. If laymen with too much time on their hands can use studies and scientific projection/discussion on this to come to the right conclusions, then their intel has already detailed this to them, and they understand collectively what's happening here. But they don't give a fuck about any of us, and they're insulated as best as is possible in our position, so don't expect to hear about it before they flee the sinking ship to the bunkers we know they've been working on. That would lead straight to torches and pitchforks - they don't want that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsk yourself this: Was I even aware of the aerosol masking effect/global dimming  before right now? Because they were. And because ignorance of this reality is par for the course with most people - by no fault of their own.

If you\u2019re in the US and have a 401k or other investment vehicle at your job, make sure that you\u2019re capitalizing on that. This provides both tax benefits as well as matching deposits from many corporations. Since you\u2019re still working, consider being heavier on stocks instead of bonds. Many folks would recommend a 60/40 asset allocation (stocks/bonds), and depending on your age and planning horizon you may lean into stocks or lean into bonds. This is the safe approach and the \u201cproven\u201d long term model that you can go and research outside of reddit.\n\nAs far as individual stock picking goes, this one is a bit trickier. Some folks will argue that you cannot pick stocks and that it\u2019s a fools game trying to succeed in this arena. From where I sit, the answer is that it depends on how you build your model. A good place to start is on portfolio Visualizer. You can perform a backtest on specific equities to try and gauge the performance of that equity. As you figure out which companies you want to own, you can then play with allocating different amounts to each of the companies (eg since you\u2019re mentioned tech run a backtest with n% Intel, n% nvidia, etc.). Once you\u2019ve done this, pay close attention to the following numbers: 1) max drawdown and recovery time, 2) sharpe ratio, 3) sortino ratio, 4) US market correlation. Ideally, you want a low max drawdown, and higher sharpe/sortino ratios. \n\nAfter you\u2019ve figured your portfolio out, go ahead and run it through the Monte Carlo analysis to make sure that it meets your criteria and to give you an idea of performance over a variety of conditions (both negative and positive). Then compare your portfolio to the S&amp;P and or a blended fund mix and see which portfolio has better results (the further you can go back in time with your data, the more confident you can be about the outcomes.) \n\nIf you like what you see, then buy in, in the specific allocation that you\u2019ve designed. Once you build the model, you should try and stick with it, in both good times and bad ones.\n\nAgain, from my own experience, my 401k got decimated in this past weeks events. However, my handcrafted portfolio which uses the methods above is still up double digits (%s) for the year. That is to say it is indeed possible to build models that can withstand certain events, but it does not guarantee that it will withstand all. The model performed exactly as the data said it would perform. \n\nAgain though, I stress that for many (most?) people, a 2-3 fund portfolio will work better for them in the long run. If you want to put in the time to build an appropriate model, you can find success there.\n\nIf you don\u2019t care, then yeah go crazy and yolo into a bunch of stocks. It\u2019s your money anyways. \n\nBest of luck to you in your investment journey.",

The best they had was low to medium performance options for both markets. This has been their position with respect of Intel and nVidia for a long time. Now their CPUs are king and their GPUs are competitive, even lacking a flagship as powerful as the 2080 or 2080ti. \n\nThey have rapidly transitioned from a sustained underdog position to a real tooth and nail competitor.

The best they had was low to medium performance options for both markets. This has been their position with respect of Intel and nVidia for a long time. Now their CPUs are king and their GPUs are competitive, even lacking a flagship as powerful as the 2080 or 2080ti. \n\nThey have rapidly transitioned from a sustained underdog position to a real tooth and nail competitor. If we assume that this trend will continue does it not stand to reason that their share price should also continue to perform as they seize a greater market share?\n\nThis of course says nothing about server and console hardware, which im less familiar with but i hear they're doing well in those sectors as well.",

        "body": "A) I think you underestimate the impact this virus had on the \\*global\\* supply chain. Saying it is priced in is retarded because we don't even know what the exact impact is yet. We know it's very bad; we just don't know if it's bad or horrible yet. But consider this. Stock market is down around 25% now. Almost an entire quarter (so far) has seen, based on current estimates, somewhere between a 60-80% reduction in supply chain. Since we don't know what the future holds, I think 25% down is pretty accurate. If this continues even more and further disrupts the supply chain, well then the market will fall even more.\n\nB) You are forgetting that the market was already **waaaaaaaay** overvalued. I cannot stress the word \"waaaaaaaay\" enough. Even for the best performing stonks which can't go tits up both short and long term (MA for example) was severely overpriced. And even after their 20% reduction in price, they are still overvalued by **a lot**. Maybe you are right and the market goes up on Monday but over the next 1-2 months the probability of it continuing its overall downtrend is pretty high (fuck off **\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b**s).\n\nC) Black swan event as another Redditor mentioned already. We can't predict these things but when they happen, falls tend to be much more than your usual \"correction.\" Add in the fact this is not only an economic problem (supply chain) but a medical one as well with no vaccine/shot as of yet (and still no understanding of how to combat it), and it's not a pretty situation.\n\nDonald Pump and the medical community are trying to downplay this by comparing it to the regular flu, where roughly 80K people/year die from it. However, beervirus has a 2-3% death rate while the regular flu has a 0.1% death rate. Additionally and more importantly, the flu doesn't spread like this new one. When have you EVER heard of someone in California getting the flu and people in bumblefuck Latvia are worried about that person in Cali? Never. This IS something different than the regular flu. Again, you may be right about Monday specifically, but I don't see how the market recovers over the next 1-2 months (at least).",

And I doubt even 5% of those with symptoms are self quarantining.\n\nThe hype is overdone and the hysteria of COVID is more damaging to the population as a whole than the virus itself.\n\nIf you are a boomer, elderly or immunocompromised you could suffer physically but the rest of us won\u2019t. \n\nIn 28 days the virus will have run its course globally and 90% of those who could have died from it will have.\n\nThe hysteria is because of media clickbait and attention grabbing.\nOld people all die of something.

The main thing is to wash your hands whenever you touch something, dont touch your face, avoid the sick, avoid at risk groups eg child daycare and have a general good health.\n\nCOVID is a good case study of contagious hysteria. \n\nLEAPS on SPY\nPuts on boomers, the elderly and immunocompromised - but they would have increased risk of dying of an infection anyway.\n\nSource: worked in one of the top 3 chest hospitals in the world, now 12 years since graduated med school, have written book chapters on respiratory med.\n\nOr inverse me idk",

        "body": "Hey guys, \n\nI don't know if this is the right place, but we own a facility that manufactures n95 masks (and on approx. March 15th, we'll also produce surgical masks) in China (Zaozhuang, Shandong specifically). We have a 500,000sq ft facility with a dedicated ISO class 5 Cleanroom for our 300,000 daily n95 production capabilities (and 1MM masks a day for surgical masks once it's at full operation) and we are taking bulk orders (10,000 pc minimum) for shipment within China, our clients are usually in charge of export as there simply isn't enough time for our limited employees to deal with exports. We supply to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in China called XiuZheng pharmaceutical group \u4fee\u6b63\u96c6\u56e2 and have sold millions of our n95 respirators to them. We also supply millions of n95 respirators to Xiaomi \u5c0f\u7c73, the phone company. We've had clients export to Russia, HK and US, though I'm not quite sure the exact logistics they went through. Some clients use freight forwarding companies.\n\nThe material costs have tripled in the last month alone so our masks are currently more expensive than usual, but people are nonstop purchasing due to the shortages. Hopefully we can help you get what you're looking for.  \n\nOur current pricing for n95 mask is 14rmb ($2 USD equivalent) for smaller orders of 10,000pcs+, 13 rmb ($1.86) for 50,000+, 12 rmb ($1.72) for 100,000pcs+, 11rmb ($1.57) for 1,000,000+ and 10rmb for 10,000,000+. This does not include shipping cost by SF Express which will be Cash on Delivery. It also does not include 10% taxes if applicable. Please keep in mind that material prices are constantly shifting so this may be out of date when you see this. Just two weeks ago (2/12/2020) our price per N95 mask was 18rmb while our prices in January was 4rmb! Once materials run out we cannot purchase them unless we pay a crazy amount for example, one ton of raw material used to cost 20,000 rmb, now for the same ton of n95 material costs 380,000-800,000 rmb, which is literally up to 40 times the cost for the same exact material. There is a global shortage of n95 grade materials.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me on Wechat or Whatsapp if you want to place orders. \n\nMy Wechat ID is: franktsaur and my WhatsApp ID is +16269916596. I am based in Los Angeles, but I work with the Asia team remotely. \n\nSincerely, \nFrank T.",

Made 20 grand long on Tesla shares and then Tesla puts end of day today on some quick whatever trades. \n\n And then one of my covid patients died. It was expected, but sad. Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day. It has for 5 years and still does now. Love you guys. Stay safe.",

Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle.

        "body": "That press conference was one of the worst I've ever seen.\n\nFirst off, they already say the same basic thing everyday at the press conference. They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",

That's only because if you start (and continue) to invest because you somehow believe \"I should start investing\" or \"I should be consistently investing\" (what brokers would have you believe, to ensure their survival) rather than \"I have found a good investment\" then you will always invest an inopportune moments. Buffett invests on very long timelines, using historical trends and ratios as a guide, whereas many investors look at more recent information, and only start investing at the point where recent history shows good returns. I'd say when recent history shows poor returns but long term history shows good, and the particular company you're looking to invest in has some kind of difficult to emulate competitive advantage (be it financial, operational, market, or some combination thereof) then go and invest. Otherwise, keep your money on the sidelines (and let it pile up) whilst you observe the market/industries/companies and wait for a great opportunity to buy. This is what the Oracle does, I think.",

        "body": "Great question. \n\nCompanies have been developing a new model for delivery of their services. Traditional IT is considered on-prem or on premise technologies. That can range from servers to applications. Technology vendors have been developing \u201ccloud\u201d technology for years and have been pushing this to market. However, because true cloud or \u201cpublic cloud\u201d is hosted in a vendors data center people are skeptical of using vendors because they don\u2019t control everything. This means all the responsibility is on the vendors to secure everything. \n\nSince cloud is the new way of deploying IT solutions and people are starting to accept the model more governments want in on the benefits of cloud. \n\nBut since the government won\u2019t be in full control of the cloud (see Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Oracle gov data centers) they need a way to ensure security, deployment, and capabilities are met. This is called fedramp. There are multiple levels in getting certified for usage from the government.",
