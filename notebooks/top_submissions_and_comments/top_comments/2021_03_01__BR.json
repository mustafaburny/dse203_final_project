You make him out to be a \"woke lefty\" and decide he's anti-facts because you're arguing in bad fsith anf making a strawman. \n\n\n\nCPI isn't a divine truth, its not a flawless tool. Any tool can be used in many ways and statistics are always easy to manipulate. Its easy to see why someone would *want* to manipulate it to br able to control the narrative. And its also easy to see why people who see the cost of living/education/transportation/healthcare/food/property rise quickly would assume its inflation. Their money has less buying power today then it had yesterday, that is by definition inflation *at least for those assets*.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least it's plain stupid to say a lefty would ignore facts, facts is the lefts best friend. Ita why they *love* higher education and want people to study, to read. They dont quoute a 2000 years old book of fairy-tales, they look for cause and effect through science. The left inquires, the right accepts. Left knows, thanks to /r/science that inequality is bad, that wage gap is bad. That when the poor get less many suffer but when the poor get more society benefits...less crime/powerty/problems.",

        "body": "I was taking notes during Tesla's ride up, and we see the exact same signs here, but Tesla had a lot more of them because it's been grpwing for far longer (in a sinilar manner) than Gamestop, and nobody was screaming manipulation then when almost the exact same things as we see here were occurring, it's just easy to spread that rhetoric when youhave a group voice convinced of it now. \n\nThe stocks value dropped from 340 to 220 in the course of 11 minutes. For the first 3 minutes, there just weren't enough people buying to stop the cascade. Professionals day trade on Gamestop, there is no doubt, and when the value dropped below a certain resistance point around 330, that signalled a further drop, so more day traders started selling their shares that, having bought it, were also the ones collectively helping keep the value above 340. Then once it dipped below 320, the next resistance point, likely caused by people 'panic' selling after the initial drop, the next reasonable resistance was around 290. And we see that, there was a lot of push back for the next 3 minutes, bouncing around 290, and then for one minute it stayed at 290. But still, not enough people, not enough money was being pumped in to 'defend' that as a solid resistance (granted this is a short time frame to gather resistance, but I can absolutely understand why people didn't have patience to wait after the last pump and dump, it's risky and taking profit is absolutely what most of the money in this stock is looking to do).\n\nThen, for the next 2 minutes, we see a fat drop. If I had access to second by second data, I would br able to do more digging, but I don't, and I doubt most of the people here, if any, looked that closely. It just seems so impossible for the apes that a typical snowball effect took place, they'd rather look at the far less likely option of market manipulation,wl ehich is almost immediately discounted by the buying pressure exherted after the wave of stop-losses stop triggering.\n\nIn the 10th minute, we hit below 220 pretty fast. It's most likely that, like I said above, a casecade of stop-losses were hit on the way down, causing a large chunk of stock value to drop as people were taken out of the game. Yes, stop losses are extremely common, almost every serious day trader sets them at or below resistance points.\n\nThen, at minute 11, we see a lot of buys at a discounted price. Nothing odd here. Minute 12 we see nothing happen, as the initial buys come in and people wait to see what happens next. Those that would have sold during this crash already did, those that would have bought at the bottom already did. A moment of anticipation. No more selling, the buyers are getting ready, and it's steady growth from there. Except for that dip right after the initial rise back up, which was perhaps the people that had given up, a common thought process 'I missed my chance to sell because I had not set a stop-loss due to the high volatility, I will wait for it to rise a bit because the buys will likely come in now, but I don't think this is going anywhere anymore/It's too volatile I will just close my trade at when it jumps up a little'\n\nIf you've day-traded for even 8 months and consistently consider the thought process of others, you can implement your own in to the mix and begin to understand exactly what is driving the market. Sentiment is. People are. The decision of one person to buy and anothers to sell. Why? Look at your screen, they see exactly what you do, consider the different circumstances of their positions and ypu can begin to understand why people make certain decisions to sell, buy, set stop losses, etc, like I mentioned above.",
