My mindset was to buy and hold for decades because I\u2019m only 30 but I did some recent reorganizing when shit hit the fan in March. It was hard for me to start investing, I come from a family who only put their money in CDs, Money markets, and other types of savings accounts. I figured I\u2019d have less risk if I picked a lot of different stocks but regretting it a little because it\u2019s also less reward when a stock does really well. Probably going to get more aggressive and use some of the recommendations I\u2019ve seen in recent posts",
