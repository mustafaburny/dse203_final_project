        "body": "Credits to /u/ixamnis\n\n\" Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I'm also going to include **EFA** and **EEM**. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. **EFA** is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and **EEM** is rated only 5.7/10. **EEM** appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. **EFA** appears to be more tilted toward the European market. \n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I'm adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**.  Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\nRead through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people.\"",

The two teams that beat us had returns several multiples above ours.  My teacher was convinced they were backdating their trades.  :-)  But whatever, it was a ton of fun and planted the seed for later in life.

So is it ok to have both of them in my portfolio, or should I go \\~40% into one of the two to clean my portfolio a little?\n\nHow often should I re-balance my portfolio, so I get in the habit of not creating too many taxable events?\n\nI am very bullish on cloud computing and semiconductors long term but I feel I may be too heavily invested in those sectors. Should I decrease my allocation to these sectors in my portfolio and diversify more, or is it ok to make bets like this because of my time horizon?\n\nIs it ok to have basically my entire portfolio in large-cap tech stocks? Have I diversified enough with the 40% allocation of the two funds (VOO and VTI)?",

There are people who want to make content and can't afford 50 a month for Premiere etc. Also Adobe has been teasing some really cool AI stuff for years.... but where is it? They haven't really done anything huge in a while.. Creative Cloud is okay.. but its clunky and people don't like paying subscription and they don't like dealing with millions of passwords on an enterprise level etc. Adobe could be great.. but they need to do something big.... although every lawyer on the planet uses Acrobat and calls it Adobe. \"Do you have adobe?\"... Yet acrobat itself is kind of clunky as well.   \n\n\nBut who is their rival? If you look it up.. None of those companies have much to do with creating content: \"Adobe's top competitors include SAP, Salesforce, DocuSign, Dropbox, Getty Images, Shutterstock, Apple, Microsoft, IBM and Autodesk. Adobe is a software company developing digital marketing and media solutions.\"",

One might say Adobe might be on the cusp of improving their net income margins (generating more income per unit of revenue), in which case 40% might actually be a fairer value to use!\n\nWhich unfortunately also reveals the riskiness of DCF calculations because they work best with companies that have sort of found their footing with respect to the ratios. That\u2019s why Jimmy used Apple in his videos, because they\u2019ve got to a point where their margins, their growth, etc have gotten to be pretty consistent. For a company like Adobe, which still shows significant fluctuations in net income margins or FCF/net income ratios, DCF tends to become very susceptible to what values you choose.",

        "body": "Don\u2019t get me wrong, their numbers look pretty solid and some are proving they could make more and more in the future, but just Roku for example: why would them being bought out by Comcast be a good thing? Comcast would destroy their whole system, add more ads and probably create a platform that people don\u2019t want anymore. Roku was built to get away from Comcast. So the stock going up cause of that possible buyout was stupid IMO. I see them independent as fine, but their stock price shot up for a bad reason. Part of the reason why I think their short term value should come down a little to maybe the 400 region. \n\nAnd then you have Twilio who yes is good, but trading super high for their rev. At the current valuation, they need to be closing the gap on their loss not increasing it. I think they deserved to be at 360 and hover, but when it dipped and soared back to 380 from 310 in two weeks, too high too fast. \n\nAnd you have DocuSign for example which is a proven model to help in the esignature world, but it\u2019s premiums are too high for their service. Costing 3x more than services like Adobe sign doesn\u2019t make sense. There may be some additional features, but not enough. It\u2019s earnings were good, makes sense for the bump, but then it soared another like 20% on no news and it\u2019s running too much in the past month. I believe 260 short term in the next week is a fair value to come in. \n\nThen again, we are in a FOMO market, everyone is sinking money into tech because of interest rates, inflation, growth, rotation, you name it. When someone on the internet says they know why a stock is moving up or down, they really don\u2019t know. They\u2019re just following the crowd. I def could be wrong too, but when a stock trades upwards 1-5 percent every single day for like 2-3 weeks straight, I think it\u2019s due for a semi pull back to cool off.",

It uses some presumably overpriced cartridges that the vet will buy and charge the pet owners for.  It lets the vet run the tests promptly in-house rather than send them out.  It may be overpriced for what it is, but doctors and customers will probably pay for this incremental convenience the way we all flipped to buying individual coffee pods at 15x the old price of a cup.  Pet ownership has exploded, pet owners will pay anything for dear Fluffy, and vet offices are gold mines.  It's not without drawbacks, but this might take off. \n\nADBE.

        "body": "This seems inline with my consensus on the matter as well. I think I'll keep investing in the index funds I have today (which cover various markets and sectors, so it's pretty diversified) and then invest in companies not represented in the funds separately.\n\nFor example, one index fund I have holdings in covers some of the largest companies in the US. So in order to get more spread I would need to find companies who has stable finances and growth potential but not included in the Top Tier yet. \n\nI believe there are a lot of tech companies out there that fit into this category, especially those focusing on core business tech (like servers, firewalls, software, hybrid clouds, etc). Some examples that come to mind are Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, Oracle, Adobe. \n\nBut I digress, thanks for the info (and the rest in this thread).",

No effective hedging identified. \n\n\r  \nLending permitted. Per NPORT-P filed on 2021-03-16 securities lending was conducted using all-cash collateral\n\n\r  \nListed: NYSE ARCA\n\n\r  \nPortfolio weightings range from .38% to 2.2% per NPORT-P on 2021-03-16\r  \nNotes: Fund limits 80% of investments to those held by the \u201cFidelity Value Factor Index\u201d. It does not require proportional weighting. This index is developed mid-cap and large-cap only, limiting the fund exposure to mid and large-cap funds for the majority of investment. The fund does not maintain a small-cap allocation.\n\n\r  \nGeode is permitted to utilize statistical sampling techniques to match investment characteristics of a variety of factors between the index and the fund. \n\n\r  \nFiling 485BPOS filed 2021-02-24 discusses the proprietary weighting strategy of \u201cFidelity Value Factor Index\u201d. The section goes on to explain the index\u2019s weighting and composite scoring methodology. Composite measures: High FCF yield, low enterprise value to EBITDA, low price to tangible book value, and low price to future earnings. Size-bias is removed, and the highest composite scores are utilized. The country-weights of the index are intended to match the developed international market. Each stock group category is market-cap weighted internally, plus a group weighting adjustment is applied, then each sector is equal-weighted against the international market portfolio. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing is semi-annual in February and August\n\n\r  \nOpinion: \n\n\r  \nThe management structure warrants additional investigation, as the senior manager covers many funds, and there has been a senior-management change. Next step would be to analyze the overlap of non-senior portfolio managers to ensure at least some competent member of management treats this as a primary fund. Due to the low management fee and small capitalization this is unlikely. Additionally research must be completed as to the compensation agreements between Geode and its managers, as well as Fidelity and Geode. \n\n\r  \nThe underlying indexing strategy is uninspired and vulnerable to value traps. The low adherence required to the underlying index poses ethical conflict to primary managers of the fund dependent upon compensation agreements. This is compounded by the ability of Geode to allocate per their statistical sampling techniques. \n\n\r  \nWhile their mandate permits small and mid-cap securities, a large majority of the fund is large-cap. Size tilt should be accounted for when determining any allocation. Additionally, they have deviated from the global allocation with a Euro-centric tilt against their mandate. \n\n\r  \nRebalancing periods align with that of the MSCI ACWI Ex US index, which is quarterly rebalanced. Semi-annual rebalancing will result in drift away from MSCI on the underlying fund index. \n\n\r  \nCurrency risk of this fund may require portfolio-level currency management upon purchase. \n\n\r  \nInvestability is low due to low ADV and wide spreads, among other market impact concerns. This fund may be a target for creation-unit arbitrage given the large liquid underlying securities and relatively high premium available for the underlying securities. It should be noted total fund value equals only \\~11 creation units.",

        "body": "You are correct this is not a full due-diligence report, and I think you misunderstand what I was trying to do. The purpose of this is to give a high level summary of some key features of the fund, and to determine whether it is investable from a portfolio management perspective. Based on the ADV/spreads it is not realistically investable for me, so much of the remainder of the information listed is moot for my purposes. For that reason I touch on a couple high notes so that if I were to ever come back to this fund I would have some context to start from. My full documentation is about 12 pages, but I figured I would toss some summary info up here for anyone who was interested. \n\nThe info I gathered was from Morningstar reports and (primarily) their EDGAR filings, which I reviewed all of. I did not look at the Fidelity website. I also did not copy + paste anything besides the manager/advisor names\n\nI called it euro-centric because it has 134% of the euro allocation of the market index. It isn't a positive or negative, just something to be aware of. Tracking error and prospectus limitations are different issues as one is forward looking and one is backwards looking. When doing portfolio allocation of investor funds being aware of the degree of third-party discretion is important, and since it is not investable for me at this point I did not evaluate historical tracking error. There is no \"problem\" per se at present, but the structure of the fund and loose tracking requirements indicates that before investing client money additional research would need to be done as to how management is compensated, that is all. \n\nThere are several strategies to avoiding value traps in passive investments, the most common are \"quality adjusting\", or G-scoring, or F-Scoring, among many others. [Here](http://www.independance-et-expansion.com/files/upload/fondements-theoriques/Novy-Marx%20-%20Value%20Investing%202013.pdf) and [Here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2672906?seq=1) are a couple articles on the topic. You will note that the size dimension plays a role in the effects of quality-adjustment, which is why I addressed the portfolio size tilt in my opinion.",

Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",

        "body": "So first of all you have to realize that when you open a credit spread, it's a contract you have to manage. You don't just open and walk away, you have to think through the whole time frame. I primarily trade in RH and Fidelity. I love RH (people will probably scream at me for that) the execution has gotten a lot better since the start of last year AND it is really easy to roll the spread if you need to and save your ass. \n\nSo looking at SPY right now. RSI is at 57 so a little oversold but its coming off its correction so I'm ok with that. MACD bounced off its low the end of last month. We're seeing some stagnation but I'm pretty confident we aren't going to see a massive correction by the end of next week. We also haven't seen it cross the 50 day moving average really since that one time in March. \n\nSo actually I just opened a 100 spread order for 6/11 405/404 @$5/spread so $10K tied up for a $500 premium. And people will scoff at this but really that's 5% return in two weeks for basically doing nothing but looking at a chart and clicking some buttons (yes not with taxes blah blah blah, but taxes wont be realized until next year so..) given market conditions this allows me to sleep too. I may open more this week depending on the market, I opened one yesterday for 6/11 as well 402.5/402.",

        "body": "\nPaysafe preps post-Spac\u00a0refi\n\u00a0\n\n02 Jun 2021\n\nFintech payments provider Paysafe has launched a refinancing of its remaining credit facilities, following its $9bn merger with a Bill Foley-controlled Spac, which closed in March. The merger and its accompanying PIPE allowed the firm to pay down debt and cut its leverage, and now it wants to lock in the benefits with a lower-cost refi.\n\nJP Morgan is sole physical bookrunner on the dollar and euro term loans, totalling $1.026bn between the currencies. This will be followed with an equal sized slug of bonds in dollar and euros, yet to be launched.\nTalk on both tranches is 300bp-325bp at 99.5, with a 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, half a turn below its present level, according to the loan marketing materials.\nLenders have successfully pushed back on proposed margin ratchet terms \u2014\u00a0including Cerba, for example \u2014 but these are generally deals which started with more aggressive terms, such as multiple step-downs for each quarter-turn of leverage. Deals with 25bp for half a turn have largely sailed through.\n\"It's a real economic term and something investors can easily rally around,\" said a leveraged finance syndicate banker. \"Some of the other docs points can be a bit of a niche interest but this is universal.\"\nPaysafe earmarked \u20ac1.25bn-equivalent of its outstanding debt for repayment as part of the merger, which closed at the end of March. The company said in\u00a0its introduction to equity market analysts\u00a0that it would have net leverage of 3.6-3.8 times on its 2021 earnings following the transaction \u2014 suggesting it intends to activate the margin step-down quickly.\nIt will, however, be going on the acquisition trail as well. Outlining the deal to analysts, Foley said: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6 times. As Paysafe continues to grow and generate cash flow, that leverage ratio will continue to come down creating even more opportunity to pursue accretive M&amp;A opportunities.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s estimated leverage at 5.2 times on March 2021 numbers, after backing out some of the company\u2019s adjustments.\nBased on its expected 2021 Ebitda, the business was 6-6.2 times levered at the end of last year, with net debt of $2.99bn, incurred when Blackstone and CVC took the firm private in 2017. The sponsors scored a huge win with the transaction, paying \u00a33bn for the company and selling it on at a valuation of $9bn.\nHowever, both firms will remain invested. They took $2.3bn off the table as part of the Spac deal, but rolled over $3.29bn, while the Spac itself put in $1.467bn.\nThe PIPE investment (private investment in public equity) closed at the same time injected a further $2bn, with cornerstones from Foley-affiliated entities Cannae Holdings and Trasimene Capital Management, and outside capital from Fidelity, Third Point, and Maplelane Asset Management.\nAlongside the term loan and bond refi, the company will have a new $305m revolver in place following the closing of the deal.\nSpac-driven M&amp;A activity is increasingly\u00a0feeding through to leveraged credit markets and to CLO portfolios, as sponsor-owned companies become targets for SPAC acquisitions. The equity raised through this route usually deleverages the company, meaning loan repayments or refinancings tighter \u2014 in some cases, helping take out loans trading at low levels at par.\nPaysafe\u2019s existing euro loan already had a margin of 325bp, the wide end of the new guidance, but it also had outstanding second lien debt of $200m and \u20ac214m in its original LBO capital structure, which paid 725bp and 700bp respectively and have now been repaid.",

I've gone from barely having enough to invest to nearly not being subject to pattern day trader restrictions in the span of eight months. At this point I'm planning on basically only holding blue chips with one or two other real plays for barely a couple hundred thousand at most after all this pans out so I can prove to myself I'm not just a lucky retard that got in on the tail end of the biggest bull run in modern history, and so that in the event I'm wrong I'll still have millions I can just leave in my fidelity account and make enough off interest from to live fat until the day I die. And that's if I'm just the laziest bastard that ever lived.  \n\nStocks will never be this fun for me again and given all the regulations that have been passed leading up to this insanity I've got a strong feeling that 8% gains per year will be a lot moving forward. At least there's plenty of squeezes to get in on atm though, and I'll be able to buy the dip on ford and apple eventually so I've got that going for me which is nice.",
