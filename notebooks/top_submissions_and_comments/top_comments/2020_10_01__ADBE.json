        "body": "&gt;What do I mean by recovery stocks? Retail, commercial real estate, airlines, casinos, cruise lines, financials.\n\n**Retail**  \\- The smart retailers are **prevailing** during this. Target (+24%), Walmart (+20%), Dollar General (+35%), Home Depot (+30%), Lululemon (+42%), Dicks Sporting Goods (20%), Lowes (+42%). These retailers have all adapted to an omnichannel model where they sell both online and in-store. Technology has helped them become better retailers. These companies all have massive technology budgets (look at the contributions that Walmart or Target make to the tech community) and they are customers of many of the tech stocks.\n\n**Commercial Real Estate** is a mixed bag. There are commercial real estate offerings like distribution warehouses (e.g. STAG), which are flat for the year. COLD (Cold Storage) is up a tiny bit this year. I don't think that commercial real estate will disappear, but I think that the winners will be found on a case-by-case basis. Not all commercial real estate is equal. AMT and CCI are up (+6.5 / +20% respectively) and they have handled this brilliantly.\n\n**Airlines -** I've never found these to be great long-term investments as they're largely unpredictable on a YoY basis with lots of volatility and not a bunch of upside. They have a bunch of fixed costs that continue to persist even if no one is using their planes. You mentioned Alaska Airlines, which is a better performer than some of the others, but it's still been trending downward since 2017. While I don't like airlines for my own personal investments, I will note that the airlines are also heavy users of technology. Airlines are becoming vertically integrated across various channel partners in the tech space.\n\n**Casinos** . I am convinced that these will recover probably sooner than some of the other sectors. However, many of the casinos are retooling. Look at what MGM is doing; they're investing heavily into technology; apps, digital games, etc. These casinos will all be customers of tech companies.\n\n**Cruise Lines -** This would be the industry that I have the most doubts about. The target audience of cruise lines are typically older customers. Maybe they can target a new demographic so that they will survive in the future, but again, they have high fixed costs that aren't decreasing, so their survival depends on the number of customers they can get on their ships.\n\n**Financials** \\-  Much like the casinos, this industry will slowly be retooled. When I used to use a brick-and-mortar bank, my banker once said, \"The only people that come to banks are poor people. People like yourself are using digital banking tools and you have very little need for a physical bank\". He was right, as I haven't been to a physical bank in the past 3 years (except to get documents notarized). Banks are starting to recognize this, as they're facing sharp competition from tech first entities like Ally, Square and newcomer SoFi (currently is applying for a banking charter). The competition is going to get hotter as Square and other \"non-banks\" get banking licenses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Ok, but the stock prices of these recovery stocks won't return to normal for quite a while, right?**\n\nYour anti-tech sentiment is shining through on this. Understand that the industries that you want to recover are only going to recover with technology. No, this doesn't mean that they are all going to be customers of Peloton (though some high end hotels will be purchasing Pelotons for their gyms), but you better believe that they're going to be customers of Microsoft, ServiceNow, Apple, Adobe (marketing departments), Amazon, Google, etc. There's a lot of room for various players in technology. Many of these companies will have partial WFH policies long-term, so they're likely to stay subscribed to something like Zoom in some capacity. If not Zoom, then perhaps they're using Microsoft Teams or Cisco's Webex. The point is that they're still making tech investments. Microsoft is up 35% this year, tracking alongside many of the retail companies that I mentioned above.\n\nPeloton is a growth story. The pitch deck for the Peloton could have just been 1 slide with the word \"PANDEMIC!\". But, if you think Peloton is the growth story, then you should have been watching Nautilus (NLS) which is up 880% this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bottom line is that there are going to be winners and losers across all sectors. It's always been that way. I have no doubt that you will capture some upside in the companies that you're picking (e.g. Alaska Airlines), but on the same token, I don't think that you're going to see some massive shift away from technology companies. The Hang Seng Tech Index is actually outperforming the Nasdaq, so this isn't just a United States stock market thing, it's a global thing. Not all technology names will be winners in the long-run, but many of them will continue to press forward. What I am absolutely confident in is that all companies will continue to invest in technology in order to survive. Technology isn't something that is up for discussion anymore. The only question is, \"How big is our tech budget going to be this year?\" Those that refuse to adopt tech and improve their efficiencies through technology will go out of business. We're already seeing it with companies that have failed to move into the digital world.\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "For long term investment, time in market generally beats timing the market. ICLN gained $1.45 today, up 6.5% to close at something like $21.45. It could lose all of those gains tomorrow. But if you\u2019re planning to hold for 3-5 years (or longer) and the price goes to, say, $400, do you really think you\u2019ll be kicking yourself about losing out on $1.45? Probably not. Better to jump in now and add a set amount on a monthly basis than miss out on potential gains. \n\nETFs or Stonks? I buy both \u2018non-diversified\u2019 ETFs and pure-play stonks. The former are lower risk but also lower (potential) reward than the latter. I buy the pure play if I know the company, it has a good track record, wide moat, and is currently pushing the field. I go with ETFs to diversify within fields that I think will take off in the future, but where a pure play is a bit too risky or I don\u2019t know much about the field. The more I know about the industry, the more comfortable I am going pure play. \n\nI have about 10-15% of my portfolio on \u201cgreen revolution\u201d stuff like ICLN, QCLN, PBW, and TSLA. I think green energy and EVs are definitely going to be huge, but the big question is when. Batteries are a major hurdle for intermittent solar and wind, efficient and cheap purification/generation for hydrogen. Once those are solved (and batteries probably sooner than H2), this field will skyrocket. We could be in a dotcom-like bubble with these guys right now (is TSLA the next Yahoo?), but maybe not. Who knows. Time in market, diversify. \n\nI have another 10% or so in ARKs. ARKK is well comparatively diversified and pretty much consists of the Crown Jewels of all of the other ARKs. That said, ARKG has provided better returns. I\u2019m a biologist, and biotech is moving at an incredible pace. It\u2019s a much surer thing in the short (2-5yr) term than clean energy. I\u2019ve also bought a number of the stocks in the ARKG portfolio independently. TXG has been skyrocketing recently, and for good reason. They\u2019ve already had a huge impact on the field and show tremendous promise for future gains. They\u2019re basically a household name in my field, which is saying something for a company that went public just over a year ago. CRSP is another promising company. The founder just won the Nobel yesterday (up 16% today on the news), and CRSPR offers the potential to cure diseases, not just treat them. The people at ARK are really doing their research, and I have no problem piggy-backing on \u2018em. \n\nAnother field you might want to consider is semiconductors. AI, gaming, VR, data analysis/mining gaming, fintech, internet-of-things, you name it, the tech is based on computer chips. My bet is a lot of the processing that\u2019s currently done on a device is going to shift to the cloud as software demands begin to outpace hardware capabilities. That means server farms, which are simply massive numbers of GPUs, CPUs, SSDs, memory, etc. Company-wise, AMD, NVDA, TSM, and AMAT are all at the forefront, and their stocks have all killed in the last few months/years. SMH and SOXX are good semiconductor-focused ETFs. I have about 15% of my portfolio here. \n\nI also have some in COVID darling stuff like ZM, MRNA, BNTX that I got in on early and will probably be selling in the 3-6 months. Wouldn\u2019t suggest any of these at this point, especially given your goals here. \n\nThe rest is safer play blue-chip stuff like MSFT, APPL, TMO, ADBE, etc. - these guys all have massive war chests, which means they\u2019ll probably be expanding in the coming downturn, whereas other, more indebted companies will be contracting or going belly up.\n\nThat\u2019s my 10 cents. That\u2019ll be 10 cents...",

As long as you see big money \"value\" guys like Buffett buying into companies at 80x price to sales ratios, I think the lofty valuations will continue for some time......\n\nBasically what I'm saying is, seeing \"value investors\" buy into companies at a 80x p/s multiple means a new paradigm has emerged. You may disagree with it, you may vehemently object to it....\n\nBut I'm riding that wave.\n\nHow's that?",

Only reason is because their ceo/founder doesn\u2019t want to sell, but if he leaves then it\u2019ll be sold in a heartbeat. \n\nMark my works. Adobe or SAP will buy zen. Been saying it for years.

Some examples are CRM and ADBE at 96 and 60 PE respectively.  \n\n If ZM makes it to 30 PE, it will be because growth has all but stopped. \n\nBut anyway 180 PE is just for the 2021.  It's not unfeasible to think it'd be at 90 PE by 2022.  I feel they have a big opportunity to expand still.  Yes pandemic caused work from home, but zoom hasnt fully exploited that yet.  They can also convert free users to paid users over time.\n\nOr look at what AMD did with using their high share price to acquire a cash flow business.  ZM could too. \n\nNow I understand the arguement that maybe too much is priced in, but there is an arguement that not enough is priced in too.  \n\nAny case this guy wanted to bet his portfolio that ZM dropped more than 50% in 1.5 years during a time period it is expected to rapidly grow.
