[About.com](https://About.com)? Paper manufacturers? Golf Digest? Certainly seems like the better move was doubling down on their core business rather than try to take on Google with [About.com](https://About.com).\n\n&gt;They now pay 3-4x industry average for journalists which is...a positive?\n\nYes, because it means almost every reporter is going to want a job at NYT. And then NYT can hire only the best ones, which makes their product better, which attracts more subscribers, etc.\n\n&gt;\"Flipped their business model from ad-supported to subscription-first\" is less of a stroke of genius and more something that they have no choice in, per the trends you display in slide 8.\n\nSure, but Netflix gets lauded for pivoting to streaming from mailed DVDs; Microsoft for Azure/365 from Window; Adobe for subscription from single licenses; Nintendo from playing cards to video games. \n\nWhen the world changes, great businesses change too. So why is that a demerit for NYT? \n\n&gt;The bottom line is that the increase in readership and engagement with podcasts, crosswords, etc, etc is probably less a function of \"superior journalism\" and more a function of a) greater interest in politics due to the big personalities of late and b) greater amount of time that is spent on leisure due to COVID. Both of these factors are fleeting and extrapolating the next 5-10 years in hockey-stick fashion is just silly. I agree that money spent on the app and digitization is overall money well spent, but this serves more to remove friction than it does to reverse what is an undeniable trend in the way that people consume information.\n\nI don't buy the argument that NYT is a flash in the pan because things are particularly crazy *now,* and that once things \"go back to normal\" the business will suffer. \n\nThe world is *always* crazy, and we *always* live in unprecedented times.",

        "body": "&gt;QQQ - This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VXUS - Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I'm also going to include EFA and EEM. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. EFA is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and EEM is rated only 5.7/10. EEM appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. EFA appears to be more tilted toward the European market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VOO/SPY - VOO and SPY are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like QQQ, VTI, VTG, VOOG and SPYG.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IWF - This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than VOO/SPY, less volatile than QQQ.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IWM - for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are also some sector funds you may want to look at:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ICLN/TAN/FAN - These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ARK group of funds: ARKG, ARKF, ARKK ARKW, ARKQ, PRNT and IZRL. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ARKG - Genomic RevolutionARKF - FintechARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligencePRNT - 3D printing technologyIZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel  \n&gt;  \n&gt;XL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;XLV - Health CareXLK - TechnologyXLY - Consumer DiscretionaryXLF - FinancialXLU - Utilities  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I'm adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  WCLD, SKYY, CLOU, BUG and XIKT. Of these WCLD has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in WCLD include ZM, PLAN, CRM, CRWD, ZEN, WDAY, TENB, PCTY, DDOG, BL.  Many of these are likely to also appear in QQQ, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Read through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A nice portfolio might look something like this:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% - VXUS - International  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10% each in four sector funds of your choice  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hope this helps.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.\n\nSolid info, thank you, I'm cutting and pasting this into a doc for myself.",

Unity makes all their money from licensing to companies per workstation, selling game components/templates in their store, and providing cloud and version management services. Their market share is impressive, especially in mobile. However, i think theyre overpriced at the moment. They dont have that many revenue streams and are kind of considered silver to unreals gold (graphics have traditionally lagged behind). Larger AAA studios skip unity and unreal altogether to save a buck and build their own environments. So youre really investing in the steam indie game genre, which is alive and well and growing. But.... i dont think its as valuable as they say it is. I wouldnt say puts, but im waiting to buy in at a much lower price.\n\nMaybe one day itll be the next adobe, but not in the short term",

They'll do a lot of data cleaning since a lot of what they're bringing in is probably garbage, and they'll set up a repeatable process for loading, managing and monitoring what they've built.\n\n2) A data analysis GUI. Basically a combination of data visualization and predictive analysis that's been simplified for someone who doesn't code. So far this almost completely customized for specific use cases depending on customer.\n\nI see a couple problems:\n\n1) This is how they've worked their way into organizations so far, but it's also been completely duplicated by every major cloud service provider and legacy database provider. I see them having a hard time proving their value over the major players like AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle and SAP in this area.\n\n2) Once a company has chosen someone for step 1, they can now choose any analytics tool. I know Palantir has built a reputation as having some magic predictive power, but in reality, there are a limited number of algorithms that are useful for any given problem, and they're all going to be built in as options for any tool now that they pretty much just incorporate the best open source solution. I don't see them beating out Tableau, PowerBI, Adobe Sensei, Alteryx, Kibana, etc. in this space.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but they've had Foundry out for a few years now, and it has a few dozen customers. I would think if it were a clearly superior product, that would be much higher. It basically seems to only be useful for customers who are willing to pay for a completely customized interface, which I think will be a hard sell for most businesses.",

        "body": "If there is a vaccine, there will likely be a rotation out of the winners (some more than others) and into the losers. That said, this belief that everyone is going to take the vaccine is imo completely unrealistic and it would not surprise me if the announcement of a vaccine generates rebounds for impacted plays that are ultimately short-term when it becomes clear that there's still a ways to go post vaccine announcement.\n\nThe eagerness to be negative on tech/growth on here and obsess over impacted plays because they \"seem cheap\" has been the wrong way to go for a long time. All the things that this sub has tsk-tsked as \"too expensive\" did absolutely fantastic this year. The things that this sub has talked up as being \"cheap\" did not. \n\n\" I think, we can all imagine in max 1-2 years things to return to something resembling the old normal.\"\n\nThere's a lot of people on here who seem very eager to believe that things \"just gonna bounce back\" and looking around at the state of things, I'm not seeing the evidence to suggest that level of optimism at all. The longer this goes on and the more impact there is, I think the longer it's going to take for this to recover. If we all locked down for weeks and this was a few month thing and we were already on the other side of it, I'd feel differently. I don't think that things just go back to the way they were 100% and the longer this goes on, the more I think that.\n\n\"The price gets pumped even more with every positive earnings report\"\n\nYes. They have positive earnings reports. Adobe said it delivered the best Q3 in the company's history. Yeah, people are going to want to buy things that are doing well in this environment and that has been what has been stampeded into during this while this sub has threads about oil majors and airlines every day for months. You're seeing one tech company after another saying that years of growth has been pulled forward by this. People want things that benefit from the considerable demand for digital transformation that is being seen. Oil companies that did nothing for half a decade before this? Not so much.\n\n\"In that scenario, the inflated stock valuations don't make sense and they will likely fall hard.\"\n\nThere will be a rotation out of tech but acting as if tech is - going forward - something that people are not going to be even more reliant on is not something I agree with. The eagerness to dismiss growth on here for years has resulted in a lot of people missing out and if the next rotation is treated as prior rotations have on here by many (\"SEE? LOOK! BUBBLE!\") rather than as a buying opportunity, a lot of people are likely to continue to miss out in years ahead.\n\nFrom Dan Loeb's most recent Third Point letter, and I couldn't agree with it more:\n\n\"The world continues to evolve at an increasingly rapid rate. The behavioral and business changes that surged during the COVID-19 lockdown have, by now, been well-mapped: work (and exercise) from home, online retail, multiplayer gaming, video on demand, online payments, and an explosion in biotech research and drug development. COVID-19 has permanently accelerated fundamental shifts in how we interact with each other and how digital information is turned into value. These shifts were only possible due to an exponential increase in broadband capacity, cloud computing infrastructure, artificial intelligence, VOIP communications, rapid semiconductor innovation, cybersecurity hardening, and the collaborative technology and business tools to bring it all together. The evolution of this ecosystem now underpins almost every business we evaluate. As investors, we must ask ourselves if we wish to engage at the leading edge of this change or end up as roadkill on what was once quaintly called \u201cthe information superhighway.\u201d",

        "body": "&gt;There is no stimulus coming anytime soon (January at the minimum) \n\nA stimulus isn't relevant for the companies which have been outperforming since March. Consider Adobe's Q3 report: \u201c*Adobe delivered the best Q3 in our history in a challenging macroeconomic environment, demonstrating the global demand for our innovative solutions,\u201d said Shantanu Narayen, president and CEO, Adobe.*\n\nThe best Q3 in the history of Adobe Software Corporation. Adobe is a company that's been around for 30+ years and is *still* painting a growth picture. Many of these tech companies that you're concerned with are blowing their numbers out of the water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The second excuse or notion that the pandemic has accelerated our reliance on Tech and that this is the reason that these stocks have all 2-5xed in a matter months is also extremely laughable. I'm not saying that there hasn't been a permanent shift, there has been, but not to the degree that it justifies every tech stock doubling or tripling its market cap in just a few months.\n\nThere are many companies which are doing very well YTD that have nothing to do with technology. Technology is doing good, but so are other themes like clean energy, diabetic care, sports betting, insurance companies (Progressive is up about 35% YTD), medical devices (Thermo Fisher is up 40% YTD), ground transportation (Old Dominion is up over 40%, Fedex is up 60%), even some retailers (Home Depot, Target and Best Buy are all over 30% YTD), etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The third notion that Wall Street has now priced in a Biden victory and sees the large stimulus that is expected with a blue wave as overriding the negativity associated with tax hikes and more regulation is also ridiculous.\n\nYou're making many dangerous assumptions here. For one, we don't know how large the package will be. Biden wants to go big with his green initiatives, and Trump also wants to go big with his infrastructure spending next year. We have a baseline that is somewhere around a minimum of one trillion dollars, regardless of candidate. The tax hikes likely won't take effect until 2022 at a minimum, even if a \"blue wave\" occurs. There are other things that will likely be dropped in a Biden victory. For example, trade relations will change if Biden wins. The Trump administration is currently being sued by Tesla, Home Depot, Target and others due to the tariffs. These tariffs will likely be removed if Biden gets a win and the money that these companies have already paid will go back to them or count as some kind of credit against their taxes once resolved. There's too many assumptions baked into this though and we can't start reading too far into this until next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;touching any of these tech stocks could mean getting caught with your pants down as a 5-7% drop day is imminent for the NASDAQ as we once again approach 12,000\n\nSounds like a good day to buy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;the inflation you would suffer for holding cash just for a few months is not nearly as bad as the brutal gaping you'll suffer at the hands of Wall Street after buying a lot of these overvalued companies at current levels.\n\nIf you're investing money that you cannot afford to lose, then maybe. I would argue that you need to fix your financial situation if you're using money that you need immediately. Simply because a stock goes down does not mean that it's worthless. Your stocks still carry monetary value and you can easily access that value through your brokerage (either via a sale or by borrowing against your stocks)",

And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted.
