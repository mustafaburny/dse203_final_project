Not everyone has a ton of money to invest, and if they want to invest in VR but can't afford Facebook maybe they can get a couple of shares of Sony.

That means he will bleed google dry until there's no more value to be pumped out of it to the detriment of innovation and disruption. \n\nHis number one mission is stock price and you can see it. Literally on the the day it was decided that he'd take over the nature of the stock changed from a steady constant slow grower to a \"live by the earning calls\" swinging machine: https://i.imgur.com/XpnBcoV.png\n\nHe's a wall street man not a revolutionary. He's the guy the board brings in after the founders are out. A pure successor CEO. You can see this in the tech industry over and over again with disaters like Gil Amelio or successes like Larry Probst. \n\nThis is the typical [founder dilemma](https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma) that hit Google very late because they had an overly long growth phase. Eric Schmidt was smart enough to keep this alive even though he was a wall street man too by delegating all the tech to the founders. \n\nSo what does this mean? For me it means I'll keep trading Google stock by using classic indicators (money). There is no crash coming. It's just going to be a typical big tech company like IBM.",
