Then you have probably 20k from SSI benefits,  so 50k salary. Not bad. But how do you get a safe 10% yield? Well, you pick stocks very carefully. Try to get 5% from dividends, and 5% from price appreciation. \n\nHere are some of my picks:\nABBV\nM\nSKT\nCTL\nIRM\nNEE\nTXN\nIBM\nBX\nAPO\nBAM\nKHC\nAMGN\nTSM\nOTEX\nTER\nUL\nNVO\nTM\nMRK\nBMY\n\nnow that is a diversified folio! You should get 4-5% paid out in dividends,  and then be able to pull 4-5% off each year in gains. That'll get your 10% and then the money should last if the market holds up in the 2020s. If it goes down, just stay invested. Lower your purchases, live off social sec for 1 year. Like that.  Alright good luck peace",

How much do you have?\nMany baby boomers are in this situation. \nI'll give you the same advice I gave my dad.\n\n1) I advise to sell your house/downsize/move to cheaper area.\n2) sell your useless shit. Extra cars, boats,  etc..\n3) scrape all your cash together and invest it\n\nNow, lets say you have 300k, for example. You need about a 10% return to get a 30k income. Then you have probably 20k from SSI benefits,  so 50k salary. Not bad. But how do you get a safe 10% yield? Well, you pick stocks very carefully. Try to get 5% from dividends, and 5% from price appreciation. \n\nHere are some of my picks:\nABBV\nM\nSKT\nCTL\nIRM\nNEE\nTXN\nIBM\nBX\nAPO\nBAM\nKHC\nAMGN\nTSM\nOTEX\nTER\nUL\nNVO\nTM\nMRK\nBMY\n\nnow that is a diversified folio! You should get 4-5% paid out in dividends,  and then be able to pull 4-5% off each year in gains. That'll get your 10% and then the money should last if the market holds up in the 2020s. If it goes down, just stay invested. Lower your purchases, live off social sec for 1 year. Like that.  Alright good luck peace",
