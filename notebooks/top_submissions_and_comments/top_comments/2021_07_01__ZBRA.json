Shorting is too dangerous, and the puts will be far too expensive.\n\nInstead, sell out of the money call credit spreads, or, if you are willing to invest more capital in a purely directional move down, look at a bearish ZEBRA trade using puts (zero extrinsic back ratio). It involves buying two in the money 70 Delta puts, and selling one at the money 40 Delta put. Adjust the strikes and expirations so that you have roughly -100 Delta and as little extrinsic value as possible.",

I did the same with a 7/16 240P, but I\u2019m just letting that ride. \n\nThe 240P breakeven is 185 at expiry, but by selling puts against it along the way, the breakeven ends up more around 210 from the premium collected from day trading the short diagonal put. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about running a ZEBRA (zero extrinsic back ratio) next time it rallies really hard. That is buying two -\n70 delta puts and selling a -50 delta put in the cycle, 60 days out.
