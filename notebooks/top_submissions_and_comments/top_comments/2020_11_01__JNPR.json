If you look at Big Commerce's or Lemonade's financials, they aren't great.  And some of the SPAC mergers are pretty suspect especially when compared to how much they run up around merger time.  \n\nI agree that there was more vaporware back in the late 90s, BUT, the fervor, the blind investing into companies without knowing anything about their financials, the double or triple digit gains within a single year.... remind you of any recent times?",

        "body": "To add on: selling covered calls is a pretty easy way to make some extra money on non-meme stocks.\n\nBasically, you're selling your shares at strike+premium, e.g. if you sell a $10 call for 1.5, you're basically selling your shares for $11.50 each. You're solidly in the green as long as the share price stays below strike+premium. If it looks like it is going to blow past your strike, and you want to hold the shares, you can usually roll to a higher strike for a net credit by adding some time. Collecting the premium also gives you some downside protection if the stock starts to drop.\n\nA basic strategy that is very popular among wealthier people is to own shares and sell monthly/quarterly strangles. E.g. own 10k $MSFT shares and sell 100 calls at +15% and 100 puts at -15% each month. Basically, getting paid to buy the dip and renting out your shares for cash.\n\nYou can easily get 10-20% monthly returns holding shares on stable companies this way, but you'll sometimes miss out on the massive rallies, so it's not suited for anyone in this sub. You'll also get screwed in the event of a covid-type crash if you've done this on margin, but if you're holding shares, you'd be screwed short-term anyway.",

        "body": "What kind of price-to-sales multiple will GME have in the next 2 years? Currently at 0.13\n\nIf GME successfully grows their e-commerce business to \\~50% with same day delivery (currently being rolled out now), the products they sell could reasonably provide a 1x sales multiple. (Compare other e-commerce P/S - OSTK 1.2   CHWY 4.2)\n\n4 new revenue streams for GME will include: Monetization of customer data, digital downstream revenue from MSFT Xbox platform, online advertising revenue, and PC hardware sales. All 4 offer good margins.\n\nAll of these new revenue streams and e-commerce growth represents a very big change (almost 'tech' like) than that of the former business model of purely B&amp;M with mostly just gaming product inventory. The real big money to influence a major share price rise is in the customer data. If leveraged properly, GME has a true 'tech' side to their business model.\n\nGME looks to grow revenue YoY, estimating 6-7bn for 2021, and 8bn+ in 2022 with a P/S of 1, we are looking at a 8bn market cap in 2022. Share price of $120+\n\nYou could compare with BestBuy, which has a P/S of 0.8. Give GME the 0.8 P/S and they reach a market cap of 6.4bn (assuming 8bn yearly revenue in 2022). That's $99/share and an 800% increase from current market value.\n\nMost investors are not aware of what the company has to offer, hence why the reference Blockbuster so much. There is a reason we have seen larger stakes being taken by bigger players. Just last week we saw some more big boys jumping in. Wells Fargo, Jefferies, Hussman all taking positions. When GME shorts flip to longs (will happen eventually) they will drive up the share price.\n\nIn the next 2 years, if the street decides to view GME as a e-commerce/digital data business within the gaming/PC industry, valuations can run high and P/S multiples could run even higher.",

Why nobody mentions this is beyond me, arguably one of the most important high margin revenue streams GME can benefit from.\n\n**E-Commerce omnichannel business model** that offers same day delivery and is continually improving. This is the \"beat AMZN' part of the business model.\n\n**PC hardware sales** ($40bn/yr and growing TAM)\n\n**Online ad revenue.** From website + App\n\n**E-sports experiences**. Currently partnering with gaming pros and streaming on twitch. Will **build brand recognition**.\n\nMassive **reduction in SG&amp;A.**\n\n**SKU optimization**. Better inventory and inventory turnover.\n\n'Digital everything' is not as strong of a bear thesis as it was 2 years ago. Especially considering GME has the MSFT partnership to share digital revenue.\n\nGaming industry TAM is growing YoY.\n\nCompetent management team. Finally.\n\nBigger firms/institutions are taking a position in GME. So far as of end of Q3 we have had new or increased stakes from: Senvent, State Street, Russell, Wells Fargo, Hussman and finally Jefferies taking an sizeable position in Call options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a $700MM company. This is not the old GME where you simply buy and trade in videogames. It is very undervalued at current market price of $11\n\nI think GME has potential to be valued at $2-3bn valuation within 12 months ($32-47)\n\nWhen it finally appreciates in value after a few good quarterly earnings then there should be a slow squeeze. You have to be patient with this play. It will most likely take 6+ months until we see good Q4 and Q1 earnings to convince shorts to capitulate.",

Facebook (the site) itself has been viewed quite negatively by the younger generation, and it might go the way of MySpace, if there\u2019s a newer and cooler social media platform in town. Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest is a success and can be big for them, but the VR market is still very niche. \n\nAmazon has a ton of upsides, especially during and even after COVID, where everything will move towards online, everyone already knew. Despite how big Amazon is, eCommerce is still only 16% of retail sale, so there\u2019s still room. Cloud is booming, and AWS is still king.\n\nI am the most bullish on MSFT. They have a good mix of the old stuff that have been steadily making them money for decades and are still here to stay (Windows, Office/365, .NET, SQL, Xbox) and the cool new stuff that has a lot of growth potential (Azure/Cloud, Surface, GamePass, Teams). On top of that, their recent acquisitions have been doing a lot better than the failed ones in the past. I think MSFT is very solid, and they are one killer product away from taking over Apple as the #1 company in term of market cap, again.",

Normally this would be their worst earnings of the console cycle, but the last one had forced store closures.  I'm thinking we see better numbers this quarter. And better than worst will be a surprise.\n\nThat said, I've been saying for months that I expect the stock to drop on EPS posting for Decembers ER, but I expect a huge rally during the call.  They will absolutely talk about console presales and interest.  That itself is pretty bullish.  They're sold out of preorders and will continue to be even after the next batch drops.\n\nThis will also be a great time to talk about other activities.  Is Cohen taking an active roll in the turnaround?  He is still invested, so this is still very feasible, and an official announcement that he is actively involved would be good for at least +2-3 bucks tacked onto the stock price.\n\nTalking about continued increase in website sales and how people are responding to the massive improvements is also a likely topic.  If they don't bring up the MSFT deal, there will absolutely be questions from investors about it.  If they start forward guidance again, we could see crazy movement on that as well.\n\n\nFinally, and rather amusingly, a lack of console supply is actually bullish for GME.  People start selling used consoles to gamestop starting the day they release.  Why?  I can't fathom a legitimate reason for this, but it happens.  Super demand and no supply means people will pay new console prices for used consoles.  There will be a massive profit margin on these for gamestop, and even better, when the console is an XBox, that console starts generating passive revenue for them as well.",

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

This year it hasn't that much. People are timid, but I largely think that is overplayed. Many companies reported great numbers for Q3. Whether the election is contested, biden wins, or trump wins, it doesn't really matter. The private sector is marching on. Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if people riot. Stimulus will pass whether its biden or trump. Even so, we know we have until next year to sort it all out. Im keeping some cash for buying opportunities, but I'm largely bullish.

As I\u2019m starting off with a weak source of money i\u2019d prefer a safer strategy, for now. I managed to get hold of 0.02 ETH and a share of SDC.\n\nI have recently picked up an interest in investing and am thinking about starting in the coming days, on trading 212. Ive selected the FAANG companies, Microsoft, Tesla, Shopify, Salesforce, Nvidia, Adobe and Vanguard emerging markets etf. I\u2019m not sure about the percentages.\n\nis this a good pie and what percentages should i use?",

But they're also spending a hell of a lot of money to get all this other crap done. I have January calls it'll probably expire worthless. I've come to accept that unless Microsoft or the government or somebody buys a company which unfortunately is not for sale. But then again everything has its price. Including me because I've been giving $5 blow jobs behind the Wendy's dumpster near my house just to make ends meet.\nI've already lost my half my portfolio which is about $80,000 thank you AMD for moving your earnings date without telling anyone and buying xilinx. And now dunkin' donuts is going private and I knew about it and I didn't buy any calls or puts or any goddamn thing.\nThe only advice I can give you is stay out of this for a while or buy leaps for 2022. Nokia doesn't move enough to day trade you're better off investing in Erickson or Comcast or T-Mobile. Even Qualcomm I stay away from AT&amp;T though period well good luck with your investment you can always buy Tesla. I just bought Amazon and the price went down even though earnings were through the roof. The stock market is just not stable right now it's almost as if Trump is running that also as well as the country period both are in very sad state. Put your money in the bank and leave it there for a while you're better off period again this is only my opinion or is everyone says the mad ravings of a madman Good luck Chuck. Cheers",

Had Jobs taken a more pragmatic approach in the beginning, Apple might have gotten decent market share in the computer business.  Regardless of Apple's current market capitalization, they have less than 8% market share of the computer industry despite being one of it's pioneers.  Sad.",

Casting a wide net can get some misses, but there's plenty of reason to expect upside north of 50% or more on a good number as well. Hard to make that case for MSFT or AMD. \n\nI'm between 75% and 250% on several of my bargain plays of April and May. There are still plenty of options out there that haven't begun to claim their recovery gains, but we can expect that in the meantime, big tech won't see a future six months anything like what it saw the past six months. \n\nI'm investing longer term as well, but I like to keep some fluidity for shorter term trading as well, since I'm already maxing out my and my wife's RIRAs and still maintaining sizable pragmatic choices in my brokerage. \n\nBut you're right on a horizon of a year or more, the longterm value and relatively low risk with the tech giants and chip makers will beat many value plays, and the FOMO factor is relatively small given the ceiling and the uncertainty between now and then, which means that even if the liquidity I added this afternoon pays off better elsewhere, it's certainly a defensible position to stand pat and take the lower drama.",

Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth.

As I\u2019m starting off with a weak source of money i\u2019d prefer a safer strategy, for now. I managed to get hold of 0.02 ETH and a share of SDC.\n\nI have recently picked up an interest in investing and am thinking about starting in the coming days, on trading 212. Ive selected the FAANG companies, Microsoft, Tesla, Shopify, Salesforce, Nvidia, Adobe and Vanguard emerging markets etf. I\u2019m not sure about the percentages.\n\nis this a good pie and what percentages should i use?",

But they're also spending a hell of a lot of money to get all this other crap done. I have January calls it'll probably expire worthless. I've come to accept that unless Microsoft or the government or somebody buys a company which unfortunately is not for sale. But then again everything has its price. Including me because I've been giving $5 blow jobs behind the Wendy's dumpster near my house just to make ends meet.\nI've already lost my half my portfolio which is about $80,000 thank you AMD for moving your earnings date without telling anyone and buying xilinx. And now dunkin' donuts is going private and I knew about it and I didn't buy any calls or puts or any goddamn thing.\nThe only advice I can give you is stay out of this for a while or buy leaps for 2022. Nokia doesn't move enough to day trade you're better off investing in Erickson or Comcast or T-Mobile. Even Qualcomm I stay away from AT&amp;T though period well good luck with your investment you can always buy Tesla. I just bought Amazon and the price went down even though earnings were through the roof. The stock market is just not stable right now it's almost as if Trump is running that also as well as the country period both are in very sad state. Put your money in the bank and leave it there for a while you're better off period again this is only my opinion or is everyone says the mad ravings of a madman Good luck Chuck. Cheers",

Hard to make that case for MSFT or AMD. \n\nI'm between 75% and 250% on several of my bargain plays of April and May. There are still plenty of options out there that haven't begun to claim their recovery gains, but we can expect that in the meantime, big tech won't see a future six months anything like what it saw the past six months. \n\nI'm investing longer term as well, but I like to keep some fluidity for shorter term trading as well, since I'm already maxing out my and my wife's RIRAs and still maintaining sizable pragmatic choices in my brokerage. \n\nBut you're right on a horizon of a year or more, the longterm value and relatively low risk with the tech giants and chip makers will beat many value plays, and the FOMO factor is relatively small given the ceiling and the uncertainty between now and then, which means that even if the liquidity I added this afternoon pays off better elsewhere, it's certainly a defensible position to stand pat and take the lower drama.",

Before I list out the portfolio I am considering, please see my answers to the relevant information questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How old are you? **23**\n* Are you employed/making income? How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

It's very rare companies are straight up broken up, even Microsoft avoided that in 2000 when they controlled 97% of the PC market.",
