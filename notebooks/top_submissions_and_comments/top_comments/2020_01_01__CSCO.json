It\u2019s about saving early and often. Your investments should have a good track record and have a reasonable expectation of relatively consistent growth. You shouldn\u2019t be buying just because someone or the internet told you. Most importantly, the early and often investments need to be done over long periods of time. \n\nThere\u2019s no magic sauce to being a millionaire. It just takes a lot longer than what most people want to accept or if you want to do it faster, more risk than most people are willing to take on. If you want to double your money in a year you have to be prepared for it to be down 50% some amount of the time before then.  \n\nCSCO is not a contrarian story to this reasoning. The only reasons it was pushed to its levels in the late 90s were hype and irrationality not the above investment principles. \n\nSave your money, invest when you can, and buy good solid companies over 30 years and you will be a multimillionaire.",

If coughing it up without any of the $2200 to help is not a problem, OK.  But it would be prudent to take that $300 and put it aside in a savings account so you know you will have it next year.   I will give you an extreme example from exactly 20 years ago.   A Cisco employee has stock option restrictiions come off in early 2000.   Exercises a boat load of options at $75/share.    The boatload was enough to get him to the 39.1% Federal Tax bracket with California state tax another 9% or so.  Doesn't file estimated taxes as he should (isos not nqsos so no withholding necessary) and leaves the money invested in CSCO.   Come early 2001 he has to pony up for his roughly 50% tax on the boatload.  Unfortunately the CSCO stock was at $16/share, so he couldn't afford to pay the tax.   Sad story.    With $2200 earned, and around $300 owed you won't have that problem but you get the idea.",

I haven't back-tested this portfolio but I imagine it would have crushed it.  This strategy;  realization of brand value should not be overlooked and will probably never become outdated.  I'm also weirdly excited by Elon Musk and love SpaceX.  If I was a millionaire I'd probably buy a Tesla, because fuck it. That's 7. This strategy would have more than likely done well.

They are currently forced to provide a status update in accordance with its obligations under the alternative information guidelines set out in National Policy 12-203 \u2013 Management Cease Trade Orders (\"NP 12-203\"), which require the Company to provide bi-weekly updates until such time as the Company is current with its filing obligations under Canadian securities laws.\n\nACB is the #2 biggest cannabis company in the world. With operations in 25 countries. The biggest medical cannabis supplier in Canada. Has over 20% of the Canadian market overall. Was the first LP to have edibles available to the market on December 18th and are continual selling out of product, faster than it hits the shelves. Yup, they have debt, much like every other cannabis company. They have a potential large amount of goodwill that might be written down, maybe, at some point in the future, depending on the performance of their acquisitions over the next few years. I'm betting the accounting department does some financial gymnastics here and finds a optimistic outcome. Then comes the share dilution. Aurora bought a bunch of companies using dilution of over 1 billion shares... That's a lot of shares. Whenever a company issues shares at a price higher than the shares' intrinsic value -- whether it does so to buy another company or to sell the shares and raise cash on the market -- an outside shareholder benefits, despite his or her percentage of ownership being diluted. This is exactly what Aurora did. Aurora was over valued for quite a long time and they took advantage of that situation by throwing the weight of their stock around. During the 90s pretty much every acquisition you saw by Microsoft or Cisco was paid for in richy valued stock. None of this points to them soon going out of business very soon.",

The burst of the bubble, known as the dot-com crash, lasted from March 11, 2000, to October 9, 2002. During the crash, many online shopping companies, such as Pets.com, Webvan, and Boo.com, as well as communication companies, such as Worldcom, NorthPoint Communications and Global Crossing, failed and shut down. Others, such as Cisco, whose stock declined by 86%, and Qualcomm, lost a big portion of their market capitalization but survived, and some companies, such as eBay and Amazon.com, lost value but recovered quickly.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",
