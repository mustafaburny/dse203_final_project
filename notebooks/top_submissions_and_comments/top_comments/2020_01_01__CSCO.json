There really won't be anything conventionally available that is faster. Parents work at VZ as regional network directors and have now been a part of the initial building and implementation of 4G and now 5G on the routing side. Shits getting intense with new 5G technology allowing phones to be able to edge-route information transferring instead of all being rerouted back to regional switches. The companies pushing the edge-routing are going to be the stocks to watch (Ericsson, Nokia, Cisco)\n\nAlso AI companies are going to be extremely useful in 5G implementation as well.",

You keep the original credit and the new position pays a credit. The new position closes out the old, so if you are taking in a credit, you made money instead of lose money like what happens rolling and buying.\n\nEDIT: If you are using RH, they don't have rolling built it. You will have to do it manually with a calculator.. Close one and open the other. Other brokers offer rolling so calculations are done by the platform and they don't charge commission. At least TDA/TOS doesn't charge commission on rolled trades. Also, TDA doesn't count a rolled position as a day trade if the original order and the rolled order were placed in the same day as long as it is rolled to the next contract at the same strike prices. Because RH doesn't offer rolling, I'm pretty sure it would be charged as a day trade under the same circumstances.",

It\u2019s about saving early and often. Your investments should have a good track record and have a reasonable expectation of relatively consistent growth. You shouldn\u2019t be buying just because someone or the internet told you. Most importantly, the early and often investments need to be done over long periods of time. \n\nThere\u2019s no magic sauce to being a millionaire. It just takes a lot longer than what most people want to accept or if you want to do it faster, more risk than most people are willing to take on. If you want to double your money in a year you have to be prepared for it to be down 50% some amount of the time before then.  \n\nCSCO is not a contrarian story to this reasoning. The only reasons it was pushed to its levels in the late 90s were hype and irrationality not the above investment principles. \n\nSave your money, invest when you can, and buy good solid companies over 30 years and you will be a multimillionaire.",

Jim O'Neill, founder of the IBD, once told a very amusing story from the past: \n\n&gt;In 1961, one of my clients barged into my office and loudly claimed that he would sell Xerox short because it was trading at more than 100 times earnings. I didn't know what happened to him later, but I hope he covered because Xerox went up another 1100% by 1968.\n\nFrom time to time, there are always these outstanding enterprises and disrupters appearing on the scene. You might not be convinced to buy them yourself (for example I can never get into Netflix), but don't be the patsy selling them short.",

If coughing it up without any of the $2200 to help is not a problem, OK.  But it would be prudent to take that $300 and put it aside in a savings account so you know you will have it next year.   I will give you an extreme example from exactly 20 years ago.   A Cisco employee has stock option restrictiions come off in early 2000.   Exercises a boat load of options at $75/share.    The boatload was enough to get him to the 39.1% Federal Tax bracket with California state tax another 9% or so.  Doesn't file estimated taxes as he should (isos not nqsos so no withholding necessary) and leaves the money invested in CSCO.   Come early 2001 he has to pony up for his roughly 50% tax on the boatload.  Unfortunately the CSCO stock was at $16/share, so he couldn't afford to pay the tax.   Sad story.    With $2200 earned, and around $300 owed you won't have that problem but you get the idea.",

For me I use Microsoft Outlook, that's 1, before that our company used Gmail, that's 2, we're also a CISCO vendor, that's 3, I used to drink Coca Cola, that's 4. I used to shop at Walmart (not in the US anymore), that's 5.  I have an iPhone and bought the original iPod (even as a Microsoft die-hard), that's 6.  I haven't back-tested this portfolio but I imagine it would have crushed it.  This strategy;  realization of brand value should not be overlooked and will probably never become outdated.  I'm also weirdly excited by Elon Musk and love SpaceX.  If I was a millionaire I'd probably buy a Tesla, because fuck it. That's 7. This strategy would have more than likely done well.

They are currently forced to provide a status update in accordance with its obligations under the alternative information guidelines set out in National Policy 12-203 \u2013 Management Cease Trade Orders (\"NP 12-203\"), which require the Company to provide bi-weekly updates until such time as the Company is current with its filing obligations under Canadian securities laws.\n\nACB is the #2 biggest cannabis company in the world. With operations in 25 countries. The biggest medical cannabis supplier in Canada. Has over 20% of the Canadian market overall. Was the first LP to have edibles available to the market on December 18th and are continual selling out of product, faster than it hits the shelves. Yup, they have debt, much like every other cannabis company. They have a potential large amount of goodwill that might be written down, maybe, at some point in the future, depending on the performance of their acquisitions over the next few years. I'm betting the accounting department does some financial gymnastics here and finds a optimistic outcome. Then comes the share dilution. Aurora bought a bunch of companies using dilution of over 1 billion shares... That's a lot of shares. Whenever a company issues shares at a price higher than the shares' intrinsic value -- whether it does so to buy another company or to sell the shares and raise cash on the market -- an outside shareholder benefits, despite his or her percentage of ownership being diluted. This is exactly what Aurora did. Aurora was over valued for quite a long time and they took advantage of that situation by throwing the weight of their stock around. During the 90s pretty much every acquisition you saw by Microsoft or Cisco was paid for in richy valued stock. None of this points to them soon going out of business very soon.",

Fortify deployed nearly everywhere. And Nessus as a DoD requirement, again, deployed nearly everywhere. McAfee for endpoint. In my experience, these companies are the dominant players in this space and a lot of the newer names are still vying to be the future replacements for much of this older tech.
