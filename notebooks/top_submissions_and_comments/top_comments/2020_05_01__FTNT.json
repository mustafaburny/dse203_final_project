Identity access and authentication management + 2FA, workforce management, and endpoint detection and response for the remote endpoint. For the private network, network detection and response (likely through an mssp), and edge firewalls. Microsegmentation and microservices for the data center / servers, and... For the most part that's good.\n\nAnd as far as the push to edge computing is concerned, if we're still making terminals then it's probably marginal to just build the rest of the computer out and just do it how we have been. Then for any intensive applications use the compute resources on the private network like a render farm.\n\nAs far as who wins the VM play. VMware is expensive. 99% of IT departments don't have even half of what I just outlined above. And there's some really great alternatives that are better in many ways and much more affordable. Big switch networks(now Arista) for cloud fabrics / networking / public-hybrid cloud, Red Hat (now IBM) for open source virtualization, open stack, Fortinet for security, etc. etc \n\nI like VMware, but I just don't see them winning the cloud wars. In my opinion, it's going to be open source providers and enablers like Arista that will win, but even then there's a lot of traditional competitors that could run with it like Cisco, Nokia, Juniper, etc.\n\nBut they did have Velocloud which sold like gangbusters. Although, sdwan is going to move more towards the whitebox virtualized services route.",

If I absolutely had to pick, I'd go with NET, FTNT and MSFT (not a true cybersecurity stock but I can see them expanding their role in the sector).\n\nI think the smartest (and safest) move would be to go with an ETF over individual stocks, it cuts down on the risk and ensures you have exposure to the companies that do well.",

Their product is a heavy hitter in their industry while fortinet is pretty budget compared to their big competitors. Additionally, onpremise hardware is getting less and less popular. Lastly, nobody ever got fired for buying Cisco. This is something we say in the networking industry, and for good reason. Cisco is expensive as hell but we all know how to use it and it works great. You won't find people raving the same way about fortinet, and if you do, I would question their experience and size of deployment. \n\nI held NET at IPO and sold for a small gain to roll into MSFT. I would be happy to own it again in the 20s. Glad to see it doing well. They are a great company in my opinion.",
