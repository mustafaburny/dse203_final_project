This leads me to #3.\n\n3. Watch your positions prior to market opening. I was able to exit AMC with profit bc I sold within first 30min of market opening. It has not hit $6 again since the rumor.\n\nCurrently standings: \n\nStarting stack: $1,000\n\nP/L: +80%\n\nStocks: PENN, CCL, AMC, M\n\n\nEdit: starting with $1,000 limited the quality of option traded.
