        "body": "Some background:\n\nMAXR is a company who specializes in delivering commercial overhead satellite imagery. They are considered to be an industry leader in this field. Multiple government agencies within the US Intelligence Community and the DOD have contracts with MAXR to deliver imagery. They had a change in leadership in 2019 after a rather nasty short report exposed some serious issues within the company, and the loss of their Worldview-4 satellite didn't help matters either. \n\nA few reasons to be bullish:\n\nThe CEO Daniel Jablonski - Since the new CEO took over in Jan 2019, the stock has gained more than 400%. The company was in massive debt, an issue which became his number one priority to fix. The leverage ratio is much improved since when he took over. Seeing as most of MAXR's clientele are government agencies, it's fitting that he has experience as a former naval officer. He knows his customer base, as does his board of directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors - Multiple members each with decades of experience within the US Government, DOD, IC etc. In particular, Gilman Louie was the founder of IN-Q-Tel, the first venture capital firm for the CIA. We recently added him to the BOD after the acquisition of Vricon, which will allow us to augment our imagery with 3D mapping capabilities.\n\nThe Upcoming Launch of Worldview Legion, a new satellite constellation - A better, more cost effective upgrade to the Worldview-3 satellite is going to allow for higher quality imagery to be captured much more often. Our current backlog is worth around $2.2 billion according to the most recent earnings report, and you can bet this number will significantly increase once Legion is in orbit - expected around Sep 2021. More details at [https://www.maxar.com/splash/it-takes-a-legion](https://www.maxar.com/splash/it-takes-a-legion) . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI advise you to do some digging and see for yourself! I seriously believe this is still a significantly undervalued company. Hope this helps! Now go get those tendies!",

Shouldnt any deposits already be after-tax from my salary?\n\nPost-tax means it come from your after-tax income. Roth doesn't get taxed at withdrawal because those are the rules established for Roth IRAs.\n\n&gt; Also, if i make an LLC as the single owner and employee, with matching 401k contribution to the LLC, does that mean the LLC gets taxed 15% on withdrawal unlike ordinary tax brackets that a traditional IRA would get taxed at age 60? Does the LLC have to be open until the owner is 60? All of this is legal just intensively complicated. Someone please elaborate. Thank you thank you.\n\nThe sponsor of the 401k would be your company (LLC). the Owner of the account would be you. You would pay the taxes like a traditional IRA. You can contribute to the 401K so long as the company (llc) exists/generates income/pays a salary.\n\nOnce the LLC goes away, you wouldn't have a paycheck, so no pre-tax or matching could happen.",

        "body": "Some background:\n\nMAXR is a company who specializes in delivering commercial overhead satellite imagery. They are considered to be an industry leader in this field. Multiple government agencies within the US Intelligence Community and the DOD have contracts with MAXR to deliver imagery. They had a change in leadership in 2019 after a rather nasty short report exposed some serious issues within the company, and the loss of their Worldview-4 satellite didn't help matters either. \n\nA few reasons to be bullish:\n\nThe CEO Daniel Jablonski - Since the new CEO took over in Jan 2019, the stock has gained more than 400%. The company was in massive debt, an issue which became his number one priority to fix. The leverage ratio is much improved since when he took over. Seeing as most of MAXR's clientele are government agencies, it's fitting that he has experience as a former naval officer. He knows his customer base, as does his board of directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors - Multiple members each with decades of experience within the US Government, DOD, IC etc. In particular, Gilman Louie was the founder of IN-Q-Tel, the first venture capital firm for the CIA. We recently added him to the BOD after the acquisition of Vricon, which will allow us to augment our imagery with 3D mapping capabilities.\n\nThe Upcoming Launch of Worldview Legion, a new satellite constellation - A better, more cost effective upgrade to the Worldview-3 satellite is going to allow for higher quality imagery to be captured much more often. Our current backlog is worth around $2.2 billion according to the most recent earnings report, and you can bet this number will significantly increase once Legion is in orbit - expected around Sep 2021. More details at [https://www.maxar.com/splash/it-takes-a-legion](https://www.maxar.com/splash/it-takes-a-legion) . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI advise you to do some digging and see for yourself! I seriously believe this is still a significantly undervalued company. Hope this helps! Now go get those tendies!",
