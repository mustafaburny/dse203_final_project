        "body": "Materials sector will get decimated once supply glut hits.\n\nRight now commodities prices are at ATH because of massive undersupply. However supply is getting built out at a crazy rate and the demand spike for a lot of these goods is likely temporary.\nThis isn't new or unusual, commodities super-cycles are they are known are fairly frequent phenomena. Some people get very rich on the way up, some people get left with some very heavy bags and a few people get very rich on the way down.\n\nCorrection in commodities pricing will be violent and brutal. Similar to the bond market commodities are traded using highly levered products called futures so when the crash starts happening (it already has) it will go down very fast.\n\nThe other bubble which is probably a year or 2 out from peaking is semiconductor stocks. For now supply is constrained but fabs are being built out massively on a scale never seen before. Again this isn't new, semis have a boom/bust cycle like commodities. It's just this one is much bigger and will take longer to play out.\n\nUnlike commodities, bonds or crypto this one will take a lot longer to deflate. I expect NVDA, AMAT and ASML to be hit the hardest by this. NVDA is going to get a double whammy from their 30XX series lining up with the top of the boom and crypto cycle exploding likely dumping tons of cheap 2nd hand hardware on the market.",

Nobody shops around to see if a competitor is $1.50/mo cheaper. OSK and URI are great ways to play the construction/improvement trend and rental equipment costs get passed on pretty easily. AMAT and ASML are both serving a high demand industry and as such they have strong pricing power.

Chasing often results in buying high and selling low.  \nLook for solid companies with a sound business and plenty of future growth.  Learn to always check p/e and p/s ratios before buying.  See what the stock traded prior to covid, did they launch something new or improve their business during covid?  If not, why would the company be worth more now than it was pre-covid?  Always have a hold philosophy before buying (is it 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years before you think you may want to sell it?)  \nNow is a great time to start buying some of the big tech and some of the other moderate p/e tech companies that will be long-term (3+ year) winners like AMD, SKWS, TSM, LRCX, AMAT.  This does not mean go all in on them but rather start buying with a plan.  Look at the solar and green-tech companies, if you find something with a p/e below ~40, research it maybe buy a few share and keep it on the radar.  Now is a great time to start buying small positions in longterm winners that have been beaten up.  This however, is not a time I could recommend looking at too many things that are still unproven.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't look at small positions in things like weed, on-line betting, eV, big data, just keep those risks as a small part of your portfolio.",

First I need Mickey Mouse to make a lot of money, so much money he actually wants to build a new theme park. Since things that big can be only bought in China, DIS buys them from BABA. Then the new park a huge success and people buy TSLAs and GMs to go to there (bc its the bomb). This triggers a rise in semiconductor demand, meaning AMAT soars and people also need energy for the EVs, so FSLR increases value. Easy peasy!",

        "body": "Hi all,\n\nI'm (37) European with a fairly stable income decided to start investing at the end of January. I decided to allocate around 10% of my monthly income with the main objective of building up a pension fund. I don't have big debts besides the mortgage which takes around 15% of my monthly income.\nAs I don't have to pay taxes in capital gains (up to 100k and from there only 4%) decided to start with mostly stocks. I don't plan tu touch the investment unless an urgency happens as I can pay all the other things with the monthly income.\nI can tolerate some risk but want to play something with the right risk/reward balance.\nAt the moment I don't have anything else, besides the house I'm paying mortgage for.\nMy main problem is that my experience with the stock market is not going as supposed. I mostly only invested in companies that I know because of my job and believe in (biggest positions are in Semiconductor: ASML, Micron, NVIDIA, AMAT; Renewable: Enphase, sunrun; EV: Tesla; e-commerce: Amazon, SE Ltd; Health: TMO, Teladoc and Fintech: eToro SPAC. (Biggest positions are Enphase, Amazon, TMO and Nvidia). However, since I joined, I \"lost\" around 25%.\n\nI know it was a bad moment to start investing and likely the market will continue a bull run that will make me recover the lost. But I start wondering if the stock market is the right place to invest or should I try something else or some other strategy (i.e. instead of investing monthly, accumulate funds for when I see a crash/big correction).\n\nThank you for your help!",

TSMC has stated that prices will go up for new orders, but they are still working through the backlog that has been under contract for some time, and the new pricing won't take effect yet. This, plus the threat of China, is what's keeping the $TSM price depressed right now. Beyond that, they have nothing but tailwinds from a business perspective for the next several years. \n\nLook for the semicaps ($AMAT, $ASML, $TER, $LRCX, $KLAC, et al) if you want plays that will see action first from the TSMC, Intel and Samsung capex spending.

        "body": "Materials sector will get decimated once supply glut hits.\n\nRight now commodities prices are at ATH because of massive undersupply. However supply is getting built out at a crazy rate and the demand spike for a lot of these goods is likely temporary.\nThis isn't new or unusual, commodities super-cycles are they are known are fairly frequent phenomena. Some people get very rich on the way up, some people get left with some very heavy bags and a few people get very rich on the way down.\n\nCorrection in commodities pricing will be violent and brutal. Similar to the bond market commodities are traded using highly levered products called futures so when the crash starts happening (it already has) it will go down very fast.\n\nThe other bubble which is probably a year or 2 out from peaking is semiconductor stocks. For now supply is constrained but fabs are being built out massively on a scale never seen before. Again this isn't new, semis have a boom/bust cycle like commodities. It's just this one is much bigger and will take longer to play out.\n\nUnlike commodities, bonds or crypto this one will take a lot longer to deflate. I expect NVDA, AMAT and ASML to be hit the hardest by this. NVDA is going to get a double whammy from their 30XX series lining up with the top of the boom and crypto cycle exploding likely dumping tons of cheap 2nd hand hardware on the market.",

Nobody shops around to see if a competitor is $1.50/mo cheaper. OSK and URI are great ways to play the construction/improvement trend and rental equipment costs get passed on pretty easily. AMAT and ASML are both serving a high demand industry and as such they have strong pricing power. Probably two dozen other names that fit easily into this (very simplified) strategy.\n\n*Disclosure: This is not a solicitation to buy or sell any security. Do your own damn homework you lazy ass*.",

Chasing often results in buying high and selling low.  \nLook for solid companies with a sound business and plenty of future growth.  Learn to always check p/e and p/s ratios before buying.  See what the stock traded prior to covid, did they launch something new or improve their business during covid?  If not, why would the company be worth more now than it was pre-covid?  Always have a hold philosophy before buying (is it 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years before you think you may want to sell it?)  \nNow is a great time to start buying some of the big tech and some of the other moderate p/e tech companies that will be long-term (3+ year) winners like AMD, SKWS, TSM, LRCX, AMAT.  This does not mean go all in on them but rather start buying with a plan.  Look at the solar and green-tech companies, if you find something with a p/e below ~40, research it maybe buy a few share and keep it on the radar.  Now is a great time to start buying small positions in longterm winners that have been beaten up.  This however, is not a time I could recommend looking at too many things that are still unproven.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't look at small positions in things like weed, on-line betting, eV, big data, just keep those risks as a small part of your portfolio.",

This triggers a rise in semiconductor demand, meaning AMAT soars and people also need energy for the EVs, so FSLR increases value. Easy peasy!",

I decided to allocate around 10% of my monthly income with the main objective of building up a pension fund. I don't have big debts besides the mortgage which takes around 15% of my monthly income.\nAs I don't have to pay taxes in capital gains (up to 100k and from there only 4%) decided to start with mostly stocks. I don't plan tu touch the investment unless an urgency happens as I can pay all the other things with the monthly income.\nI can tolerate some risk but want to play something with the right risk/reward balance.\nAt the moment I don't have anything else, besides the house I'm paying mortgage for.\nMy main problem is that my experience with the stock market is not going as supposed. I mostly only invested in companies that I know because of my job and believe in (biggest positions are in Semiconductor: ASML, Micron, NVIDIA, AMAT; Renewable: Enphase, sunrun; EV: Tesla; e-commerce: Amazon, SE Ltd; Health: TMO, Teladoc and Fintech: eToro SPAC. (Biggest positions are Enphase, Amazon, TMO and Nvidia). However, since I joined, I \"lost\" around 25%.\n\nI know it was a bad moment to start investing and likely the market will continue a bull run that will make me recover the lost. But I start wondering if the stock market is the right place to invest or should I try something else or some other strategy (i.e. instead of investing monthly, accumulate funds for when I see a crash/big correction).\n\nThank you for your help!",

TSMC has stated that prices will go up for new orders, but they are still working through the backlog that has been under contract for some time, and the new pricing won't take effect yet. This, plus the threat of China, is what's keeping the $TSM price depressed right now. Beyond that, they have nothing but tailwinds from a business perspective for the next several years. \n\nLook for the semicaps ($AMAT, $ASML, $TER, $LRCX, $KLAC, et al) if you want plays that will see action first from the TSMC, Intel and Samsung capex spending. The fabs will benefit from this capex second, while the fabless companies ($NVDA, $AMD, $AAPL, etc.) will see the benefit of this extra capacity last.",

For Intel,   I do know however that as you increase your technode you must increase your equipment technology.  20 B for new Fabs is not an eye shocking number and anyone who knows semiconductor companies knows this.  \n\nLook at the foundry TSMC majority of output is in Taiwan with only 2 8-inch wafer facilities in the USA.   8 inch wafer facilities are money losers, you spend the same amount to produce them as a 12 inch wafer, but netting less chips, industry current standard or 300 mm or 12 inch.  Those fabs wont be around much longer and they will eventually need to be retooled, and most likely completely rebuilt.    \n\nWhy building in the USA will be so important in the future.   \n\nLook at Taiwan and Singapore two places China would love to control.  Let's say tensions with China intensify and a skirmish or war breaks out there.   There would be a strangle on a lot of chip manufacturing.  Pay attention to trouble brewing in the south china sea.  \n\nIf Intels fabs are up and running they would continue to build un-harrassed in the USA.   \n\nI agree that any time a company takes money for capital expenditures when it is running behind is risky. TSMC IS SPENDING 25 TO 28 BILLION THIS YEAR ON CAPITAL EXPENSES.  Samsung  is spending 28.1 billion this year. The reason Intel is producing more fabrication facilities is so that is can have more capacity which it does not have access to currently.  So the numbers being thrown around are normal for the industry.   \n\nI would have to agree in the short term intel is behind and it will take time for them to get back up.   I do however believe they will be much better positioned going forward.   Their stock already looks discounted. \n\nJust remember semiconductor companies are always playing texas hold em.   They have to put tons of money upfront and then hope everything works out to stay profitable.   Loss of power, interuptions in supply chain i.e. south china sea, would be devastating to any company producing there.  \n\nThe only thing that would push intel higher right now would be an announcement of more capacity,  upgrading to 450 mm wafers, or some new advanced processes that blows away the competition.   They are making more capacity but that yield will be 18 months or more out.  Not a bull or bear hear just my two cents.",

        "body": "Sometimes being a consumer of a company can help you see some trends that can help you find a good purchase, but over time learn to separate your outlook on various companies between your perception as an investor and as a consumer.\n\nI bought a laptop with an Intel chip this year, but I got over $20k in AMD.\n\nA few fundamentals I see some young investors struggle with, myself in the past included, is understanding P/E, revenue, and net profit. But more importantly, go a step further and understand what competitive advantages a company has to gain future profits without the rise in competition from other companies that will undercut them. Certain companies can find ways to get more pricing power in contracts with other companies or be able to price a little higher with consumers. \n\nFirstly, since the peak in February I'm up 9%, something to keep in mind. \n\nThese high-growth companies everyone gets excited about should be a part of your investment portfolio, but only a part. Many of them will fail or one day be out-competed by another company, while 1 will remain as the next big thing. They're riskier and more volatile in the interim. They haven't made it yet, they're just on the cusp of maybe making it. Look beyond just the recent price performance of the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake CHWY as an example.  They've yet to make a profit. Let me say that again, they've yet to make a profit.\n\nIn 2020 They had revenue's of $4.85B, but their net income with expenses was -$252.37m. \n\nThey still need to do 1 of 3 things generally speaking:\n\n1) Get pricing negotiation power over suppliers to get a higher cut of the products they are retailing.\n\n2) Get a higher price from consumers that are buying the product\n\n3) Get more efficiencies to lower expenses per amount of revenue they take in.\n\nCHWY is getting traction on their stock price, because they are on the edge of being able to turn a profit and possibly grow larger, but they haven't yet.\n\nIf there is any small downtrend in the market, stocks like this are bound to fall faster and deeper. Investor's are paying a premium for a stock that might turn a profit later.\n\nIn the meantime, they offer no dividend, so the stock doesn't give the investor anything back directly. The fwd P/E ratio, with analyst expectations they will be profitable in 2022, is still $442.89 (CFRA).  This means you are paying $442.89 for each $1 they earn. That is extremely high. To be worth the current price, not only do they need to start turning a profit, they need a high enough profit to make that P/E ratio lower between $15-$35.\n\nThis tells me any little news that shows forward momentum of improvement will make investors get excited, but any bad news on the macro-economy or about their suppliers, consumers, or the company can cause larger drops in the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example of a growing retail company that is a more stable investment is TSCO, Tractor Supply Company. They have a growing consumer market on the exurban edge of large and mid-size cities. One of the fewer places brick and mortar retailers have room for growth.\n\nThis is an example of a company that has made it, has room for growth, and the stock is paying out.\n\nThey have had several years of sustained profits. In 2020 They have a revenue of $10.6B and a net profit of $749m. \n\nThe stock is paying a divided to shareholders just over 1% annually.  The P/E ratio is 26.87. This means for each $26.87 in the cost of the stock the company is making $1 after expenses.\n\nWhat to expect is there is room for growth and room for the stock to go down, like any company. But it will be less volatile than CHWY. If there is a small hiccup in the macro-economy investors won't be as nervous. It's a stable company turning a profit that can justify its price without as much future growth. Whereas, CHWY depends on that future growth that is in jeopardy.\n\nThis exercise isn't about saying TSCO is better than CHWY or the opposite. That is not the point and I'd be interested in buying both.\n\nBut this is an exercise in understanding and managing risk. I was some riskier companies with real potential, but I choose carefully what % of my portfolio are those types of companies. I have other parts of my portfolio that are growth companies that have already achieved success and have lower P/E ratios, but are less risky during small downturns.\n\nThen I have another portion of my portfolio that are value companies. These are stable companies that I don't expect much growth (beyond growth from inflation), in fact some are slowly in decline, but they're stable, common to consumers and produce dividends. Sometimes just 2-3%, but sometimes 7%. That is annual income from the stocks, not tied to changes in the share price at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are two important sides to investing, 1) finding companies that will grow and 2) managing the overall risk you're taking in finding that growth.\n\nIt is easy to find growing companies during a long Bull Market, but these popular companies with these large potential upsides in stock price are the riskiest during a bear market or even a small downturn. You're not paying for the profits they are making now, you're paying a huge premium for profits you believe they will be making in 5-6 years vs. a company that is making the profits now.\n\nSo don't just look at the performance of a stock by share price over the last few years, rather look at it on a broader level of how much that company is making for that share price and how down it will probably go in a downturn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might buy some CHWY myself for my riskier portfolio allotments, but I know their profits haven't come close to justifying that price. It is priced at profit potential 2-3 years out and any sign of a potential downturn or problem will cause some volatile dips that aren't always guaranteed to recover.\n\n(Side note: I'm long on TSCO. I needed a good comparison to examine risk. At it's current price, I believe it to be slightly overvalued. It has been a good long-term investment.)",

Their stock price rise seems to be more about can Intel shit itself even more.\n\nWhat is next for Nvidia, artificial intelligence ?\n\n'' On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Arm Inc. from SoftBank Group Corp. (TSE:9984) for $40 billion.10 Arm is a U.K.-based semiconductor and software design company specializing in CPU architecture. Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''\n\nLooks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.\n\nWhich company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ? Will AMD still be producing better chips than their last one ? Is AMD going to be around or are Intel, Apple and Nvidia going to push breakthrough things AMD can't possibly match ? AMD is quite scarier and riskier investment in that regard. Nvidia on the other hand has bigger stronghold with their GPUs and have a lot of speculative things that could pay off big time.\n\nDisclaimer, i own fuck ton of both equally.",

The upcoming RDNA3 chiplet graphics cards are said to be very, very fast and even much faster what NVidia can offer. There are some very promising leaks and the chiplet designs makes it possible to cut the time to market so AMD could probably be 3-6 monts ahead of Nvidia with even better products in the next GPU cycle.\nThis leads to better public recognition, probably higher prices and margins and after all higher revenue in graphics segment.\n\nAlso AMD is switching to 5nm next year when intel just try to improve its 10nm process. The 6nm APU Rembrandt and the 5nm version 1 year later will surely gain more market share in mobile and OEM market.\n\nFor me its most likely that Intel and Nvidia will loose market share to AMD and AMD will increase margins over time.\n\nI think its possible to double the revenue in die upcoming 1.5 years.",

        "body": "Just like in '99 and 2000, there is some game changing tech out there. \n\nThis one might ring some bells, but I think Netflix is on the path to being the next AOL. Maybe that's an exaggeration, but I wouldn't touch the stock. There are deep content pools that legacy studios are putting together that will really eat into Netflix, including, ironically enough, the assets of TimeWarner formerly owned by AOL which are now the bundle that is HBOMax. \n\nAny company that isn't an existing conglomerate (like Amazon) that has the word \"cloud\" in its short description worries me. Don't get me wrong, the so-called \"cloud\" is really cool, but I suspect it will be like the old telcos that spent tens of billions burying fiber. Of course, in the long haul that fiber was needed and it was critical for rolling out the data hungry streaming model, but a huge percentage of it got placed and then sat dormant. It absolutely buried companies that were high fliers (you have to understand it wasn't just a dot com bubble, there was an entire telecom bubble as well). A lot of stuff with \"cloud\" in it will probably find a similar fate. There will be winners just like Amazon eventually gained the title of internet commerce king, but the carcasses of the dead will lay across Wall Street only to be forgotten in a few years. \n\nOne that I remember thinking was a turd was PLUG. Look at the max chart on that thing. I still wouldn't buy that. Maybe I'm totally wrong, maybe not. I think TSLA is also overvalued. I'm not saying it's a bad company or anything, but its valuation metrics are way out of whack. \n\nYou have to understand in that era guys would go on CNBC and talk about some new internet IPO was worth x billion because it had y million \"eyeballs.\" I'm not exaggerating. They would multiply page views by 2 and use it as a metric for valuation. That whole thing to me felt like the bigger idiot theory taken to the extreme, but even that feels more reputable than the people who push crypto on CNBC. \n\nI have cash. I want to deploy it because of inflation risks, but there's virtually nothing I want to touch right now so I've just been nibbling on Boomer stocks and swing trading SPY options. \n\nOh, and one other thing. Funds. Back then Janus Twenty was all the rage. They had closed it to new investors. People would brag that they were in it. It had all the high flyers. AOL, Cisco, JDSUniphase, Intel, Microsoft and Oracle. That reminds me of that ARK fund or whatever it is called. Again, not everything in the J20 was a terrible company, but valuations got so out of whack that things like INTC have never returned to their highs and MSFT and ORCL, while good companies, were dead money for over a decade. I think a company like TSLA has the chance to find itself in that sort of company where the stock takes a decade plus to touch its ATH again.",

People who knew a lot about Intel been waiting for this for years.\n\nOn other hand Microsoft is trying to acquire everything that is trending and are making better decisions overall.\n\nApple just made its best laptop ever which is just scary godly in benchmarks with its chip, had marvelous past earnings.\n\nAmazon is building pharmacy, possibly building supermarkets, absolutely marvelous earnings and will do just about anything to get to the world dominance.\n\nAMD and Nvidia are both trying to acquire some serious companies, overall they are on streak themselves.\n\nThat is just realy shortly said, but i just dislike the ''hindsight, hindsight, hindsight you can't predict anything at all, my ears are closed wheeee''\n\nBut when i ask do these people actually went through past few earnings reports i get absolute silence, but i guess reddit doesn't want to do any homework, just wants to stick to stupid quotes and then invest at the top and cry for months.\n\nA lot of speculations can be made, and by what i have seen, whatever after homework you believe in FAANG and similar companies now, i can speculate that after those 5 - 10 years some of these stocks will lift up the entire peoples portfolio, like they did before. Or like check the 5 years ago posts on what people think will be great after 5 years, many portfolio there beats the entire market assuming they held.\n\nBut yeah tell me how we will never know anything ever about anything that could really perform in future.

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC, BTCX or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

Some exchanges actually provide you with the coins, other just provide you with exposure to it and give you some kind of object tied to the price action but never the actual transferable coin.\n\nFor exchanges that allow you to buy the coins, just look at [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/) \n\nEtoro, Robinhood and a few others just allow you some exposure.\n\nFurthermore, exchanges give you acces to the coins, but they are never yours, they still can exert influence on them such as freezing the account and you will not be able to transfer or trade.

Last March this thing was a dead horse at 6 bucks then all hell broke loose .\n\n...multiple factors contributed to the greatest run on ammo as long as I have been in the industry ..8 years now. ..national emergency with Covid, Civil Unrest, Police Brutality..looting in Santa Monica, CA of all places, Massive influx of new buyers..the list goes on. \n\nObama was no match for this.  \n\nIt started March 12th 2020 and has been outrageous sales EVERY SINGLE day 417 days in a row!!!!!. Can't keep anyting in stock. Vista has a massive market share(Federal, Blazer, CCI, Speer, American Eagle and now Remington) This is THE ammo stock. They also hold the keys to primer manufacturing which is the reason we are in this mess. The primer shortage caused a backlog and then 10 million new gun buyers wanted to feed their new toys. \n\nSuper Demand City and no Supply easy math. As far as timing..this thing still has some juice left in it I believe and that's because they've had some price increases and recently stated they are behind a billion dollars in orders.\n\nPrice Targets range from 35-49. A consensus buy across the board on most outlets.  I believe all time high was 52 and change..it has a serious shot at beating that.  I have personally spent a year watching and running with this stock.  Seriously hours daily researching this for over a year.\n\nThe negative is there is low volume to move this thing. It's insane. It has taken a big jump, but over 14 months.\n\nThe earnings probably hit 575 million in this report and might break earnings record. It was at 38 not too long ago.  I've owned this since last March at an average of 7.80. I have taken profits twice so far. I now have stock and 35 dollar calls to hit May 21st which are green and also some 40 dollar hail mary calls as well. Those could be dreamers, but I work in this field and it never ends. Phones ringing off the hook..lines all day long.  I can't and won't give you advice on what to do with your hard earned money, but I do believe this company has a serious positive short term outlook.\n\nBest of luck Champ",

This will only continue as more and more serious institutions start to get it and don't want china to control them. \n\n&gt;The ecological impact of running computers to support BTC is insane and currently unsustainable.\n\nEnergy consumption of Bitcoin is lower then our current monetary system (banks, visa etc) in relative terms. There's also a clear trend to sustainable energy usage since mining is location independent and is a way to profit off of otherwise unusable land and wasted energy (deserts/surplus of the power grid etc.)\n\n&gt;Nobody knows the exact origin of BTC, so nobody really knows if there is a back door to hack\n\nKnowing who Satoshi is is irrelevant in terms of hacking. The entire code of the protocol is public since it started. Bitcoin is an open source project and anyone can look at the code if they want to. There are no backdoors and there's no way to build one unless you want the whole world to see it. \n\n&gt;there are a number of early early adopters that hold a huge amount and can tank the market anytime they decide to sell their billions of dollars worth of BTC\n\nOnly point that's fair imo. Although there's something to be said that the market can tank it by now and it won't be the end of Bitcoin. Also I doubt these individuals would voluntarily trigger a market crash by selling billions at once. They obviously believe in Bitcoin's future or lost their keys otherwise they wouldn't have stayed committed to their holdings for this long. \n\n&gt;I think blockchain is a tech that is here to stay, but current versions are basically beta tests.\n\nSmart contract platforms and everything build on them are still in beta/early adopter territory but Bitcoin isn't. Banks and the biggest financial institutions don't adopt technologies that are in \"beta\" Bitcoin is a trillion dollar asset and on it's way to cross the chasm to the early majority.",

Interesting but full of conjecture and vague suppositions, typical for that kind of pitch \"people disagree with me but this is because they are stupid and are part of the machine\"\n\n If VCs where prone to believe every similar line of reason they read like Dan's they would invest after every one of thousands of hockey stick presentations they see. Here is one such gem based on emotional appeal to the outsider:\n\n\"The idea that Satoshi perfectly crafted Bitcoin on the first try is unfathomable for them to consider.\" \n\nTo which the first commentor correctly replies \"Because it's unfathomable that this is true\" and there you have the summary of the two sides of the argument.\n\nEven a brief browse through the Wikipedia entry for Bitcoin will tell you as much based on its history.\n\nThere are so many other problems with BtC but let's just choose one and let's also apply another line if reasoning: how secure is it in a physical sense? People are keeping their keys on physical media in safety deposit boxes at multiple banks because they are rightly concerned people can and would kill them for their Bitcoin or otherwise steal it. Many people who used services for their wallet have been burnt hard. We have laws about the fiet money proceeds of such crimes but people who own BTC do well to be concerned. Whose jurisdiction does solving a theft of Bitcoin actually fall under? Where exactly is Satoshi if he is even a real person? If he is not dead it's pretty dangerous to be him.\n\nThe truth is that BTC is flawed and will be changed/replaced as people solve problems with it. As such it will become obsolete or be updated and when that happens it will be vulnerable and Dans reasoning is flawed on this basis.\n\nI have no doubt there is utility for crypto. I just think investing in any particular technology as an investment asset will be demonstrated to be a huge mistake in 15 years when when we look back on the crypto bubble of 20xx. Many of the Dotcom companies had value there was still a bubble. Except now with crypto we have perfected this bubble. For Dotcom and firms pretended to have value and products or services. \n\nBottom line: Dan is invested",

        "body": "Yes, as a Canadian, there are multiple exchanges available to us such as Newton, ShakePay, NDAX, WealthSimple Crypto, and some Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

Sure, the stock is trading at a high P/E. That doesn't mean it's not on my pullback radar.   \n\n\nValue investing for me is all about buying and holding for 10+ years. I expect the demand for chips to power AI skyrocketing over the next 10 years. Self-driving cars, automated factories, airborne pizza delivery, robotic pilots, algorithms for predicting consumer behavior, automated logistics, personal health AI wearables, kill bots to dominate the battlefield. There are uses for AI that we still haven't found yet, and all of those new uses are going to require lots of chips.   \n\n\nEven now, chip manufacturers are building new foundries to meet the demand.
