        "body": "Reading other comments - I won\u2019t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. \n\nIntel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. \n\nHence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won\u2019t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. \n\nIntel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. \n\nAlso the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. \n\nAs I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. \n\nIs NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. \n\nNow regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. \n\nAnd regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel\u2019s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. \n\nFull disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.",

        "body": "Materials sector will get decimated once supply glut hits.\n\nRight now commodities prices are at ATH because of massive undersupply. However supply is getting built out at a crazy rate and the demand spike for a lot of these goods is likely temporary.\nThis isn't new or unusual, commodities super-cycles are they are known are fairly frequent phenomena. Some people get very rich on the way up, some people get left with some very heavy bags and a few people get very rich on the way down.\n\nCorrection in commodities pricing will be violent and brutal. Similar to the bond market commodities are traded using highly levered products called futures so when the crash starts happening (it already has) it will go down very fast.\n\nThe other bubble which is probably a year or 2 out from peaking is semiconductor stocks. For now supply is constrained but fabs are being built out massively on a scale never seen before. Again this isn't new, semis have a boom/bust cycle like commodities. It's just this one is much bigger and will take longer to play out.\n\nUnlike commodities, bonds or crypto this one will take a lot longer to deflate. I expect NVDA, AMAT and ASML to be hit the hardest by this. NVDA is going to get a double whammy from their 30XX series lining up with the top of the boom and crypto cycle exploding likely dumping tons of cheap 2nd hand hardware on the market.",

        "body": "&gt; Start with businesses you know and love yourself.\n\nThis is one of the best pieces of investing advice.\n\nDon't put your money into something you don't know about unless you know what you're doing.\n\nAnother best piece of advice:\n\n**You will never buy at the lowest and sell at the highest.**\n\nSo it's OK to catch a falling knife or something on the rise AS LONG AS IT'S SOMETHING RELIABLE.\n\nAnd\n\nBE HAPPY IF YOU SELL AT A PROFIT. Don't look back and kick yourself if you didn't make more. I sold Amazon at $900 thinking that was high... but it made me a solid profit back then and it kept the rest of what I was doing going (self funding and building businesses).\n\n**Example of \"Something Reliable\"**: The market might crash, but tech companies will bounce back regardless, some of them might not even feel the crash. There are plenty of mainstay companies that you can buy and hold and be happy with.\n\nApplied materials is one of my favorites. They literally dominate the semiconductor equipment and support game. Semiconductors are needed for all of our technology (anything that uses electronics). They aren't going away anytime soon. So if you buy them now or during a dip, you'll be happy in the long run.\n\nOne last bonus one:\n\n\n**It's not a loss if you don't sell.**\n\nHere's the thing, maybe you have a short term strategy, maybe long. Either way, if your investments take a dip, as long as you chose well, hold onto them. They'll come back sometime. It might take days, months, of even years, so this determines on your strategy (which should account for stuff like this).\n\nMy RothIRA account survived two market plummets - 2008 and the beginning of the pandemic last year (2020). Once the market came back we were back to gains.\n\nSame goes for my active investing accounts. If any \"bet\" goes negative, I hold onto it until it comes back.",

See what the stock traded prior to covid, did they launch something new or improve their business during covid?  If not, why would the company be worth more now than it was pre-covid?  Always have a hold philosophy before buying (is it 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years before you think you may want to sell it?)  \nNow is a great time to start buying some of the big tech and some of the other moderate p/e tech companies that will be long-term (3+ year) winners like AMD, SKWS, TSM, LRCX, AMAT.  This does not mean go all in on them but rather start buying with a plan.  Look at the solar and green-tech companies, if you find something with a p/e below ~40, research it maybe buy a few share and keep it on the radar.  Now is a great time to start buying small positions in longterm winners that have been beaten up.  This however, is not a time I could recommend looking at too many things that are still unproven.

I decided to allocate around 10% of my monthly income with the main objective of building up a pension fund. I don't have big debts besides the mortgage which takes around 15% of my monthly income.\nAs I don't have to pay taxes in capital gains (up to 100k and from there only 4%) decided to start with mostly stocks. I don't plan tu touch the investment unless an urgency happens as I can pay all the other things with the monthly income.\nI can tolerate some risk but want to play something with the right risk/reward balance.\nAt the moment I don't have anything else, besides the house I'm paying mortgage for.\nMy main problem is that my experience with the stock market is not going as supposed. I mostly only invested in companies that I know because of my job and believe in (biggest positions are in Semiconductor: ASML, Micron, NVIDIA, AMAT; Renewable: Enphase, sunrun; EV: Tesla; e-commerce: Amazon, SE Ltd; Health: TMO, Teladoc and Fintech: eToro SPAC. (Biggest positions are Enphase, Amazon, TMO and Nvidia). However, since I joined, I \"lost\" around 25%.\n\nI know it was a bad moment to start investing and likely the market will continue a bull run that will make me recover the lost. But I start wondering if the stock market is the right place to invest or should I try something else or some other strategy (i.e. instead of investing monthly, accumulate funds for when I see a crash/big correction).\n\nThank you for your help!",

        "body": "Taiwan has this little issue called \"China\" 100 miles off its coast, and China has been rattling sabers in Taiwan's direction for the past few weeks -- likely just to see what Washington's reaction is, but China is desperate for chipmaking capability, has failed constantly in developing the technology/know-how themselves, and would probably like nothing more than to do to Taiwan what it did to Hong Kong. \n\nI don't think that China will actually attack Taiwan because Xi knows that it's an open declaration of hot war on the entire world (not just the U.S.) but the threat is there -- the entire world's economy literally depends on Xi not going full Kim Jong Un level of insane on us. \n\nBusiness-wise -- TSMC is completely booked; any new capacity they manage to scrape together is immediately snatched up. TSMC has stated that prices will go up for new orders, but they are still working through the backlog that has been under contract for some time, and the new pricing won't take effect yet. This, plus the threat of China, is what's keeping the $TSM price depressed right now. Beyond that, they have nothing but tailwinds from a business perspective for the next several years. \n\nLook for the semicaps ($AMAT, $ASML, $TER, $LRCX, $KLAC, et al) if you want plays that will see action first from the TSMC, Intel and Samsung capex spending. The fabs will benefit from this capex second, while the fabless companies ($NVDA, $AMD, $AAPL, etc.) will see the benefit of this extra capacity last.",

        "body": "Reading other comments - I won\u2019t comment on the valuation since different folks might have different risk tolerances. I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. \n\nIntel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. \n\nHence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won\u2019t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. \n\nIntel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. \n\nAlso the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. \n\nAs I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. \n\nIs NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. \n\nNow regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. \n\nAnd regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel\u2019s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. \n\nFull disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.",
