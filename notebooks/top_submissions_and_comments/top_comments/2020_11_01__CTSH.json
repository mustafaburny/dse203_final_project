Making travel alot more annoying, this make travel agents more appealing for hassle free travel. \n\nI\u2019d say give it 6-18 months and it\u2019ll be at around $30-40 mark in that scenario. \n\nOr, vaccine talks die down and it drops to $8-12 range.

Gates's mom served on a charitable board with the CEO of IBM; they were more associates than friends, and that wouldn't have helped Gates at all if he hadn't already, you know, founded MS. \n\nElon's family didn't own an emerald mine, and he was $100k in debt when he graduated college. \n\nMeritocracy just means that merit - mostly in the sense of skills - is rewarded. It doesn't mean that everyone necessarily has an equal chance. \n\nIf a company needs and engineer and I have an engineering degree, and you don't - maybe because you had an abusive family growing up wit a father in prison and so never graduated from HS, the company is hiring me *on merit*. I'm an engineer; you're not; you can't do the job. \n\nThis doesn't mean that if our lives were switched at age 3 I would have done any better; that's just a separate question from meritocracy. \n\nI mean, if a company needs someone who speaks French, and my wealthy family summered in France every year and sent me there one a gap year and then on a junior year abroad...while you took French in HS...merit means I get the job *even though* I was only able to obtain my qualifications because my family was rich enough to keep sending me to France. \n\nBut the company isn't hiring me because of who I am, but because of what I can do, and that I can do it better than you can.",

First, comparison to the Leidos, CACI, BAH, IBM, HPE etc. of the government consulting world. They too employ a lot of talent. What is the difference with PLTR? Second, government consulting is often a \"customer intimate\" model, not quality leadership. Govt says it wants high tech, but they often buy those companies who understand them most. Which model is PLTR using? Why will PLTR succeed in Govt? Is it primarily IC?\n\nThird, if PLTR has silicon valley magic in it, then why is the commercial business not taking off? If you have a superior value proposition, that will be reflected in high margins and a kind of inevitability of customers who are drawn to your products. A weakness there would make me pause.",

It may not seem like it but consumers will switch for better products or ways of doing things.

It will always be around of course, but anyone that doesn't think ARM is going to keep getting a larger and larger bite of the pie isn't paying attention. Apple will give everyone permission to target software for ARM architecture and we'll soon see a second attempt from Microsoft. Again, we'll always have applications for Intel, but it won't be nearly as dominant. Intel's production woes over the past half decade are well documented, and it's clear that they are about as well run as Boeing these days. The problem for Intel is that they face much more fierce competition than Boeing. Intel will survive of course, but they'll be a shell of their former self, and they'll have fumbled their flagship products and missed the boat on the areas of the industry that are sure to see rapid growth. I understand that people want to target value, but Intel is priced the way they are for good reason. If you're looking for value in Intel then I have some IBM stock to sell you as well.",

So I will be around so long there are investors willing to keep the company running.\n\nAs for the eV controversial giant, this is not quite finished. Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money. Seagate was dismissed in 1997, sue again and paid [$45 M to R+ as late as 2000](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/seagate-to-pay-rodime-45m-to-settle-suit-2000-01/).   R+ only exists as a shell company and its share price soared on news of the patent settlement.  I think **NKLA** can remain as a shell company with its patent portfolio covering designs that covers most vehicles built electric or not. [It sue Tsla earlier](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/04/20/teslas-effort-to-short-circuit-nikola-lawsuit-fizzles-as-patent-office-denies-door-argument/?sh=44dc21a45d78).

More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",

Now that you close the spread once it gets touched, your probability of loss is now the probability of touching the short strike (which is approximately twice the probability of being ITM).\n\nAs opposed to waiting to see if the stock rebounds off the short strike?  \n\nMakes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI opened a spread against IBM about 3 weeks ago, a 35 day spread.  It initially dipped below the short strike but I didn't freak out because I had 30 days for it to go back up....and it did.  Now my spread is OTM and profitable and has been for about a week.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guy was putting forth a strategy of writing a spread with a short strike of 20 delta for &lt; 14 days.  I guess the thought is if the stock moved that much in a short amount of time to test the short strike, probably best to just close it for a loss rather than manage it with just a few days left until expiration.

It's far more volatile than precious metals and also intangible.\n\nIBM is making huge strides towards quantum computing, and once they pull it off, Bitcoin will become worthless once the public/private key cryptography is cracked and anyone with access to a quantum computer can simply sign transactions to send coins to themselves.

I definitely wouldn't advise you to put all your eggs in one basket, but I do believe that AMD is a very good buy in the long-term.\n\nFundamentally, they have an absurdly phenomenal management team. Since Lisa Su's inception, the company has experienced tremendous growth and even managed to steal away Intel's lead architect. Although AMD has always has great products, Lisa Su has really managed to take it to the next level and make AMD nearly a household name at this point with the rise of customized computer building.\n\nI guess to answer your question better, if you're planning on holding this for 10+ years, I have no doubts that this stock will grow especially with its acquisition of Xilinx and incredible product line. These synergies match especially well and I don't see a way that Intel could possibly topple AMD as it previously has. The semiconductor industry has been seeing a growing prevalence, especially with its intertwining of AI (i.e. NVDIA).  \n\n\nEDIT: I know that might be a pretty ambiguous answer, but I've done a few analyses and reports on AMD, so if you have any other questions regarding their financials/future outlook, feel free to reach out!",

In June 2018 AMD had 8% of the consumer CPU market and by November 2019 they had 20% and by the end of Q3 2020 they had 37.3%. They are carving a massive hole in the market. AMD's new GPUs combat NVidias [at least that's what their marketing says, but AMD's marketing has been very good since Lisa Su became the CEO/COO, she is an actual electrical engineer and has been essential in bringing AMD back from the brink of bankruptcy in 2017 (AMD was expected to go bankrupt in 2018 if they didn't release something)]. \n\nI know it can be difficult to trust some random person on the internet, so you should look at the news. All tech news indicates that AMD is going to be doing very well this quarter and it seems like NVidia knows this as well, since they coincidentally delayed their 3070 GPUs 2 weeks ahead, so that it was literally the day before AMD's Big Navi announcement. Intel won't have a response to AMD's 5000 series (which is releasing this month) until early 2021 and those CPUs will be practically equal (probably slightly better) to the 5000 series, but probably cost more. The crux of Intel's problem is Intel's aging 14nm process, AMD is using TSMC's 7nm process (and is designing its next CPUs around TSMC's 5nm process). The difference between the 14nm process and the 7nm process is transistor density TSMC has a transistor density of 90 MT/mm\u00b2 (million transistors per square millimeter) while Intel's is much worse (no exact figures because Intel doesn't share that). The reason we can tell it's worse is because Intel's CPUs run much hotter than AMD's, yet have similar performance (people don't gravitate to Intel due to Intel's poor pricing) which means that Intel is having to push more power through the CPU to reach comparable speeds (which produces the extra heat). \n\nBack to GPUs, the 3090 (1500 USD) is NVidia's top-end flagship ridiculously priced card (NVidia and most other tech companies have one usually you pay double the price of the product below it while only gaining a negligible 15% performance boost) and the 6900XT (1000 USD) costs 500 less while delivering the same performance (when I say the same I mean in some games/workloads the 3090 wins and in others the 6900XT and it's always by a negligible margin). The 3080 is the reasonable 700 USD GPU (it's actually a very good value, especially when compared to NVidia's last gen pricing) but AMD has an answer to that too, and it's the 6800XT which also has very similar performance and costs 50 USD less, and I haven't even gotten to the best part: NVidia completely sold out of all of their GPUs within minutes and do not have ANY in stock rn and a lot of gamers want these new GPUs since they are such a massive leap forward, to put it in perspective the 3080 costs 100 USD less than the 2080 ti as of rn (the 2080 ti was the most expensive card from NVidia's last lineup) and has 33% more performance, gamers will buy whatever is available, plus NVidia had a shitty launch for a great product (they sold a lot of cards to scalpers and allowed them to buy multiple cards because they didn't add recaptcha or anything like that and their supply was already limited due to their choice to use faster (and lower yield) GDDR6X memory over just normal GDDR6 (AMD uses regular GDDR6, but they make up the performance by using TSMC's 7nm which is much denser than Samsung's 8nm the names of processes are not really indicative of transistor density), so people are angry). The cards that most people will buy are lower down the stack, but time and time again it has became evident that even if someone will ultimately buy a mid-tier GPU if the company that makes the mid-tier GPU isn't competitive on the high-end then they will purchase the mid-level GPU from the company that is competitive on the high-end (this hurt AMD bad last gen with GPUs) so that is why I won't go over the mid-low end as much (it is worth noting that AMD does have much better GPUs on the mid-low end)",

It will always be around of course, but anyone that doesn't think ARM is going to keep getting a larger and larger bite of the pie isn't paying attention. Apple will give everyone permission to target software for ARM architecture and we'll soon see a second attempt from Microsoft. Again, we'll always have applications for Intel, but it won't be nearly as dominant. Intel's production woes over the past half decade are well documented, and it's clear that they are about as well run as Boeing these days. The problem for Intel is that they face much more fierce competition than Boeing. Intel will survive of course, but they'll be a shell of their former self, and they'll have fumbled their flagship products and missed the boat on the areas of the industry that are sure to see rapid growth. I understand that people want to target value, but Intel is priced the way they are for good reason. If you're looking for value in Intel then I have some IBM stock to sell you as well.",

They're complacent. They've never had competition before. \n\nSure their business is solid but in truth they really aren't worth much more than their dividend. There's a place in every portfolio for dividends, but personally I don't look to the tech sector for dividends. Things move too quickly and you don't have the same kind of stranglehold on markets as you do in other industries. If I want dividends I'm looking at financials or REITs or energy.

I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

        "body": "It\u2019s pretty true. I have a BS in Economics and an MA in applied economics and an MQM (Masters in Quantitative Management) as well. And the first question people ask when they find out what I did in college is about the economy and stocks. And it\u2019s a dumb question and they don\u2019t even realize it. Like I spent years learning about scarcity and a bunch of basically applied calculus and statistics. \n\nUnless I work directly for a brokerage I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to make an informed decision any one way or the other, and even then it would only be a best estimate and one with enough of a likely chance to not be correct that it would be pretty irresponsible to give an opinion on it. \n\nI can fully do the math behind it sure, but the stock market has proven time and time again that it\u2019s irrational and not really predictable with any algorithm. There is a reason that economic theory even says throwing a dart at a chart of stocks and picking where it lands is just as likely to be accurate than if you picked it based on extensive amounts of DD and research. \n\nBut I just point people towards index\u2019s, tell them if they aren\u2019t retiring in the next 5 years don\u2019t be afraid or worried that the stock market drops every now and then etc etc. \n\ntl;dr Economists don\u2019t study the economy they study scarcity. I\u2019d be extremely skeptical of any economist claiming to know what the market will do or that they have figured out the stock market. We exist to do small scale data analysis, or to advise large scale economic moves aka monetary/fiscal policy, we aren\u2019t adept at guessing small movements within certain markets. And if we\u2019re in a spot where we can then we are also in a spot where the sec would have something to say if we profited off it.",
