        "body": "I was a materials scientist developing 7nm process technology at Intel before jumping ship. The biggest thing TSMC did to get the upper hand over Intel was order a shit ton of ASML EUV photolithography tools early on. ASML took years to fill those contracts due to how complex their production is (these tools cost ~$100M each). I didn't directly work on the EUV tool, but saw the effects first hand of how Intel's first EUV tool streamlined several difficult manufacturing steps in our 7nm technology. But we couldn't get enough of them in time. Before this the companies were close on process technology; Intel was maybe even slightly ahead. Whether this persists once Intel's orders with ASML can be filled remains to be seen.\n\nAn interesting development is the Japanese semiconductor manufacturing tool companies (e.g., Nikon, Canon, TEL) have EUV tools coming soon. If only I knew which of these might follow an ASML like trajectory  in the markets.",

The overwhelming majority of actively managed funds do not beat the index they are benchmarked against after fees. That includes global equities. \n\n2. Following on from point 1, the comparison is valid and depends really on which index the active fund is benchmarked against. Many, many active funds aim to out perform \u201cX\u201d index and the data shows they fail to do so, after fees, over the long term. To your point if an investor was considering an activity managed fund that tracked global stocks - Janus Henderson Global Equity Fund that comes with a 0.85% TER - the evidence suggests he or she would have great returns by investing in a global equities tracker with a TER of 0.15% and get the same exposure but 5x cheaper. It does not matter to the investor if the manager, on paper, actually achieves their goal if the investor is still worse off!\n\n3. Your point about volatility. It\u2019s a metric, for sure. But it\u2019s importance is down to the investor and their risk tolerance. If reducing volatility was an issue the traditional thing to do would be to reduce equity exposure and increase bond exposure. As a comparison of active funds vs index trackers, sure it may be important to some people but long term investors will only care about the performance and their gains.  \n\n3. RE rising tides. You are exactly right. Active funds are let off the hook in a long term bull market. Again why pay them extra fees when they\u2019re playing in easy mode. Again, how do you know who will steer the ship through troubled waters? You don\u2019t, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s a guess. The data supporting index trackers goes back to the turn of the century, evidenced by data collection and the miracle of modern computing.",

Please let the community know what you have decided and why, I would be interested to know. From where I am standing, both seem perfectly fine as a core equity investment for your portfolio.\n\nSWDA is high on my list as I know that I like MSCI's approach to index construction (frankly, I am just less familiar with SolActive so simply haven't done DD yet). Further, I believe that any passive investment in the stock market should be cap-weighted so that disqualifies TGGB (once again, I am looking at indices for benchmarking purposes, as I actually may like equal-weighted better to invest in).\n\nEqual weighted has its obvious merits, but note that such a weighting scheme works best when there is some mean reversion in share price. The last decade, betting on mean reversion has been a losing strategy as large firms (e.g., US tech) just became bigger and bigger. There are some fundamental reasons behind this (e.g., ineffective competition regulation, tax avoidance, bargaining power of large firms vs suppliers, consumers and the government) that are the driver of this, which may not subside soon.\n\nApart from the weighting scheme:\n\n\\- Both have same TER\n\n\\- SWDA allows securities lending, which may introduce unwanted risk to you. TGGB does not.\n\n\\- SWDA is massive and TGGB, with EUR 300m in assets, is rather mid-size. This may impact liquidity and the breadth and liquidity of any derivatives referencing the EFT. Also, if TGGB may not grow to the potential the manager wants it, they may discontinue the product. \n\n\\- Both don't seem to have a large replication error, but not that TGGB only has about 1 year of realized performance to prove that.\n\nGood luck choosing!",

SurityPro is scientifically formulated to deliver carefully controlled CBD content for customized daily use in dogs of all sizes. Canopy Growth calls SurityPro the \u201cnew generation of advanced pet specialty CBD product for dogs to support calm behavior, joint health and flexibility, healthy aging and an enhanced overall mental well-being.\u201d\n\n&gt;In addition to SurityPro, Canopy Growth recently partnered with Martha Stewart to launch another line of CBD products for pets that includes CBD oil drops and savory soft-baked chews for dogs formulated with premium hemp-derived, broad-spectrum CBD. The flavors, created by Martha Stewart, include chicken and cranberry, chicken and blueberry and chicken and blueberry + anise, as well as chicken-flavored wellness drops.\n\n&gt;To ensure all products meet the highest quality standards, Canopy Growth continues to work closely with the veterinary and academic community, regulatory authorities and leading scientists. The company\u2019s research team conducted two recent studies that signify important research on the topic of CBD use in pets.\n\n&gt;According to Canopy Growth, its 28-day study in dogs is a step towards better understanding the long-term impact of daily CBD use and how it interacts in the canine body, while a feline study is just the beginning of Canopy Growth\u2019s work in understanding CBD use in cats. The completion of these studies demonstrates Canopy Growth\u2019s continued commitment to CBD science and industry-leading investment into research.\n\nI know everyone likes shitting on Canopy but they are the only company so far that has transitioned into an actual Cannabis CPG company instead of just a recreational cannabis company. It's still very very early, but with brands like Suritypro, Martha CBD and Biosteel, there is massive potential if they can gain traction now that these products are available in retail stores like Walmart, Target and on amazon.com.\n\nWith their ties to STZ, the upcoming acquisition of Acreage, as well as investments in Ter and Slang in the US, CGC is well positioned to remain a top player in this industry if these brands reach their potential. This has always been a marathon, not a race. Despite the volatility in this entire over the years, their CPG products + focus on entering the US is the primary reason I continue to remain invested in CGC alongside other MSOs.\n\nPositions: CGC, Gtii, Trul, Cura and MSOS calls.

Most of the cobalt is mined in Congo. The mining situation is unstable, and there are some conflicts around it. That's why there's no good ETF for cobalt miners so far.\n\nCopper had a surge recently and it's difficult for me to predict it. I think, I've missed this train.\n\nAbout energy production: Developed countries declare to 0 CO2 emission within few decades. That means switching to renewable energy sources. I don't see wind and solar playing big role in it, unlkie atomic energy. Some experts say there's going to be another uranium boom in the market. The facts are encouraging:  \ncurrent uranium price: 31,70 USD/lb  \ntotal uranium mining cost is around 60 USD/lb  \nammount of uranium to be used by utilities in 2021: 200 mln lbs  \nammount of uranium to be mined in 2021: 150 mln lbs  \nCurrent gap is covered by stock and disarming nuclear weapons.

And aside from CGC and their agreements with TER/ACRG, I'm going to assume that conversation between other LPs and American companies are well under way. Just because Irwin didn't call up Ben Kovler to opine over his plans, does *not* mean they don't have one.\n\nThe rest of your thesis, about anyone waltzing in and becoming a cannabis company after legalization, is a cop out. Of course that is true. Amazon could buy their way into any state and dominate if they wanted to. But they haven't said their intentions were to do so, while some LPs have, once they are legally permitted.... how is that misleading?",

        "body": "1. A long term analyses of global diversified equity indexes vs actively managed funds aiming to beat those indexes will also demonstrate the same point. The overwhelming majority of actively managed funds do not beat the index they are benchmarked against after fees. That includes global equities. \n\n2. Following on from point 1, the comparison is valid and depends really on which index the active fund is benchmarked against. Many, many active funds aim to out perform \u201cX\u201d index and the data shows they fail to do so, after fees, over the long term. To your point if an investor was considering an activity managed fund that tracked global stocks - Janus Henderson Global Equity Fund that comes with a 0.85% TER - the evidence suggests he or she would have great returns by investing in a global equities tracker with a TER of 0.15% and get the same exposure but 5x cheaper. It does not matter to the investor if the manager, on paper, actually achieves their goal if the investor is still worse off!\n\n3. Your point about volatility. It\u2019s a metric, for sure. But it\u2019s importance is down to the investor and their risk tolerance. If reducing volatility was an issue the traditional thing to do would be to reduce equity exposure and increase bond exposure. As a comparison of active funds vs index trackers, sure it may be important to some people but long term investors will only care about the performance and their gains.  \n\n3. RE rising tides. You are exactly right. Active funds are let off the hook in a long term bull market. Again why pay them extra fees when they\u2019re playing in easy mode. Again, how do you know who will steer the ship through troubled waters? You don\u2019t, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s a guess. The data supporting index trackers goes back to the turn of the century, evidenced by data collection and the miracle of modern computing.",

SurityPro is scientifically formulated to deliver carefully controlled CBD content for customized daily use in dogs of all sizes. Canopy Growth calls SurityPro the \u201cnew generation of advanced pet specialty CBD product for dogs to support calm behavior, joint health and flexibility, healthy aging and an enhanced overall mental well-being.\u201d\n\n&gt;In addition to SurityPro, Canopy Growth recently partnered with Martha Stewart to launch another line of CBD products for pets that includes CBD oil drops and savory soft-baked chews for dogs formulated with premium hemp-derived, broad-spectrum CBD. The flavors, created by Martha Stewart, include chicken and cranberry, chicken and blueberry and chicken and blueberry + anise, as well as chicken-flavored wellness drops.\n\n&gt;To ensure all products meet the highest quality standards, Canopy Growth continues to work closely with the veterinary and academic community, regulatory authorities and leading scientists. The company\u2019s research team conducted two recent studies that signify important research on the topic of CBD use in pets.\n\n&gt;According to Canopy Growth, its 28-day study in dogs is a step towards better understanding the long-term impact of daily CBD use and how it interacts in the canine body, while a feline study is just the beginning of Canopy Growth\u2019s work in understanding CBD use in cats. The completion of these studies demonstrates Canopy Growth\u2019s continued commitment to CBD science and industry-leading investment into research.\n\nI know everyone likes shitting on Canopy but they are the only company so far that has transitioned into an actual Cannabis CPG company instead of just a recreational cannabis company. It's still very very early, but with brands like Suritypro, Martha CBD and Biosteel, there is massive potential if they can gain traction now that these products are available in retail stores like Walmart, Target and on amazon.com.\n\nWith their ties to STZ, the upcoming acquisition of Acreage, as well as investments in Ter and Slang in the US, CGC is well positioned to remain a top player in this industry if these brands reach their potential. This has always been a marathon, not a race. Despite the volatility in this entire over the years, their CPG products + focus on entering the US is the primary reason I continue to remain invested in CGC alongside other MSOs.\n\nPositions: CGC, Gtii, Trul, Cura and MSOS calls.
