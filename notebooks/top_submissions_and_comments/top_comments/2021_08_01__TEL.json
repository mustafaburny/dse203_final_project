        "body": "I was a materials scientist developing 7nm process technology at Intel before jumping ship. The biggest thing TSMC did to get the upper hand over Intel was order a shit ton of ASML EUV photolithography tools early on. ASML took years to fill those contracts due to how complex their production is (these tools cost ~$100M each). I didn't directly work on the EUV tool, but saw the effects first hand of how Intel's first EUV tool streamlined several difficult manufacturing steps in our 7nm technology. But we couldn't get enough of them in time. Before this the companies were close on process technology; Intel was maybe even slightly ahead. Whether this persists once Intel's orders with ASML can be filled remains to be seen.\n\nAn interesting development is the Japanese semiconductor manufacturing tool companies (e.g., Nikon, Canon, TEL) have EUV tools coming soon. If only I knew which of these might follow an ASML like trajectory  in the markets.",
