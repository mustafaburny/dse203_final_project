        "body": "Understandable, I\u2019ve been invested for a while but it took me a solid few weeks of research before I actually bought any stock last year. Patent trolls are usually the first thing that comes to mind in these situations but Netlist isn\u2019t some scam company, they\u2019re a real company with real innovation. \n\nA quick, rough breakdown of the Google history: \n\nNetlist that came to Google in 2006-ish trying to license their memory products to Google for their servers. Google said thanks but no thanks but then used their patented technology anyways. Netlist caught wind and sued Google in 2009. Google has been fighting this court case for 12 years now, their first defense was that the patent wasn\u2019t valid, but a USPTO PTAB recently came to the conclusion that the patent is valid. So Google should be on the hook for 12+ years of treble damages as well as court fees and possibly future royalties. Currently the judge in their case ordered both sides to try and talk it out and a joint decision was supposed to be turned into the judge just a few days ago so speculation is running rampant in the Netlist subreddit that an agreement was reach as nothing was filed on the deadline but who tf knows. Google has been fighting this tooth and nail for years and there are also cases against Micron and Samsung for similar infringement. \n\nNetlist has barely been staying above water this past decade, with most of its profits going towards fighting these legal cases and it seems like maybe the most recent win against SK Hynix may be the turning point. I can\u2019t say I know what\u2019s going to happen but things have definitely been trending in the right direction. Shareholders are basically betting that the last 12 years of missed profits from these giant tech companies will be realized very soon in triplicate with additional cash covering legal fees as well as forcing Google and others to pay royalties for future use of the technology. \n\nAs always, do your own research, I\u2019m not a patent lawyer nor an expert in computer memory technology.",

        "body": "Understandable, I\u2019ve been invested for a while but it took me a solid few weeks of research before I actually bought any stock last year. Patent trolls are usually the first thing that comes to mind in these situations but Netlist isn\u2019t some scam company, they\u2019re a real company with real innovation. \n\nA quick, rough breakdown of the Google history: \n\nNetlist that came to Google in 2006-ish trying to license their memory products to Google for their servers. Google said thanks but no thanks but then used their patented technology anyways. Netlist caught wind and sued Google in 2009. Google has been fighting this court case for 12 years now, their first defense was that the patent wasn\u2019t valid, but a USPTO PTAB recently came to the conclusion that the patent is valid. So Google should be on the hook for 12+ years of treble damages as well as court fees and possibly future royalties. Currently the judge in their case ordered both sides to try and talk it out and a joint decision was supposed to be turned into the judge just a few days ago so speculation is running rampant in the Netlist subreddit that an agreement was reach as nothing was filed on the deadline but who tf knows. Google has been fighting this tooth and nail for years and there are also cases against Micron and Samsung for similar infringement. \n\nNetlist has barely been staying above water this past decade, with most of its profits going towards fighting these legal cases and it seems like maybe the most recent win against SK Hynix may be the turning point. I can\u2019t say I know what\u2019s going to happen but things have definitely been trending in the right direction. Shareholders are basically betting that the last 12 years of missed profits from these giant tech companies will be realized very soon in triplicate with additional cash covering legal fees as well as forcing Google and others to pay royalties for future use of the technology. \n\nAs always, do your own research, I\u2019m not a patent lawyer nor an expert in computer memory technology.",
