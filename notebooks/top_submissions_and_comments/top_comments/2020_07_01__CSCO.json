        "body": "It is hard to tell what tech stocks and the NASDAQ will do but a bit of history is worth studying.\n\nIn 2000 Cisco was the giant of the internet and the internet was the giant of tech stocks. Every employee at Cisco was rich because they all got stock options (yes, including the janitors in those days) and the stock price had climbed from $10 in 98 to $33 in 99 and $79/sh in 2000. They did then sell and still do sell routers that were the backbone of the internet and CSCO was everyone's tech darling. I can't tell you how many Cisco employees had told me in spring of 2000 that they were not going to diversify until CSCO hit $100/sh. In Sept of 2001, their share price had dropped to $12/share. They still were the backbone of the internet but the internet and tech were no longer the darling of the Market. In Feb of 2009 they were at $14/sh and are today at $48/sh. So they today as an ongoing company still doing what it did and with a strong balance sheet are trading at roughly 2/3rds the price they were 20 years ago. That is what can happen to a really good tech company.\n\nBTW, CSCO is not the only one. Intel was at $74.88 in the fall of 2000 and is at $60/sh now and was running around in the $20's for most of the past 20 years. Still a great tech company doing great things.   And yes Intel employees also got rich on options.  I met with a Intel employee, a janitor, single, living in a trailer that was about to exercise $3 mm in net in the money INTC options and needed help with estate planning.   Those were the days.  A short edit:  In 2000 the estate tax began with only $675,000 of assets at death and it started just below 50% and quickly grew to 55%.   So you didn't need to be very wealthy to need estate tax planning.\n\nMicrosoft, one of today's tech darlings, was $50/sh in early 2000. It wandered around $25/share for 15 years until it again hit $50/sh in fall of 2015, fifteen long years later. The last 5 years have been good for it but will it stay at $200/sh?",

        "body": "Depends on how you categorize them.  They aren't software companies, but the general market sees them as tech companies, which is the companies that benefit so much.  The people hyping up Tesla so much, are arguing that it's a tech company, even though it makes cars.\n\nThe big 5 (MSFT/AAPL/AMZN/FB/GOOG) are definitely solid companies.  That doesn't change the fact that they've gotten overvalued.  Apple has grown 2.5x in value the past few years, but revenues have slowed, and profits really haven't changed much.  \n\nBelow that top tier you have a bunch of unprofitable $100-300M companies that have gotten hyped up.  And simply comparing it to 2000 without reference is ignoring it.  Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel were top 10 companies and weren't the single product late 90's product that you focus on.  Cisco still lost 90% of it's value, and still isn't back up there.  Microsoft still took 16 years to recover it's lost market cap.  \n\nHow am I throwing a tantrum.  It's a fact that the only time that valuation compared to trailing earnings was higher was the dot com bubble, and near right before great depression, the only time that market cap was higher as a percentage of GDP was dot com bubble.  There's tons of comparables that suggest this market is overvalued, and absolutely 0 that it's undervalued compared to history.",

I don\u2019t think you can put it in the same box as Cisco or Intel, hardware companies focused on providing a single service. \n\nMSFT has greater market share in the broader tech sector than either of those companies because it has expanded vertically (across sub sectors, for example gaming, office software, web services, laptops/hardware) instead of trying to expand horizontally (within its own sub sector) and has plans to continue to do so via its cloud services. I personally do not know who will \u201cwin\u201d the cloud web services sub sector but I know that MSFT won\u2019t lose purely due to its advantage in existing office software (MS Office integrates well with devices like Azure and Sharepoint making it more appealing to companies exploring the cloud).\n\nI love your take regarding the cyclical nature of those speculator dollars, but I think MSFT should be compared to AAPL, AMZN, and GOOG instead of CSCO and Intel. Maybe Shopify is a better comp for CSCO and Intel?",

But a number of friends have Teslas and each of them really like the car.  I also think that Tesla is going to be a viable car company long term and will do well in the future.\n\nThe problem is that the current price would only be justified if they were already profitable building and selling 5-6 mm cars per year and they don't do 10% of that and are not in any way profitable.   So anyone buying now is assuming they will find somebody that is a greater fool than they are to actually buy the stock from them at a price higher than $1500.\n\nIn 2000 I was young and stupid and financially had a great year.  Some of the companies I invested in that are still very successful and still leaders in their field were CSCO and JNPR.   2000 was the year of the internet and Cisco built all the routers for the internet worldwide.  Some ex Cisco employees had started Juniper and were building specialty routers that were pushing Cisco to improve.   All of that still is true and both companies are fabulously profitable and leaders in their field but today can be classified as old tech.  I paid $65/sh for CSCO and bought JNPR at $65, $83, and $115/sh.   Today CSCO is $48 and JNPR is $22 with no splits in the meantime.   Sometime you can be early and never recover.   That is where Tesla is now.   In 20 years 80% of the cars being sold will be EVs or H2 and every manufacturer will be making excellent products.  Tesla will be old tech and the 20 year olds now pumping Tesla will be 40 with 2 kids approaching college age and wondering about that $1500/sh stock they bought in 2020 that is worth $350/sh in 2040.",

Dividends cause taxable events and are taxed as income, a Roth lets your money grow tax free but you can't take out more than what you originally put in without penalties.\n\n3) Personally I hate the idea of partial shares of stocks/etfs.

Dividends are great, but you'd have made way more by putting your money into basically any top tech stock\n\nThat 13% that GLV pays out is annualized. Per month, they pay out roughly 1%. So essentially you get ~20% total growth over a 5 year period if you account for the decrease in stock price and the lower dividends you get throughout the last 5 years. Compare that to MSFT which is up 340% not including their small 1% dividend. or TSLA which is up 450% over the last 5 years. Or even a less hyped tech stock like Cisco is up 63% in the last 5 years. Or look at some more crazy stocks like Shopify which is up over **2000%** over the last 5 years. Yes you read that right\n\nDividend stocks are nice to diversify and get some consistent income, but it doesn't have anywhere near the upside that stocks have. To make a livable wage on dividend stocks, you'd have to have somewhere close to a $1M portfolio that is 100% invested into dividend stocks and that would return you like $60k if youre lucky before taxes\n\nEdit: I see I'm getting down votes, so maybe people just hate the tech stock hype, so ill look at other industries. O'Reily Autoparts is up 80% over the past 5 years. McDonalds is up 95% over the last 5 years. The list goes on\n\nSure there are also some very negative stocks, but dividend stocks will NEVER have the same growth opportunity that a regular stock has",

        "body": "It may also be worth looking at this from another angle. You've already shown an interest in some diversification, given your broad accumulation of tech stocks rather than betting on an individual one. And you list an interest in additional companies, 2 payment / financials and 3 healthcare related.\n\nA lot of the focus on long term investing is based on the minimization of downside. Ex: Suppose one company from your list of 7 tech stocks got banned from a country (we're seeing the beginnings of this with Huawei, likely expect some retaliation). How exposed are you to that negative news?\n\nBy constructing your own collection of 7+ tech stocks, you'll end up re-creating your own mini diversified ETF. By adding additional sectors into your investment portfolio, you're diversifying your risk from one sector into multiple. The end result is an actively managed portfolio where you do all the work. If you value your time / energy spent on managing stocks in this portfolio, you're effectively paying a fee for this actively managed portfolio. At the very least, you're spending your free time.\n\nSuppose you want to focus on a tech-heavy portfolio, but from a less actively managed standpoint. You can pick up an etf, like VGT for example, that focuses on just the tech sector. From the top asset holdings as of 6/30, that etf holds AAPL, MSFT, V, M, INTC, NVDA, Adobe, Cisco, Paypal, Salesforce with roughly 60% of it's assets. This is actually pretty well aligned with your current collection of stocks. There are individual sector ETFs, dividend growth ETFs, disruptive tech ETFs, and broad market ETFs. It's important to recognize when the collection of stocks you end up with actually aligns with a broader index. Arguably your current portfolio and intended direction seems like 40% VGT and 30% VHT. If later you want to add exposure to other parts of the economy, you might end up with a mix of multiple individual sector ETFs, which might end up having significant overlap with the S&amp;P500 or VTI (total market ETF). A long road to end up at a broad market ETF.\n\nThe important thing about ETFs that track benchmarks / indices is that the index is a moving target. Right now there are discussions about TSLA being included in the S&amp;P 500, which would kick some other company out. All the S&amp;P index tracking funds would adjust to this new definition of the index, and all passive investors would then be exposed to TSLA. This is true for many of the index tracking funds, the index definition can change and the funds change to reflect that.\n\nIn trying to outperform an index, you're making a bet that you can pick stocks that do better than the continually evolving indices that track economic growth of various sectors. It's always worth evaluating whether you can outperform the 7-9% long term avg the S&amp;P500 returns, and how much effort it takes for you to do that. By spending a lot of time and effort on stocks, you're spending time trying to improve performance on current savings. Your time could also be spent acquiring skills to increase your earning potential, increasing future savings.\n\nTL;DR: Upgrade your portfolio to sector ETFs, eventually to VTI.",

Most of these \"product\" companies are heavily filled with contractors and their numbers are almost equal to greater than the permanent employees.

I have seen this with Renesas mobile which had their modem come from Nokia acquisition which had completely failed in the market. They then was brought by Broadcom and everyone was laid off and was again resold to some Chinese company.",

I still remember the dot com bubble of the late 90s. I still remember how Microsoft didn't break even with its 1999 peak until 2015.\n\nIf you had invested in a basket of tech stocks back in late 1999, early 2000, chances are, you are only doing well now because of Amazon. Just look at what happened to [Pets.com](https://Pets.com), Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo, Netscape. Many stocks went to zero, others were bought for pennies on the dollar from their peak valuations. Still others took decades to break even or still hasn't broken even.\n\nThe thing is, even with Amazon, you could have bought at 95% off from its bubble peak if you had just waited a few years.\n\nThere may very well be a time to buy tech, but that time is not now. The time is when the bubble burst and the valuations are pricing in irrational pessimism. Amazon dropped from $113/share in March 2000 to $5/share in October 2001.\n\nThe future of mankind belongs to high tech, but right now there are a lot of posers that are using tech as nothing more than a talking point to scam money from investors. Wait until these guys go bankrupt, and the survivors are priced like they are going out of business, then buy.\n\nIn investing, being early is the same thing as being wrong. Many people think tech investing works like early bird gets the worm, but in reality it's the second mouse that gets the cheese. The first wave of investors will fund the build out of all these companies, then there will be a crash as it becomes obvious not all these companies can generate a profit. Then the companies will go bankrupt, consolidate, and the survivors learn how to be profitable. This happened with railroads, cars, aircraft, electronics, internet. Each one was a major tech revolution of its day, and each one also burned a ton of early investors.\n\nThe time to buy tech is 2 years after the crash. This gives enough time for the bankruptcies and consolidation to happen.\n\n\\---\n\nOh, and dump Air Canada. Please stay away from Airlines unless you are a better investor than Warren Buffet. Airline investing is not for newbies, it's literally one of the hardest sectors to be a successful investor in. If you scan the world's list of richest people, no one made their money in airlines. If you must, keep 1% at most in AC as play money. Almost no one is smart enough to make money in airlines, you are likely not an exception.",
