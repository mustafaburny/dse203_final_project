        "body": "It is hard to tell what tech stocks and the NASDAQ will do but a bit of history is worth studying.\n\nIn 2000 Cisco was the giant of the internet and the internet was the giant of tech stocks. Every employee at Cisco was rich because they all got stock options (yes, including the janitors in those days) and the stock price had climbed from $10 in 98 to $33 in 99 and $79/sh in 2000. They did then sell and still do sell routers that were the backbone of the internet and CSCO was everyone's tech darling. I can't tell you how many Cisco employees had told me in spring of 2000 that they were not going to diversify until CSCO hit $100/sh. In Sept of 2001, their share price had dropped to $12/share. They still were the backbone of the internet but the internet and tech were no longer the darling of the Market. In Feb of 2009 they were at $14/sh and are today at $48/sh. So they today as an ongoing company still doing what it did and with a strong balance sheet are trading at roughly 2/3rds the price they were 20 years ago. That is what can happen to a really good tech company.\n\nBTW, CSCO is not the only one. Intel was at $74.88 in the fall of 2000 and is at $60/sh now and was running around in the $20's for most of the past 20 years. Still a great tech company doing great things.   And yes Intel employees also got rich on options.  I met with a Intel employee, a janitor, single, living in a trailer that was about to exercise $3 mm in net in the money INTC options and needed help with estate planning.   Those were the days.  A short edit:  In 2000 the estate tax began with only $675,000 of assets at death and it started just below 50% and quickly grew to 55%.   So you didn't need to be very wealthy to need estate tax planning.\n\nMicrosoft, one of today's tech darlings, was $50/sh in early 2000. It wandered around $25/share for 15 years until it again hit $50/sh in fall of 2015, fifteen long years later. The last 5 years have been good for it but will it stay at $200/sh?",

        "body": "Depends on how you categorize them.  They aren't software companies, but the general market sees them as tech companies, which is the companies that benefit so much.  The people hyping up Tesla so much, are arguing that it's a tech company, even though it makes cars.\n\nThe big 5 (MSFT/AAPL/AMZN/FB/GOOG) are definitely solid companies.  That doesn't change the fact that they've gotten overvalued.  Apple has grown 2.5x in value the past few years, but revenues have slowed, and profits really haven't changed much.  \n\nBelow that top tier you have a bunch of unprofitable $100-300M companies that have gotten hyped up.  And simply comparing it to 2000 without reference is ignoring it.  Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel were top 10 companies and weren't the single product late 90's product that you focus on.  Cisco still lost 90% of it's value, and still isn't back up there.  Microsoft still took 16 years to recover it's lost market cap.  \n\nHow am I throwing a tantrum.  It's a fact that the only time that valuation compared to trailing earnings was higher was the dot com bubble, and near right before great depression, the only time that market cap was higher as a percentage of GDP was dot com bubble.  There's tons of comparables that suggest this market is overvalued, and absolutely 0 that it's undervalued compared to history.",

I don\u2019t think you can put it in the same box as Cisco or Intel, hardware companies focused on providing a single service. \n\nMSFT has greater market share in the broader tech sector than either of those companies because it has expanded vertically (across sub sectors, for example gaming, office software, web services, laptops/hardware) instead of trying to expand horizontally (within its own sub sector) and has plans to continue to do so via its cloud services. I personally do not know who will \u201cwin\u201d the cloud web services sub sector but I know that MSFT won\u2019t lose purely due to its advantage in existing office software (MS Office integrates well with devices like Azure and Sharepoint making it more appealing to companies exploring the cloud).\n\nI love your take regarding the cyclical nature of those speculator dollars, but I think MSFT should be compared to AAPL, AMZN, and GOOG instead of CSCO and Intel. Maybe Shopify is a better comp for CSCO and Intel?",

But a number of friends have Teslas and each of them really like the car.  I also think that Tesla is going to be a viable car company long term and will do well in the future.\n\nThe problem is that the current price would only be justified if they were already profitable building and selling 5-6 mm cars per year and they don't do 10% of that and are not in any way profitable.   So anyone buying now is assuming they will find somebody that is a greater fool than they are to actually buy the stock from them at a price higher than $1500.\n\nIn 2000 I was young and stupid and financially had a great year.  Some of the companies I invested in that are still very successful and still leaders in their field were CSCO and JNPR.   2000 was the year of the internet and Cisco built all the routers for the internet worldwide.  Some ex Cisco employees had started Juniper and were building specialty routers that were pushing Cisco to improve.   All of that still is true and both companies are fabulously profitable and leaders in their field but today can be classified as old tech.  I paid $65/sh for CSCO and bought JNPR at $65, $83, and $115/sh.   Today CSCO is $48 and JNPR is $22 with no splits in the meantime.   Sometime you can be early and never recover.   That is where Tesla is now.   In 20 years 80% of the cars being sold will be EVs or H2 and every manufacturer will be making excellent products.  Tesla will be old tech and the 20 year olds now pumping Tesla will be 40 with 2 kids approaching college age and wondering about that $1500/sh stock they bought in 2020 that is worth $350/sh in 2040.",

The obvious bubbles are in ZM, Shop, TSLA and others that really are one trick ponies.  But think about the problems in 2000.  We had just had the internet millenial clock challenge so everybody and been spending a lot on hardware.  And the market simply projected that growth forward for years.   It didn't happen.  Are we making the same mistake now with services and the Cloud?  There has to be a point where, like hardware, the services are mature and the crazy growth comes back to single digits.  When/if that happens these crazy multiples will come way down.   I certainly could be wrong but if that happens in cloud and services we are going to see a real problem in AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and MSFT just as happened with INTC, CSCO, JNPR and AMAT in 2000.",

The good ER is built into the run up. Almost always on good ER there is maybe a slight bump and then a sell up. Then a week or so later it has a good chance to run again. It's such a rookie mistake to think just because a company has a good ER the stock will go up\n\nCisco is a prime example of that. Cisco would beat earnings but their CEO might mention that they see stiff competition ahead in the earnings call. The stock will go down. They will miss on earnings but the CEO is positive and the stock goes up. \n\nIntel does not dominate production servers. I've worked in linux sys admin/devops/cloud eng for 21 years. AWS is slowly migrating away from Intel. Apple is making their own chip. AMD is destroying them. In fact Intel's next gen chip got delayed till 2022. I'm not sure if you are even paying attention to what's going on if you claim to work in the field. \n\n5g i can buy that but that's not gonna play out for years. People aren't pumped about 5g like they are with Tesla's master plan. \n\nIf you are long on Intel it might work out but NEVER expect good things to happen because a company beats earnings. I've seen it time and time again that smart money will run up a stock pre-earnings and then sell off. \n\nAlso I'd be willing to bet the gaming sector doesn't even show up on any of their radar at Intel. Cloud right now is what's pushing chip makers. \n\nHere's homework that I'd find interesting. Find all the AWS re:invent blog posts where they announce new instance types. See if there is a bump in AMD or Intel based on that. I'd be willing to bet there is better correlation there then ER",

(For tax purposes). Dividends cause taxable events and are taxed as income, a Roth lets your money grow tax free but you can't take out more than what you originally put in without penalties.\n\n3) Personally I hate the idea of partial shares of stocks/etfs.

Dividends are great, but you'd have made way more by putting your money into basically any top tech stock\n\nThat 13% that GLV pays out is annualized. Per month, they pay out roughly 1%. So essentially you get ~20% total growth over a 5 year period if you account for the decrease in stock price and the lower dividends you get throughout the last 5 years. Compare that to MSFT which is up 340% not including their small 1% dividend. or TSLA which is up 450% over the last 5 years. Or even a less hyped tech stock like Cisco is up 63% in the last 5 years. Or look at some more crazy stocks like Shopify which is up over **2000%** over the last 5 years. Yes you read that right\n\nDividend stocks are nice to diversify and get some consistent income, but it doesn't have anywhere near the upside that stocks have. To make a livable wage on dividend stocks, you'd have to have somewhere close to a $1M portfolio that is 100% invested into dividend stocks and that would return you like $60k if youre lucky before taxes\n\nEdit: I see I'm getting down votes, so maybe people just hate the tech stock hype, so ill look at other industries. O'Reily Autoparts is up 80% over the past 5 years. McDonalds is up 95% over the last 5 years. The list goes on\n\nSure there are also some very negative stocks, but dividend stocks will NEVER have the same growth opportunity that a regular stock has",

Every employee at Cisco was rich because they all got stock options (yes, including the janitors in those days) and the stock price had climbed from $10 in 98 to $33 in 99 and $79/sh in 2000.  They did then sell and still do sell routers that were the backbone of the internet and CSCO was everyone's tech darling.  I can't tell you how many Cisco employees had told me in spring of 2000 that they were not going to diversify until CSCO hit $100/sh.  In Sept of 2001, their share price had dropped to $12/share.  They still were the backbone of the internet but the internet and tech were no longer the darling of the Market.  In Feb of 2009 they were at $14/sh and are today at $48/sh.   So they today as an ongoing company still doing what it did and with a strong balance sheet are trading at roughly 2/3rds the price they were 20 years ago.   That is what can happen to a really good tech company.\n\nBTW, CSCO is not the only one.  Intel was at $74.88 in the fall of 2000 and is at $60/sh now and was running around in the $20's for most of the past 20 years.  Still a great company doing great things.\n\nMicrosoft, one of today's tech darlings, was $50/sh in early 2000.  It wandered around $25/share for 15 years until it again hit $50/sh in fall of 2015, fifteen long years later.  The last 5 years have been good for it but will it stay at $200/sh?",

Many market participants believe today that we are at a paradigm shift where growth/tech is the new way of investing and value is antiquated but he relates that several times in the last 100 years investors believed that hype stocks decoupled from fundamentals were the way forward and it always inevitably ended. \n\nHe\u2019s relates that the common reasoning is that \u201cwell investing in high PE growth stocks just works\u201d and it does for some time period (growth has had a great run for many years) but inevitably they will couple back to fundamentals typically when the company starts to mature.\n\nRemember that back in 2000 CIsco was the darling super growth/tech stock and people talked about it just as they do apple or tesla or Netflix today. With Cisco the company was not mismanaged or anything like that: they simply ran out of growth and when the market finally figured that out the price crashed to the point where it still hasn\u2019t recovers today. Meanwhile CIsco still runs today as a well run concern. Now it\u2019s just valued correctly.",

You cant say that with any of the tech/growth companies.

        "body": "\"Wow. These are great insights. Thank you so much! \"\n\nNo problem.\n\n\" I just thought that all ETFs helped mitigate most risk, but that\u2019s not always the case.\"\n\nNope. There are very few actively managed funds that really do attempt to sidestep downturns to some degree and fewer that have a decent track record doing it. One is little-known mutual fund Provident Trust (PROVX, https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2018/12/provident-trust-strategy-fund-provx/, \"Investors remember that this period includes the 2007-09 financial crisis. What they may not know is that in 2008, the fund lost 21.0% compared to the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 37.0% decline. That ranked the fund in the 1st percentile.\n\nWhile paralyzed investors and central banks struggled, the fund held between 61% in cash and fixed income instruments at the end of \u201908 and 70% at the market bottom in March \u201909. That positioning dramatically reduced the fund\u2019s losses compared to the market, while giving it ample \u201cdry powder\u201d for the gains that followed. During Provident\u2019s tenure as portfolio manager to September 30, 2018, PROVX gained +389% cumulatively with a 79.8% average month-end allocation to equities vs. +348% for the always fully invested S&amp;P 500.\")\n\nSo that's an example of a fund where managers will start to move to the sideline if they think it's prudent to do so. Not entirely - you're still going to lose some money - just probably not as much as the market in a downturn. \n\nIf it's a bad year most funds are going to have a bad year and the letter will be basically, \"Hey, sorry it was a bad year.\"\n\nStock index funds are going to go down in a downturn whatever the index does.\n\n\"I remember seeing a video interview of this analyst on Robinhood who said that the tech bubble right now is bigger than the dot com bubble was in the 2000s.\"\n\nI don't think this is the dot com bubble again. I do think that after the bottom in March, you saw a widening of the gap between the performance of the market and the performance of certain growth themes that were either less impacted by this or benefited from it. E-commerce, digital payments, cloud, software, telehealth and the \"stay at home\" names (Peloton, Netflix, etc.) Even the \"buy a home online\" names, as things like Zillow finally started to seem to have a sustained gain for once as people are now apparently comfortable buying houses virtually. People basically ran towards what they thought benefited today and I think what many people thought the future is going to look like post-crisis. I think what's been very frustrating on this sub this year has been this focus on the negative, when I think a compelling topic really is, what are the themes post-crisis that will be big? How does the world change in the next 3-5 years? **I think what's done extraordinarily well this year is in part due to the result of people asking themselves that question and investing accordingly.** The ARKW and ARKF have themes listed on the main pages for those funds and you look at those themes and those have absolutely been the places to be this year.\n\nIn the short-term, I have a hard time believing that the correct answer to concerning statistics will continue to be \"just buy more growth (Zoom, etc) stocks.\" At some point that will either stop working and broad market pullback or there will be a solution to this crisis and when that happens you're going to see a considerable rotation out of the Ark-style growth stocks and into impacted names that have lagged, but I think that is going to be buying opportunity for growth. \n\nYou've saw this sort of \"tale of two markets\" again on Thursday and Friday of last week: Thursday the Dow was down 300 but growth stocks were ramping. There was the Gilead news on Friday and the Dow was up 300 but many of the growth stocks were down.\n\nMuch of my own portfolio is similarly aggressive growth to Ark or Scottish Mortgage and I would not be surprised if at some point in the near-term much of my portfolio lost 20% in a hurry. The problem is when: I thought there was going to be a pullback in May - didn't happen. I have a long-term view on what I own so I may trim a little here, add a little there at times but happy not doing much of anything for long stretches. Additionally, I'm not a major market timer or do I have any desire to be. But after a really fantastic first half of the year, I really don't think that I'm going to have a repeat of that kind of performance in the back half of the year and I'm sitting here fully expecting a considerable pullback. If I manage to get through the second half of the year without a considerable pullback in my portfolio, I will be 1) stunned and 2) have to question whether this time is actually somehow different. I've said recently that I did a lot in March and April and then have since gone back to doing not much and am happy with long stretches of doing little-to-nothing. I'm okay with investing in aggressive growth stocks, but where I'm increasingly cautious is where/how much I add to things. \n\nBut, long story short, I think there are compelling long-term growth themes and growth may continue up for a while, but it is overextended and a considerable correction at some point in the relatively near-term would be so not surprising that it would be pretty remarkable imo if it didn't happen. Broadly, if you're not risk tolerant (and there's nothing wrong with that), then the ARK funds would not be something I'd recommend (great when things are fantastic for growth, going to be rough when it's not - they've had an amazing year, but people have to be cognizant of things capable of having those kinds of gains in that short a time period are also capable of going the wrong direction just as swiftly, if not swifter) or at the most would be a *tiny* bit to have exposure to some themes long-term - but I'd be particularly cautious about where you bought them.",

It went up to 4.50 at one point. \n\nI then held on to SQ puts too long and lost most of the gains there. \n\nCLDR calls have murdered me until today. That's really the worst one ha. \n\nBut yeah that was the reasoning on BABA. The Chinese stocks are going nuts tho. I loaded up on some Tencent calls for August on the cheap. UOA on them too.
