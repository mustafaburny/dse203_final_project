So I'll buy shit like Zoom, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, whatever.\n\nI think all these plays are FUCKING RETARDED. But going with my \"smart logic\" hasn't been working.

I'm not saying that theatres will go away forever, but AMC stonk is fucked.\n\n2019 quarter end June earned $1.4 billion. This year that will be nothing. Nil.Their quarterly operating cash flows per quarter are around $200M. That will be nil for Q ending June 2020.\n\nAs at December 31, AMC had $100mil cash on hand.They will be saving on employee costs, cutting capex, etc, however they will not be saving on rent nor any prior purchase agreements made for food, etc. If they cancelled those with their suppliers then that would put a huge damper on their supply chain relationship.\n\nTheir quarterly lease costs alone are around $250 mil. AKA they cannot even pay one quarter's worth. Sure, they can defer this for a bit, but it will take a long fucking time for AMC to catch up with the payments when people will not even think about hitting the movies this summer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMC has always had an abysmal current ratio and relies on quarterly cash flows, which will not be coming in the future. Especially since around 1/4 of their revenue comes from European countries who will be slower and more prudent to reopen.\n\nUpon imminent bankruptcy, they have $580 mil in short term lease obligations and $5B long term - those landlords might get cucked.\n\nAdd $800mil in other current debt and $4.7B in corporate borrowings, and that leaves fucking nothing for shareholders. Their asset ratio, removing a retarded $4.7B in goodwill which makes up 1/3 of their assets, is negative $3.5B.\n\nThis will be a penny stock upon restructuring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm buying $1 September puts",

No revenue for months.  Decreased capacity in theaters since they\u2019ll need to spread things out.  Decreased visitors (really should be no visitors but we see how stupid some people are).  \nThe IV on puts is double what it is on calls.  Had to laugh at people buying calls on strikes that are higher than the pre covid $7.50 a share.  The January \u201821 $1 puts are selling for $0.30.  Tells you where people think this is heading.  \nTheir 2019 net income was ($150M).  If they lost that much last year what would they do this year?  They\u2019ll lose $750M-$1B.  \nTheir balance sheet is ugly.  $5B of goodwill.  Expect them to have to write off a ton of that.  $5B of long term debt.  I don\u2019t know if they own any property out of their $3B net PPE but if they do they\u2019ll need to sell it. And if that PPE is all non property they are even more fucked.  \nTheir FCF was $61M last year.  They\u2019ll bleed every last penny this year.  \nBut people know this all and yet the stock price is where it is.  Tipping point will be when Cinemark reopens mid June and we see what type of demand there is and if bad then I\u2019d expect AMC to get crushed.
