F5 suggest reverse-proxying related requests to their server but it seems the CRA decided to link to their backend directly.\n\nSo in short, it doesn't look compromised. However, I'd say the amount of external JavaScript loaded from external domains is concerning (hCaptcha, Device ID+, Adobe Dynamic Tag Manager) and posses a risk. But it's a risk the CRA has decided to take and isn't a vulnerability on its own.",

Unstable and unreliable app, RH became completely unusable, multiple times during the Covid March 2020 crash. When other brokers stayed operational\n\n4.) Payment for order flow. RH makes money buy selling your buy orders to high frequency trade hedge funds, who are then able to \"frontrun\" the stock, meaning they can buy the stock a milisecond before you do, thus raising the price your market orders get filled. So you're actually paying more for stocks on RH than if you used another broker.\n\n5.) Conflict of interest, RH primary customer, Citadel was caught illegally naked shorting meme stock. During the meme stock frenzy, RH users weren't allowed to buy shares of certain companies, whereas with other brokers you could.\n\n6.) RH has history of being fined by the SEC, and countless lawsuits regarding not having the best user's interest in mind.\n\n7.) Glitchy Options display. RH falsely displayed losses for a young options trader who was actually in the green. He ended up committing suicide because of it.\n\n8.) If you care about margin %, Interactive Brokers and M1 Finance both have cheaper margin %\n\n9.) Not good for buying Crypto. You don't have access to your wallet keys, and you're not allowed to transfer your crypto to anew wallet, so you're forced to liquidate it if you want to move it elsewhere, which creates a taxable event. Also questions have raised if RH really holds the crypto that you \"own\" on their app.\n\nAlso it's not 2019 anymore, it's 2021. Countless apps have clean simple UI.

Meanwhile, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have great back end infrastructure, but terrible, outdated UIs. I used to think what those companies did was the hard part, and Robinhood just put some paint on a pig. I joked it was a race to see who could fix themselves up faster. But it's been almost a year, and those old school websites are as bad as ever.\n\nVanguard's bad UI is somewhat on purpose, and Schwab bought TDA and Thinkorswim. But Fidelity is an embarrassment. Active Trader Pro is the single oldest and worst performing piece of software I've had the misfortune of interacting with in the past decade. Their mobile app is terrible as well, though I commend them for trying to introduce a nicer looking, but still barely functional Robinhood knockoff beta.\n\nBasically, good design is priceless. But since an investor's job is to put a price on things, I'll just say it's very valuable. Haters always said that Steve Jobs was just the pretty boy frontman, but there are a lot of computer companies and only one is the largest corporation on the planet by simply coasting on Jobs's designs. It's hard to write good code or build a brokerage, but it's almost impossible to create good design.\n\nBasically, leaps on $MLKN",

They are in a dying industry and have been unsuccessful in pivoting away from fossil fuels to alternative sources of revenue. b.) They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",
