This is absolutely awesome and with those tools anyone can achieve their desired wealth and dreams. My opinion anyway.\n\nThe problem with that is it's completely unrealistic. To be a _good_ investor _consistently_ over _long periods of time_ is damn near a full time job. It's not for everyone. In fact, it's not for the vast majority of people. They're better off in an index fund. \n\nI imagine we'd agree that general financial literacy would be a great thing to teach early. Most people don't have the first clue and it's a shame.",

        "body": "Eh, I hear you, but this isn't an honest accounting of it.\n\nTesla's pulling some strings with accounting, but it's not like they can't pull the strings the other way, and they have plenty of time to do so. They're going through rapid, rapid expansion right now, and the potential for them from pivots is very real.\n\n\\- Their battery tech is way ahead. Right now they're supply constrained, but ramping up quickly. I would fully expect them to make an almost 1:1 switch from revenue from green credits to being a battery *supplier* as other car manufacturers get into EVs.\n\n\\- They already operate the largest public charging network in the world. This actually *benefits* them as other manufacturers move into EV.\n\n\\- They also benefit from [the Starbucks effect](https://aipcommercialrealestate.com/the-starbucks-effect) as other companies move into the EV market and drive EV acceptance.\n\n\\- They're making a heavy, heavy bet on autonomous driving. Right now, I put them behind Waymo, but ahead of most other players in the market. And they're absolutely 100% ahead when it comes to eventually building fleet-scale autonomous, and financially way, way ahead as they pursue doing it with lease returns. (Waymo will get to an autonomous fleet quicker, but Tesla will do it cheaper.)\n\nAll of this means you can't evaluate Tesla as if it's an automaker running in the red. It's an automaker, *plus* a battery supplier, *plus* a fueling station operator, *plus* a potential rideshare operator. Plus like five other things.\n\nMeanwhile, car revenue for them is constrained from the supply side, not the demand side. They have **four** factories under construction at this very moment\u2014 Nevada, Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin \u2014 with yet another one on the way. \n\nAnd those green credits? Cadillac isn't even coming out with the Lyriq until 2022. Volkswagen is having production issues and hasn't delivered a single ID3 yet, despite promising 100,000 this year. That's how far behind everyone else is.\n\nYes, everything you've said is completely valid. But it's an incomplete picture.\n\nThat said, are they still overvalued? Yes, absolutely.",

The CCP doesn't specifically target any American companies.\n\n&gt;We should reciprocate.\n\nShould we copy their Great Firewall as well and ban any apps that doesn't allow government backdoor for data access? Winnie the Pooh can unilaterally ban any site/app he doesn't like, and that's what makes their government terrible, do we really want our President to have *exactly* the same type of power?\n\nIf there are privacy/national security concerns, then legislate through Congress and punish all apps/software that doesn't abide by the law, be it Facebook or WeChat. \n\nHowever I feel extremely uncomfortable that \"national security concern\" is now just the magic keyword that gives the President unlimited power to do whatever he wants. What's next, banning CNN and MSNBC because the FBI \"uncovered\" some connection between the networks and some foreign government?\n\nFurthermore speaking from personal experience, WeChat is used by millions of Chinese Americans as a chat app, very often with friends/relatives back in China. It's very similar to Line and WhatsApp in that regard. Using this logic Trump can ban all phone calls or emails or texts to China because there is a risk of the CCP government monitoring on their side.",

She's kinda giving me an ultimatum, relationship or lose her forever. Sucks because if life had worked out in a different way that placed us in the same city for an extended period of time, I could probably see myself marrying this girl. But it's not meant to be right now, I guess, a relationship isn't going to happen. My way of life + career choice + the distance just isn't compatible the way I see it. She wants to talk tonight and I don't think it's going to go well. I'm not great at handling goodbyes. \n\nI dunno why I'm posting this here but thanks for being hilarious, guys. Reading this sub helps keep my mind off of things. Although I'd probably rather stomach the losses some of you take than this one. Financial scars hear, emotional trauma is forever",

I usually wake up about 2:30am.\n\nThere is a section called Top Gainers. You can choose categories such as Pre Market, After hours, 5 Minutes, 1 Day, 5 Days, 1 Month, 3 Months, 52 Weeks.\n\nWhen i wake up i go through the Pre Market and 1 Day category. The 1 Day lets you know what was running the day before and the Pre Market will let you know whats starting to run that day after WB hours start up. If i see the same stock on the 1 day and the PM slots i write it down and pull up the chart on WB. You can choose to include PM and After hours on the charts. The same stock on the 1 day and the PM chart is a strong indicator that this stock still has some gas in it. Sometimes just the top 3-4 on the PM movers are good targets to follow.\n\nI'll pick 2-4 of the stocks that i like for the day and in the first 5-10 minutes after WB opens you can see which ones are starting to run. If i feel good about i will buy about 5 of it and watch it for a few more minutes to see if it keeps climbing while i watch the charts. \n\nIf it keeps trending up ill buy more and then set a stop loss about 7% below my entry. If it bombs out right away i walk away. You have to learn to let it go if it drops. If it keeps climbing i adjust my stop loss along with it.\n\nThis strategy has served me pretty well so far. I know that the motto is \"dont chase.\" and while i normally agree with it the condition of the market right now is that we have multiple +50% daily runners so getting a piece of that action is totally doable. You dont need to catch the entire ride up but you can easily 10-20% of a run. A few months from now it wont be the same... but for now the getting is good so why not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this information helps some people out. I started out with 3k back in June and have more than tripled that. I know its not lambo money but hey im still new and learning haha",
