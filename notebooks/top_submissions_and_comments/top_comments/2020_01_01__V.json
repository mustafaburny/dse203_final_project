If you have some money to play with, I suggest making the investment and using it as a learning experience. But here are some thoughts:\n\n1) Price (as a $ amount) is irrelevant so long as you have enough money to buy one share. A $2 share and a $2,000 share can have equal growth prospects. What matters is the valuation; price to earnings, enterprise value to ebitda, etc.\n\n2) The dividend yield for visa looks fairly low. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing\u2014many good stocks don\u2019t pay a dividend. \n\n3) Historical performance isn\u2019t especially meaningful on its own. If all of the conditions that have helped produce historical performance are still in place, then it\u2019s more meaningful, but otherwise a historically good investment could sour tomorrow if certain fundamentals are now absent.\n\nNow here\u2019s why it\u2019s probably a good investment: Visa performing well, has something of a monopoly (for now) on the payments space in the US, and given its profitability and competitive moat isn\u2019t too outrageously valued.\n\nAs you keep learning: try reading and understanding financials statements, seek to figure out how the business works and sustains a competitive advantage, explore potential threats to the business, learn about valuation and pricing to determine what price range is fair for this stock and what your potential exit price might be.",

It\u2019s a trading platform u can use on your phone and they don\u2019t charge fees for trades. Most other platforms charge $5-$10 a trade. \n\nYou can start small and sink away $50-$100 a week or so until your portfolio grows without paying pesky fees. \n\n\n\nThe thing with penny stocks is it\u2019s a huge gamble. Some pop, most don\u2019t. Additionally, you really have to do solid research on a company. \n\nI know you don\u2019t want to hear this, it\u2019s not as fun. But sinking your money into ETFs or a solid stock such as Visa or Nike right now is a good way to start.\n\nGet a few stocks like those destined for slow bust steady growth, and once you have anywhere from 1K to 10K in those fuck around with penny stocks\n\nIf you want to roll the dice, I\u2019d sink like 5%-20% of your portfolio on penny stocks when you get a solid base built. \n\nSorry to ramble on , good luck trading!
