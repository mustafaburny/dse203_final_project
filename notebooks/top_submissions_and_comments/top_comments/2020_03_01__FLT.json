The problem with having 10 stocks is on average you need to research 1 hour per week per stock at a minimum. I'm not sure if you want to spend 10 hours a week on a $10k portfolio. Others will say you can just buy solid stocks that are low maintenance and you don't need to do research. I say that stocks can become high maintenance and by then its too late and they drop like a rock (see GE, IBM, ect)",
