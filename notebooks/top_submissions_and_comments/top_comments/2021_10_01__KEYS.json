        "body": "You are obviously very new to crypto and so I will give you a quick summary of the basics. In short, no, you will not own real crypto with WealthSimple. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage wallets, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can easily confirm their legitimacy and I have been stacking free Satoshis for a few years now.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not completely insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your crypto\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the crypto-asset, it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your adjusted cost base (ACB) for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your ACB for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really crypto itself, but rather, it is in the application of blockchain technology which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the crypto-assets itself simply have a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Moreover, investing is simply risk management and from a risk-adjusted returns perspective, having some excellent crypto-projects is better than not having any at all while I personally see this as the 12th sector in the overall global market index.\r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

        "body": "BTC.X is the ticker symbol to track the USD/BTC pair.  Typically you would use a crypto exchange to buy and sell, like Kraken or Coinbase although more brokerages are starting to offer crypto holding services.  If you want to HODL your keys, you need to have a Bitcoin wallet on your phone or desktop in order to transfer the coins.  It's technical.  You pay fees when you buy and sell and also when you transfer to wallets.  Typically not available for registered accounts like TFSA or RRSP.\n\nBTCX is the ticker for Galaxy Bitcoin ETF available only to Canadians in your brokerage account.  They hold a certain amount of Bitcoins and your shares represent a certain interest in these Bitcoins.  The fees are structured similar to other ETF.  You will not be allowed to take ownership of any coins.   There are two versions of this product, one is hedged to the USD and the other is not.  The biggest advantage is that these are available inside your TFSA/RRSP.  There are other variations of Bitcoin ETF's in Canada:  BTCC, EBIT, BTCQ and probably more.  They each have their own configuration and you will have to research each one to decide if it's right for your investment objectives.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you are the custodian (unless you leave your balance on the Crypto Exchange, which has it's own set of issues).  If you lose your computer or phone with no backup, you have no recourse.  No one can help you.  Your coins and wealth are gone.  It's 100% your responsibility to ensure your assets are secure and safe.\n\nWith BTCX (or any other holding ETF) you are paying for custody services via their MER fees.  You could possibly sue or have other recourse if they get hacked or do an exitscam, but, of course, it would still be a bad time.\n\nBe aware some ETF's don't actually hold Bitcoin such as the new American ETF: BITO.  They only hold futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "Everything is digital now.  All the fed needs to do is hit some keys and suddenly everyone's money is right back where it was.  That's not at question here.\n\nThe issue is everyone who has investments has basically been pushed into Real Estate and Equities due to fed policy giving incredible gains to those two asset types.  Now, it wasn't really their goal to do this, but it was a side effect of \"saving\" the economy in 2008 and 2020.  \n\nSo that really leaves two paths forward.  One where the fed continues to support those assets - and there are many, many reasons they would want to do this.  And one where the fed does not.  \n\nThe issue is, the fed didn't really mean to support those assets that much, but they didn't see they had any other choice due to the crisis.  In 2008 systemic collapse was a real threat.  Now we're at a point where there is enormous pressure to support these assets simply because no one wants to see them crash.  And that's dangerous because all it does is kick the can down the road and potentially create a bigger problem later.    \n\n\nOn the other hand, if the fed doesn't support those assets at their current high levels, it's very possible they could drop significantly - or slowly.  Especially if rates are raised to combat inflation.  If we saw the S&amp;P drop say 5-10% per year for \\~5ish years what would happen?  Who would hold onto stocks losing 6% a year when they could buy bonds yielding 3%?   Who would buy houses when their prices were declining and they could save money by waiting?  How much house could people even afford if companies are spending less on payroll (remember their stocks are falling so they're in cut costs mode) and rates are double where they are now?   And don't forget, housing can enter a self-reinforcing loop where prices fall, causing people to walk away, causing prices to fall further, causing more people to walk away ect.  \n\n  \nWho knows if this stuff will really happen, but we haven't really had a meaningful crash that the government hasn't stepped in and been as accommodating as possible for in quite some time.  Clearly the fed's plan is to \\*very\\* slowly back off and begin raising rates.  But last time we tried that we had a taper tantrum, so it can only be accomplished \\*very\\* slowly during periods of high growth.  If inflation continues to rise then the fed is going to have to choose between raising rates faster and potentially causing a stall, and between keeping things accommodating (low rates) and allowing inflation which benefits basically everyone who owns these assets now.",

You can hold it in your TFSA for tax sheltered gains.\n\nIf it's in regards to safety, you're better off holding BTC directly in a hard wallet off the exchange. The saying of \"not your keys not your coins\" is very real in crypto. Look at QuadrigaCX as an example of what can happen when you don't hold your own keys. Hundreds of millions of dollars disappear essentially overnight. It also has the benefit of trading 24/7 vs just during market hours, so in theory if there's a massive crash on a Sunday and you want out quickly you can. \n\nPersonally, I split it and hold both. The appeal of tax free gains is strong enough to at least partially outweigh the risk of not holding the keys. \n\nIf you want to see how closely it tracks BTC in pricing check out bitbo.io",

You indicate that you have made almost 100% gains. Excellent. But, we have been in a roaring bull market ever since the Covid crash of March 2020, so a LOT of people have made some impressive gains during this time, by simply going long SPY or QQQ options or 3x ETFs after pullbacks and selling into overbought rallies. You do a LOT of work - seems like it's your full time job. Most traders or investors have other things going in their life - so they only have so much time to spare for trading. Just being realistic. In my experience, keeping things simple and being very careful about your leverage are keys to long term success in the market. When traders watch too many things they can get lost in a maze of over choice and conflicting signals, indicators, advice.  Also, one can make a lot of money fast trading options and lose all of that money even faster in a series of bad trades. Leverage can be a wonderful thing and a horrible thing. There is an old Wall Street saying that goes \"don't confuse brains for a bull market.\" There are many economic indicators that are suggesting a possible end to the current bull market - so you will have to adjust accordingly, or, we will see another post here that you lost $500,000. When the bull market of the late 1990's ended I lost more than $500,000, after starting with 30k and building that up to a million dollars. So, I have \"been there, done that\".",

I do solid state physics, and there is funny coincidence - producers of devices I like and use generally show good performance at a stock market.

Those 4 people would not know who else holds the keys, or even if their keys work, how much is in the wallet etc. they would not be able to communicate with each other or collude because they shouldn't even know each other. The coins also move around and are lent out so the borrowers might have control or the exchanges where arbitrage bots are doing their thing. \n\nThey aren't all sitting in one wallet ever where 2 teenage brothers who drive lambos and live in a hotel have control over, that would be a very bad system. Some of the keys constantly change and are held in vaults with cameras and security. It's impressive and well thought out in a proper system.\n\nSecurity audits look for these things and verify the programming. \n\n&gt;Audits exist, of course, but they can only audit the system actually holds bitcoin it says it does and that it's secure against hacking. Not against internal rug pulls.\n\nWhat arw you trying to say? An audit looks for redflags and security holes that can enable rug pulls.

It's far more secure and it's even quicker than pulling up an OTP code for sites that support the FIDO protocol directly, such as Coinbase and Gemini. For sites that don't support FIDO and still use OTP (what Authy/Google Auth is), Yubikey can do those too with a Yubico Authenicator app which requires your key to generate the codes.\n\nYubico's site has excellent setup guides and FAQs to get things going. The only downside is the expense, as you want to buy multiple keys to have a backup incase you lose your primary. But, if you've got a decent chunk of money to protect, spending a hundred bucks for a couple Yubikeys is well worth the vastly improved security.\n\nTradFi is so behind crypto on security models, it's insane. For Fidelity, TDA, and my three banks, they *all* only have SMS 2FA as an option, not even OTP. And for my trading platform, ThinkOrSwim, it doesn't have any 2FA at all to login and make trades.

        "body": "A lot of people are investing in crypto-ETFs without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual crypto. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. That is a pretty big risk even though they can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage wallets, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can easily confirm their legitimacy and I have been stacking free Satoshis for a few years now.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not completely insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your crypto\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the crypto-asset, it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your adjusted cost base (ACB) for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your ACB for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really crypto itself, but rather, it is in the application of blockchain technology which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the crypto-assets itself simply have a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Moreover, investing is simply risk management and from a risk-adjusted returns perspective, having some excellent crypto-projects is better than not having any at all while I personally see this as the 12th sector in the overall global market index.\r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

Saying \u201cskills\u201d would imply you have one already. Simply due to your lack of personal accountability and lack of ability implied by your ridiculous proposal , I highly doubt you have any skill at all. You obviously have no critical thinking skills, so let me help you out and guide you through your first thinking exercise. First, we have to define what a \u201cgood market strategy\u201d is to you. Hopefully for your sake, it means it will be profitable and give you a healthy return on your $10,000 investment. So healthy in fact, that you can brag to whoever it is that gives you attention, how great your \u201cmarket skills\u201d are. Ok, let\u2019s just say for arguments sake, you find this person with this strategy you seek. This brings us to the first question- Why, I repeat, WHY would they need your $10,000? If it would give you handsome returns, enough to brag about, wouldn\u2019t they have been making those returns for themselves. Therefore making your offer not very enticing and seem quite minuscule to them. So, now you have some sound reasoning as to why that would never happen, let\u2019s take it a step further. Not only are you not going to benefit from your offer, it\u2019s probably going to damage you. All you\u2019re going to find is scammers that will offer you these \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d strategies that, to any real trader , would be obviously bogus and therefore only lose you more money. So, I\u2019ll tell you again, DO THE WORK YOURSELF. Then and only then can you take ownership of the skill you so desire. There are no shortcuts in the market. The market is unforgiving and wipe people out on a daily basis. What makes you think you can just waltz right in the front door and beat the market? Why, just because you want it? The market doesn\u2019t care about what you want or how you feel. It will smoke you because it can. The ONLY way you beat the market is with skills YOU develop over time with though hard work. This shit is not easy and you can\u2019t buy your success. This is probably the best advice your gonna get from here. I can\u2019t believe I wasted so much of my own time writing this. I could have made twice your offer in the length of time it took me to write this. I would ask for $10,000 for this advice because you wanted the keys to the castle, and I just gave you the map, however I have done the hard work and I found the keys. I don\u2019t need your money. Seriously, do yourself a favor and unless you are willingly go all in and do whatever it takes and are willing to make valuable sacrifices, don\u2019t even try the market. Stay far away. If you try to cheat, or half-ass the market, you WILL lose.  Best of luck to you.",

        "body": "Well, in my case I was using Authy, right? I am also heavily involved in crypto, where there is no FDIC, no fraud prevention departments, no auto-blocking of transactions for suspected fraud, no 2-5 day processing time for me to call customer service to get my money back before it moves, etc etc. So, for me, \"being my own bank\" is a real thing, with real money, so 2FA is critical.\n\nAlright, so here's what I was doing with Authy. Authy can be used in place of Google Auth, and I was using it because it is tied to your phone number and provides the ability to do encrypted backups on Twilio's servers. I was always paranoid about what happens if I lose my phone, and I need quick access to my accounts, so that's why I used the backup option in Authy. So I had my main phone, and two backup phones that I always updated Authy in tandem with the primary phone. This way, I had quick access backups should I lose my phone. But there's another threat with Authy, since it's tied to my phone number, theoretically there's a risk of SIM swap attacks where someone steals my phone number and accesses my Authy backups through the phone number. They'd have to know the backup password, of course, but I just didn't like that theortically it's possible.\n\nFrom what I've already described, I felt pretty fucking safe. I have great password practices, so I didn't think it was very likely at all for my Authy to be compromised. And that's why I was lazy and never made the switch for years. But... technically... it *could* be remotely compromised. It's non-zero, no matter how small a chance, it's non-zero. And as someone deep in crypto where there is no protection other than my own OPSEC, that bothered me.\n\nWith the security key, there's no way to remotely get at it. None. You need the actual key, in hand. The natural question is, what if someone wrench attacks me and steals the key physically, which is a real possibility. The key also has a password on it, so they'd need to take my key, and know the PIN to unlock the key to use it. This could happen to me with my phone and Authy's PIN as well, so what's the difference? At this point we're at a very similar state of the Authy risk with the critical difference that *remote* attacks are impossible. After using it, after producing mulitple backup keys and storing them in various places (a safe, a bank box, a trusted relative, etc), I now have complete confidence in my security. That super small non-zero chance of a remote compromise is gone, and I like that it's gone. I feel way better no matter how small the chance was.\n\nEven if I'm drunk and fall for a phishing attack, say by hitting a link to coinbasi.com instead of coinbase and entering my OTP code, and then getting my account emptied by the phisher (which is the story posted to a crypto sub that prompted me to make the swithc) -- even if I derped and fucked up that bad, I'm still safe. No phisher can get my 2FA remotely, no matter how dumb I am, no matter if I got phished.\n\nIt's a small difference, but, for me, with a heavy crypto involvement, it's a big increase in peace of mind. It might not be for everyone, but I operate in an industry with no safeguards except my own diligence. And the key helps remove some of the remaining risk. It's that simple. It's an improvement, and I'll gladly take it.",
