The list of oldest continuing businesses frequently includes farms, taverns, law firms, and boutique banks.\n\nI am going to ignore them here and limit this to public companies.\n\nI would bet on companies that have a full VRIO moat \u2014 access to valuable, rare, and inimitable resources paired with the organisational capability to extract value from them.\n\nI am looking for companies that exercise control over their supply chain, manage complex problems (including logistics), and can maintain customer loyalty through virtuous cycles such as inertia and cultural transmission.\n\n**Universal Music Group** is the market share leader in the global oligopoly of music licensing, and renews its franchise by maintaining a pipeline of organic or \u2018manufactured\u2019 musical talent. UMG at the moment can only be accessed through PSTH.\n\n**Disney** is an easy second choice, for similar reasons but in the film industry. Disney has a proven ability to produce original content in-house that becomes a brand in itself based on cinematic style and thematic unity. Thus Disney owns multiple brands (including Disney itself) that can drive viewership on the strength of their brand alone, and since these are for the most part targeted towards a younger audience, the brand association is built at a young age and creates an intergenerational cycle of lifelong loyalty.\n\nThis is further reinforced by their amusement parks business, which can continue to grow faster than the economy. Disney has so far developed only \\~50% of the land it owns in Florida, for example.\n\nAnd of course, my grandchildren will probably be be using TI-83 despite their brain-machine interfaces, so probably **Texas Instruments**.",

        "body": "I worked sales in payments for four years. A large international payments company. Direct competitor to Paysafe in all respects except we were more restrained on gambling.\n\nPaysafe make money, in large part, by charging merchants for a fee per card transaction. This is known as merchant acquiring. (Yes, the term \"acquiring\" is a little odd here, but keep following)\n\nThis fee is subject to many variables, including interchange fees charged to Paysafe by the card scheme (Visa/MC), as well as competition. Acquirers historically were subsidaries of banks - Chase Paymentech are examples of one that still is - JPM, in this case.\n\n As fees are usually taken before income is paid to the merchant (else invoiced payable within 30 days), it means bank-linked acquirers can significantly reduce their txn fee (and thus increase the topline) for merchants as an incentive they want to upsell more profitable products like loans to. I have worked in the industry and seen it time and again. One large international merchant even got free acquiring, they were that good a customer of the bank's other services. I even worked personally in combo with a bank on a deal of such a type.\n\nWhilst I appreciate that gambling companies are higher risk and some acquirers won't touch them...the barrier to entry is just the acquiring price and the willingness of a competitor to pant-drop. And they do.\n\nPlus I interviewed at Paysafe once. UK office, pre-Covid. There wasn't any buzz, any excitement. It seemes boring and uninspired. Granted, its a subsidary office.\n\nI hold no position on this stock and I am not planning to. Nor am I looking to shit all over the stock per se. Just cautious advice from personal experience.",

        "body": "An index fund is basically a single stock that contains a collection of other stocks. They are usually considered safer investments because even with just one stock you are diversifying over several companies. Your return on your investment is an average of how all the underlying securities perform.\n\nFor example let's say I have an index fund called FakeTechETF(FAKE.to). That index fund is made up of the following stocks:\n\nApple: 20%\nMicrosoft: 10%\nNvidia: 15%\nAlphabet: 15%\nMicrovision: 10%\nTexas Instruments: 20%\nIntel: 10%\n\nFakeTechEFT trades at around $15 per share, which makes it a lot cheaper to buy than trying to buy one share of the underlying securities. It also means that if Apple has a really bad month but all the rest are performing well, you will probably still be up on average. That's the power of diversifying, which index funds do for you.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that if the entire tech sector does badly for some reason (say a huge chip shortage that stops everyone from supplying products), then you might find you aren't as diverse as you first thought.\n\nThat's why there's so many different types of index fund. Some cover specific sectors. Others cover highest performing stocks. Others still would cover highest dividend stocks etc and pay a good passive dividend...\n\nTake a look at some and read what constitutes them. Bear in mind that they frequently reconstitute. You can't for example have a highest grossing company's index without a lot of change, because those companies will move in and out of the index when they meet the requirement for it.\n\nHope that helps!",

In the words of a funny movie writer... \"Assumption is the mother of all fuckups.\" Dont just assume things will continue as they have.\n\nAsk the Japanese what happened after that big run up in the 80s when they were killing it in tech. They thought their stocks were going to the moon too just to get 10 years of sideways then a dip and another 10 years of sideways... \n\nHere in the US we had periods like that too. After the early 20th century tech boom (energy/auto) we had the roaring 20s and then we were flat for 20 years... Then we had almost no gains in the 70s too. And frankly it took us 13 years to make market wide gains against after the .com bubble. During that time countless tech firms went under. Guess what we have a lot of today? Tons of speculation on tech startups.\n\nThats not to say there arent good stocks in each of those periods but needless to say, if you are just an average Joe, then during those periods, dividends were king. Not only did you beat the market overall but the cash you generated allowed you to buy into other things at regular intervals. \n\nFor example, in the 70s and into the 80s while people were sitting on the kings of tech growth... IBM &amp; TXN... folks who bought staples like GIS, KO and PEP were killing it and using their divs to buy small chunks of upstarts like MSFT and Apple. Meanwhile the tech kings just went sideways... Granted if you picked something like ATT you would have been ok but what if you decided Kodak and Poloriod were the future? LoL.",

        "body": "If you're investing in dividends for \"reliable\" income, diversification is crucial. Companies can and do cut their dividend, sometimes even when they can still afford to pay it. For example, Western Digital suspended their dividend in March 2020 to focus on reducing debt and investing back in the company, and it remains suspended even as their profits have resumed.\n\nOwning a fund like VYM and/or VIG provides significant diversification. That way during recessions you might see a 25% reduction in dividend income if things are really bad, vs if you invested in a single stock you might see a 100% reduction.",
