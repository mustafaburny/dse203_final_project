Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.\n\nDivesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP\u2019s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom &amp; will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.\n\nMain downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this &amp; the sky didn't fall.\n\nTLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP",

Look at who their CTO is if you're looking for technical competence.\n\nAMD isn't doing well because Lisu Su somehow engineered a better processor on her own and by far her personal contributions to really improving the company's fundamentals were in pushing the company into the game console market, amending the wafer supply agreement and putting a much needed axe in the Bulldozer line of processors in favor of a new architecture.  I'm sure she's a great engineer too, but that's not the job she was hired for when she was appointed CEO.  She's made great decisions as a CEO, but this whole idea there's any kind of 'wizard' out there is just wrong.\n\nIntel's problem is their fabs and no 'wizard' is going to fix that.  These are extremely complex and expensive processes that take years to set up and are not easily changed or fixed.  That's a big part of why Intel has basically given up on their 10nm process at this point and is focused on their 7nm node.  If you build something that involved and complex that's fundamentally flawed you can't just turn it around and make it work.  Intel's literally been trying for years here and that more than anything else is what's contributed to AMD's meteoric rise.",
