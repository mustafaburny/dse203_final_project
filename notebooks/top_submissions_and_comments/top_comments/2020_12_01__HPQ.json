Other licensees can only sell reference CPU designs with little changes.\n\nThe M1 is a great design but it's nothing that AMD and Intel can't do in the PC market on their own.

        "body": "I mean... most of it, or I would have done a deeper point by point analysis. It misses the Mark on what an SoC is, as well as its performance advantages (such that they are) and the reason it is a popular package these days. It suggests Intel can\u2019t do this, or that M1 is superior or has a huge advantage because it has an integrated package and x86 has first no SoC implementations... then it goes on to list some. Then it ignores that AMD owns ATI when discussing their SoC design churches.\n\nIt vastly overstates the importance of ooo, and at some points kind of confuses it with hyperthreading which is weird to do, since that\u2019s an Intel only extension.\n\nThe fact is that simply nothing about x86 makes it inherently faster. It\u2019s years of development, r&amp;d expenditures, and the being designed for a specific class of device that has driven performance gains. Atom, for example, was a very low power chipset that was quite fast for what it was, when it was introduced. People didn\u2019t want to pay Intel prices (similar to here) to use it in cheap smartphones, so it never found a huge market. Doesn\u2019t mean x86 couldn\u2019t have driven the atom line very far with different design goals and adequate time.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know where to start on \u201cdesigned for a specific purpose\u201d and therefore faster. Although the author then proceeds to write an article describing why he thinks ARM is better suited for general computing (while totally ignoring any importance of the fact that Apple\u2019s GPU performance is guaranteed to be problematic for some time to come. So I don\u2019t think he knows either lol\n\nHe spends a couple pages talking about developing software whilst ignoring that the languages are going to be the same and all that changes is the compiler. If Apple does it\u2019s job well, all that will happen is developers will go click a button that says \u201cbuild for Apple ARM\u201d and XCode will do the rest. Same code, different architecture, 100% transparent. That\u2019s not likely to happen (it would be magic) but that is the goal.\n\nIf Apple can pull a quality GPU out of its ass in the next year or two THAT would be impressive. But the whole argument for an ARM based product line is a no -starter if they don\u2019t have graphics chipsets to rival ATI NVIDIA or even Intel. Doesn\u2019t discuss the importance of this. It\u2019s one of the reasons ARM hasn\u2019t seen wider adoption for machines that need generally good performance in desktop computing.\n\nSo again it\u2019s hard for me to deep dive it, and I realize that\u2019s pretty superficial explanation and I haven\u2019t addressed all of his points. Because it\u2019s just not accurate in either it\u2019s explanation of how the chips work or it\u2019s description of why that\u2019s better.\n\nIf he means Intel tried to put x86 in to toothbrushes, phones, laptops, desktops and data centers and that had a bad influence on its roadmap from which they have had difficulty recovering. Then yeah, maybe I\u2019d buy that. But that\u2019s not what he says. He says ARM is a superior architecture that only one company has noticed its potential and x86 is fundamentally unable to compete with its design. And that\u2019s just not true.\n\nIf this article was the full and true story, why isn\u2019t Apple switching back TO to PPC, which it helped design? Apple also helped create ARM. For one purpose. POWER for another.\n\nIf Apple had an x86 license, I would wager they would be trying to design competing x86 chips and not switching architectures. There were rumblings of them buying AMD for that purpose a while ago... until AMD\u2019s x86 designs started to perform better and their business regained some ground. Oh, by the way, that happened after AMD poached people from Apple... just saying.\n\nSo the transition is driven by apple\u2019s desire to iPhoneify their desktops and to drive up margins (which is a perfectly valid Waylon confront what many are worried is a brick wall in terms of market penetration and upgrade cycle). The product lines are converging and the architecture is too. That sort of makes sense. But apple does not have the secret tech sauce that is going to bury Intel. They DO have the secret financial engineering sauce that can support a 1T+ valuation for the next 6 months or whatever. Very few people in the general public are paying attention to the financial reasons.\n\nApple is spending the money it used to give to Intel for R&amp;D on its own intellectual property now. There will be cost savings but no price reductions. It\u2019s upgrade cycle will change to better suit its marketing needs. It\u2019s design hurdle was literally \u201cdon\u2019t suck\u201d and they delivered a machine that didn\u2019t suck, although it does have limited applications, and I have to think his low end MacBook or Mac mini beats $4000Mac Pro is total bullshit. The new M1 doesn\u2019t suck.\n\nIf you buy it, and use your laptop as a general computing/office machine (no graphics no VMs no cross platform development since it can\u2019t compile for x86) then you will be equally happy and apple will make more money than if the machine had an Intel chip in it.",

Because OP's article already goes into quite some detail as to why, quote: \"Intel and AMD may not be able to catch up.\" (with x86-64).\n\nIt has to do with Out-of-Order execution (OoO).\n\n&gt;The biggest baddest Intel and AMD microprocessor cores have 4 decoders, which means they can decode 4 instructions in parallel spitting out micro-ops.\n\n&gt;But Apple has a crazy 8 decoders. Not only that but the ROB is something like 3x larger. You can basically hold 3x as many instructions. No other mainstream chip maker has that many decoders in their CPUs.\n\n&gt;Why Can\u2019t Intel and AMD Add More Instruction Decoders?\n\n&gt;This is where we finally see the revenge of RISC, and where the fact that the M1 Firestorm core has an ARM RISC architecture begins to matter.\n\n&gt;You see, for x86 an instruction can be anywhere from 1\u201315 bytes long. On a RISC chip instructions are fixed size. Why is that relevant in this case?\n\n&gt;Because splitting up a stream of bytes into instructions to feed into 8 different decoders in parallel becomes trivial if every instruction has the same length.\n\n&gt;However on an x86 CPU the decoders have no clue where the next instruction starts. It has to actually analyze each instruction in order to see how long it is.\n\n&gt;The brute force way Intel and AMD deal with this is by simply attempting to decode instructions at every posssible starting points. That means we have to deal with lots of wrong guesses and mistakes which has to be discarded. This creates such a convoluted and complicated decoder stage, that it is really hard to add more decoders. But for Apple it is trivial in comparison to keep adding more.\n\n&gt;In fact adding more causes so many other problems that 4 decoders according to AMD itself is basically an upper limit for how far they can go.\n\n&gt;This is what allows the M1 Firestorm cores to essentially process twice as many instructions as AMD and Intel CPUs at the same clock frequency.",
