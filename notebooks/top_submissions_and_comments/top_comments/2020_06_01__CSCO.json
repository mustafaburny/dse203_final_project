And what, they will offer these services for free to their users as part of an integrated bundle of products that are used by every organization in the world? Who cares? Companies dont care about adding new costs. And what, they have security issues. ok? what company cares about securities or hackes? Thats right,none. Oh and the best one. ItS oVErValUed. no? they generated 27m income this quarter. this means that if you buy zm now, you turn a profit in 600 years. Are you really that fcking impatient? You cant wait? And so what if they had their best quarter ever and will never see anything close to that ever again? Video conferencing is the futur. Want to go play golf? lmao good one, crack a cold beer and talk on zoom.

        "body": "No, it's not driven by a magical expectation. The high price is due to their market penetration, which is unlike any competitor.\n\nI'm not saying it's justified, I honestly have no idea what the true value of this company is, nobody does, but the value in Zoom is so much more than a 'magical expectation'.\n\nTech companies have stickier customers than any other industry in history due to the incredible amounts of data they can collect.\n\nAt a global scale, both on a consumer, business and enterprise level, Zoom has daily analytics on:\n\n- How many video conferences take place\n- Who participates in them\n- Whether they use chat features or just the video/audio\n- How many people are in a meeting\n- How close participants are geographically\n\nHonestly, I could make this list as long as I liked, the data points are endless.\n\nNo other video conference company has such deep penetration across every area of the vidconf market. \n\nThat mix of personal, business and enterprise penetration isn't something anyone else in the market has, and it's so incredibly valuable at a data analytics level. \n\nBeing able to compare and contrast customer behaviours across different contexts unlocks insights that power incredible company growth (see: Facebook)\n\nThis incredible amount of data informs their future product development opportunities, meaning that it's a strong bet that Zoom is going to make better future plays in the technology space than their competitors (e.g. Google, Webex, etc).\n\nNote again that these competitors cover an area of the market each (personal, enterprise), Zoom covers all of it and more.\n\nWhen you combine that with the fact that they have already destroyed every competitor in the space on user experience and customer satisfaction, this puts them at a huge advantage over every other player in the video conference space. \n\nThey came into this space as a startup competing against Microsoft, Cisco and Google, and they're winning by a country mile.\n\nSo when video chats move from 'schedule a call' to an all inclusive platform that handles all communications across audio/video, personal/business, etc, Zoom is going to be the best placed to dominate that huge market.\n\nThis is an equivalent shift in the Telcom industry as the one from dial phones to mobile phones. \n\nIf you're imagining what a shift like that might look like, imagine having cameras from your TV, fridge and various 'IoT enabled' devices around your house that follow you as you talk to people.\n\nImagine having an affordable interactive whiteboard in your house that updates as your video partners write on their own interactive whiteboards.\n\nImagine it get used to plan family trips out as much as it's used to plan corporate strategies.\n\nImagine being able to manipulate AR models on video and share it with the world.\n\nThat all requires a central platform to harness all the data involved and turn it into a user experience. Zoom is better placed to do that than any other company in the world right now.\n\nThat is what it's price is driven by.\n\nAnd all you see is people whining that they had a security breach, as though that can't be fixed (which it has).\n\nEvery company has data breaches, not every company is this well placed to dominate a market that is going to grow like wildfire over the next 20 years.\n\n---------\n\nNow, with all that being said, I still only have 10% of my portfolio in Zoom, even with all this going for it, every company is a 50/50 bet at best. But if I'm gonna pick 10 companies in the world to invest in, Zoom is definitely one of them.",

Turned 5k into 100k in an old brokerage account through Apple puts at the start of the crash. Once South Korea and Samsung facilities got hit with COVID I figured there would be (warranted) doomsday predictions about tech supply chains that would hit AAPL.\n\nI did end up catching the bottom though in another account. SABR @ 3, CPRI @ 6, LEAPS on VTR @ 15. Those were the core buys when the market was at peak liquidation. That account was managed into a more balanced COVID-recovery portfolio. Still very heavy on SABR and CPRI.\n\nHere are some of the current holdings: https://i.imgur.com/IAiV8gp.png. It's admittedly an absolute mess because it's all locked in a brokerage account that none of this should have taken place in. The market was literally down 10% and my main trading account was in a hilariously bad margin call while I was on the phone with someone asking \"is the world ending\", so the set of buys at market bottom were extremely haphazard and chaotic. Meanwhile, tech is my wheelhouse yet I happened to be about to pull the trigger on luxury clothing (which I know *absolutely* nothing about) because it's apparently trading at half of its bankruptcy value and buys needed to happen within a window of the next few minutes as the -10% market was turning. Just an absurd day. Things may have literally been on fire as far as my memory serves. Soon it will be in an IB portfolio margin account with proper management tools though.\n\nSo the path has been: Set of random equities and options from the SPY 2200 market bottom -&gt; Scaling out of those positions and buying Quality/Tech (asml, lrcx, nok, sbux, oled , chl were the buys in the weeks after the bottom) -&gt; Value COVID recovery/\"return to normalcy\" stocks (brk, bx, banks, txrh, cxw, vwagy, dfs, banks). There's also been some side ventures in there like buying CLMT and XOM during the negative oil event, and those won't be held long term.\n\nLots of options not showing there as well. Collars on positions, covered calls, 200k short nasdaq hedge. Basically locking in the profits and marching towards neutral until the positions can move over to the PM margin account and it can turn into something actually sane.\n\nA lot of that stuff is probably going to be gone by next friday and sold into the rotation. dfs up 10% today, sabr up 12%, txrh up 8%, Well +7%, VTR +10%, CXW +6%... Today was the exact day that that list of stocks was positioned for. There was a 4 sigma move into value a few weeks ago that I took to be a canary in the coal mine for the rotation. Looked like a quake from quant funds moving factors around. Not sure what's next. It's probably time to focus on the insane quarterly reports we're about to get, and start actually paying attention to the real economy and things like the +600 unemployment checks rolling off and the unemployment trajectory. Maybe just step out of the way until that all picks trends.\n\nThere are still many laggards to pick out but they by and large have debt loads that carry a very real bankruptcy risk, and some extreme exposure to COVID and lockdowns (restaurants, entertainment, companies like SABR that provide the back-end for flight booking). So they come with a bundle of esoteric and disastrous tail risks, but honestly, some of the common risk exposures like consumer credit risk, commercial real estate, etc aren't rocket science to hedge against. Most of this stuff is not something I'd want to leave alone without watching charts for even a day though, even in a decently hedged portfolio.",
