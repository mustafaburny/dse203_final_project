Want to go play golf? lmao good one, crack a cold beer and talk on zoom.

Good known quality companies that have a chance of growth still. In this case, maybe the impending 5G stocks, any medical related to tele-medical work, tech companies that operate largely in the remote technologies. \nExamples: Verizon/ATT/Nokia/Livongo/Teladoc/Cisco/Disney/.. companies like that. You could even take a few grand from your savings account and throw it into a growth stock that has a dividend (which would return more per year than your pitiful savings account). Could always try emerging technologies too, like green energy, electric cars (Nikola) as growth stocks.\n\n2. Pennystocks for the \"pump and dump\" like you read here as well. Cheap stocks that run anywhere under $5 or so.. usually in this subreddits case, $2 and under, hope i hits $2.20+, and you have a few hundred shares, sell, and take your profit. Do not look for a $2 stock to hit $100 and make you richer than Richie. That happens over a real long time, and hardly ever. Dont hold too long.\n\nI've been taking my pennystock profits and putting them into longer term growth stocks. So far so good. \n\nBy the way - almost every hyped up stock I have seen posted about here in the last few months immediately dropped. When this thread was posted the stock was approx $1.24 .. it's now trading at $1.12",

It happened to own through acquisition a company called Palm, which made the original Palm Pilot and was developing the world\u2019s first smartphone. \nI knew a lot about Palm and bought 3Com calls. \n\n3Com decided to spin Palm off and goes to Goldman, who tells them to just release 30 million shares and keep the rest to keep demand higher than supply. This is at the top of the tech bubble. I keep buying calls. The Palm roadshow goes great and it\u2019s one of the hottest IPOs ever because Goldman is keeping most of the shares locked in  3Com, probably doing the same play I am.\n\nThe first week in March 2000 my calls rise $200,000 in three days Monday to Wednesday. Palm goes public on Thursday and by 11 o\u2019clock the embedded value of the Palm stock in 3Com is worth more than 3Com, which is logically impossible. \n\nAnyhow, I\u2019m a millionaire for the first time and realize shit, if I sell these calls I\u2019ll be paying $200,000 in taxes, maybe I can exercise and convert. Well, the tech bubble suddenly  deflates, and I wind up with only a $100,000 profit. \n\nI did get my first BMW out of it.",

Your point is spot on - CTS goes after small and medium size enterprises while IBM will go after the Fortune 500. It is purely a reseller model...but the company's main focus is converting these clients into more software. \n\nA lot of the targets they acquire are usually product specific - they end up selling a ton of Cisco or a ton of Dell without much overlap. But if they are selling Cisco, it's not as if their clients aren't buying Dell products also. That's the value prop that they pitch when they acquire targets - we are going to give you the tools to sell everything your clients want and need and your clients will love that they will not have multiple vendors. So effectively cross-selling is a huge selling point for the targets. \n\nWith respect to Red Hat, IBM is actually giving Converge market development funds to pursue these markets effectively throwing their full weight behind them. \n\nAnd yes, 700m and still on the Venture...not something you see every day. I am pretty confident they will uplist to the TSX within the year and will aim to go after NASDAQ later this year if not early next year.",

Good known quality companies that have a chance of growth still. In this case, maybe the impending 5G stocks, any medical related to tele-medical work, tech companies that operate largely in the remote technologies. \nExamples: Verizon/ATT/Nokia/Livongo/Teladoc/Cisco/Disney/.. companies like that. You could even take a few grand from your savings account and throw it into a growth stock that has a dividend (which would return more per year than your pitiful savings account). Could always try emerging technologies too, like green energy, electric cars (Nikola) as growth stocks.\n\n2. Pennystocks for the \"pump and dump\" like you read here as well. Cheap stocks that run anywhere under $5 or so.. usually in this subreddits case, $2 and under, hope i hits $2.20+, and you have a few hundred shares, sell, and take your profit. Do not look for a $2 stock to hit $100 and make you richer than Richie. That happens over a real long time, and hardly ever. Dont hold too long.\n\nI've been taking my pennystock profits and putting them into longer term growth stocks. So far so good. \n\nBy the way - almost every hyped up stock I have seen posted about here in the last few months immediately dropped. When this thread was posted the stock was approx $1.24 .. it's now trading at $1.12",

        "body": "In 1999 was a company called 3Com that was failing badly trying to compete with Cisco. Everyone knew it was a dog. It happened to own through acquisition a company called Palm, which made the original Palm Pilot and was developing the world\u2019s first smartphone. \nI knew a lot about Palm and bought 3Com calls. \n\n3Com decided to spin Palm off and goes to Goldman, who tells them to just release 30 million shares and keep the rest to keep demand higher than supply. This is at the top of the tech bubble. I keep buying calls. The Palm roadshow goes great and it\u2019s one of the hottest IPOs ever because Goldman is keeping most of the shares locked in  3Com, probably doing the same play I am.\n\nThe first week in March 2000 my calls rise $200,000 in three days Monday to Wednesday. Palm goes public on Thursday and by 11 o\u2019clock the embedded value of the Palm stock in 3Com is worth more than 3Com, which is logically impossible. \n\nAnyhow, I\u2019m a millionaire for the first time and realize shit, if I sell these calls I\u2019ll be paying $200,000 in taxes, maybe I can exercise and convert. Well, the tech bubble suddenly  deflates, and I wind up with only a $100,000 profit. \n\nI did get my first BMW out of it.",

Your point is spot on - CTS goes after small and medium size enterprises while IBM will go after the Fortune 500. It is purely a reseller model...but the company's main focus is converting these clients into more software. \n\nA lot of the targets they acquire are usually product specific - they end up selling a ton of Cisco or a ton of Dell without much overlap. But if they are selling Cisco, it's not as if their clients aren't buying Dell products also. That's the value prop that they pitch when they acquire targets - we are going to give you the tools to sell everything your clients want and need and your clients will love that they will not have multiple vendors. So effectively cross-selling is a huge selling point for the targets. \n\nWith respect to Red Hat, IBM is actually giving Converge market development funds to pursue these markets effectively throwing their full weight behind them. \n\nAnd yes, 700m and still on the Venture...not something you see every day. I am pretty confident they will uplist to the TSX within the year and will aim to go after NASDAQ later this year if not early next year.",

I find it easier to focus on stocks I have at least one share with that stocks I don't own at all).  \n\n\nHere is my list of shares I'm watching carefully, feel free to research it.  \nMSFT, V, MA, NKE, NTDOY, LOGI, SPXL, TQQQ, DOCU,  TRIP, ALGN, F, GME, APPL, NFLX, SBUX, LUV, HS, AMZN, AAL, TMUS, PG,  INTC, QCOM, PYPL, T, ATVI, RSG, FDM, AXP, CSCO, TGT, PLSE, TROW, ORCL,  FDX, CUBE, BABA, CTAS, ALK, JNJ, LLY, CB, NEE, FANG, GAMR, TWLO, TNA,  LABU, FAS, CTRE, PEP, EBAY, DFS, GE, SNQP, MS, RF, AMG, HIG, BR, BEN,  ZNGA, COR, WWE, WYNN, VT, VTI, ELY, ADBE, SQ, TWTR, CVS, CRSP, QQ, NDLS,  WU, MTRX, PUTW, TECL, GM, NYMT, MU and NDAQ .",

Trade Desk up another 11% today and is now more than 2x since early April. Car sales were considerably better than expected in May (https://www.autoblog.com/2020/06/02/may-2020-us-auto-sales/), which sent Carvana up big yesterday. Security? Okta had a very good quarter the other day, Crowdstrike yesterday. Visa said two days ago that trends continue to improve, Paypal said April was the best month since its IPO.\n\nSome emerging markets tech names doing well. Look at SE +117% YTD. MELI +40%\n\n Google and Facebook suffered from ad spending on things like travel being down (Booking and Expedia spend a fortune on Google ads - Expedia's chairman noted \"\u201cAt Expedia, for instance, we spend $5 billion a year on advertising. We won\u2019t spend $1 billion on advertising probably this year.\" A couple of years ago, Booking spent a billion on Google ads in the quarter (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/05/travel-giant-booking-spent-1-billion-on-google-ads-in-the-quarter.html.) So those companies are uniquely effected, but things have improved as Facebook noted on their conference call. Google may have suspended some spending recently, but they announced the other day that employees who choose to work from home can expense a grand worth of office furniture. https://nypost.com/2020/05/26/google-will-let-workers-expense-1000-worth-of-office-furniture/\n\nWork from home has certainly done well too, but if that becomes a bigger part of culture going forward to some degree, that becomes a long-term theme. Remote work - look at RNG, ZM, FIVN.  Look at telehealth - Teladoc has done well this year but Livongo +145% YTD. Look at CDN names like FSLY, which is +150% YTD/NET +71%",
