There will always been a need for flash arrays but I just have a hard time seeing exponential growth in a company that is moving away from their core product and moving more cloud based which is already a heavily saturated market with much bigger players.

I am kind of confused why some of these other cloud stocks have exploded with massive losses, yet NetApp is barely crawling back, even though they have a good balance sheet, cash flow, dividend. They def haven't been a growth story lately, but at the very least they should be closer to pre-covid numbers.",
