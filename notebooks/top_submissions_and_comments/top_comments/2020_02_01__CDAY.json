Almost every stock in the sector is. ZEN, AVLR, ZEN, MDB,GWRE,AZPN,SMAR,CDAY and HUBS. All of them are up huge. It's hard to believe bc all they are is companies that deal with data management from what I can gather.",

When you first start out you are going to literally bust your ass until you hit the point you can hire a driver to deal with the work.\n\nLets say you have a machine that takes 20 cases of soda to fill and you have 20 machines around. Your talking about 400 cases at 20 pounds a case. 8000 pounds.\n\nYour moving 8000 pounds at the store to your cart, from your cart to the truck, from the truck to the hand truck, from the handtruck into the machine. Can your back handle 32000 pounds and bending up and down each time you refill? Obviously rough math, but you get the idea.\n\nDo you have a vehicle that can handle this?\n\nRepair is dirty cheap if you have good machines and a good mechanic. Very easy to swap boards, validators, etc.\n\nStay away from snack and food machines if you are just starting out. Hassle to be cognizant of perishables and dates, etc. Need to consider how well candy holds as well - are you in Florida and have candy/chocolate machines?\n\nYou can absolutely crush it in the right location - but keep in mind its not get rich quick. It's get rich slow and by making sure your machines are all in a relatively close proximity (at least to start).\n\nWhen we do the rough math it usually comes out that 50% of sales price is profit. So for $1 can of soda, $.50 goes towards gas, products cost, commission, operational expense etc.\n\nHow do you plan on moving the machines? Each time you move its $150-$200. Where do you store them when not using?\n\nJust food for thought :)",

I'd also personally prefer these 2 since they offer more than Vanguard: 24/7 customer service, checking or cash management accounts with ATM fee refunds (Vanguard closed the closest thing they had over the summer, and even then, it was much more limited than Fidelity or Schwab's offerings), and both offer optional credit cards if you wish. For stocks and ETFs, Fidelity is in the process of rolling out fractional shares over the next few weeks, Schwab has announced it but has not started a rollout yet (I believe I heard spring?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should open a high yield savings account in addition to everything else, possibly except if you go with Fidelity or Schwab and use their CMA or checking accounts (since you can invest money there in money market funds which should return similar to a HYSA, but you do give up FDIC or NCUA insurance by doing this).",

(e.g. I have a good bit of Fidelity\u2019s 2055 Index FDEWX). I ask because Fidelity has different target date funds, some of which are much more expensive.\n\n2) What funds are available in your 401k plan? Can you purchase iShares ETFs? Or is the fund selection pretty small?\n\nI ask these things because while factor investing is pretty cool and technically more theoretically optimal when implemented properly, it\u2019s hard to beat the behavioral benefits of automatically DCA-ing into a dead simple one fund portfolio that automatically rebalances for you.\n\nIf you\u2019re really dying to get some flexibility though, then I think your plan of contributing up to the 401k match then maxing your Roth IRA (do Roth if you can) is good. But I would put leftover money after this back into the 401k and max it before looking at a taxable account. Utilize those tax advantages accounts as much as you can!",

Combined we make right around $200k a year. We have about $95k in retirement accounts and about $10k in savings. We want to continue to grow our retirement savings, and still be able to travel.\n\nWe\u2019re not against taking risks and playing the long game. Thought our single largest Rollover IRA has been fairly flat for the last 10 years (currently at $52k). It\u2019s in a managed account with a financial advisory firm and in a fidelity account. The fees are $628 per month. I believe the fees are destroying my gains. It looks like the fund choices are producing, but the bottom line has felt flat (slightly upwards over the last 10 years). \n\nOut of that $95k, $18k is in a separate Fidelity account in a S&amp;P 500 fund/product. And we have  5 shares of Amazon (totaling about $10k now) and a few shares of Visa &amp; MasterCard (totaling $2.5k). \n\nOur home is valued at about $360k and we have about $250k left on the mortgage. Out two vehicles were both PreOwned, but not inexpensive and we owe about $20k on the 2016 Mini Cooper and $33k on the 2013 Porsche Cayenne. We have about $20k credit card debit we\u2019ve been grinding down the CC debt over time. From as high as $45k or so, to $20k). \n\nMy wife is very good with money. I am not. We money becomes an issue, I tend to look for a different employer. (My job is in pretty high demand and I have a good bit of experience).  \n\nThe two other upcoming expenses we foresee will be buying a preowned Airstream travel trailer and replacing our floors in our home. Other than that, it will be retirement savings. \n\nAny advice would be welcome.",

Don\u2019t blow your investment account(s) on trading. \n\nINVESTING AND TRADING ARE SEPARATE THINGS. \n\nYou can buy and hold in one account and stock trade in another. \n\nNOT DOING BOTH AND KEEPING BOTH SEPARATE were OPs mistakes, not trading itself. \n\nHere\u2019s the correct way: \n\n1. 401k investing (or something similar).  This is your first and foremost, put the money away, let Fidelity or whoever do their jobs, don\u2019t touch it.  Monitor it, ask questions, maybe make some changes WITH your financial advisor.  Other than that, leave it alone. \n\n2.  Want to be like OP and never trade again, cuz you suck at it? Ok, open a second IRA, a Roth preferably, 100% ran by you, buy and hold the next Amazon, Apple, Netflix, etc. Woohoo, you\u2019re a genius. \n\n3.  Not touching 1 or 2 whatsoever, day trade with separate funds that you\u2019re ok with losing.  Have some type of limit...IE \u201cif I lose 50k, I\u2019m done because obviously I suck at this.\u201d",
