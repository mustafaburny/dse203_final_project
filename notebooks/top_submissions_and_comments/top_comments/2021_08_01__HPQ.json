Imagine that this has the added bonus of dividends to investors, despite being publicly traded for less than a month.\n* [Modest capex spend in their S-1; immediate FCF generation](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021013318/1?cik=1783879&amp;hl=1029918:1029933&amp;hl_id=4yjqwnqyi) - capital light business that is shitting free cash flow L2Y. Help me understand why RH is such a shit investment again?\n\n* Cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, and other logical fallacies that /r/investing and /r/stocks are ***ridiculously*** susceptible to (me speculating here) - most $HOOD bears arrive at their thesis from extrapolating personal experience over RH's entire user base\n * e.g. - reddit incorrectly assumes the RH the user base consists of day traders looking to profit off of short term price movements that are based off of what the billions of other public capital market participants are going to do in the immediate term.....rather than making buy/sell decisions based off of firm-specific and macro fundamentals. \n * The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of investors see brokerages as offering a commoditized service where you're offering the same service at the lowest cost. **The smart money** sees RH for what it is: a brokerage that charges me $0 in fees and is awarding me free yield. Why tf would I trade away additional return in the form of lower fees relative to what another brokerage would charge me? \n\nSo, again, I'm open to hearing a rational bear case on RH or any sort of pervasive, idiosyncratic risk associated with the ticker that isn't being properly reflect in the current share price.",

It's in a pretty similar boat as Intel. Both of them are quite legacy but up until a decade ago people would have said similar about MSFT. \n\nI'm not invested in it outside of indexes, but I'd still feel more comfortable with it over a moonshot like PLTR or whatever meme stock people are pumping lately.",

        "body": "I have mixed feeling on selling prior to earnings. Beucase of exactly what happened. If youre buying weekly options then yeah, youre playing with fire holding options through earnings. But if you have options contracts that has a lot of time left after the earnings call then you have time to recover. If your options contracts has months left until expiration then holding through earnings is not going to hurt you too bad. I bought calls on AMD at the end of June and they were down 50-80% leading up to earnings. I have been slowly (maybe prematurely) selling my calls all for profits of 150-300%. My calls expired in September, November, and December. I like to stagger mine. \n\nWith that being said, I think people grossly missunderstood the position AMD is in. The signs were all there. Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely.",

The biggest thing TSMC did to get the upper hand over Intel was order a shit ton of ASML EUV photolithography tools early on. ASML took years to fill those contracts due to how complex their production is (these tools cost ~$100M each). I didn't directly work on the EUV tool, but saw the effects first hand of how Intel's first EUV tool streamlined several difficult manufacturing steps in our 7nm technology. But we couldn't get enough of them in time. Before this the companies were close on process technology; Intel was maybe even slightly ahead. Whether this persists once Intel's orders with ASML can be filled remains to be seen.\n\nAn interesting development is the Japanese semiconductor manufacturing tool companies (e.g., Nikon, Canon, TEL) have EUV tools coming soon. If only I knew which of these might follow an ASML like trajectory  in the markets.",

Gelsinger needs to (and I think he is)  identify all the negatives (or current issues they face, including internal bureaucracy) and quickly address the vision on how to rectify these issues. At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction.  Once he does that,  and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal,  he might have the most successful turn around story ever.   I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years.  If successful I'll be rewarded. If not,  another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",

Market is extremely hot there right now though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though they have been discovered I think Phoenix and Atlanta continue to be hot.  Austin by the tech centers in the Domain could be a decent bet too but prices there are so elevated atm.",

        "body": "While investing in Chinese companies listed on US exchanges you have to remember 3 additional types of risk you are taking on in addition to your normal investment risk.\n\nFirst is fraud risk. Chinese companies arent held to anywhere near the same standard as American companies. As Luckin Coffee showed, new IPOs and smaller Chinese companies can easily get creative with their accounting. While BABA, JD and other mega caps are less likely to suffer from this problem, generally the risks are much higher with Chinese companies than with their American or European equivalents.\n\nSecond, US political risk. The US government is finally waking up to the fact that China has been competing with us in order to supplant us for the last 20-25 years, and is beginning to take action. China's multinational corporations, especially those listed on US exchanges, are the some of the easiest places to apply pressure.\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is political risk from the CCP. The Chinese government can be arbitrary, and political concerns supercede economic ones. They can and will crush certain businesses just to make a point. This is real.\n\nAll that being said, I think sentiment for Chinese stocks is about as low as it can be right now. Short of the CCP nationalizing their largest and most profitable companies, or the US banning chinese stocks from US exchanges or US brokers from dealing with them (both real possibilities, although not the most probably outcomes), I dont think Chinese companies, especially Chinese tech companies, have that much further to fall. Selling here is likely selling near the bottom.",

Gelsinger needs to (and I think he is)  identify all the negatives (or current issues they face, including internal bureaucracy) and quickly address the vision on how to rectify these issues. At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction.  Once he does that,  and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal,  he might have the most successful turn around story ever.   I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years.  If successful I'll be rewarded. If not,  another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",

        "body": "While investing in Chinese companies listed on US exchanges you have to remember 3 additional types of risk you are taking on in addition to your normal investment risk.\n\nFirst is fraud risk. Chinese companies arent held to anywhere near the same standard as American companies. As Luckin Coffee showed, new IPOs and smaller Chinese companies can easily get creative with their accounting. While BABA, JD and other mega caps are less likely to suffer from this problem, generally the risks are much higher with Chinese companies than with their American or European equivalents.\n\nSecond, US political risk. The US government is finally waking up to the fact that China has been competing with us in order to supplant us for the last 20-25 years, and is beginning to take action. China's multinational corporations, especially those listed on US exchanges, are the some of the easiest places to apply pressure.\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is political risk from the CCP. The Chinese government can be arbitrary, and political concerns supercede economic ones. They can and will crush certain businesses just to make a point. This is real.\n\nAll that being said, I think sentiment for Chinese stocks is about as low as it can be right now. Short of the CCP nationalizing their largest and most profitable companies, or the US banning chinese stocks from US exchanges or US brokers from dealing with them (both real possibilities, although not the most probably outcomes), I dont think Chinese companies, especially Chinese tech companies, have that much further to fall. Selling here is likely selling near the bottom.",

It's basically bidding for a contract from what I understand. Lowest bidder wins.\n\nRobinhood might actually be able to steal some market share there though if they come up with an offer to not charge anything for actually managing the assets, and offer expanded employee choice, while making their money off of payment for order flow.

Same with Apple, Amazon, etc. So I kinda disagree that it makes business sense because it doesn\u2019t help just institutions it really helps everyone given that MSFT is also probably on every other ETF and Index fund. \n\nI find it more troubling when it is a smaller stock that not everyone owns. I remember earlier this year I think it was Morgan Stanley, late in 2020 they release a sell rating for PLTR and then earlier this year they raised the PT for PLTR and later I saw that they started buying PLTR a month before the PT was released. So I think if it is a smaller stock that it is not \u201cwell known\u201d I definitely would call that helping and pushing their BS",
