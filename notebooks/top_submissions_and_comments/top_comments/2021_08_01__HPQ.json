        "body": "&gt; Back then many companies not only didn't have profit, they literally had almost zero revenue.\n\nThat\u2019s not true. A large percentage of IPOs back then had revenue, just no profits. And the valuations of these profitless companies like pets.com (again it had revenue) was at 300 million at its max. Just look at the valuations of various spacs like NKLA, QS, SPCE. No revenue, but huge multi billion valuations.\n\n&gt; Where as today the tech giants are figuratively printing profits.\n\nThe tech giants of yesteryear were also printing profits like MSFT, HPQ, CISCO, etc. Those were the FAANGs of the day.",
