        "body": "It feels a lot like Feb 2000, when the dot com bubble was about to burst. I was in the thick of it... I was running a startup hoping to IPO, and I had dozens of friends who were paper millionaires with their stock options, and most wound up worthless. I started with $5k in 1998, and by 2000, I had over $200k in my Schwab account. I thought I had cracked the code, and I was feeling pretty invincible.\n\nIn Feb 2000, I shorted some tech stocks, then bailed when they kept going up and took my losses. As the bubble started to burst, I put all my money in \"safe\" profitable tech stocks (Cisco, Oracle, Network Solutions and Intel). A month later the bottom fell out. It was a roller coaster ride, with enough ups to make you think it was coming back. My \"safe\" stocks lost a bundle. I rode two companies into the ground, and lost 90% on others. \n\nToday, Cisco and Oracle are worth less than they were 21 years ago. Despite consistent earnings increases, they never grew into those valuations. (Yes, I wish I had put everything in AAPL, GOOG and AMZN instead).This market feels \"frothy\" (to quote someone smarter than I am). There will always be winners and losers, but when the market loses its collective mind every time someone says \"inflation\" or \"tightening\" it's concerning. I'm still long, but it seems like it's time to think about taking some chips off the table soon.",

Maybe that's an exaggeration, but I wouldn't touch the stock. There are deep content pools that legacy studios are putting together that will really eat into Netflix, including, ironically enough, the assets of TimeWarner formerly owned by AOL which are now the bundle that is HBOMax. \n\nAny company that isn't an existing conglomerate (like Amazon) that has the word \"cloud\" in its short description worries me. Don't get me wrong, the so-called \"cloud\" is really cool, but I suspect it will be like the old telcos that spent tens of billions burying fiber. Of course, in the long haul that fiber was needed and it was critical for rolling out the data hungry streaming model, but a huge percentage of it got placed and then sat dormant. It absolutely buried companies that were high fliers (you have to understand it wasn't just a dot com bubble, there was an entire telecom bubble as well). A lot of stuff with \"cloud\" in it will probably find a similar fate. There will be winners just like Amazon eventually gained the title of internet commerce king, but the carcasses of the dead will lay across Wall Street only to be forgotten in a few years. \n\nOne that I remember thinking was a turd was PLUG. Look at the max chart on that thing. I still wouldn't buy that. Maybe I'm totally wrong, maybe not. I think TSLA is also overvalued. I'm not saying it's a bad company or anything, but its valuation metrics are way out of whack. \n\nYou have to understand in that era guys would go on CNBC and talk about some new internet IPO was worth x billion because it had y million \"eyeballs.\" I'm not exaggerating. They would multiply page views by 2 and use it as a metric for valuation. That whole thing to me felt like the bigger idiot theory taken to the extreme, but even that feels more reputable than the people who push crypto on CNBC. \n\nI have cash. I want to deploy it because of inflation risks, but there's virtually nothing I want to touch right now so I've just been nibbling on Boomer stocks and swing trading SPY options. \n\nOh, and one other thing. Funds. Back then Janus Twenty was all the rage. They had closed it to new investors. People would brag that they were in it. It had all the high flyers. AOL, Cisco, JDSUniphase, Intel, Microsoft and Oracle. That reminds me of that ARK fund or whatever it is called. Again, not everything in the J20 was a terrible company, but valuations got so out of whack that things like INTC have never returned to their highs and MSFT and ORCL, while good companies, were dead money for over a decade. I think a company like TSLA has the chance to find itself in that sort of company where the stock takes a decade plus to touch its ATH again.",

It's continuing to see expansion to more government agencies every single day; not just three-letter  agencies, either.  \n\n\nThey have a $120b TAM as we speak. The potential for growth is enormous. They're the leading company in this area right now (no, Snow and Salesforce are not the same fucking thing), and they're the first company to get the highest level of security approval that even the likes of Google and Oracle aren't cleared for, which gives them an enormous edge. You can't provide solutions to problems that exist in areas you're not approved to service in the first place.  \n\n\nThe company is doing great financially and has enormous upside.

        "body": "Zero clue. The crypto market lacks the fundamentals like the fiat markets. Ie, the value behind crypto is inherently intrinsic as very few projects create anything tangible to establish an underlying \u201cvalue\u201d behind its product. In essence the crypto market is only as valuable as people are willing to assign value. So if some bozo thinks litecoin is still worth $40....litecoin will sell for $40....\n\nPersonally, I see this rush to crypto as a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s now so accessible that a boomer watching CNN can figure out a way to download an app and buy shib coin. I love how easy cryptos gotten to buy, furthering it\u2019s position to establish a global currency that\u2019s organically rooted from this grassroots uprising on the internet as \u201cdigital money\u201d.....but at the same time I\u2019d wager that 70%+ of new users have ZERO clue or interest in how it works or what it\u2019s true value is....or even what they\u2019re buying. They\u2019re all chasing moonshots. \n\nLike eth for instance. I honestly think the flippening is upon us. I think Buterin has just played 4-d chess with btc by showing that even his network when maxed out from retail investors rushing to buy erc-20 shit coins, drove gas fees to astronomical levels. He\u2019s also buffered eth value by having so many dapps reliant on it. Every eth based dex further reinforces eth dominance. So one of the biggest challengers to btc, who\u2019s technically supposed to be faster and stronger...just bent. Even with wrapped tokens, the lightning network, etc....btc fundamentally from a technical perspective will never keep up. It\u2019s definitely the Oracle of blockchain tech. but it\u2019s like the horse and buggy compared to a Boeing 747 of crypto. Caveat is that people are now anchoring to its stability because it\u2019s the oldest. \n\nSo zero clue what the bottom is but keep in mind, the folks who understand btc have been in it for a very long time, and if they\u2019re holding, they can dump on the market and still walk away profitable. Heck, I remember being able to cpu mine 2 btc a week off a shitty laptop in 2010. Whales will either pocket their winnings, or move on to another project with more robust capabilities. Psychologically if you\u2019ve been in the btc game for 11 years and held your fat bag....where do you think your head would be seeing this many pumps and tightening time frames?",

This was the closest someone could be to an investor in those days.  Stoic philosophy encouraged living in accord with Nature, which didn't simple mean the natural earth but also reality more broadly, that the key to escaping suffering is to live life with accurate expectations about Nature.  It's hard to imagine a Stoic who takes up investing not to be interested in things like the balance sheet.    Here's what Wikipedia says about him.\n\n*Diogenes reports that Zeno's interest in philosophy began when \"he consulted* [*the oracle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia) *to know what he should do to attain the best life, and that the god's response was that he should take on the complexion of the dead. Whereupon, perceiving what this meant, he studied ancient authors.\"*[*\\[5\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium#cite_note-6) *Zeno became a wealthy merchant. On a voyage from* [*Phoenicia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia) *to* [*Peiraeus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peiraeus) *he survived a shipwreck, after which he went to Athens and visited a bookseller. There he encountered* [*Xenophon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon)*'s* [*Memorabilia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorabilia_(Xenophon))*. He was so pleased with the book's portrayal of* [*Socrates*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates) *that he asked the bookseller where men like Socrates were to be found. Just then,* [*Crates of Thebes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crates_of_Thebes)*, the most famous* [*Cynic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)) *living at that time in* [*Greece*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) *happened to be walking by, and the bookseller pointed to him.*[*\\[6\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium#cite_note-FOOTNOTELa%C3%ABrtius1925%C2%A7_2%E2%80%933-7)\n\n*Zeno is described as a haggard, dark-skinned person,*[*\\[7\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium#cite_note-FOOTNOTELa%C3%ABrtius1925%C2%A7_1-8) *living a spare,* [*ascetic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascetic) *life*[*\\[8\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium#cite_note-FOOTNOTELa%C3%ABrtius1925%C2%A7_26%E2%80%9327-9) *despite his wealth.

Why? Because the difference in price was irrelevant from a practical perspective. Even though it was 10%-30% more than competitors, what is $15k a month vs $11k a month to a company that gross millions a month? Its literally nothing and more importantly, GC is the easiest to scale worldwide (along with AWS) and provides, by far, the best performance and redundancy due to owning their own systems.\n\nBABA is far too late to the game just like Oracle and IBM.

One oracle could pull data to say one if it\u2019s under 30 degrees AND it\u2019s this high humidity, then it\u2019s snowing. And since it\u2019s in Dallas, this kills the ticket sales of a game. If those conditions are met, then an automatic payout happens. This can happen with crop insurance too etc. \n\nErnst and young has been working hard on ethereum to develop supply chain tracking. This product is called baseline and Microsoft is their biggest partner on it. \n\nIt\u2019s like how the internet wasn\u2019t internet tv or internet radio. It\u2019s internet everything you can dream of. Same with blockchain, and ethereum is Turing complete so it can do it all.",

        "body": "&gt;In regard to PLTR, today it broke support going back to November. That's what I mean. If you bought PLTR January or added more to your position, you are feeling the pain.  \n\nOkay, I see what you mean. But at the same time if you looked at fundamentals (lol remember when that was something that held weight) the indicators were pretty clear PLTR was pretty significantly overvalued even at $20 so buying more once it got up into the $30 was definitely a risk and anyone purchasing it at that level should know that given the growth the stock has seen since IPO only 6 months ago. And I don't say this like I'm some kind of oracle who knew PLTR would drop, I own quite a bit of PLTR @ $16/share and then bought more during the rise moving my cost average up to $19/share. Even though I know the stock could go below this I'm not bothered because I bought this stock because I had faith in the Company long-term and a temporary dip in the short term isn't going to change my mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If I need to sit on a stock as it goes sideways for 15 years, that ain't for me. In 15 years watching MSFT go sideways, I could have profited owning the whole market. \n\nI agree with what you're saying in general but I'm just pointing out that even really good stocks/companies can trade sideways. Of course no one wants to hold an investment that doesn't make any gains over 15 years but it does kind of support the fact that if you truly hold long term (i.e hold until retirement or close to) you would've ended up making quite a bit of money even if you bought in 2001. Again, not ideal to trade sideways but over the long-term most of the time you end up with a gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I could recommend one thing I would say try doing your stock research on your own and see if you can find some companies you think could be a gem or companies you just believe in. For example, I really liked the direction Ford was going with their new cars and business strategy so even though many said they weren't a good stock I  bought a bunch of shares at around $5 because I genuinely believed in the company and loved their products. That has since paid off. \n\nWhen you're following the advice of reddit, WSB, Daily finance shows, etc you are at the mercy of the big players trying to influence the little guys like you and me and it's easy to get swept up in the hype before they pull out the rug on you.",
