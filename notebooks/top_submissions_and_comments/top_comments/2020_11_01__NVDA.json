        "body": "Lol not sure why my post about CRSR was closed, but I'll write my take here.\n\nNot really hype or pump at all. Imagine if the PS5 AND Xbox were currently selling as just console only (like no controllers, power plug wires, hdmi, storage). PS5 would still be out of stock, and people would still be buying the controllers, power plugs, etc from name brand companies that make them. They would buy them even without the PS5 console with the belief and preparation that they will buy it eventually and they mind as well since the prices are bit lower for the holiday sale season.\n\nI'm in that work space. So here's the rub. There is a huge demand for pc building. If you've seen AMD's rise that's proof enough of the demand. AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel similar space of building the most valuable parts of the computer, the video card (GPU) and the computer processer (CPU). They are the PS5 consoles in the PC world. **They do not sell the other parts of the PC**. That's where Corsair comes in. \n\nCorsair is pretty unique in the PC world in their variety in parts. Their competitors are usually only specialist in certain parts. For example PC builders will be familiar with G.Skill, but they only make RAM. Cooler Master, but they only make PC cases and cooling units (I'm not including the power supplies because I think they are shit). Kingston also makes a variety of PC parts and is the closest variety part making competitor (Also they are like the cheaper brand of these parts and you get what you pay for). All three of these are private companies so no real data on their sales, but they should also be profiting right now as well. In addition Corsair also is probably only second to Logitech with computer peripherals. These include things like mouse, keyboard, headset, etc. With such variety of products and a brand known for quality it isn't surprising that CRSR is still on the rise.\n\nI use AMD, NVIDA, and even Intel as my indicator of how well CRSR is doing. AMD goes up, means their sales are still going up, meaning people need the complimentary parts, meaning CRSR goes up. I'm not sure where they will end up stabilizing at. I bought a bunch at their IPO, and I don't think it will stop at 40. Logitech is around 80 and they only sell the peripherals. Grant they have a bigger market cap, but they have also been publicly trading for more than 20 years. Corsair is in no way inferior to Logitech. I only use them since they are really the only other publicly trading company that partly share a space with CRSR. \n\nThis is the second stock (AMD is first) that I have been excited to own since I actually know a lot about the products and the company. To me who works in tech and an avid PC building enthusiast, I view Corsair as a top brand as I would Nike in its respected field of athletic apparel and sneakers.",

It will consolidate for the week and probably test the run up to 35.\n\nAlso most of the sell off today was small retail positions panic selling. Large position (Whales) inflow was up and outflow was down.\n\nThe Citron sounds like a hit piece so that the big boys and hedge funds can pick up the shares for cheap while making sure calls expire worthless on option expiration.\n\nThe volume was 200M. A yacht load of shares changed hands today. Stock was manipulated. Don't buy weeklies not just for PLTR but for all stocks unless you're day trading them.\n$726 Million in retail dumped their shares a lot of it when the ticker turned red. Stop posting PLTR memes here then panic selling at the first sign of blood.\n\nTLDR: PLTR testing $35 next week whether you like it or not.

Nvidia has been working on self driving cars for years now. Daimler has the fleet and Nvidia the brain, they will be putting out very competitive vehicles. When it comes to AI there's no company I would trust more than Nvidia, they're pretty much all in on AI and Daimler is gonna benefit from that. But it's gonna take a few years for that to materialize so I dont know how one would take advantage of that here and now with options.

Softbank bought ARM in 2016 for 32B and in their 4 years of owning it its only grown a few billlion in valuation.They have not been able to properly focus on growing and expanding ARM as they have had other pressing issues to worry about, especially this past year. Nvidia on the other hand knows what they're doing with ARM. \n\nNow, Softbank is selling ARM for $40B, *22B of which will be paid in NVDA shares.* Essentially, Softbank are making an *investment* in the hope that Nvidia is able to grow ARM at a much better rate than they could. which should pay off for them eventually",

        "body": "Seems fairly uninformed. I can't read \"And now, it\u2019s just a matter of time before the performance of ARM-based chips continues its march upmarket into Intel\u2019s last refuge: the server business\" without immediately thinking that he has no idea of the very long and tumultuous history of big iron server ARM. Apple's lighting core is not going to be in the datacenter/server space. Ever. That's not how Apple works. They keep their vertically integrated tech as a competitive advantage and as a way to gate in innovation from other players that literally don't have the capability to copy it without playing \"follow the leader\", the cadence of which works to Apple's advantage.\n\nIf ARM stays independent then ARM is not breaking into servers any time soon. If NVIDIA gets ARM then it is highly likely that ARM will be in servers, but that's just the progression of the trend that's already happening with stream processing eating x86 market share. NVIDIA will not be slotting in ARM chips into chip sockets currently owned by Xeon and Threadripper, they have a very different vision for the datacenter and server space that involves deep vertical integration and dominant performance to justify it. Thus their purchase of Mellanox as a means to that end.\n\nIntel is not screwed because of Apple (we've known about Apple ARM for many months now), it still comes down to AMD getting into the datacenter, server, and laptop space - areas where Intel has built it's behemoth size off of parts that they sell for thousands of dollars. Margins will be crushed, and Intel has insanely huge capex requirements due to running its own fabs. If Intel continues to have fab problems and has to execute an inevitably expensive transition to fabless while their margins are getting crushed, it's going to be another inflection point where investors are going to bail. That would probably be the buy-in time for a knife catcher, but I'd never buy it now. Their quarterly reports are so poor right now that every report has a serious risk of huge investment losses. Intel lied to investors for years about the severity of their fab problems, and Swan gets 0 leeway from investors. I remember how awful his first call was, how he was trying to blame China and how outright pissed the analysts were at his bullshit and how huge the resulting selloff was afterwards. It's really an important point that Intel has lost the trust of their investors, including institutions. These bad flow trends aren't going to reverse unless Intel perhaps kills it for a couple of quarters back to back, and that's not at all likely given the competitive landscape.",

        "body": "I understand the desire, but those sparse expirations, low volumes, and crazy wide bid/asks are all warning flags to steer clear of options on those ETFs. You're just throwing away money trading those options.\n\nA better idea would be to figure out what the top 3 holdings of each of those funds are and see if any of those companies have highly liquid options. Then trade options on those companies as a sort of proxy.\n\nFor example, the top three holdings of SOXX are AVGO, NVDA, TXN. All three have decent liquidity.\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SOXX/holding\n\nYou can then use an asset correlation app to see which of those individual stocks with liquid options most closely correlates to the fund's performance. For example:\n\n[Portfolio Visualizer asset correlation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&amp;symbols=SOXX+AVGO+NVDA+TXN&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;tradingDays=60&amp;months=36)\n\nTXN is the closest with a .84 correlation to SOXX.\n\n\n\nFWIW, you're paying an obscene expense ratio on ARKK. You'd likely make more money over the long run holding QQQ instead of ARKK.",
