It will consolidate for the week and probably test the run up to 35.\n\nAlso most of the sell off today was small retail positions panic selling. Large position (Whales) inflow was up and outflow was down.\n\nThe Citron sounds like a hit piece so that the big boys and hedge funds can pick up the shares for cheap while making sure calls expire worthless on option expiration.\n\nThe volume was 200M. A yacht load of shares changed hands today. Stock was manipulated. Don't buy weeklies not just for PLTR but for all stocks unless you're day trading them.\n$726 Million in retail dumped their shares a lot of it when the ticker turned red. Stop posting PLTR memes here then panic selling at the first sign of blood.\n\nTLDR: PLTR testing $35 next week whether you like it or not. Andrew Left from Citron has a total net worth of $5m US and set the price target for PTON at $5 and NVDA at $100.",

Nvidia has been working on self driving cars for years now. Daimler has the fleet and Nvidia the brain, they will be putting out very competitive vehicles. When it comes to AI there's no company I would trust more than Nvidia, they're pretty much all in on AI and Daimler is gonna benefit from that. But it's gonna take a few years for that to materialize so I dont know how one would take advantage of that here and now with options. I dont see why Daimler would take off any further right now because they heavily rely on the economy not to be dogshit and the economy doesnt look too hot right now.",

Its losses in the past couple of weeks only bring it down to where the US tech bubble stocks are, because before that, it was outperforming them: \n\n[Past 3 months of BABA, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, FB, AMD](https://imgur.com/9yxOe0h)\n\nRight now, BABA has dropped to the same level of performance of the US tech bubble stocks that don't have some kind of special growth story (like NVDA riding the semiconductors bump or GOOG riding the online ads recover), for the past 3 months. \n\nWhether BABA drops further is going to be a function of whether or not all the coronavirus bubble stocks, including the US tech bubble stocks, are going to maintain their value or start to tumble once investors realized they've topped out or losing value.\n\nBecause of the political and regulatory situation in China, I think it's unlikely that BABA will rebound in this quarter without some intervening special event that redeems it.",

I can't read \"And now, it\u2019s just a matter of time before the performance of ARM-based chips continues its march upmarket into Intel\u2019s last refuge: the server business\" without immediately thinking that he has no idea of the very long and tumultuous history of big iron server ARM. Apple's lighting core is not going to be in the datacenter/server space. Ever. That's not how Apple works. They keep their vertically integrated tech as a competitive advantage and as a way to gate in innovation from other players that literally don't have the capability to copy it without playing \"follow the leader\", the cadence of which works to Apple's advantage.\n\nIf ARM stays independent then ARM is not breaking into servers any time soon. If NVIDIA gets ARM then it is highly likely that ARM will be in servers, but that's just the progression of the trend that's already happening with stream processing eating x86 market share. NVIDIA will not be slotting in ARM chips into chip sockets currently owned by Xeon and Threadripper, they have a very different vision for the datacenter and server space that involves deep vertical integration and dominant performance to justify it. Thus their purchase of Mellanox as a means to that end.\n\nIntel is not screwed because of Apple (we've known about Apple ARM for many months now), it still comes down to AMD getting into the datacenter, server, and laptop space - areas where Intel has built it's behemoth size off of parts that they sell for thousands of dollars. Margins will be crushed, and Intel has insanely huge capex requirements due to running its own fabs. If Intel continues to have fab problems and has to execute an inevitably expensive transition to fabless while their margins are getting crushed, it's going to be another inflection point where investors are going to bail. That would probably be the buy-in time for a knife catcher, but I'd never buy it now. Their quarterly reports are so poor right now that every report has a serious risk of huge investment losses. Intel lied to investors for years about the severity of their fab problems, and Swan gets 0 leeway from investors. I remember how awful his first call was, how he was trying to blame China and how outright pissed the analysts were at his bullshit and how huge the resulting selloff was afterwards. It's really an important point that Intel has lost the trust of their investors, including institutions. These bad flow trends aren't going to reverse unless Intel perhaps kills it for a couple of quarters back to back, and that's not at all likely given the competitive landscape.",
