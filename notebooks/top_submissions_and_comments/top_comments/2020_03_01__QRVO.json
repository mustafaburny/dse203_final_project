        "body": "I mean as you found out, bonds have a floor that equities don't. It isn't so much that bonds are trading at $50 now because presumably they bought them at $100 but the average recovery value is $50. Equity can and will go to $0 so you don't have that floor. The other thing is the S&amp;P 500 has a decent amount of junk in it, pun intended. IQV, IRM, DVN, APA, M, QRVO. \n\nPerhaps the problem with indexing but if you want to trade this strategy, probably better off doing it versus strong balance sheets but even then, equities on the whole are likely to underperform credit on the whole given they are riskier. Where you really see this show up is the IWM (small cap) performance vs SPY or large cap indices. \n\nThe other thing is that there is likely some Fed put in HY. They ain't buying HY yet but they'll buy HY before they buy stocks. Look at the index trading at a NAV premium. If things hit the fan, they'll end up supporting the credit while equity likely goes to 0.",
