        "body": "Thanks for your question. There are a number of ways in which we are very different, and the differences are really significant. First and foremost, Payoneer was custom-built for business to business transactions, while Paypal focuses primarily on consumer to business payments.   This means our infrastructure and pricing are targeted at bigger transactions at lower price points while Paypal is essentially built around consumer credit card infrastructure and pricing, which is too high for B2B.  Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",

It is such a big market with well over 1 billon people, a lot of technology sophistication, growing digitalization and there are lots of talented small business owners.  We work with exporters of services and goods and have had strong consistent growth there.  We think India should support strong growth for many years to come.  As it relates to Paypal, I think what they really have indicated is that they are pulling back from trying to compete in the domestic market in India.  They have consistently been supporting cross-border from India for many years, so that isn't anything new.  So we think India is a huge opportunity and our B2B focus is a great fit for a market that is so big and so focused on growing its trade relationships with the rest of the world.  There is so much room for growth, regardless of what other players may be doing in the market.",

At first glance, they are already offering more services than a bank, and the best part is, everything can be accessed directly in the palm of your hand, not waiting in line for a teller.\"\n\"SoFi is structured around 3 key segments, Lending, Financial Services, &amp; Its Technology platform.\n\nIts lending platform offers student loan refinancing, personal loans, home loans, and school loans.\n\nIts financial services include its stock\ntrading app and the recently launched\nSoFi credit card. All of these businesses\noffer a huge advantage in that they can\ncross-sell multiple financial products in\norder to boost revenue while lowering\nchurn. This has been highlighted by its\nmulti-product member growth going\nfrom 74k in Q2'19 to 400k today and a\nplan to get that to 775k by the end of\n2021.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of Sofi and why\nlam bullish on the company is its\nTechnology Platform. This includes a\nproduct called Galileo, which powers\nSofi Money and companies like Chime,\nTransferwise, and even Robinhood.\nGalileo is an API and white-labeled\npayments platform. This means that\nother companies looking to build\nfinancial services products can build on\nthis technology, creating an alternative\nrevenue stream for SoFi.",

SoFi appears to be a very solid company, the DD I have done shows strong user growth, low debt, good growth, will be profitable this year with over 1B in revenue. They are also pursuing a bank charter and have acquired a California bank to help with that, should the bank charter get approved the stock could easily jump above $30 by the end of the year.

Decrease in price the year leading up to elections and massive increase the years after until we do it all again. \n\nGas is more expensive right now, but it has nothing to do with the dollar or crypto or even inflation. \n\nFood costs are up, but it\u2019s basically in line with healthy inflation. Everyone is worried about April numbers when year over year they are basically right in line with what we want. We need a certain level of inflation to maintain growth. \n\nNone of this has anything to do with future crypto viability. In what world, do you see the US government allowing a decentralized crypto coin to overtake the worlds currency? Crypto will be the future, but for it to exist in the banking systems needed to function in a regular society it will be a Fed backed coin that makes the leap. At that point, the rest will die a horrible death. Crypto is a product of supply and demand like anything else. \n\nYou can not use crypto to buy anything. You can use crypto to exchange for dollars and then buy goods. To do so, coinbase, PayPal, etc charges a fee. The business is fees, not crypto. Furthermore, Bitcoin is traded not spent. A currency system is to be spent. Meaning Bitcoin stays in the same general hands where dollars move all around the world. I\u2019m just not sure you have an understanding of the economics here. \n\nBitcoin can go up in value, but that doesn\u2019t make your arguments legitimate. Bitcoin is not predictable or useful. It does not serve a purpose outside of trading. That said, there is nothing wrong making money trading crypto.",

All of these businesses\noffer a huge advantage in that they can\ncross-sell multiple financial products in\norder to boost revenue while lowering\nchurn. This has been highlighted by its\nmulti-product member growth going\nfrom 74k in Q2'19 to 400k today and a\nplan to get that to 775k by the end of\n2021.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of Sofi and why\nlam bullish on the company is its\nTechnology Platform. This includes a\nproduct called Galileo, which powers\nSofi Money and companies like Chime,\nTransferwise, and even Robinhood.\nGalileo is an API and white-labeled\npayments platform. This means that\nother companies looking to build\nfinancial services products can build on\nthis technology, creating an alternative\nrevenue stream for SoFi.",

As someone who has family back home, my grandparents always watch the Filipino channel and half the commercials are about how to send money home and they always have a huge fee because it\u2019s not as feasible with other platforms so it costs a lot more.\n\nBeing able to use PayPal to buy things from other countries isn\u2019t the same as using it to send money to other people in other countries. People live very different lives to those of us in 1st world countries. Many of these people (about 50% of the world) don\u2019t have bank accounts.
