Recent low quarterly growth report had to do with strategic exiting of high-risk Asia markets, without which they said they'd have reported growth in the high teens.  Their new Board of Directors, along with Bill Foley as Chairman, suggests this will continue to be a very positive turn around story.\n\nThey only produced losses last ER because they had millions in one-time expenses associated with paying down $1.2 Billion in debt and merger transaction costs.  Without those non-recurring expenses, they'd have reported over $40 million in profit and beat analysts' EPS estimates.  Because of these and other strategic moves, EBITDA and EPS will show big improvements going forward.\n\nNever heard anything about the nutraceutical thing.  That seems like a different company, or just made up.  Curious to learn though if you have proof.  Paysafe owns the second largest digital wallet globally and currently dominates the iGaming sector globally.",

In fact, last quarter alone they generated $108 million which is a 28% yoy increase.\n\nYou say, \"As of my knowledge, they don't have their own technology\"\n\nResponse: Their MOAT is in their unique platforms which allow them to successfully enter spaces that other fintechs can't or won't.  For example: Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.\n\nAnother aspect of their MOAT is their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise which offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics.

        "body": "Thanks for your question. There are a number of ways in which we are very different, and the differences are really significant. First and foremost, Payoneer was custom-built for business to business transactions, while Paypal focuses primarily on consumer to business payments.   This means our infrastructure and pricing are targeted at bigger transactions at lower price points while Paypal is essentially built around consumer credit card infrastructure and pricing, which is too high for B2B.  Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",

        "body": "Yeah, just added to Russell 3000 and 1000. Found bottom support and getting ready to build upward momentum imo.\n\nThis is what I like about it:\nPaysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPartnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.\n\nVoted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n\nPaysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin &amp; 26 other crypto-currencies) and was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.\n\nUnlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\nIn Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.\n\nRecent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n\nPaysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn\u2019t include planned inorganic M&amp;A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020\u2019s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth.\n\nBuy rating from all seven analysts covering Paysafe, with 50-70% upside from current price but, with everything noted above, it\u2019s clear that Paysafe would still be significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of ~12.5% (in Paysafe\u2019s 10-13% range):\n\n\u200b\n\nPaysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n\u200b\n\nValuation Notes:\n\nRemoved all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+\nUnlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\nPaysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group\nPaysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them\n\u200b\n\nChairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, Bill Foley, has a proven track record in generating value for his investors through rapid synergistic inorganic growth. This is a key strategic pillar for Paysafe. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d",
