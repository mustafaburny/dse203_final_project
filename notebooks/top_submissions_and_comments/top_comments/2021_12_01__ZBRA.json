Unfortunately, I get an error saying they are down atm and cant check.  I do like the idea of buyting the further OTM put to redcue the capital if it is 100% cash.\n\nAs for the ZEBRA, I'll have to look in to that.  I havent used or even know what one is and will have to do some research.  Love getting in to this but have a lot to learn.  If you have any good resources, i'd appreciate it.  If not, google works too!",

        "body": "It seems like you understand the risks. Keep in mind that the covered strangle is a long position. You stand to lose a lot if the stock drops. Additionally, it seems like you\u2019re selling a cash-covered put and not a leveraged put. That\u2019s a VERY capital-intensive position. The airlines might not be margined with your broker. I know Fidelity isn\u2019t margining AAL, which I found out when they took $1,700 for a 17P. Very annoying. \n\nYou might consider buying a further OTM put to cap the capital requirement and give yourself some efficiency. \n\nYou can achieve the same results on an un-leveraged covered strangle with a lot less and less risk. For example, if you own 100 shares of DAL and you sell a 20 delta strangle, you are net long 100 deltas. However, if you\u2019re selling a CSP, you are synthetically long the second lot at your break even, so from a capital standpoint, it\u2019s actually more like 180 long deltas. Ignoring that, you can buy a ZEBRA, which will give you 100 long deltas for probably 1/4 the amount of capital as the cash-covered strangle. You could sell 2 ATM puts, or buy 2 ATM calls both of which will give you 100 deltas. If you wanted 180 long deltas, you could sell (3) 60 delta puts or buy (3) 60 delta calls.",
