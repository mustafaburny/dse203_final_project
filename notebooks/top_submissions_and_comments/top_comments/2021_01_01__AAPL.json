Any loses were more do to stubborn conviction, and relatively quantifiable by the shorts at any given time. \n\nApple taking a 1% dip may represent a paper loss similar in dollar value, but no one is forced to sell at that dip and realize that loss, and even if they did, again it is known and quantifiable. \n\nWith The current situation the squeeze potential is enormous and potential losses cannot really be quantified because they are theoretically infinite. Shorts in this circumstance, unlike Tesla, may not be able to close out their positions for some time due to lack of liquidity and/or risk of triggering a cascading squeeze. Because these losses have the potential to be massive for the funds themselves and even threaten their solvency, the risk can easily spill over into the brokerage houses as well, setting up a domino situation. \n\nThis current situation isn\u2019t as much about the total losses realized thus far by the funds, in that case you are right, more money has been lost before. The fear from the institutions is more about their inability to measure how bad their losses *could* be and their inability to control it.",

I will respond to your bear case, with the **possible** bullish points (I'll also give the bearish take on it).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; **\"It's so secure!\"** \n\nThat's a sentiment around BlackBerry. Basically the stuff they do is normal stuff that doesn't evolve quick - but it is secure.  \n\\*BBMe - Just messaging, but secure  \n\\*BlackBerry AtHoc - Just crisis communication, but secure &amp; reliable  \n\\*BlackBerry Workspaces - Just file sharing, but secure  \n\\*...\n\nThey're looking to advance this sentiment to cars, since in their eyes cars will be the next big connected thing. Especially in self-driving security is key. \n\nAlso they are already running on 175mil cars, one would think they've already had atleast *some* attacks. (In 2017 there were about 100mil Mac computers, and they've suffered some attacks)\n\n*Bullish: They make it secure and get famous for it*  \n*Bearish: They make it secure, but others succeed as well / They fail at making/keeping it secure*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; **\"But QNX has a moat! Look at all these safety standards.\"** \n\nIt can't hurt to have these certifications. \n\n*Bullish: Manufacturers care about certifications*  \n*Bearish: Manufacturers don't care about certifications*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; **\"Look at the 175 million vehicles using QNX!\"** \n\nIt sure doesn't hurt to already have relationships. They have relationships with a lot of top tier manufacturers.\n\nsrc: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html)\n\nThe articles also states \"In the past five years we've gone from BlackBerry QNX technology helping to power 60 million cars to today's announcement of more than 175 million \"  \nThis is about 25% YoY growth. Or x3 in 5 years.\n\nIt's no guarantee that they keep growing like this however.\n\n*Bullish: They keep growing like this, or even more with EV's coming (needing more electronics, meaning more software)*  \n*Bearish: Manufacturers make their own stuff or use other system suppliers.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; **BlackBerry IVY** \n\nBlackBerry IVY wants to be a platform for all cars, and does not want to own the data generated by the platform. This is something important for manufacturers, and is something the Apple/Android car will probably not provide.  \nThe way they presented this partnership: BlackBerry knows cars, Amazon knows UI and data. \n\n*Bullish: Manufacturers implement IVY because they'll own their data, IVY gets a big market share which develops in something like Android/iOS for cars and then the decide to monetize since they can't be beaten at that point. This is hard however, as can be seen in the smartphone world: many have tried and many have failed.*  \n*Bearish: They fail.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Talent** \n\nI know nothing about this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; **Parting sentiment: Stay simple or get squeezed out**\n\nLooking at the 60 -&gt; 175mil in the past 5 years, I dont think they're on track to be squeezed out. The direction can change ofcourse.  \nStay simple is something that may be plausible. However since I have no experience in the field I do not know how fast paced these things are and whether they need to change quick. If fast paced, this *could* be a problem for BB since they like to go slow and steady to ensure quality, reliability and security.",

Because these guys had to liquidate real assets to cover and now you can pick their pockets and buy at a discount.",

Also, I think you are misinterpreting 'giant multinational corporations' as belonging to a specific country. That just isn't true. Microsoft and Google for example are headquartered in the US but have employees all over the world. \n\n\\- Canada actually does make cars there are a handful of major manufacturing plants in Ontario. There are also automotive research and design offices. Yes, the companies are headquartered in the US, but that doesn't mean they have no Canadian content. \n\n\\- Canada has a number of hardware companies. ATI which used to design graphics cards was Canadian until it got purchased by AMD. They still have offices in Canada and the graphics cards are competitive with the best made anywhere. I don't think any of the GPU manufacturing is actually in Canada, but lots of the R&amp;D is done here. \n\n\\- Canada does have a significant pharmaceutical industry, it is just small compared to the US where profits can be many times higher due to the high per-person healthcare spending in the US.  Often times viable products designed in Canada get purchased by larger American companies before they reach consumers so you don't realize the Canadian connection. Canada also has facilities to make vaccines, they just don't happen to be compatible with the new type of vaccine being used for COVID (mRNA). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been some notable Canadian tech failures. Nortel for example was the world leader in advanced telecommunications technology. Unfortunately, it fell victim to a combination of incompetent management and corporate espionage where it had its designs stolen from competitors. BlackBerry is a bit similar in that it completely DOMINATED the world's smartphone market for well over a decade before Apple disrupted the market with the first-gen iPhone. The smartphone market eventually saw everyone else either make android phones or sell off the cellphone business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCanadian companies often sell out to large multinational companies. They just have the resources such that it doesn't make sense for someone small to compete against them, it's better to join them.",

They're like the Apple of EV's, once their \"IPhone\" caught on it was all upwards for them. It's the Cybertruck, and Silicon Batteries, and fucking SpaceX, just like new IPhones have better cameras and larger screens.\n\nThe short positions on GME are all so underwater that when James Cameron went 11km under the sea he briefly caught a glimpse of Melvin Capital sinking out of sight. They're completely turbofucked. Combine this with the boomer market's resistance to seeing anything of value in GME (BlOcKbUsTeR) and I don't think investor sentiment is going to really start turning around until the numbers get better. C-suite's talk but it's money that walks. I do think that Q4 earnings will spread some good sentiment, and if you are right and Cohen does become CEO (possibly at the shareholder meeting in June if it were to happen this year) that's when the long march positive will really start. \n\nTL;DR: Smart money on the street thinks this is just a short squeeze. Dumb money thinks it's a WSB pump. Venture Capitalists would think that GME has a bright future ahead of it, but few are really looking at it because SPAC's and EV's and green tech and fancy big-data businesses are the current hotness.",

Of course these growing business are valued very differently. They still may be overvalued businesses by the way, but everyone needs to stop comparing them to legacy automakers because they\u2019re different businesses.\n\nEven Herbert Deiss, CEO of Volkswagen, acknowledges the key differences between Tesla, tech, and EV companies with legacy auto:\n\n&gt; We as an industry are facing new rivals like Tesla or Apple. One of the biggest differences actually is the view of capital markets: Cause we haven\u2019t sufficiently proved yet that we can hold our ground in the new competitive environment - our valuation is still located in \u2018old auto\u2019. This leads to a grave disadvantage for us in terms of access to required resources.\n \n&gt; More so, the new game of autonomous, electric drivetrains, mobility with sophisticated devices,.. is even more capital and resource intesive than \u201eold auto\u201c.

I saw that they barely made any revenue relative to their debt. So I says, \"If Tesla, a luxury car company, was to ever enter a recession they would be fucked. There will be no demand for their cars causing them to default on multiple loans.\" I says, \"I have learned from school that this is how economics/finance works. Overvalued stocks can run for a long time, but eventually a recession will shut them down!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me tell you was I (and still am) retarded. Tesla gained in magnitudes I would have never dreamt of. I called people buying it at 200 dollars retards! Apparently despite being in a massive supply chain shock, Tesla is immune to any sort of rhyme or reason for financials. The animal spirit fumes surrounding this stock are so mother fucking intoxicating that it does not matter if TSLA's market cap becomes worth 5% of the US GDP with only 30 billion dollars in revenue (apple is about 2 trillion dollars and has 280 billion revenue). It will keep going up. It makes no sense, it will never grow into its valuation unless it somehow makes a space elevator straight to Mars that brings back gold.",

They aren't just simply going to combine a bunch of tech in the market and rebrand it into apple car. If that were the case Elon Musk would be laughing his ass off instead of saying that Apple could be their biggest competitor.\n2. You're overstating the impact of Hyundai investing in Goev. They invest in venture startups EVERYWHERE and quite honestly they probably don't care about Canoo any more than a decent prospect that they can take advantage of if Canoo takes off. They DO NOT, and I reiterate, DO NOT need to rely on a small startup to export EV infrastructure/tech to Apple lol",

        "body": "I think the right answer would probably be a combination of them all. There won\u2019t be a perfect way to hedge your whole portfolio perfectly. If there was, it would be cost prohibitive. \n\nI\u2019m convinced that the bubble will drop, but I don\u2019t wake up everyday hoping the worst to happen. That\u2019s no way to live your life. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI have about 50% in cash. Majority of my invested money is in QQQ, AAPL and FB.  I have a small amount just basically gambling with other companies like CRWD, TSLA, AMZN, etc. (they are either LEAPs or OTM call debit spreads). \n\nI\u2019m only averaging down if QQQ drops more than 30%. I have a laddering plan to max out my portfolio when QQQ is down 70%. Otherwise I\u2019ll just sit and wait til it recovers. I also have about 1% of my invested money in 5 delta QQQ June puts. It\u2019s not meant to make huge money, just to recoup some loss in case market really tanked. \n\nAll in all, market will drop at some point and eventually it will go back up. If it doesn\u2019t, then we have bigger problems. I don\u2019t wanna waste my precious time worrying about it. Ride the wave til it changes, then adjust. Size your positions appropriately and you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nThe market is quite different from 2000 bubble. Big techs like aapl, fb, amzn are making insane amount of profits, and sitting on crazy levels of cash. So I don\u2019t expect any of them to go bankrupt. If anything, this pandemic has shown how resilient they are. Biggest threat is probably government antitrust cases, but these companies spend huge amount of money to lobby so don\u2019t really expect anything to happen. It\u2019s capitalism after all. \n\nWhat happened when government repeatedly bailed out big corporations in the past? They get used to it. Same thing is happening to regular Joes, who expect a stimulus check when the economy is not doing well, and once people learn to expect to be fed, no politicians have the balls to say no. So I expect trillion dollars stimulus to become the norm. And all those stimulus money will be spent by consumers once pandemic is over. So really, I kinda think the market has much room to grow too, especially in travel and discretionary spendings.",

Tesla is expected to grow every metric you could think of (Revenue, sales, EBIT, EBITDA, net income) by 50-100% per year for the next 5 years. NIO and BYD are likely to grow quickly as well. Of course these growing business are valued very differently. They still may be overvalued businesses by the way, but everyone needs to stop comparing them to legacy automakers because they\u2019re different businesses.\n\nEven Herbert Deiss, CEO of Volkswagen, acknowledges the key differences between Tesla, tech, and EV companies with legacy auto:\n\n&gt; We as an industry are facing new rivals like Tesla or Apple. One of the biggest differences actually is the view of capital markets: Cause we haven\u2019t sufficiently proved yet that we can hold our ground in the new competitive environment - our valuation is still located in \u2018old auto\u2019. This leads to a grave disadvantage for us in terms of access to required resources.\n \n&gt; More so, the new game of autonomous, electric drivetrains, mobility with sophisticated devices,.. is even more capital and resource intesive than \u201eold auto\u201c. That is why we have to push more for solid cash flows from our actual businesses to be able to finance our future from inside.",

If there was, it would be cost prohibitive. \n\nI\u2019m convinced that the bubble will drop, but I don\u2019t wake up everyday hoping the worst to happen. That\u2019s no way to live your life. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI have about 50% in cash. Majority of my invested money is in QQQ, AAPL and FB.  I have a small amount just basically gambling with other companies like CRWD, TSLA, AMZN, etc. (they are either LEAPs or OTM call debit spreads). \n\nI\u2019m only averaging down if QQQ drops more than 30%. I have a laddering plan to max out my portfolio when QQQ is down 70%. Otherwise I\u2019ll just sit and wait til it recovers. I also have about 1% of my invested money in 5 delta QQQ June puts. It\u2019s not meant to make huge money, just to recoup some loss in case market really tanked. \n\nAll in all, market will drop at some point and eventually it will go back up. If it doesn\u2019t, then we have bigger problems. I don\u2019t wanna waste my precious time worrying about it. Ride the wave til it changes, then adjust. Size your positions appropriately and you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nThe market is quite different from 2000 bubble. Big techs like aapl, fb, amzn are making insane amount of profits, and sitting on crazy levels of cash. So I don\u2019t expect any of them to go bankrupt. If anything, this pandemic has shown how resilient they are. Biggest threat is probably government antitrust cases, but these companies spend huge amount of money to lobby so don\u2019t really expect anything to happen. It\u2019s capitalism after all. \n\nWhat happened when government repeatedly bailed out big corporations in the past? They get used to it. Same thing is happening to regular Joes, who expect a stimulus check when the economy is not doing well, and once people learn to expect to be fed, no politicians have the balls to say no. So I expect trillion dollars stimulus to become the norm. And all those stimulus money will be spent by consumers once pandemic is over. So really, I kinda think the market has much room to grow too, especially in travel and discretionary spendings.",

They are constantly updating the fucking thing and making it cooler. They will roll out subscription based services for the autonomous driving and other features, and this is just on the Auto side. Wait till you see people building utility scale solar and buying their megapacks to store energy and resell it. NV energy just secured thousands of acres from the BLM for a solar farm and most likely going to them for storage. Essentially Tesla is a mix of Apple, Google and God. The list goes on but here's the most important thing everyone that shits on Tesla overlooks...Which other fucking international company on Earth owns their real estate in communist China? Don't worry, I'll wait....\n\nIf you buy BABA, you dont anything of the company directly, just rights of an offshore company that has ownership in BABA. Long story short...owning Tesla means you own the only company that made \ud83c\udf6f\ud83d\udc3b cave in.",

One of the biggest differences actually is the view of capital markets: Cause we haven\u2019t sufficiently proved yet that we can hold our ground in the new competitive environment - our valuation is still located in \u2018old auto\u2019.

Apple is likely reaching out to auto manufacturers not for their tech, but to produce their products using the auto industries' existing factories. They aren't just simply going to combine a bunch of tech in the market and rebrand it into apple car. If that were the case Elon Musk would be laughing his ass off instead of saying that Apple could be their biggest competitor.\n2. You're overstating the impact of Hyundai investing in Goev. They invest in venture startups EVERYWHERE and quite honestly they probably don't care about Canoo any more than a decent prospect that they can take advantage of if Canoo takes off. They DO NOT, and I reiterate, DO NOT need to rely on a small startup to export EV infrastructure/tech to Apple lol",

Of course these growing business are valued very differently.

One of the biggest differences actually is the view of capital markets: Cause we haven\u2019t sufficiently proved yet that we can hold our ground in the new competitive environment - our valuation is still located in \u2018old auto\u2019. This leads to a grave disadvantage for us in terms of access to required resources.\n \n&gt; More so, the new game of autonomous, electric drivetrains, mobility with sophisticated devices,.. is even more capital and resource intesive than \u201eold auto\u201c.

It's being valued based on an imagined future where it conquers the entire automotive industry and then some.\n\nHey, that may very well happen.  It might not.  But, the point is that the valuation has jumped the gun here.  A 1500 P/E ratio?  Come on.  Apple had arguably the biggest success story in the modern history of markets with the iPhone and the wholesale revolution of the mobile/handheld computing sector.  Their company is worth about 20 times more than it was 14 years ago when it was released.  It peaked at a 40 P/E ratio.\n\nTesla, on the other hand, is worth almost 450 times what it was since going public.  It is now the 6th biggest company in the world by market cap and is worth as much as Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler, Ford, Nissan, and Honda put together.  It's one thing to think they will dominate the market eventually.  It's another to price them as if they've already won.\n\nI can't tell anyone what to do, but I'd be taking my profits now.  You can always come back to them in the future.  How much more upside are you trying to extract out of this?  Where do you see the valuation going in the future and how?",

Make a US index with just ford, Gm, the banks and industrials and you will arrive at just a slight premium in valuation.\n\nEuropean and international equities are cheap because the underlying companies just don't get a high multiple and because they don't have any tech companies. It isn't much different when comparing apples to apples.\n\nThe single fact that you compare apple and samsung shows you know nothing about these 2 companies. Samsungs main business by profit is in Dram and nand, not in making phones. Apple also doesn't make phone screens or washing machines. The 2 companies are barely compareable.

It's being valued based on an imagined future where it conquers the entire automotive industry and then some.\n\nHey, that may very well happen.  It might not.  But, the point is that the valuation has jumped the gun here.  A 1500 P/E ratio?  Come on.  Apple had arguably the biggest success story in the modern history of markets with the iPhone and the wholesale revolution of the mobile/handheld computing sector.  Their company is worth about 20 times more than it was 14 years ago when it was released.  It peaked at a 40 P/E ratio.\n\nTesla, on the other hand, is worth almost 450 times what it was since going public.  It is now the 6th biggest company in the world by market cap and is worth as much as Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler, Ford, Nissan, and Honda put together.  It's one thing to think they will dominate the market eventually.  It's another to price them as if they've already won.\n\nI can't tell anyone what to do, but I'd be taking my profits now.  You can always come back to them in the future.  How much more upside are you trying to extract out of this?  Where do you see the valuation going in the future and how?",

DD below. \n\nToday's price drop was driven by a conflation of macro economic factors unrelated to Romeo, namely: \n\n1. There was a broad market sell off today. 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies lost value. This was due to more restrictive COVID restrictions in North America and Europe. \n\n2. On negative market news (above), investors take their money out of riskier stocks first, less risky stocks last. Romeo is a riskier stock because its a relatively new company (founded in 2016) and a small company (less than $1bn market cap), so naturally more investors will flee Romeo versus say, Apple or Tesla. \n\n3. The EV sector (and SPACs generally) exploded in q4 2020. It's natural for air to come out of a balloon that's been inflated so dramatically and rapidly as investors will be taking their profits. \n\n4. A report came out today casting doubt on the promise of QuantumScape's solid state technology. This caused QS stock to drop dramatically. Since QS is the poster child of the EV/SPAC bubble, short term investors get scared off of the sector as a whole and flee other EV stocks (not just QS). \n\n5. The conflation of factors above results in significant selling pressure, causing the stock price to dip significantly. After this initial (2%) price fall, day traders who are overleveraged face margin calls and are forced to sell. This causes the price to drop even more dramatically. This price drop - margin call pattern is a self reinforcing cycle which results in a large price drop on the day.\n\nDespite the above, I am confident Romeo Power is currently undervalued at $20 per share, because:\n\n6. Romeo is one of the only EV sector players with a product - and it even has revenue already. Prior to today the company had over $500 million in committed revenue (2021 to 2025). \n\n7. Today Romeo signed a supply contract with Heritage Power, which is additional committed revenue on top of the $500 million.\n\n8. Today Amazon agreed to purchase from Lion Power up to 2,500 electric busses. Romeo is the battery supplier for Lion Power, so this Amazon deal de-risks the committed revenue Romeo has from Lion Power. Lion Power has also found a SPAC partner which will provide the necessary funding to manufacture the busses.\n\n9. Even better, Amazon's contract with Lion Power includes an option for Amazon to purchase up to a 20 per cent stake in Lion Power. If Amazon exercises this option, Lion Power will be a force to be reckoned with in the electric Class 8 commercial vehicle market - in which Romeo is the market leader - which bodes incredibly well for Romeo long term.\n\nTherefore, I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. BTIG analysts have set a price target of $40 for Romeo (not factoring in the latest positive developments set out above).\n\nSource: I'm a Corporate Lawyer by profession and I subscribe to the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times and other publications.",

DD below. \n\nToday's price drop was driven by a conflation of macro economic factors unrelated to Romeo, namely: \n\n1. There was a broad market sell off today. 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies lost value. This was due to more restrictive COVID restrictions in North America and Europe. \n\n2. On negative market news (above), investors take their money out of riskier stocks first, less risky stocks last. Romeo is a riskier stock because its a relatively new company (founded in 2016) and a small company (less than $1bn market cap), so naturally more investors will flee Romeo versus say, Apple or Tesla. \n\n3. The EV sector (and SPACs generally) exploded in q4 2020. It's natural for air to come out of a balloon that's been inflated so dramatically and rapidly as investors will be taking their profits. \n\n4. A report came out today casting doubt on the promise of QuantumScape's solid state technology. This caused QS stock to drop dramatically. Since QS is the poster child of the EV/SPAC bubble, short term investors get scared off of the sector as a whole and flee other EV stocks (not just QS). \n\n5. The conflation of factors above results in significant selling pressure, causing the stock price to dip significantly. After this initial (2%) price fall, day traders who are overleveraged face margin calls and are forced to sell. This causes the price to drop even more dramatically. This price drop - margin call pattern is a self reinforcing cycle which results in a large price drop on the day.\n\nDespite the above, I am confident Romeo Power is currently undervalued at $20 per share, because:\n\n6. Romeo is one of the only EV sector players with a product - and it even has revenue already. Prior to today the company had over $500 million in committed revenue (2021 to 2025). \n\n7. Today Romeo signed a supply contract with Heritage Power, which is additional committed revenue on top of the $500 million.\n\n8. Today Amazon agreed to purchase from Lion Power up to 2,500 electric busses. Romeo is the battery supplier for Lion Power, so this Amazon deal de-risks the committed revenue Romeo has from Lion Power. Lion Power has also found a SPAC partner which will provide the necessary funding to manufacture the busses.\n\n9. Even better, Amazon's contract with Lion Power includes an option for Amazon to purchase up to a 20 per cent stake in Lion Power. If Amazon exercises this option, Lion Power will be a force to be reckoned with in the electric Class 8 commercial vehicle market - in which Romeo is the market leader - which bodes incredibly well for Romeo long term.\n\nTherefore, I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. BTIG analysts have set a price target of $40 for Romeo (not factoring in the latest positive developments set out above).\n\nSource: I'm a Corporate Lawyer by profession and I subscribe to the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times and other publications.",

This guy has a huge fund, don't put your nuts on the table against him.\n\nSecond, Intel isn't in much trouble overall. They dominate some big markets. They have fallen so far behind schedule they can pay other companies to fabricate their current generation designs while getting back on track for next gen.\n\nThird, TSMC is announcing a significant increase in capital spending and a portion of this is preparation to take on Intel contracts so Intel already has a plan. This move doesn't significantly hurt Intel's margins.\n\nFourth, Uncle Sam loves this company. Washington DC knows they need chips for defense and Intel is the only US company that makes them here. Intel can thrive in the China-US Cold War.\n\nFifth, Intel has big investments in next generation processing for tasks such as AI and LIDAR. For instance, within the past few years, Intel has bought the following companies:\n\n*Movidius - created breakthrough computer image processing technology\n\n*Nervana - created a commercially successful deep learning engine\n\n*Habana Labs - is the leading designer of AI chips\n\n*MobileEye - self-driving, everyone knows about this one\n\nIntel is losing their sales to OEMs of commodified product categories which hurts but doesn't justify the value falling to scrap levels. Cashflow and balance sheet are both very strong. You missed this trade and should have opened it the moment Apple announced they were making their own chips because that news was front running rumors that Intel was a full year behind which got confirmed later.\n\nINTC $55 C 01/21/22",

For the record I have TSLA stock and my expectation is it will continue up for about 6 more months. \n\nI think AAPL and Disney are good growth picks. Both are comparatively undervalued in this market.

For the record I have TSLA stock and my expectation is it will continue up for about 6 more months. \n\nI think AAPL and Disney are good growth picks. Both are comparatively undervalued in this market. Disney is taking huge market share of streaming services, although it's financials were definitely affected by covid big time.\n\nIf I were you I would make Disney and AAPL my two largest positions with the buy and hold goal in mind with accumulation.

For the record I have TSLA stock and my expectation is it will continue up for about 6 more months. \n\nI think AAPL and Disney are good growth picks. Both are comparatively undervalued in this market. Disney is taking huge market share of streaming services, although it's financials were definitely affected by covid big time.\n\nIf I were you I would make Disney and AAPL my two largest positions with the buy and hold goal in mind with accumulation.

Enjoyed the ride up in 1999, and saw much of that money erode come 2000. However, since I still had a job, I was able to continue to buy in 2000 when things were going down. Made my first $1M after 2 drawdown periods (1999 and 2008); $150k invested over 12 years (I'd try to put in $1k/month most months, and a bit extra when I could) turned into $1M.\n\nThere's just so much more information and knowledge available now, and the folks of today don't seem to have a problem with holding through drawdowns. I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns. I've never seen such an iron conviction before. Folks of today are not afraid of drawdowns or volatility. Additionally, between all of our corporations, we're pumping in billions of new dollars every single week into the market now.\n\nTimes have changed, and you're kidding yourself if you haven't seen the change.",

        "body": "This portfolio is entirely tech.  I know you have a long timeline, but heavily investing in one sector is risky and you miss out on other opportunities.  Spread your risk into other industries, even if a little bit.  The market is also a good benchmark and is already distributed well, so maybe 10% in SPY or a similar ETF.\n\nDividend growth is a strategy that allows for tax-deferred growth in income.  You can read more about it [here](https://www.thebalance.com/making-money-with-the-dividend-growth-investing-strategy-357877), but I recommend looking at other places, since I just did a quick search for the basics.  The main point is that dividend stocks still grow, so don't discount those.  They also tend to be established, successful companies, so they tend to be good buys without considering dividend yield - see MSFT and AAPL, historically.  (You can read an overview to compare strategies [here](https://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/15-4-withdrawal-rule-vs-dividend-stocks)).\n\nFor the growth strategy, you would sell a bunch of stocks that have grown over 30 years, pay taxes and fees, then pay to reinvest in dividend stocks for a small yield.  The roth allows you to withdraw your cash pile from dividends tax-deferred.  You pay fees when selling a stock vs. receiving dividends, so it is worth considering.  What happens if one of thee stocks has a rough few years in 2030 and falls, so you sell it, in order to rebalance?  There is more to consider when you factor in taxes, so make sure to also look for articles/studies/advice with regards to taxes.\n\nThose are my first impressions and things worth looking into.  I'm sure other redditors will have comments as well to consider.\n\nNote: This is a rough writeup based on my first impression and the links are from internet searches when typing up this reply.  The math or the examples may be off.  Look into these more to get a better idea.",

As the world returns to normal, people will realize wow, I\u2019m betting my life savings on a meme stock I\u2019ve never heard about til someone on wsb talked it up for their own benefit. As they do, they\u2019ll realize wow, Apple is the real deal. The problem is nobody is impressed anymore they\u2019re just used to it. Apple is everywhere and it really is everything. Whether you have an iPhone or Samsung pos it\u2019s an iPhone. FaceTime has become a verb. Apple stock is severely, severely under priced right now. We saw the EXACT same thing happen after the 2014 split. It took a solid couple years and analysts bashing before it finally doubled and then ended up 500% higher and split 6 years later. This will happen again. I\u2019m a long holder of Apple and will buy every dip I see along the way. I also love the 150c for 2/19 and beyond. Fantastic deal right now. So TL;Dr. buy Apple and keep buying all the way to the moon.",

I am not some veteran guy who has seen everything in the market. \n\nThis past year almost anything you could have bought should have sky rocketed.\n\nDon\u2019t start with options, ever. I\u2019d suggest starting with an index fund or very diversified ETF. These should gain 8-15% per year. This gives you exposure to a ton of different companies, and if the market takes a dive these will feel much less downward pressure. Disclaimer, history shows you should make money, but understand the risks.\n\nA few other things: DONT PANIC SELL. If the companies fundamentals align with why you invested them, take it as a buying opportunity. If you want to gamble, understand that is not investing. Have a long term outlook, AT LEAST a 1 year outlook (and 1 year is very short in terms of investing). \n\n\nIf you want to try individual stocks, try big, established companies first. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon - these are going no where and are probably some of the safest technology companies to own. \n\nHow to conduct research? Firstly, start to understand ratios, floats, revenues, earnings, growth, ROA, ROE, EBITDA - this will give you a solid groundwork on a companies current financial situation. These fundamental principles don\u2019t always apply simply to growth companies. \n\nHope I helped a little, good luck!",

So it is not illogical to see profitable technology companies doing great, I mean results are better than before this crisis so it is not incredibly shocking to me.\n\nTo conclude, we might be in a bubble but it surely is just an illusion.",

I mean, it does in the sense that if you sell for a lower price than the market is offering, you are leaving money on the table. But that's not what you described. Since you aren't trading weekly, you should not be planning to hold to expiration, and if you are not holding to expiration, **the max profit number is irrelevant**.\n\nOpening an IC is no different from any other credit trade. You set the limit the same way you would for CSPs. And yes, the greedier you are, the less likely you will get a fill anytime soon.\n\nThe goal for setting the limit for opening a credit trade is to get as close to the optimal market value as possible. What is the optimal value? Nobody knows, but it's constrained to be somewhere between the bid and the ask, inclusive. So you have to do some active bidding to find the market value. But if you care more about time than money, which is not unwise, you'll get the fastest fill by setting your limit at the net bid for the entire position. Or one increment above the net bid. Then you will have a Marketable Limit Order that will get favorable order flow routing.\n\nAnd this is without even getting into how inappropriate AAPL is for an IC play, particularly with a February expiration when the next quarterly earnings report is in January.",

Most people outside of finance had never heard about an \"ETF\". We were also seeing 6.5% CD rates in 2000. We didn't have iPhones back then, but my Lexus had a \"car phone\". Enjoyed the ride up in 1999, and saw much of that money erode come 2000. However, since I still had a job, I was able to continue to buy in 2000 when things were going down. Made my first $1M after 2 drawdown periods (1999 and 2008); $150k invested over 12 years (I'd try to put in $1k/month most months, and a bit extra when I could) turned into $1M.\n\nThere's just so much more information and knowledge available now, and the folks of today don't seem to have a problem with holding through drawdowns. I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns. I've never seen such an iron conviction before. Folks of today are not afraid of drawdowns or volatility. Additionally, between all of our corporations, we're pumping in billions of new dollars every single week into the market now.\n\nTimes have changed, and you're kidding yourself if you haven't seen the change.",

        "body": "This portfolio is entirely tech.  I know you have a long timeline, but heavily investing in one sector is risky and you miss out on other opportunities.  Spread your risk into other industries, even if a little bit.  The market is also a good benchmark and is already distributed well, so maybe 10% in SPY or a similar ETF.\n\nDividend growth is a strategy that allows for tax-deferred growth in income.  You can read more about it [here](https://www.thebalance.com/making-money-with-the-dividend-growth-investing-strategy-357877), but I recommend looking at other places, since I just did a quick search for the basics.  The main point is that dividend stocks still grow, so don't discount those.  They also tend to be established, successful companies, so they tend to be good buys without considering dividend yield - see MSFT and AAPL, historically.  (You can read an overview to compare strategies [here](https://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/15-4-withdrawal-rule-vs-dividend-stocks)).\n\nFor the growth strategy, you would sell a bunch of stocks that have grown over 30 years, pay taxes and fees, then pay to reinvest in dividend stocks for a small yield.  The roth allows you to withdraw your cash pile from dividends tax-deferred.  You pay fees when selling a stock vs. receiving dividends, so it is worth considering.  What happens if one of thee stocks has a rough few years in 2030 and falls, so you sell it, in order to rebalance?  There is more to consider when you factor in taxes, so make sure to also look for articles/studies/advice with regards to taxes.\n\nThose are my first impressions and things worth looking into.  I'm sure other redditors will have comments as well to consider.\n\nNote: This is a rough writeup based on my first impression and the links are from internet searches when typing up this reply.  The math or the examples may be off.  Look into these more to get a better idea.",

Whether you have an iPhone or Samsung pos it\u2019s an iPhone. FaceTime has become a verb. Apple stock is severely, severely under priced right now. We saw the EXACT same thing happen after the 2014 split. It took a solid couple years and analysts bashing before it finally doubled and then ended up 500% higher and split 6 years later. This will happen again. I\u2019m a long holder of Apple and will buy every dip I see along the way. I also love the 150c for 2/19 and beyond. Fantastic deal right now.

I am not some veteran guy who has seen everything in the market. \n\nThis past year almost anything you could have bought should have sky rocketed.\n\nDon\u2019t start with options, ever. I\u2019d suggest starting with an index fund or very diversified ETF. These should gain 8-15% per year. This gives you exposure to a ton of different companies, and if the market takes a dive these will feel much less downward pressure. Disclaimer, history shows you should make money, but understand the risks.\n\nA few other things: DONT PANIC SELL. If the companies fundamentals align with why you invested them, take it as a buying opportunity. If you want to gamble, understand that is not investing. Have a long term outlook, AT LEAST a 1 year outlook (and 1 year is very short in terms of investing). \n\n\nIf you want to try individual stocks, try big, established companies first. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon - these are going no where and are probably some of the safest technology companies to own. \n\nHow to conduct research? Firstly, start to understand ratios, floats, revenues, earnings, growth, ROA, ROE, EBITDA - this will give you a solid groundwork on a companies current financial situation. These fundamental principles don\u2019t always apply simply to growth companies. \n\nHope I helped a little, good luck!",

Both are comparatively undervalued in this market.

Enjoyed the ride up in 1999, and saw much of that money erode come 2000. However, since I still had a job, I was able to continue to buy in 2000 when things were going down. Made my first $1M after 2 drawdown periods (1999 and 2008); $150k invested over 12 years (I'd try to put in $1k/month most months, and a bit extra when I could) turned into $1M.\n\nThere's just so much more information and knowledge available now, and the folks of today don't seem to have a problem with holding through drawdowns. I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns. I've never seen such an iron conviction before. Folks of today are not afraid of drawdowns or volatility. Additionally, between all of our corporations, we're pumping in billions of new dollars every single week into the market now.\n\nTimes have changed, and you're kidding yourself if you haven't seen the change.",

        "body": "This portfolio is entirely tech.  I know you have a long timeline, but heavily investing in one sector is risky and you miss out on other opportunities.  Spread your risk into other industries, even if a little bit.  The market is also a good benchmark and is already distributed well, so maybe 10% in SPY or a similar ETF.\n\nDividend growth is a strategy that allows for tax-deferred growth in income.  You can read more about it [here](https://www.thebalance.com/making-money-with-the-dividend-growth-investing-strategy-357877), but I recommend looking at other places, since I just did a quick search for the basics.  The main point is that dividend stocks still grow, so don't discount those.  They also tend to be established, successful companies, so they tend to be good buys without considering dividend yield - see MSFT and AAPL, historically.  (You can read an overview to compare strategies [here](https://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/15-4-withdrawal-rule-vs-dividend-stocks)).\n\nFor the growth strategy, you would sell a bunch of stocks that have grown over 30 years, pay taxes and fees, then pay to reinvest in dividend stocks for a small yield.  The roth allows you to withdraw your cash pile from dividends tax-deferred.  You pay fees when selling a stock vs. receiving dividends, so it is worth considering.  What happens if one of thee stocks has a rough few years in 2030 and falls, so you sell it, in order to rebalance?  There is more to consider when you factor in taxes, so make sure to also look for articles/studies/advice with regards to taxes.\n\nThose are my first impressions and things worth looking into.  I'm sure other redditors will have comments as well to consider.\n\nNote: This is a rough writeup based on my first impression and the links are from internet searches when typing up this reply.  The math or the examples may be off.  Look into these more to get a better idea.",

As the world returns to normal, people will realize wow, I\u2019m betting my life savings on a meme stock I\u2019ve never heard about til someone on wsb talked it up for their own benefit. As they do, they\u2019ll realize wow, Apple is the real deal. The problem is nobody is impressed anymore they\u2019re just used to it. Apple is everywhere and it really is everything. Whether you have an iPhone or Samsung pos it\u2019s an iPhone. FaceTime has become a verb. Apple stock is severely, severely under priced right now. We saw the EXACT same thing happen after the 2014 split. It took a solid couple years and analysts bashing before it finally doubled and then ended up 500% higher and split 6 years later. This will happen again. I\u2019m a long holder of Apple and will buy every dip I see along the way. I also love the 150c for 2/19 and beyond. Fantastic deal right now. So TL;Dr. buy Apple and keep buying all the way to the moon.",

I am not some veteran guy who has seen everything in the market. \n\nThis past year almost anything you could have bought should have sky rocketed.\n\nDon\u2019t start with options, ever. I\u2019d suggest starting with an index fund or very diversified ETF. These should gain 8-15% per year. This gives you exposure to a ton of different companies, and if the market takes a dive these will feel much less downward pressure. Disclaimer, history shows you should make money, but understand the risks.\n\nA few other things: DONT PANIC SELL. If the companies fundamentals align with why you invested them, take it as a buying opportunity. If you want to gamble, understand that is not investing. Have a long term outlook, AT LEAST a 1 year outlook (and 1 year is very short in terms of investing). \n\n\nIf you want to try individual stocks, try big, established companies first. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon - these are going no where and are probably some of the safest technology companies to own. \n\nHow to conduct research? Firstly, start to understand ratios, floats, revenues, earnings, growth, ROA, ROE, EBITDA - this will give you a solid groundwork on a companies current financial situation. These fundamental principles don\u2019t always apply simply to growth companies. \n\nHope I helped a little, good luck!",

So it is not illogical to see profitable technology companies doing great, I mean results are better than before this crisis so it is not incredibly shocking to me.\n\nTo conclude, we might be in a bubble but it surely is just an illusion.",

        "body": "This portfolio is entirely tech.  I know you have a long timeline, but heavily investing in one sector is risky and you miss out on other opportunities.  Spread your risk into other industries, even if a little bit.  The market is also a good benchmark and is already distributed well, so maybe 10% in SPY or a similar ETF.\n\nDividend growth is a strategy that allows for tax-deferred growth in income.  You can read more about it [here](https://www.thebalance.com/making-money-with-the-dividend-growth-investing-strategy-357877), but I recommend looking at other places, since I just did a quick search for the basics.  The main point is that dividend stocks still grow, so don't discount those.  They also tend to be established, successful companies, so they tend to be good buys without considering dividend yield - see MSFT and AAPL, historically.  (You can read an overview to compare strategies [here](https://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/15-4-withdrawal-rule-vs-dividend-stocks)).\n\nFor the growth strategy, you would sell a bunch of stocks that have grown over 30 years, pay taxes and fees, then pay to reinvest in dividend stocks for a small yield.  The roth allows you to withdraw your cash pile from dividends tax-deferred.  You pay fees when selling a stock vs. receiving dividends, so it is worth considering.  What happens if one of thee stocks has a rough few years in 2030 and falls, so you sell it, in order to rebalance?  There is more to consider when you factor in taxes, so make sure to also look for articles/studies/advice with regards to taxes.\n\nThose are my first impressions and things worth looking into.  I'm sure other redditors will have comments as well to consider.\n\nNote: This is a rough writeup based on my first impression and the links are from internet searches when typing up this reply.  The math or the examples may be off.  Look into these more to get a better idea.",

As the world returns to normal, people will realize wow, I\u2019m betting my life savings on a meme stock I\u2019ve never heard about til someone on wsb talked it up for their own benefit. As they do, they\u2019ll realize wow, Apple is the real deal. The problem is nobody is impressed anymore they\u2019re just used to it. Apple is everywhere and it really is everything. Whether you have an iPhone or Samsung pos it\u2019s an iPhone. FaceTime has become a verb. Apple stock is severely, severely under priced right now. We saw the EXACT same thing happen after the 2014 split. It took a solid couple years and analysts bashing before it finally doubled and then ended up 500% higher and split 6 years later. This will happen again. I\u2019m a long holder of Apple and will buy every dip I see along the way. I also love the 150c for 2/19 and beyond. Fantastic deal right now. So TL;Dr. buy Apple and keep buying all the way to the moon.",

I am not some veteran guy who has seen everything in the market. \n\nThis past year almost anything you could have bought should have sky rocketed.\n\nDon\u2019t start with options, ever. I\u2019d suggest starting with an index fund or very diversified ETF. These should gain 8-15% per year. This gives you exposure to a ton of different companies, and if the market takes a dive these will feel much less downward pressure. Disclaimer, history shows you should make money, but understand the risks.\n\nA few other things: DONT PANIC SELL. If the companies fundamentals align with why you invested them, take it as a buying opportunity. If you want to gamble, understand that is not investing. Have a long term outlook, AT LEAST a 1 year outlook (and 1 year is very short in terms of investing). \n\n\nIf you want to try individual stocks, try big, established companies first. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon - these are going no where and are probably some of the safest technology companies to own. \n\nHow to conduct research? Firstly, start to understand ratios, floats, revenues, earnings, growth, ROA, ROE, EBITDA - this will give you a solid groundwork on a companies current financial situation. These fundamental principles don\u2019t always apply simply to growth companies. \n\nHope I helped a little, good luck!",

Mainly bc of settlements, each weeks MM will sell their positions accordingly to what is left in their portfolio.\n\nBUT, it does not mean that tech stocks are not in a bubble right now, because of two things :\n\n- QE : pouring trillions of dollars in a market will inflate prices at some points \n\n- Low interests rates : the bond market is not attractive, and with QE cash is also not attractive, so you have to take some risks, investments will be poured into index funds and simple stocks that you understand and that have good metrics like Apple or Microsoft, I mean at this point you don\u2019t have any other choices\n\nBut on the other hand, this rally is not very surprising, many companies needed to digitalize, they had to use zoom, people needed to buy computers... So it is not illogical to see profitable technology companies doing great, I mean results are better than before this crisis so it is not incredibly shocking to me.\n\nTo conclude, we might be in a bubble but it surely is just an illusion.",

They do it willingly, Beijing asserts, to get access to China\u2019s vast and growing market. Still, Chinese officials say they are taking steps to address the concerns.\n\n...\n\nAmerican companies say Chinese companies also use more subtle tactics to get access to valuable technology.\n\nSometimes China requires foreign companies to form joint ventures with local firms in order to do business there, as in the case of the auto industry. It also sometimes requires that a certain percentage of a product\u2019s value be manufactured locally, as it once did with wind turbines and solar panels.\n\nThe technology companies Apple and Amazon set up ventures with local partners to handle data in China to comply with internal security laws.\n\nCompanies are loath to accuse Chinese partners of theft for fear of getting punished. Business groups that represent them say Chinese companies use those corporate ties to pressure foreign partners into giving up secrets. They also say Chinese officials have pressured foreign companies to give them access to sensitive technology as part of a review process to make sure those products are safe for Chinese consumers.\n\nForeign business groups point to renewable energy as one area where China used some of these tactics to build homegrown industries.\n\nGamesa of Spain was the wind turbine market leader in China when Beijing mandated in 2005 that 70 percent of each wind turbine installed in China had to be manufactured inside the country. The company trained more than 500 suppliers in China to manufacture practically every part in its turbines. It set up a plant to assemble them in the city of Tianjin. Other multinational wind turbine manufacturers did the same.\n\nThe Obama administration questioned the policy as a violation of World Trade Organization rules and China withdrew it, but by then it was too late. Chinese state-controlled enterprises had begun to assemble turbines using the same suppliers. China is now the world\u2019s biggest market for wind turbines, and they are mostly made by Chinese companies.\u201c\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty big perspective and a lot of history to ignore.",

As the world returns to normal, people will realize wow, I\u2019m betting my life savings on a meme stock I\u2019ve never heard about til someone on wsb talked it up for their own benefit. As they do, they\u2019ll realize wow, Apple is the real deal. The problem is nobody is impressed anymore they\u2019re just used to it. Apple is everywhere and it really is everything. Whether you have an iPhone or Samsung pos it\u2019s an iPhone. FaceTime has become a verb. Apple stock is severely, severely under priced right now. We saw the EXACT same thing happen after the 2014 split. It took a solid couple years and analysts bashing before it finally doubled and then ended up 500% higher and split 6 years later. This will happen again. I\u2019m a long holder of Apple and will buy every dip I see along the way. I also love the 150c for 2/19 and beyond. Fantastic deal right now. So TL;Dr. buy Apple and keep buying all the way to the moon.",

The gains were typically averaging around 20-30% per year, which clearly is great by any metric for any type of growth security. From Feb. 2016-&gt;Jan 2020 I made a 180% return. From Jan 2020-Today I made 174%.\n\n\nSo literally the gains I made in 12 months almost entirely outweighed the gains I made in 4 years. And while you can nitpick in that it has a fair amount of TSLA exposure, there's a ton of securities that happened with. Anyone here long AAPL? AMZN? MSFT?  \n\n\nI think in general, people should be weary of *anyone* trying to sell your *anything*.

(E.g. getting into Apple calls September, BBY calls November, Apple puts December literally days before they announce an Apple car that's as realistic as NKLA). Literally the only wins I had this year were in March, when I knew the market was going to tank, and NKLA puts, seeing that their tech made 0 sense.

At least in the US, legacy car makers are woefully behind and will be in a world of hurt this decade.  Elon has made Tesla open source patent wise, trying to encourage other companies to adopt electrification.  There will be other successful EV makers no doubt, but even a bear case has a large market share for Tesla going forward.  More importantly, they have first mover advantage.  Talking to my nieces and nephews, Tesla is all the rage in the same way Apple has been.  It's hip, its tech, its \"cool\".  Likewise talking with neighbors that are not car people, when I ask about what they know about EV's they know Tesla and that is about it.   Tesla continues to innovate and will be ahead for awhile.  All this fails to mention all the other important endeavors of energy storage, solar, etc.  I've locked in some gains as a long term holder, but also continue to buy shares as recently as this week going forward.  I challenge naysayers to at least read some of the White papers by Cathie Wood at Ark.",

        "body": "I think this question is an example of why MGA might be the best EV play.  MGA is like a manufacturing bridge for tech companies to reach into the market.  MGA is already partnering with Fisker and is rumored to be in talks with Apple.  There were 100\u2019s of car companies at the start of the 1900\u2019s.  Picking the winners was like throwing darts at board.  There will be hundreds of players flocking to the EV game in the coming years.  MGA provides you with a lot of darts to throw at the board in hopes of hitting a winner.  \n\nAt the same time MGA is a stable profitable company that already dominates the parts industry (including parts for Tesla).  MGA is also not trading at an insane premium.",
