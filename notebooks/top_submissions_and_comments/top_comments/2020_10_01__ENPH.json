        "body": "I can't speak to NET, but my general advice is that if you're holding long term, adding the stock at a premium will be cheap compared to waiting on the sidelines hoping it will drop in price. As for REGI, I invested a couple years ago and since then they have shot up during the lockdowns. I think it's fairly valued finally, but if you want to buy in I wouldn't discourage you. They have so many positive catalysts going for them right now. With higher RIN prices, rejections of oil refinery exemptions from the renewable fuel standard, price target increases, Blender's Tax credits through 2022 and a future renewable diesel plant TBA, I'm still very bullish on this stock long term. Not to mention they could beat earnings in Q3. As for ENPH, I've been doing research on the company and its fundamentals before I invest in them. From what I've learned, the company seems to be rising due to recent analyst upgrades along with positive sentiment for renewables in general. I'd say that long term, clean energy is a great investment and you won't regret buying in even at it's high valuation. My advice, I'd look more towards a mix of clean energy stocks in ICLN or TAN, which will give you exposure to solar stocks broadly.",

Just like a social media app, the best thing to do is remove them from your phone, if you really want to change the habit, making the information more difficult to access will help. The only reason you should be checking it that often is if you\u2019re trading options or large quantities of shares where small fluctuations can cause drastic changes in profit or loss. \n\nTry to find you a good renewable energy company you like (that\u2019s still cheap) and buy a bunch and then let it sit. Try not to focus on making $50 bucks here or there by timing the market. Instead, focus on making long term gains. I bought 65 shares on ENPH for $31 awhile back and since then I\u2019ve been able to just check once a day or every other day. Once you land your first company that does really well and keeps growing, I think you\u2019ll be less inclined to keep checking back as frequently. Best of luck and happy trading though.",
