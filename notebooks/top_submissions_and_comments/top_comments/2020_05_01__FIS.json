Doesn't seem to be dollar average strategy.\n\nIs it Etrade limitation? Any other platform (Schwab, fidelity) will give me that option?Is it VOO (any etf, any stock at all??) limitation? (i doubt since every second article in web mentions VOO example for dollar cost averaging)\n\nI've tried google some stuff, and i found some article mentioning some limitations of etrade (if i remember correctly).\n\nIt would be awesome if someone can guide me to some 101 noobs article about buying whole/parts of stocks/etf opportunities.\n\nThanks for reading long post, it's not 9gag, thus no veggies ;)",

I actually had some extra income due to this situation as I work for some wealthy individuals and they asked for some extra help right when the issue hit, but I have to pay off a credit card with 0% interest until November. So I have 10k in assets right now, and 10k that needs to be paid off in November. I am 35 with a family, and we expect to be able to save $1400 per month moving forward as well which includes paying my car payment at 3%, but I live rent free (so I will be able to have another $8.4k to pay off the card). I also have retirement already and put enough in there, so I am not too worried about that. I placed a bit of money in Tesla for 1 week (a friend of mine got in really low talks about it all the time) and I removed it after making some money, just at the right time. I realize I was lucky and want to make the right decisions moving forward. Being as I can make enough to pay off most of my debt, I feel I could be a bit risky. I was contemplating placing about 1k or 2k into the market as I could still double down another 2k if the market goes way down, and then again if it goes down further. Is this the right strategy? 10-20% now knowing I could make that money back by investing more if it crashes? What else should I know? Should I do a Roth IRA now for 2k, or wait until my finances settle....\n\nLastly, I have been using Fidelity as they are already my bank. I like their website, hate their app. I am not locked in to using their services. I tried using Uplift on my phone just to track stocks... hated it. I have heard good things about Sigfig, but did not realize it was not more than a stock tracker and they wanted all my info. Any suggestions on the best app to possibly invest, but at least track stocks would be amazing. I want to do my research. I want to be able to see ratings, graphs,",
