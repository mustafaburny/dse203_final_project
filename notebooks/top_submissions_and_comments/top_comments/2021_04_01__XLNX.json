        "body": "AMD is down today and here's why:\n\nTake a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means hedge funds need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit or else they'll have to cover. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases. Analysts are already saying to buy, and buy aggressively at this price.\n\nI know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  \n\"This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.\"\n\nOne could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% QoQ which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers \"digesting\" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales QoQ saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.\n\nOne could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.\n\nOne could speculate that the \"chip shortage\" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.\n\nAll of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.\n\nWith AMD, there's no need for WSB or individual investors to try to turn it around on the short selling hedge funds, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, diamond hands, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.\n\nAMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022. My price target is $120 which is more conservative than even some analysts.",

        "body": "Over/under-valued is supposed to be fundamental. You should keep that separate from your opinion on it.\n\nYou should be psychologically and emotionally able to say, \"I recognize that the stock is currently over-valued, but I think it has a better future than the professionals realize, so I still like it at this price.\"\n\nWhen you're completely honest about your evaluation, you end up with better information about what your opinion actually is. In this case, do you actually have better information about Apple's future than everybody else? Is there some popular idea about Apple that pulls the stock price down, that you think is incorrect? Are they planning to move into some new area of business that you understand, and most people don't realize is important?\n\nFor example, AMD. My day job is firmware engineer. AMD put out a press release earlier this year about two new patents. All the analysis I read, both in the stock market, and on the engineering websites, presumed these are two different, unrelated things, that they just coincidentally talked about on the same day. I disagree; I think they're part of one new future product, that is also related to their Xilinx acquisition, and will bring real advantages to their server products. Right now their server market share is only 10%; the forecasts are that they will increase this to 20% in about 18 months. If they come out with a new product that enhances their competitive position in this area right when they're also already expanding their market share, that could be a huge driver for them and for the stock. So I think the stock is really worth at least 15% more than it can be objectively valued at now. But that doesn't mean it is undervalued now; just that I have a higher price target!\n\nAnother example is if a hedge fund releases research report that bad-mouths a company, and the stock goes down, and you read the report (most people don't even read it, they just sell!) and you think the report doesn't actually accuse them of anything. So then you might reasonably have a different evaluation than others.\n\nAs with all other parts of trading and investing, psychology is the most critical aspect of success. Don't be credulous of your own opinions; and treat your emotions with skepticism. When you love a stock, be nervous about your evaluation. You want to trade on what you rationally think will go up, not what you love.\ud83d\udc7c",

They won't have 7 nm CPUs for two more years, and they will have to get the support chips made by TSMC.\n\nI.e., they are limping and could be dead money for a while.\n\nAs for its competition, I still don't get what Lisa Su is doing buying Xilinx. The FPGA and modern core technologies will not merge easily. She's paying 7X what Hector paid for ATI, and that should have been a slam-dunk integration (but, being Hector, he utterly bungled it and it took 5X as long as it should have and the results were an abomination that cost the company its fabs, and he vanished with them). Meanwhile Ryzen is aging and they don't have design talent that can replace it the way Jim Keller dropped it on them to replace the old garbage. Radeon crypto sales are their real cash cow. So AMD is a question mark that just diluted shares due to vast goodwill in the XLNX takeover.\n\nNVDA, however, has a rolling business in video, crypto, and AI, and has ideas in the pipe that will expand it significantly. The decision to target servers is all win. The ARM buyout will be a huge up if it goes through, and a small down if it doesn't (since the risk is currently baked in).",

TSMC's clear process lead may shrink significantly by 2024 if they're not the first to figure out GAAFETs and the feds are looking to pump billions into domestic semi manufacturing, which I agree with, but which hurts AMD's PR vs Intel. Finally I think that ARM and hyperscalers building their own SoCs or ASICs becomes more of a risk over time.\n\nBetween those things, the fact that I already have very large gains in AMD along with a high % of my portfolio in them, and the fact they pay no dividend I'm looking to reduce my holdings by 75-100% by 2024.

Extremely undervalued considering they bought xilinx($120 stock) to compete in the data center space. All of the new gaming consoles have AMD chips in them which is a testament to their performance.  \n\nBABA- The AMZN of China, China\u2019s middle class will continue to grow and grow in the coming years. China won\u2019t mess with their giant in any real significant way, the commies still love money. \n\nLYFT- Short term I can see people hesitate over their business model relying on gig workers or whatever, but for me this would be a 5 year play on increasing demand for micro-mobility(any trip from 1-3 miles or under). Living in any city you realize that parking is just going to keep becoming more and more of a nightmare. People want to use their cars less, and nightlife/traveling will return. Lyft has some partnerships I am excited about: Google\u2019s Waymo self driving project, and they bought Motivate which does E-Bikes. The lyft bikes have an infrastructure(charging stations) monopoly in my city and they\u2019re exploding in popularity. This is probably my most pure speculation play while still having the safety net of being a well known brand. \n\nTGT- I haven\u2019t bought any stocks in the purely retail space yet but maybe next week. I just love Target. Great company, I have had nothing but fantastic experiences buying everything here throughout the pandemic. They are affordable without just selling cheap garbage.

That said, AMD is so low in market share that i think oversupply shouldn't affect them too much.\n\nAll that said, if the impossible happens and it truly was due to AMD, i expect this stock to be at 100 by next week\n\nBTW, i would absolutely love to see your further analysis on them. What do you think about the risks of RISC V to x86? how do you see xilinx integration allowing AMD take on NVDA in the ML/AI space? xilinx is big in automotive, any inroads for AMD integration there?\n\nAnyway, thanks for the writeup",
