However, wouldn\u2019t that also mean that extreme valuations aren\u2019t really that high because the dollar is quickly becoming worth less and less? \n\nI mean, if Apple is worth $2T and that seems high to you, could it not just be that it now takes $2T to be worth c.$1.5T pre-pandemic? From overseas is kinda seems like it\u2019s priced in. \n\nI suppose the counter argument could be that a LOT of the stimulus went into the market and is tied up.

It's not an algorithm that chooses the stocks, it's a group of humans.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500, by its nature, will \"buy high\" and \"sell low\" because a company already needs to be successful to be added to the index and they remove unsuccessful companies.\n\nThere was a study a while ago that found that if you invested in the original list of companies in the S&amp;P 500 and didn't follow the index,  you'd outperform the index by a wide margin. That's because the index has a history of removing companies while they're down and later adding them back when they recover. If you simply held on to the companies, you'd have done better. And that even accounts for the fact that many of the original companies no longer exist.\n\nThe index was meant to track the state of the market, not provide the best returns.

The reason isn't important but the behaviour of the correction is far more important.\n\n I personally do not think the correction will be more than 20-25% so you can pretty forget about a big sized one because markets will never give you another such big opportunity to buy stocks at cheap prices because markets are not stupid. You will get cheaper prices, but not the prices you may still be satisfied with\n\n. Yes anything can happen in markets but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say its almost literally impossible for correction to be 40-50% range unless some country starts a war with usa or something or some huge volcano erupts and kills half of united states or some crazy shit like that.",
