On semiconductor ( not a spac) is doing fairly well as a competitor. I'm notan engineer but a previous comment on another thread spoke on how it separates itself through their communication systems.

Prior to founding indie, Donald McClymont held executive roles at Axiom, Skyworks and Conexant. \" Axiom was a top semiconductor company bought by skyworks.

I have not invested much since as I am trying to build my savings again however I aim to start investing $400 - $500 per month into my brokerage account starting 2021. Now my issue is how do I allocate that money into my stocks and funds? I have high priced stocks like Tesla(641) and Twilio(309). While also having lower priced stocks like Cloudflare(81) and Pagerduty(40). Now which stocks and ETFs deserve deposits of new money? The ones that are winning or the ones that are losing? Or should I plan to reinvest into 1 to 2 companies per month? So that by the time a year completes every stock/etf has had their fair share of deposits.\n\nIf any additional information is needed, please let me know! Thanks again",
