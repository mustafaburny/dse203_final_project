Since the first athlon x64, they kept releasing bad products most of the time. In just 3 years, she made AMD go from Zero to Hero!\n\nAMD now trading at tremendous numbers, no one thought would be possible ever. Heck just look 7 years back, the share price was about 2 bucks.\n\nIf there is any CEO who you feel should earn so much, it\u2019s not people from Moderna, but Lisa Su.\n\nJust to give you an idea, back in 2014 or so, I remember trying to buy AMD shares under 2 euros each (I wanted to get 2000 euro), before the order went through, it asked me for some paperwork confirmation, I then did not go through with the order and never did.\n\nMissed on 1000 shares from AMD. I did not believe back then, although I saw it was incredibly cheap.",

        "body": "Well this is /r/investing, so buy quality and hold, diversify (beyond just bonds which may or may not have a good future in a zero rate world), and have worldwide exposure/don't arbitrarily lock yourself to your own country.\n\nI actively trade, but in all likelihood in 2040 the investors at the top will likely have stories like \"As Waymo got bigger, my ETF kept buying more, and now Waymo is 10 trillion dollars. And as that Chinese electric car company grew and took 1/3 of the 1 billion person Chinese market, my ETF kept buying more on the way up.\"\n\nAlthough in that same vein, getting ahead of the tech curve might be one of the few ways for someone outside of the professional investor/institutional world to realistically get ahead. The trick is having the fortitude to hold for 1-2 decades. The financial crisis in '08 blew me out of so many hilariously good positions, like SBAC because the iPhone was just invented and 3G means more cell phone towers... It's not always rocket science. Anyone with some specialized insight into the future, whatever it may be, should consider putting a small well thought out speculative position on and leave it be. Small enough to not hurt if it goes nowhere, but big enough to care enough to check up and manage every few months.\n\nWow, just looked up an email from over 10 years ago. These names are probably in the mainstream investing language now, but wow... 10-100x if they were held. And it wasn't complex quant investing or anything, just looking ahead, positioning, and waiting.\n\nQuotes from the email circa 10 years ago: \"NVDA... They are also making a leap into scientific computing, where there's a lot of money to be made. They're the first major player to enter that arena to fight Intel and AMD in a long time, and their architecture is much more suited to scientific computing than the traditional CPUs that currently rule the top 100 supercomputer list. I think I'll see how that works out before selling NVDA\"\n\n\"I might want to put some money in AMD as well. They're here to stay and may still be undervalued...\"\n\n\"Universal Display Corp and LG Display (PANL/LPL) are also the leaders and partners in OLED screen development, which is bound to catch on eventually. Lower power use and much better image quality mean that it's just a matter of time before more devices adopt this new display technology and it becomes a new standard. I actually expect Apple to eventually partner up with LG (I think LG is their main LCD supplier) and use and use an OLED display on either a new product or a new Iphone version, which will kick OLED production into overdrive.\"\n\nFood for thought... MicroLED is likely going to grow 1000x over the coming decades. AR and LIDAR sensors for AR will probably not just be used for face unlock and will get some killer apps, the next Snapchat or TikTok might be AR based. Self-Driving is going to be powered by thousands of companies, not just NVIDIA and Waymo. Quantum computing? AI providers in the military contracting space? Clean cargo ship tech to get in front of green regulations? It's endless, and so many people know about these little niches of information that very few others do. Even mundane spaces see world changing innovation every day. Getting in front of a curve is inherently speculative but it is also entertaining, educational to follow through development, and can be extremely profitable.\n\nThat's my appeal for pulling a few pennies out of the ETF pile and doing some a little different, especially if you have a \"wheelhouse\" that you know a little bit more about.",

So if people can't find much besides a \"short the shit out of this company\" report, it might be more important for management to attempt to keep the stock afloat, whether it's in their own self interest or not.\n\nIf you try to short Intel it's a bit of a different story considering there are 40 analysts covering it and an ungodly amount of brand recognition. If one analyst comes out with a short and 39 say Intel is fine, it's unlikely the short piece actually does anything. But if you have three analysts covering you, which is very common for small-cap companies, one short piece can actually fuck your shit up. \n\nAlso since companies often use their equity as collateral for a loan, the higher stock price could afford more reasonable loan terms, which could help the company's actual business.",

        "body": "Options are contracts.  They are not stocks, they are a contract stating that the holder has the right (the choice, or the *option*) to purchase/sell 100 shares of a specific stock at a specific price on a specific date.  Calls are for purchasing 100 shares on a later date, puts are for selling 100 shares on a later date.\n\nLet's say a stock, we'll call them AAAA for simplicity, is at $100 today.  If you were to buy 10 shares of this company, that would cost you $1000.  You would own 10 shares of that company for $1000 though.  If you instead buy options, you would likely be able to get a couple options instead for the same price.  Let's say that a $100 call on AAAA for next friday costs $5 per share, or $500 per contract.  For that same $1000, you could have 2 calls on AAAA.\n\nIn both scenarios, you're looking for the value of the stock to go up obviously.  If you have 10 shares and AAAA goes up one dollar, you gained 10 dollars.  If you have 2 calls (which is 200 shares worth of an option) and AAAA goes up by a dollar, those calls increase in value as well, although not quite as much, we'll say it increases by $0.50 per share.  That's still a lot.  Instead of making $10 from your $1000 investment, you made $100 instead.  It's not quite that simple though.\n\nCalls (and puts) have an expiration date.  If the call is expiring on the 12th (next Friday), then the value of the stock needs to be decently close or above the value stated in the contract, or the \"strike price\".  In our $100 AAAA calls, if the stock goes below $100 (especially on the Thursday), the value of the call will plummet.  And remember, since these are just contracts, you don't actually own anything with the money you spent.\n\nSince you also spent $5 per share in order to get the call, the value of AAAA needs to not only be above $100 on the 12th to be redeemed (nobody should ever execute a right to buy at a higher than market price, obviously, you'd just be throwing away money for no reason) but it needs to be above $105 in order to make a profit.  You had already paid $5 per share for the right to buy those shares later at $100 per share.\n\nNext, and here's what many people do in order to make their profit instead, *you do not have to hold your contracts.*  If you buy a call on Monday, you don't have to wait until it expires on Friday to make money.  If AAAA jumps to $120 on Tuesday, you could sell your 2 calls for likely $23-$24 per share.  That would turn a $1000 investment into $4600.  What a hell of a gain, right?  If you just had 10 shares, you'd have only made $200 on a 20% stock jump when people who are options trading just made a $3600 or a 460% return.\n\nLastly, the reason that so many people avoid them.  *Options can expire* ***worthless***.  If the stock drops to $95 on Tuesday, those calls are suddenly only $2 per share, you just lost $600.  If it drops again to $90 on Wednesday, those calls are suddenly less than $1 per share, you're at an $800+ loss.  If you had 10 shares, you'd have only lost $100.  On Friday if you still have those calls, if AAAA never hits $100, your calls will expire and you'll have lost the full $1000 investment with absolutely nothing to show for it.  That money is gone for good, no amount of wishful thinking is going to make it come back to you.\n\nPuts are the opposite of calls in a way, they're the right to sell 100 shares at a certain price.  You get a put when you believe the value of the stock is going to drop.  Let's say you have a $100 put on AAAA and the stock drops to $80 on Friday.  On Friday, you would purchase 100 shares of AAAA at market value ($80, or $8000 worth) and then immediately sell it to whoever wrote the contract for $100 per share, or $10000.  That's quite a profit right there too, you made money when a stock decreased in value.  You can't really do that with standard stock trading.  Puts do still come with the same risk as calls in the fact that they too can expire worthless if the value of the stock is above the strike price.  If you have a $100 put on AAAA and the value on Friday is $105, it would be absolutely stupid to purchase 100 shares at $105 to sell them immediately for $100.  Remember, these contracts give you the *option* to buy/sell at a certain price, it doesn't mean that you have to when they expire.\n\nI hope that helps!  If you've got more questions, I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.",

This can be FOMO in anticipation or FOMO in reflection. In both cases, you feel a negative emotional reaction to missing or potentially missing a big move.\n\nAs you know, negative emotions are very bad as a trader and can limit your Trading Vision - preventing you from seeing a much clearer move that fits within your own defined strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"missing out\" in the stock market. There are infinite opportunities presented to you every single second. So focus on that. Focus on the stream of infinite opportunities and how you can interpret and decipher this data stream to pluck out trades within your own strategy boundaries.\n\nStick to your rules, manage your emotions, and focus on what is right in front of you.\n\n**I'd love to hear some thoughts from other traders who very recently learned this lesson.

Anyone can stream nearly anything for free or very cheap subscriptions. 30 years ago you had to spend 10-20 dollars to buy one album, nowadays that seems like an absurdity to the average consumer. Ease of access means there is now a panoply of genres and bands. Artists have bypassed large studios and large labels because technology now allows them to record at home with a little investment in equipment, self-publish and promote their work through sites like bandcamp, soundcloud and social media in general. Labels used to be the great gatekeepers and help fund recording sessions; that's not how the industry works anymore.

        "body": "A company splits its stock to increase liquidity.\n\nConsider Berkshire Hathaway, with a share price north of $250K. If a shareholder needs to liquidate enough stock to raise $100K, they can't do it without selling more than twice that value of BRK-A. So maybe they'll pick something else to sell instead that's more right-sized for the amount of money they need. Now consider an individual investor with \"only\" $100K to invest. That person can't buy even one share of BRK-A. In both cases, the high share price discouraged investors from trading the stock -- it inhibits liquidity. If BRK-A did a 3-for-1 stock split then those two investors could work out a trade with each other.\n\nThere are three reasons companies don't split stock:\n\n1. They feel it's prestigious to have a high per-share stock price.\n2. They prefer having lower liquidity because it causes the population of investors holding your shares to trend toward being wealthier and trading less frequently. That can provide greater stability for the stock price in normal times.\n3. Splitting the stock isn't free. It requires you to pay lawyers, publish notifications to shareholders, and so on. Companies prefer not to incur expenses without a clear payoff.\n\nEDIT: I guess I'll also explain why a company might like a more liquid stock. A more liquid stock will track more closely to its true market value. A low-liquidity stock can drop in price very sharply if it's hard for buyers to purchase it. Go back to that investor who needed to raise $100K. Now suppose that guy **ONLY** has BRK-A and he **HAS** to sell it. Because of the high share price, there's a smaller pool of investors who have the money to buy it from him. Desperate seller + small buyer pool means that seller can get screwed. Maybe in desperation he'll sell for $200K instead of the $250K+ the stock is worth... well then the market sees **ALL** of those shares as worth only $200K and the share price plummets. Now of course the price isn't really determined by what one guy does, but in a crisis a lot of sellers can find themselves in the same boat and it can happen.\n\nThis kind of liquidity problem is why the US Fed recently started buying up bond ETFs -- desperate sellers + small buyer pool would have put the price of those bonds through the floor *even though the bonds are actually still valuable* had the Fed not stepped in. Because the Fed has the money to buy anything, it can buy those bonds at a normal market price from anyone and let the price decline in a less terrifying way for everyone involved. When analysts talk about the Fed \"providing liquidity,\" this is what they mean.",

        "body": "A company splits its stock to increase liquidity.\n\nConsider Berkshire Hathaway, with a share price north of $250K. If a shareholder needs to liquidate enough stock to raise $100K, they can't do it without selling more than twice that value of BRK-A. So maybe they'll pick something else to sell instead that's more right-sized for the amount of money they need. Now consider an individual investor with \"only\" $100K to invest. That person can't buy even one share of BRK-A. In both cases, the high share price discouraged investors from trading the stock -- it inhibits liquidity. If BRK-A did a 3-for-1 stock split then those two investors could work out a trade with each other.\n\nThere are three reasons companies don't split stock:\n\n1. They feel it's prestigious to have a high per-share stock price.\n2. They prefer having lower liquidity because it causes the population of investors holding your shares to trend toward being wealthier and trading less frequently. That can provide greater stability for the stock price in normal times.\n3. Splitting the stock isn't free. It requires you to pay lawyers, publish notifications to shareholders, and so on. Companies prefer not to incur expenses without a clear payoff.\n\nEDIT: I guess I'll also explain why a company might like a more liquid stock. A more liquid stock will track more closely to its true market value. A low-liquidity stock can drop in price very sharply if it's hard for buyers to purchase it. Go back to that investor who needed to raise $100K. Now suppose that guy **ONLY** has BRK-A and he **HAS** to sell it. Because of the high share price, there's a smaller pool of investors who have the money to buy it from him. Desperate seller + small buyer pool means that seller can get screwed. Maybe in desperation he'll sell for $200K instead of the $250K+ the stock is worth... well then the market sees **ALL** of those shares as worth only $200K and the share price plummets. Now of course the price isn't really determined by what one guy does, but in a crisis a lot of sellers can find themselves in the same boat and it can happen.\n\nThis kind of liquidity problem is why the US Fed recently started buying up bond ETFs -- desperate sellers + small buyer pool would have put the price of those bonds through the floor *even though the bonds are actually still valuable* had the Fed not stepped in. Because the Fed has the money to buy anything, it can buy those bonds at a normal market price from anyone and let the price decline in a less terrifying way for everyone involved. When analysts talk about the Fed \"providing liquidity,\" this is what they mean.",

        "body": "&gt; When I hear \"iS BitCoiN AbLe tO BuY My CoFFee?\" I instantly know they dont understand bitcoin, the block size the mining time or the fee's.\n\nI hold a small amount of my investments in bitcoin (2.5%).  I completely 100% disagree with this statement of yours.  You see I purchased my bitcoin right after the big crash once I learned about the lightning network.  The lightning network made me say \"yes, this technology has promise.\"\n\n\"Is bitcoin able to buy my coffee\" is EXACTLY the correct question to ask.  Second layer drops fees and wait time down to nearly free and instantaneous.  Businesses setting themselves up to accept bitcoin via secondary layers is trivial vs getting credit card and other payment systems setup (all you need is a phone an internet connection and some know how. It can be done in less than 25minutes).\n\nThe ONLY thing holding bitcoin back is the volatility (that said, volatility is spurred by risk w.r.t. legal systems and wide market adoption).  If we knew that bitcoin was a stable and assured store of value, actually exchanging goods and services for it is extraordinarily simple.  And thus, why the hell not exchange coffee for bitcoin?\n\nIf a coffee shop can be assured that they can buy their beans for a set amount of bitcoin, and this set amount will remain the same tomorrow, next week, and next month; then they can sell their coffee products for a stable set amount of btc.\n\nOnce bitcoin has a stable set value, then there is no reason NOT to exchange coffee for bitcoin, and thus \"Can I buy my coffee with bitcoin?\" is precisely the question to ask.  Bitcoin is speculative until it's a stable store of value, and once it's a stable store of value you'll be able to buy coffee with it.\n\n&gt; I need to transfer 300,000 dollars worth of bitcoin\n\nBut you can't transfer $300k worth of bitcoin.  You can transfer what you THINK is $300k today, but you cannot be assured that tomorrow it will be $300k, nor can the person on the receiving end \"withdraw\" that $300k quickly.  EG If you sent me 30BTC right now, I couldn't immediately exchange it for my local currency, it would probably take me a few years and be quite the hassle.  Thus you THOUGHT you sent me $300k, but you actually sent me $100k, or maybe $750k.  However, once I can exchange bitcoin for a coffee, then I have no reason to transfer it into my local currency, I'll just spend it as it is.\n\nYou see, it's a tautology.  Once bitcoin has value, I can spend it, but I can't spend it until it has value.  Thus \"Can I buy my coffee with bitcoin\" is precisely the correct question to ask.",

Will catch up. \n\n2. It's June now. Need to see how volumes will form.\n\n3. Current events is so odd. We been complaining how everyone should be coming out of their homes. And now many people are coming out but government implementing a curfew. Overall these are small events in terms of economy, still need people going to work, spending money, building things, etc. \n\n4. Rant about the social divide. The numbers I'm seeing on the fundamental side are terrible over 40 mill unemployed. I don't think the rate in which people go back to work will effect stock prices. But society is  hurting. My guessimation is 40 / 170 mill working people under employed so daddy not bringing home the bacon means the poorer segment of the population hurting. Kids are going hungry. \n\nThe rich on the other hand have an opportunity to buy into the rebound and the top 10-15% of the population will get solid returns 10%-20%+ on their piles of money. The more the government prints the money goes into stock markets. They need to print a lot more to feed the other 30-40% that are going hungry and it'll go into paying rent keeping housing prices maybe only 10% down across the board. \n\nNew companies will emerge. And old companies like Disney will redo their business and I don't know what they going to do with Disney Land charge $200 a person due to less people no idea. Redo the park for half the visitors and sell a weeklong pass (basically for rich people) for $500 for a week.\n\nAnyway I digress this is a technical analysis forum. \nBut there's alot of pain out there.",

Anyone can stream nearly anything for free or very cheap subscriptions. 30 years ago you had to spend 10-20 dollars to buy one album, nowadays that seems like an absurdity to the average consumer. Ease of access means there is now a panoply of genres and bands. Artists have bypassed large studios and large labels because technology now allows them to record at home with a little investment in equipment, self-publish and promote their work through sites like bandcamp, soundcloud and social media in general. Labels used to be the great gatekeepers and help fund recording sessions; that's not how the industry works anymore. I love music, but I don't think the future of the industry will be as profitable as it used to be, by a long shot.",

        "body": "A company splits its stock to increase liquidity.\n\nConsider Berkshire Hathaway, with a share price north of $250K. If a shareholder needs to liquidate enough stock to raise $100K, they can't do it without selling more than twice that value of BRK-A. So maybe they'll pick something else to sell instead that's more right-sized for the amount of money they need. Now consider an individual investor with \"only\" $100K to invest. That person can't buy even one share of BRK-A. In both cases, the high share price discouraged investors from trading the stock -- it inhibits liquidity. If BRK-A did a 3-for-1 stock split then those two investors could work out a trade with each other.\n\nThere are three reasons companies don't split stock:\n\n1. They feel it's prestigious to have a high per-share stock price.\n2. They prefer having lower liquidity because it causes the population of investors holding your shares to trend toward being wealthier and trading less frequently. That can provide greater stability for the stock price in normal times.\n3. Splitting the stock isn't free. It requires you to pay lawyers, publish notifications to shareholders, and so on. Companies prefer not to incur expenses without a clear payoff.\n\nEDIT: I guess I'll also explain why a company might like a more liquid stock. A more liquid stock will track more closely to its true market value. A low-liquidity stock can drop in price very sharply if it's hard for buyers to purchase it. Go back to that investor who needed to raise $100K. Now suppose that guy **ONLY** has BRK-A and he **HAS** to sell it. Because of the high share price, there's a smaller pool of investors who have the money to buy it from him. Desperate seller + small buyer pool means that seller can get screwed. Maybe in desperation he'll sell for $200K instead of the $250K+ the stock is worth... well then the market sees **ALL** of those shares as worth only $200K and the share price plummets. Now of course the price isn't really determined by what one guy does, but in a crisis a lot of sellers can find themselves in the same boat and it can happen.\n\nThis kind of liquidity problem is why the US Fed recently started buying up bond ETFs -- desperate sellers + small buyer pool would have put the price of those bonds through the floor *even though the bonds are actually still valuable* had the Fed not stepped in. Because the Fed has the money to buy anything, it can buy those bonds at a normal market price from anyone and let the price decline in a less terrifying way for everyone involved. When analysts talk about the Fed \"providing liquidity,\" this is what they mean.",

I\u2019ve started with an initial \u00a31,000 but I\u2019m unsure of how to split it at the moment. I see most people on this sub seem to advise beginners to look into ETF\u2019s as a start. I looked into the Vanguard FTSE 250 however I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a good move in the current market or not. Also it\u2019s probably good to mention I\u2019ve already invested in a few tech companies such as RTX, NVDA (again not sure if that was smart) I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get loads of stick from more experienced traders but i guess I gotta start somewhere :).\n\nAny advice would be incredible",

It\u2019s usually a dud.\n\nThis is typically their best quarter as it\u2019s their year end so their sales team really pushes hard to close deals, but given the fact every company out there halted spending, I doubt it\u2019ll be good.\n\nI work very closely with a lot of Orcl folks as well and they\u2019ve told me they\u2019ve cut costs heavily and aren\u2019t allowing OT for their tech folks, which to me is a sign of slowing sales.",
