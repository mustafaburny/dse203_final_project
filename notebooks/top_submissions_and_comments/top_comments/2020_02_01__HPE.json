        "body": "The first thing is to not compare yourself and your situation to others.  \"Comparison is the thief of joy\" as the saying goes....\n\nNext, adopt a minimalism lifestyle (watch the netflix show on Minimalism).  Sell the shit that is cluttering up your life.  Anytime you think about buying some new shiny thing, ask yourself these two questions:  1. How have I gotten along without this in the past?  2. Why do I need it now?\n\nPut a sign on your bedroom wall that says \"Look around... All of this stuff used to be Money\"  You won't buy half the stuff you currently think you need.  \n\nNow that you have your money going into your pocket instead of toward some meaningless stuff, learn how to read and interpret a balance sheet and income statement.  Next, fund an account with whatever you can afford.  Start small and buy shares in companies that you understand.  What is their business model?  How do they make money?  For example, Hewlett Packard will give away the printer to sell you the ink.  Gillette (before being bought out) gave away the razor to sell you the blades.  Apple used to be a gadget maker and they banked on the product replacement cycle (you gotta buy the new model because it does so much extra for you and is better)....  PKG sells packaging...  Timken sells bearings...  Do you know anything about those businesses?  If not, then don't buy it.  Buy the companies that you know and understand how they work and how they make money.  If they pay a dividend, great.  At least you get paid to wait.  \n\nThe alternative is to YOLO your paycheck into binary option plays that might not payoff.  Think about this....  A stock will move one of three ways - up, down, or sideways.  If you buy a call option, the only way you can win is if the stock moves up.  You can lose if the stock moves down or sideways.  So you lose in 2 out of 3 scenarios, win in only 1 of the 3 scenarios.   You don't have to be an expert in Black-Scholes option pricing methodologies or even understand all the Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, theta, etc).  \n\nGood luck.  We've all been where you are, and it's hard to see these other people have so much success when you're hardly making ends meet.  You'll get there....  But it takes time.",

It\u2019s likely just that on paper, now it\u2019s going to be the main instant communication platform considering they sold off their in-house IM service a few years ago which I\u2019m told isn\u2019t very good. So anyone still relying on the old system will be forced to use slack too. It\u2019s basically just wider roll out to an existing customer that\u2019s already widely rolled out.\n\n&gt; In the filing, Slack said \"IBM has been Slack's largest customer for several years and has expanded its usage of Slack over that time.\" The company added it would not update its financial guidance for the fourth quarter or its fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\n&gt; Business Insider reported than an IBM executive said more than 300,000 of its employees already had access to Slack and the company was working to onboard the last 50,000.

Dynamics AX, Dynamics NAV, Dynamics 365 are now cloud offerings.\n\nMeaning if you are on Dynamics NAV ,  there is not a lot of work being done to the NAV product, its all being done on \"Business central\" what is just NAV running Azure. If you want to \"upgrade\" you have to go to business central .\n\nSame with AX and \"finance and operations\" their branding is retarded but my point is there are a ton of customers who use these products and will be moving to the cloud versions, once they already use azure for that they will just keep using it for there other cloud needs.",

JIT for every company is different based on what commodity they are producing.  Automotive parts distribution centers for example consider 3 months supply JIT.  Apparel retail  has already started moving to South American suppliers as an alternative to China, so even if they run a tighter JIT, they have already been forced to find new suppliers in order to get goods quicker and more consistently.  People will work around it,  companies that don\u2019t will be Fucked. But I promise most supply chains are already diversified way more than r/all seem to think.",

Here are my big lessons on the market. \n\n1) Earnings are wayyyy too risky to hold through. Do not hold through earnings. Buy 1-2 weeks out when IV is still low, watch that shit swing up right before the bell on ER day. Sell \\*minutes\\* before 4pm. \n\n2) If a company drops after ER, and if they only missed ER by a little bit, then buy that fucking dip and watch it rip in the coming days/weeks. \n\n3) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. They will fuck your life up. \n\n4) Play the big names, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, V. \n\n5) Red days usually mean green days are around the corner. Load up on red days, sell on green days. \n\n6) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. \n\n7) Do not play biomedical. See EPZM, AIMT. \n\n8) Listen to the old heads here, they have a lot of game. \n\n9) Trust your gut. \n\n10) SELL INTO STRENGTH.",

        "body": "Some DD for all of you regarding \u201ctons of money coming from China to the USA...\u201d i.e US stock market...\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s very difficult to get money out of China to the USA for investment purposes. The annual limit for currency conversion in China is $50,000 USD. Furthermore, the purpose of these conversions must NOT be for investment purposes. It can be for education, vacations, hookers, whatever. Now, of course people can lie, but note that getting caught won\u2019t turn out well. \n\nMy clients who transfer money to the USA for investment purposes do it via a proxy \u201ccountry,\u201d the most popular being Hong Kong. A few years ago (5+), before these currency restrictions went into effect, a lot of wealthy Chinese moved a significant bulk of their assets into HK. They purchased property, life insurance, stocks, etc. Many purchased life policies with the goal of liquidating it after 2 years into cash with very low gains (~0.5-2%). Why do this? Simple. Get money out of China. \n\nEven if these Chinese investors could get money out under some kind of lie, they would still be limited to $50k per person (a family of 4 can convert $200k a year). However, trying to justify little Pang Pang\u2019s college expenses at $200k a year is near impossible. Conclusion is simply that FXI going down due to liquidation has nothing to with SPY going up. \n\nSo what about all those Chinese cash buyers of homes in the USA? Most of them had assets outside of China already. Or, could somehow justify a housing expense for their kids\u2019 education when wiring money from China to close escrow.\n\nSource: industry veteran who had been doing these transactions for a long ass time.\n\nPS yes, there are other ways to get significant money out of China, but that\u2019s a discussion for another day.",
