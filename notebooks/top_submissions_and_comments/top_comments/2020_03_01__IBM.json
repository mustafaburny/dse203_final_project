I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

(Btw I got puts on this mofo)\n\n1- The name virgin is just a slap marketing gimmick after Branson\u2019s success. It\u2019s like if chipotle started making smartphones, and people thinking they would be great, because they are successful in selling burritos\n\n2- the last time they tested, the Co-Pilot died and it was 10 years ago. There is 50% or greater cha Che it will happen again in Their next flight or the next 20 flights. Any single time if it happens, it would put a pause to the company for 10 more years. Imagine hearing in the news that a rich fuck has died on one of these joy rides. That\u2019s the end of the company. Many of amazon and spaceX\u2019s rockets have exploded in the past several years\n\n3 - it is not actually going to space, but flying really high; which makes them in no shape or form comparable to Musk\u2019s or Bezos space programs; where they have opportunity with gov &amp; corporate contracting.\n\n4- the cost for a 3min quickie flight is absord and people will lose interest after the first 5-6 flights (if that ever happens) without killing the next set of travelers.\n\n5- the stock is getting pumped, but soon (next week) will lose all its value once the 27 million set of warranted shares hits the market at 11$/share and fucking the value in the ass\n\nNow - let\u2019s assume that the company is successful in their next flight; they still need fucking billions and billions in marketing; R&amp;D and  actual fucking interest from people who would want to fly\n\nThe 8000 people who have signed up is BS; and really are just WSb trolls pumping the stock value. But when it comes to actual people wanting to put in 300k; good fucking luck! \n\n\nSo fuck SPCE;\n\n15$/ put; 3/6",

Behind the scenes, the online brokerage was already bracing for financial strains.\n\n&gt;\tRobinhood drew its entire $200 million credit facility from Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., according to people familiar with the matter. It made the move just as fears of the coronavirus set off more than two weeks of violent market swings and heavy volume, during which Robinhood\u2019s trading platform suffered three significant outages.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cOur capital position remains strong,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based firm said in an emailed statement, saying the decision to borrow predated and was entirely unrelated to the outages. \u201cWe determined it was prudent to draw on our credit line during the week of Feb. 24 in light of market volatility. That capital was returned in full last week.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tIt said it\u2019s not unusual for companies to take precautionary measures during such market conditions.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cCompanies don\u2019t tap their credit line unless they need to,\u201d said David Ritter, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who spoke generally about the issue without commenting directly on Robinhood. When companies do, it\u2019s \u201cperhaps not a good signal with regard to their cash burn, which could make creditors nervous.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tRepeated Outages\n\n&gt;\tIn the days since it tapped the line of credit, Robinhood\u2019s platform has repeatedly gone dark for more than an hour at a time, including an outage March 2 that spanned an entire U.S. trading session, in which the S&amp;P 500 surged 4.6%.\n\n&gt;\tRobinhood said last week that a confluence of factors -- record account sign-ups along with highly volatile and historic market conditions -- led to unprecedented stress on the firm\u2019s infrastructure.\n\n&gt;\tThat heavy load caused the so-called Domain Name System, or DNS, to fail. The system is essentially the phone book that computers use to turn a domain name into an IP address, and it\u2019s how users access websites around the world.\n\n&gt;\tOn Monday, Robinhood faced a fresh breakdown as U.S. stocks plunged. Stocks tumbled so hard they set off a market-wide trading halt minutes after the open. And by day\u2019s end, the S&amp;P 500 was down 7.6%, the worst performance since the depths of 2008\u2019s financial crisis.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cWe know this interruption was frustrating for our customers -- especially after last week and on a day that trading was halted,\u201d the company said in the statement. \u201cOur platform is now fully operational and we\u2019re working hard to improve our service during these historic and volatile market conditions.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tThe firm declined to comment further on what sparked Monday\u2019s disruption.\n\n&gt;\tEngineering Focus\n\n&gt;\tRobinhood, founded in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, pioneered commission-free trading, a move that\u2019s since been copied by larger online brokers including Charles Schwab Corp. The startup has attracted 10 million users and is now backed by venture capital firms including Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia, garnering a valuation of $7.6 billion.\n\n&gt;\tThe company has been increasingly focused on improving the reliability of its service in recent years, and in mid-2018 hired Adam Wolff from Facebook Inc. to lead its squad of engineers.\n\n&gt;\tWhen Wolff joined, Robinhood\u2019s entire engineering workforce was the size of the group of specialists he\u2019d led at Facebook, he previously said. He has been focused on adding staff and last month hired former Facebook colleague Paul Tarjan.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cAn area where we plan to focus is one we continue to invest in heavily as a company -- compliance,\u201d Wolff said in a blog post announcing the hiring. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to our focus on our customers and our ability to safely and confidently move forward as a firm.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tShaken Confidence\n\n&gt;\tSoftware mishaps have rocked Robinhood before. In late 2018, the company\u2019s options trading service had an outage that locked consumers out of their accounts and stopped them from closing positions. Employees had to call affected clients to apologize, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n&gt;\tFor its latest outages, Robinhood has created a dedicated customer service team to work directly with customers, the company said in a statement. The impact among customers \u201cvaries significantly due to the nature of our business,\u201d it said.\n\n&gt;\tThe latest technology problems have drawn the attention of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which has been in touch with Robinhood on the matter, according to a spokeswoman for the brokerage regulator. The firm previously agreed to pay $1.25 million to the watchdog for allegedly failing to ensure customers received best prices for securities orders. It didn\u2019tadmit or deny the allegations when settling the complaint.\n\n&gt;\tFinancial technology startups can risk eroding customer trust with outages, said John Bartleman, president of TradeStationGroup Inc., a rival online trading firm.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller fintech startup, your reputation is everything,\u201d he said \u201cIf you can\u2019t get in, you lose all trust in a brand.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tA growing number of Robinhood users on social media have been reporting trouble with closing their accounts. They\u2019re also criticizing the $75 fee associated with the transferring to another platform.\n\n&gt;\tPankaj Sharma, a New Jersey IT professional with a $70,000 Robinhood account, said he sent an email to the company when he realized the site was down March 2, but didn\u2019t receive a response until after the market closed. He\u2019s now considering moving his money to a different brokerage.\n\n&gt;\t\u201cIt\u2019s really shaken my confidence,\u201d he said by phone.",

Now that the virus is just ramping up in the US and parts of Europe, the demand side of the economy is going to suffer.Any companies or industries that were struggling, slowing, or on the verge of being insolvent are going to crash.\n\nThe virus' impact could be much greater in the US too. Americans suffer from an over-sized sense of independence/self-reliance which will result in a less unified response and likely allow the virus to spread further because the citizens won't allow their liberties to be infringed. Add to that a working class that has tons of debt and cant afford to take days off work and you've got yourself a nice recipe for disaster.\n\nFactor in all the other economic data and it's hard to see how this isn't headed for a cliff.\n\nTL;DR SPY 290P 5/15",

Any reading between +5 and -5 is neutral, he explained, while any reading greater than five means sell and below negative five means buy. There is only one other reading on the oscillator that matters, however, and that's -12. \n\n&gt;\tThe oscillator hit -12 after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and again at the end of 2016 and 2018 when the Fed took interest rates too far. During all of those times, a reading of -12 signaled the bottom. The only time -12 failed to be correct was in the middle of the financial crisis in 2008. Today is not 2008, Cramer said, adding there is no systemic risk to the markets. He said we will be getting a mild recession based on a lack of travel and entertainment -- so-called gatherings -- but the oscillator is saying the odds favor buying short-term -- and long-term, for that matter.\n\nSo Cramer relies on a magical oscillator to know if it\u2019s time to buy or sell?

Now that the virus is just ramping up in the US and parts of Europe, the demand side of the economy is going to suffer.Any companies or industries that were struggling, slowing, or on the verge of being insolvent are going to crash.\n\nThe virus' impact could be much greater in the US too. Americans suffer from an over-sized sense of independence/self-reliance which will result in a less unified response and likely allow the virus to spread further because the citizens won't allow their liberties to be infringed. Add to that a working class that has tons of debt and cant afford to take days off work and you've got yourself a nice recipe for disaster.\n\nFactor in all the other economic data and it's hard to see how this isn't headed for a cliff.\n\nTL;DR SPY 290P 5/15",

Any reading between +5 and -5 is neutral, he explained, while any reading greater than five means sell and below negative five means buy. There is only one other reading on the oscillator that matters, however, and that's -12. \n\n&gt;\tThe oscillator hit -12 after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and again at the end of 2016 and 2018 when the Fed took interest rates too far. During all of those times, a reading of -12 signaled the bottom. The only time -12 failed to be correct was in the middle of the financial crisis in 2008. Today is not 2008, Cramer said, adding there is no systemic risk to the markets. He said we will be getting a mild recession based on a lack of travel and entertainment -- so-called gatherings -- but the oscillator is saying the odds favor buying short-term -- and long-term, for that matter.\n\nSo Cramer relies on a magical oscillator to know if it\u2019s time to buy or sell?

        "body": "There\u2019s a black hole in the dollar funding\nAUGUST 23 2019 By: Izabella Kaminska\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since we checked in on what\u2019s percolating through the mind of financial-plumbing specialist Zoltan Pozsar at Credit Suisse. And it looks like this was an error because we may have missed a whopper of a dollar funding story.\n\nHere\u2019s the gist from the opening of his latest note (with our emphasis, oh, and RRP stands for reverse repurchase agreement):\n\nThe FOMC should forget about r* for the moment and focus on Sagittarius-A* \u2013 the supermassive black hole at the center of global dollar funding markets.\n\nThe black hole is the foreign RRP facility, which has seen close to $100 billion of inflows since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe driver of these inflows is the curve inversion, and the longer the inversion persists the more inflows will follow. The trade war is also contributing to the inflows \u2013 given the inversion, as foreign central banks weaken their currencies they \u201cbuy\u201d the foreign RRP facility and not Treasuries like in the past.\n\nForeign central banks are rate shopping\u2026 \u2026and an uncapped foreign RRP facility is what enables that. Like the matter that enters a black hole, the reserves that are sterilized by the foreign RRP facility are gone for good \u2013 like the reserves \u201cshredded\u201d via taper.\n\nIt\u2019s an important point because even if the Fed were to stop tapering (a monetary tightening measure which sees central banks absorbing the proceeds of maturing Treasuries rather than reinvesting them in further asset purchases), tightening would continue for as long as the uncapped foreign RRP facility attracts inflows. Which it would, says Pozsar, because of the curve inversion.\n\n\nHe predicts such inflows could eclipse $200bn by the year\u2019s end with the consequence of pricing Treasury supply out of the market.\n\n\nThis suggests the Fed may have overdone its hiking cycle, something that now can only be fixed with rate cuts. (Which incidentally also means, eek, Donald Trump might be right about Powell\u2019s policy.)\n\nKey to this conclusion is how the make-up of inflows into the foreign RRP facility has been changing over time. In 2015, for example, much of the growth of the facility was due to inflows from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance.\n\nAs Pozsar explains:\n\n...the Fed, deeply concerned that it won\u2019t be able to enforce a floor underneath o/n interest rates as it tries to exit ZIRP, uncapped the facility to help banks shed balance sheet by luring foreign central banks away from banks and into the foreign RRP facility, and to help ease the bill shortage in money markets by luring foreign central banks out of bills and into the foreign RRP facility.\n\nThe important context at the time was the massive shortage of short-term safe assets in the system, which put negative pressure on short-end rates across the board. By diverting central bank liquidity away from commercial banks and over to the foreign RRP facility, the Fed thus released important bill supply into the market which alleviated that pressure and thus defended the rate floor.\n\nThe rate-hiking cycle, however, has entirely reversed this situation.\n\nRRP inflows are now being fuelled not by balance sheet constraints or a shortage of quality collateral but the inverse: intraday liquidity constraints and a collateral surplus.\n\n\nIn short, there are too many dollar-denominated safe assets in the market and not enough liquidity and hence -- very possibly -- the makings of a fresh liquidity crisis.\n\nAs Pozsar explains:\n\nBecause inflows into the facility sterilize reserves and add collateral to the financial system, they worsen the collateral surplus. But don\u2019t blame the foreign central banks placing cash into the facility, for they do what a rational person would do when offered something that has value \u2013 take as much of the stuff as they can, while they can.\n\nPozsar adds the current inversion is the most extreme relative to overnight repo rates, and that historically this is the first time that the curve has inverted relative to these rates:\n\n\nThe usual structural incentive during a yield curve inversion is to sell long-term notes and buy short-term bills. This time, however, the greater incentive is to sell long-term notes and buy the foreign RRP facility, not bills. Thus the worse the inversion gets , the more dollar they\u2019ll put at the foreign RRP facility. This incidentally ensures the short-term bill market doesn\u2019t receive the offsetting flows it should.\n\nBut there\u2019s more!\n\nConventionally, central banks that want to weaken their currencies relative to the dollar intervene by buying dollars and investing in Treasuries. But the recent interventions by the PBoC seem to have seen dollars invested in the foreign RRP facility as well as in Treasuries, says Pozsar.\n\nEvery penny that flows into the facility, he says, makes it harder for banks to fund dealers, whose safe-assetinventories are growing partly due to the foreign RRP facility, and partlydue to the circularity of the matter:\n\n\u2026economists would refer to the above dynamics as pro-cyclical: more collateral supply, higher repo rates, more inflows into the foreign RRP facility, even more collateral supply.\n\nWhich we guess means the Fedshould cap or otherwise restrict the facility and begin to lower rates to avoid a major dollar funding squeeze.\n\nBut why might they not do this? One reason, says Pozsar, is that other central banks don\u2019t cap their equivalent facilities, and the other is that the Fed is not the only one to be paying a better rate on its facility than can be achieved in local bill markets.\n\nAccording to Pozsar this is the result of strategic BoJ and ECB policy designed to encourage the lending of more dollars in the FX swap market, so as to avoid deeply negative reinvestment yields and make more bills available in their own financial systems.\n\nBut it makes no sense for the Fed to do the same, he says. To the contrary doing so creates a paradox of thrift.\n\nThe following is a stellar point by Pozsar:\n\nIf the global financial system\u2019s problem is a shortage of US dollars, it makes sense for foreign central banks to pull funds away from their local bill markets to help improve the reinvestment returns of dollar lenders and hence ease the flow of dollars, but it makes no sense for the Fed to do the same \u2013 if it does, it hurts the flow of dollars. Here is how\u2026 If the Fed offers a rate above Treasury bill yields on an uncapped the foreign RRP facility, it will attract inflows. Inflows sterilize reserves and increase collateral supply on the margin \u2013 instead of buying Treasury bills at auctions, the facility incentivises foreign central banks to deposit cash at the Fed. These dynamics put an upward pressure on local bill yields, and higher local bill yields reduce the allure of lending dollars in the FX swap market \u2013 the flow of dollars suffers and the Fed is pushing against the efforts of other central banks.\n\nSo, unless the Fed takes action -- and by that Pozsar doesn\u2019t mean technical action such as the creation of a standing repo facility or asset purchases -- the collateral tsunami may continue to worsen.\n\nIt follows, Pozsar says, that if the Fed priced supply out of the market, it should now consider rate cuts instead: \u201d...rate cuts that are aggressive enough to re-steepen the curve so that dealer inventories can clear; cuts deep enough to incentivise real-money investors to lend long, not short and foreign investors to buy Treasuries on an FX hedged basis on scale again.\u201d\n\nThat makes this weekend\u2019s Jackson Hole meeting arguably the most significant in a decade, concludes Pozsar.",

Over half of \"investment quality\" bonds are now rated BBB, the the lowest investment grade rating available. Corporate cash holdings have dropped to $1.69 Trillion. The US Debt-to-GDP Ratio is 107% .\n\nConsumer Debt is at a record high of $13.95 trillion. Meanwhile, the Prime Age (working age) Employment Ratio has not returned to pre-recession levels. If you look at personal savings rate by income quintile, only the top 20% are saving more than 4%. the bottom 60% aren't saving anything at all. this is largely because the majority of income growth has been in the top 20%. Even the average including the top 20% is only 8%, still historically low.\n\nThe equity market cap-to-GDP ratio is at an all-time high, above 200%. The Price-to-Earnings-Growth Ratio (PEG) is at it's highest ever.\n\nIn other words, spending and prices have become decouples from actual productivity and earnings. With high debt, low savings, and low credit ratings, both consumers and corporations face default if they have a minor hiccup in revenue.\n\nNote: These numbers rely on the best available data, based on large numbers of tests, available from the WHO and academic sources. they could change as more information comes in from other countries.\n\nDisease threat: In China, the In China, the overall CFR for COVID-19 was 17.3% for cases before they improved standards of care (access to sophisticated medical equipment and trained personal); it then dropped to 0.7%. The much heard 2.3% Case Fatality Rate is an average between these two. This explains the variance in CFR, and why countries such as South Korea, which had preparation and foreknowledge, have a lower CFR.\n\nThe disease has a 1 to 14 day incubation rate. This explains the variance in apparent asymptomatic rates (diseases in incubation appear asymptomatic). Hundred of thousands of tests have been conducted in South Korea; the WHO reported that China produced millions of tests. Some cases, such as the first Italy, have shown several weeks of no symptoms before becoming severely ill. This makes it difficult to control the spread.\n\nThe data from both China &amp; South Korea seem to support that about 80.9% of cases are mild, 13.8% of cases become severe, and 4.7% become critical. The remaining 0.6% may be asymptomatic. The sum of severe &amp; critical cases is 18.5\u202c%, close to the 17.3% early CFR in China, suggesting that those people would die without significant supportive care. This care includes: oxygen production and breathing apparatus to support respiratory failure, IVs &amp; vasopressor medication to support septic shock, and dialysis to support kidney failure. The median time to recover is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease.\n\nThis suggests that about 20% of those infected will need about 4.5 weeks of intensive care. The hospitalization rate for the flu is only 1%.\n\nThe overall CFR rate (including all ages and comorbidity statuses) for seasonal flu is about 0.1%. The CFR for COVID-19 ranges from 0.2% for peole in their 20s &amp; 30s, 0.4% for people in their 40s, 1.3% for people in their 50s, 3.6% for people in their 60s, 8.0% for people in their 70s, to 14.8% for people over 80.\n\nCFRs vary by comorbidity. For those with no comorbidity (otherwise in good health), the CFR is 0.9%. Remember that the flu is only 0.1% overall, which lumps in those with comorbidities. Those with diabetes have a CFR of 7.3%, those with hypertension have a CFR of 6.0%, those cardiovascular disease have a CFR of 10.5%.\n\nSo, the fatality of the disease ranges from twice as deadly as the overall rate for flu for the healthiest people, to 148 times as deadly as the overall rate for those over 70. It's significantly more likely to result in hospitalization, and that hospitalization will be longer.\n\nThe disease appears to have an R0 of about 2.5 without \"intense quarantine and social distancing measures\". most epidemiologists, and other relevant experts, don't think the world could maintain for the 6 months to a year necessary to develop a vaccine. Current estimates by epidemiologists range from 20% to 70% of adults being infected within a year, depending on control measures. Washington State Department of Health officials stated that they expect to see more cases of COVID-19 in the coming months than cases of flu.\n\nQuarantine and Control Measures Impact: If we want to prevent that millions of people being infected thing from happening, we could do this. The effect on productivity and demand would be tremendous. Additionally, transaction costs go way up; it's difficult to conduct business when you're in different quarantine zones. Their are also multiple legal and political hurdles.\n\nDisease Impact: 20% hospitalization of 20% infected of 209.1 Million adults in the US is 8.4 Million needing about 4 weeks of intensive care. 20% hospitalization of 70% infected of 209.1 Million adults in the US is about 29.3 million people requiring about 4 weeks of intensive care.\n\nA 1% fatality rate of 20% infected adults is 289,940 dead in the US. A 2% fatality rate of 70% infected adults is 2,927,400\u202c dead in the US.\n\nNormal annual fatalities in the US are 2.8 Million. These death amount to between a 10.4% increase and 104.6% increase in deaths for the year.\n\nIf we choose to control it, the control measures will directly impact production and reduce demand in an immediate fashion.\n\nIf we allow the disease to run rampant, and it actually does, the deaths and hospitalizations will pose significant disruptions; massive resource will be allocated to medical requirements, people will take time off work to care for their family members or stay in hospital, deaths will result in a significant increase in empty housing, municipal property taxes will decline (increasing the likelihood of default on municipal bonds), assets such as stocks &amp; bonds will pour into the market either because the owner is dead or they need to pay for medical expenses.\n\nWith high debt and low savings, consumers and corporations are ill prepared to endure such an impact to production and revenue. Since we are close to full employment, have such high valuations compared to production, and have a high level of government debt already, we are primed for inflation if the government decides to print money to save these entities. In a worst case scenario, the government's credit laying could lower, and t-bonds would be dumped on the market.\n\nHowever, these are all just possibilities. the chance of the worst case scenarios happening is still low; it could be contained in relatively small areas. The full potential threat may not become apparent to the non-epidemiologist for six months or so, when we have significantly more cases and their impact is directly visible. Actions such as the additional rate cuts could raise prices in the meantime.\n\nPossible high risk long play: INGN is down to $ 47.67 from $67.59 about 8 weeks ago. They produce lightweight portable oxygen concentrators. They could have an increase in demand of orders of magnitude, in a market with a high barrier of entry (FDA regs, IP, expertise). However, they could face supply chain problems.",

The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

Mind you, Air Freight is not a viable way to transport some things, but for a lot of industries Air Fright is allowing them to \"patch\" their supply line disruptions by rushing parts from China to the USA.\n\nAnything that shortens that time and makes it easier to get in parts and material from China and alternate suppliers will help.

(STZ), a leading beverage alcohol company, today provided a response including fact-based consumer trends to address unfounded concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 virus on its business and consumer sentiment related to the company\u2019s Corona beer brand.\n\nBased on recent IRI retail trends, sales of Corona Extra remain strong, with dollar sales up 5% in the U.S. per the latest 4-week period ended Feb. 16, nearly doubling the 52-week trend for the brand. Similarly, depletion trends for Corona Extra for the first two months of this calendar year through Feb. 26, as well as the month of February, have also outpaced their 52-week trend. In addition, IRI dollar sales trends for the entire Corona brand family are also outpacing their 52-week trend in the latest 4-week and 12-week periods. Furthermore, all business units supporting our beer business are seeing positive sales trends for the brand thus far this calendar year.\"",

It's a great time for you to buy right now being the Covid-19 outbreak, good for you long term. Come Monday and the news around Covid-19 looks like it will continue down. Time in the market will beat timing the market for 99% of investors. Also look at your investments as % ignoring the dollar amount. You may make 'only' $40 off your $400 but that's 10% growth!!

Get it done in federal - disability money garnished at 25% for 10 years, then debt forgiven and IRS taxes the forgiven amount. Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle. Gonna need a super lawyer to keep it in state as I stayed in CA the entire time, opened the account in CA, and TDA has state presence by having physical retail buildings so are bound to state creditor laws. \n\n# TL;DR\nMay be paying a lawyer 100k-1m to not owe 1m to keep it in state court, lol. I need the best here as they'll bring the best.",

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",
