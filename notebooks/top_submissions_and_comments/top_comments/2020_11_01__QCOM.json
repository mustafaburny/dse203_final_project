        "body": "Amazon won\u2019t be literally wiped out. The mistake is assuming stock returns will remain positive as long as the company continues to do well. \n\nI use this example all the time. Qualcomm is THE wireless chip designer. If you\u2019re using a piece of tech that has wireless capability, there\u2019s a very good chance it uses QCOM tech. Obviously wireless has exploded over the last 20 years, mostly with smart phones, but pretty much everything... TV, consoles, microwaves. \n\nQualcomm was perfectly positioned for the 21st century. They make money on every piece of hardware sold that uses their chips. \n\nTheir revenues were $2-3bn in the late 90s. With the advent of the smart phone, revenues jumped to &gt; $10bn by 2008. \n\nIf you knew wireless was going to explode in the 2000s, QCOM was as sure a bet as anything. I mean, *smart phones!* \n\nExcept if you bought QCOM in 2000, ignoring dividends, you made your money back... this July, 2020. Qualcomm predictably did very well with the rise of smart phones. Their stock? Trash. \n\nThe point is that markets are far from one dimensional, and overly simple narratives display a clear lack of understanding of market psychology, market flows, how and when valuations matter (they don\u2019t, until they do), etc. \n\nBubbles are a hell of a thing, because they can destroy the stocks of good companies for years or even decades. \n\nAmazon? IDK. But I see MSFT at 11x price/sales and I\u2019m reminded of one of the all time greatest stock quotes, ever:  \n\n&gt; At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&amp;D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need any transparency. You don\u2019t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?\n\n- Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems. \n\nThe last thing I will say is *a lot* of high flyers this year have charts that display the hallmarks of a bubble; exponential ascension with no regard for long term fundamentals, big drop, claw back some of the losses from the initial drop for a few weeks/months, before the steady decline hits and before you know it, the stock is stealthily down 40% despite no major catalysts or changes to the company.",
