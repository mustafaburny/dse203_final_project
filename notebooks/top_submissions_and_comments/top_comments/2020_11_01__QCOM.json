Consequently, FIVG is up quite a bit. On the other hand, SRVR has been relatively flat. I\u2019m not sure if this is because the side of the industry they\u2019re tracking hasn\u2019t really been tapped yet, or if they\u2019re just going to be a more slowly growing sector. Or if the list of srvr holdings are just focused on the wrong companies.\n\nRight now I\u2019m holding a little SRVR at a small loss. I\u2019m thinking about taking the loss and shifting into FIVG, but I have a feeling that the moment I do that, FIVG will start to flatten and SRVR will start to run up.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Maybe I should just split 50/50?",
