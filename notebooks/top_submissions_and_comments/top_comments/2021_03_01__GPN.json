        "body": "I really hope he reads these when he gets home after a long hard day of shilling for the hedgies and his overlords over at Melvin and Citadel.  \n\nImagine Cry Bitch Jimmy Cramer walking into his home, throwing his suit jacket over the back of the couch.  He shuffles into the kitchen and reaches for the $SJM to make his favorite PBJ sandwich. Pops a cold $BUD and heads to the couch where he pops open his $IBM toughbook, opens up $MSFT Internet Explorer and pecks his was to WSB to see what his favorite retards are up to AH. He can't help but to search the subreddit for his name.  As he sorts by trending he hears the muffled moans of orgasmic euphoria echoing from his bedroom.  He rolls his eyes as he realizes he'll be sleeping on the couch tonight since his wife's boyfriend is sleeping over tonight. He continues scrolling through WSB reading every retarded post about him he can find.  He begins to feel sadness and a lump in his throat and he thinks about his 401k being down 2.5 points on the day.  Tears swelling in his eyes as he hears the unmistakable sound of a hand slapping and smacking his wife's bare ass as she moans in pleasure as her boyfriend rails her for the fifth time tonight. Jimmy knows he will never be able to satisfy his wife the way her boyfriend can.  He closes WSB as the tears of disappointment and rage roll down his face.  How dare these selfish retail traders, who know nothing about investing, question me and CNBC!  How dare they make money! MONEY IS FOR HEDGIES ONLY! he exclaims. He navigates to his bookmarks to find his favorite cuck porn help him relieve the swelling rage, anger, and fear that have been building within him over the past two months.  How much more of this can I take he wonders and he manually stimulates himself to cuck porn while his wife and her boyfriend begin round six in the next room over, all the while tears streaming down his face.  Finally after several hours he achieves a sweet release however his anger still remains balled up inside him.  In a fit of rage he throws his $IBM toughbook to the floor and pulls out his $T $AAPL iPhone and heads over to $TWTR where he goes on an 18 tweet rant about the retards on WSB before he finally passes out after his 9th $BUD.",

        "body": "You have the option to either take the dividend in cash or take it in shares, which is called a dividend reinvestment program (DRIP).\n\nIf you are taking cash with your IBM example, IBM pays a dividend of $1.63 for every share you have once a quarter. So if IBM keeps the dividend at $1.63 for every quarter, that means you get $6.52 ($1.63 * 4) a year for every share you own. \n\nSo if you want to get $20k a year from IBM alone, you would need to have about 3,067 shares. You get $6.52 a year for every share times 3,067 which equals about $20k. IBM currently trades for about $120 a share, so it would require you to $368,040 worth of stock in order to get $20k a year. \n\nHope this helps!",

Free cash flow yield is a completely different metric, and it returns more value to shareholders for a company that is stagnating or declining. It's perfectly reasonable for them to buy back shares instead of sit on cash. I would prefer to hold a company like this than one that continually is able to be 'competitive in the market' but doesn't generate any cash so it has to issue shares year-over-year in order to supplement it's growth",

        "body": "IBM generates plenty of cash to cover its high dividend as well as share buy backs. What does that have to do with their ability to be competitive in the market? Free cash flow yield is a completely different metric, and it returns more value to shareholders for a company that is stagnating or declining. It's perfectly reasonable for them to buy back shares instead of sit on cash. I would prefer to hold a company like this than one that continually is able to be 'competitive in the market' but doesn't generate any cash so it has to issue shares year-over-year in order to supplement it's growth",
