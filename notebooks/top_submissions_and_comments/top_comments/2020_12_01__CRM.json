My cat ate some shit and needed an expensive ass surgery to get it out of his intestines or he would slowly starve to death, so I said fuck it and put the rest of my money into tesla weeklies before the split. Fuck yeah was all the way back up to 100%+ and kitty was saved.\n\nFast forward to November. After some terribly timed Sony calls (right before the sept tech sell off, with short exp dates) and some other bad moves, I ended up being down 90fucking%. I was absolutely devastated didn't know what to do. So what happens? My little fucking retard starts puking up all his food again with the same exact symptoms as last time. Another surgery! While I'm at my absolute lowest with only a little savings and no job. Fuck it, time to get back in I'm too far invested in the cat to lose him now. Go in one at a time on , KOS, PFE, APHA, PLTR, F, BABA, RKT calls and sell the moment I hit decent profit. Up 600% in one month and back to 100% all time.\n\nI don't know if I saved my cat or if my cat saved me, but WSB was with me every step of the way. Cat's doing fine and I'm back in the game.\n\nPositions: PLTR 12/18's, URA CRM RYCEY leaps and stocks",
