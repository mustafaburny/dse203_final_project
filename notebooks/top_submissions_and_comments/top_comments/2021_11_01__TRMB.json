        "body": "There\u2019s more to it than just thinking it will hit my  call price. If the stock is at $100, I can buy $140 (or higher/lower, this is just an example) and if the stock goes up I can earn money along the way. Once your option is \u201cin the money (ITM)\u201d your options gain faster. A common strategy is to buy Leaps, which are a year or two out or more (expiration date). Do this with solid companies and look at their performance, price targets, etc. AMDs price target has, mostly, been pushed some where between $130-150. So I bought $130 calls when the price was around $125 (they\u2019ve crushed earnings all year and had big runs the last two ERs). I\u2019ve been in and out of calls with this stock for the past year+. There\u2019s a macro play with merger coming. This is not about gambling. It\u2019s knowing the stock, fundamentals, and preparing accordingly. Fully expect this to run more post-merger with Xilinx. Then will take it from there. Hope this helps.",

AMD is trading on taking share from INTC plus I think people are starting to treat the XLNX acquisition as accretive.  Yes they do have a graphics business but it wasn't an earnings driver in the recent earnings call.  NVDA I think is riding a bigger tail wind from crypto, and IMO is more priced to perfection (disclosure they are above my sell target price), but they have done a good job with software offerings that are quite profitable too.\n\nAll the analysis from Fidelity etc say INTC is undervalued and a buy while they say stay away from AMD.  I think they have it wrong on AMD and INTC but that's what you get from sell side analysts whose job is frequently to pander for investment banking opportunities.",

        "body": "My take on stock investing in general is it really works in levels. You do not touch the higher levels of investing until you have a firm understanding and success at the lower. \nThe lowest level is ETF investing, easy to learn easy to toss money at and make returns. Also builds a strong base to work from\n\n The 2nd is individual stock, once you really learned to analyze investment data. You can also work on the emotional side of your investments in this area like not panicking during a selloff or becoming to elated in your gains not to sell.\n\nThe 3rd level is learning the various trading options such as limits, stop losses and margins. Really it can be bundled into the 2nd BUT these things are generally more important for traders rather Investors.\n\nFinally we get to options, if you don't have a firm grasp and decent experience with the above then you need to stay the hell away from options. They are the ultimate trap to newbie investors who see dipshits on WSB gambling away there entire savings. HOWEVER, a reasonable experienced investor whom can make sound decisions in there investments in the previous level can  infact benefit from limited option trading (can never recommend an all in). \n\nI for one am sitting on some delicious AMD 87.5 leap calls that don't expire til next June. I felt they were a reasonable investment as the XLNX merger was already know.",

Right now the gap is continuing to widen and all of the major tech pushes in semiconductors right now need lower power consumption. PCs dominated the sector for decades but in 2018 you could see that era was coming to an end. PCs are the only area we\u2019re intels 10 nm process node competes. By the time 7 nm is in production tsm will have released 3 nm. A few years ago intel was only one process node behind but now they are 2.\n\nMaybe the best example of this is my best friend who is not an engineer owning a ton of intel he bought the upward swing of the dip in 2019 and got it for 48. I convinced him to rotate that position into Amd and the best way to do that was xlnx based on price ratio of the two. He was able to get out at 57. He made 18.75% holding a stock for two years during one of the most historic bull runs ever and even an order of magnitude more historic for semiconductor stocks. He rotated all of it into xlnx at 120 and in a few months is up 79%. The delta between Amd price appreciation and intel might not always be that crazy and that fast but for the next two or so years I think most semiconductor stocks will outpace intel gains wise.",

If the stock is at $100, I can buy $140 (or higher/lower, this is just an example) and if the stock goes up I can earn money along the way. Once your option is \u201cin the money (ITM)\u201d your options gain faster. A common strategy is to buy Leaps, which are a year or two out or more (expiration date). Do this with solid companies and look at their performance, price targets, etc. AMDs price target has, mostly, been pushed some where between $130-150. So I bought $130 calls when the price was around $125 (they\u2019ve crushed earnings all year and had big runs the last two ERs). I\u2019ve been in and out of calls with this stock for the past year+. There\u2019s a macro play with merger coming. This is not about gambling. It\u2019s knowing the stock, fundamentals, and preparing accordingly. Fully expect this to run more post-merger with Xilinx. Then will take it from there. Hope this helps.",

        "body": "&gt; And what use case are we seeing for these besides Shors algorithm? A probabilistic computer is not good for almost all the problems we have to solve today, so beyond needing one to help with your cryptography, what is the use case for the market? \n\nI've yet to understand why shor's algorithm even gets mentioned - Seemingly only around hype articles and investing spaces. I'm guessing because it's easy for the layman to understand the nature of the result: \"you get a prime factors and someone told me they're important to encryption\" that's *technically* true for one nature of encryption but absolutely false for symmetric encryption like AES-256. Now we do have Grover's algorithm which reduces the solve space of AES-256 to AES-64 but that's arguably marginal gain because of a dirty \"secret\". Quantum computers don't run as fast as classical computers, there isn't as many processing cycles per second on even the best machines so when you see only quadratic gains in solve time, forget it. It's exponential or bust because of this slow down that you have to overcome.\n\nPhysicists like me want them for simulating quantum physics. I know, pretty meta, but that's our motivation and frankly everything else is just frosting. You need 2^N bits on a classical computer or N qbits, the choice is easy. I believe a lot of \"killer apps\" could simply be built in this benefit of 2^N unitary matrix multiplication resulting in 2^N exponential speed up and 2^N state space.\n\nThe \"probablistic\" nature of these algorithms is already accounted for in the solve time. Circuits are developed so that \"incorrect\" solutions are attributed with both positive and negative probabilities so while your state space is 2^N, your output is completely deterministic and repeatable.\n\nMore tangibly I'd point out computational chemistry which leads into biology and pharmaceuticals.\n\nYou will be able to simulate high-temperature superconductors; the active sites of enzymes containing metal complexes or radicals, photovoltaic materials and inorganic catalyst behavior. Anything that needs precise modeling of electron orbitals is impossible to do classically. Projects like folding@home are monuments to how bad classical computers are at computational chemistry. It's tough to simulate anything without assumptions and simplifications that interfere with your results on a classic machine.\n\nOne example is how the transcription of genetic information encoded in DNA is regulated by histone proteins which exist in a regime where the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down. This forces you to calculate for every electron spin state in the system. Just the Fe ion has 151 electrons and 121 spatial orbitals and that's only one of nine catalytic steps to understanding gene switching. Enter quantum computers\n\nAnother example is how telomerase replenishment is significant to our understanding of stem cell maintenance, aging, and cancer treatment. Quantum computing would have advantage in simulating the catalytic active centers and preserve fidelity during the extension process. This is because the process relies on nucleobase pairing.\n\n \n&gt; noise problem\n\nAs for your purported \"noise problem\" I genuinely don't know what you're talking about. The world record for two gate fidelities, state prep, measurement and entanglement are all beyond acceptable for commercial use today, if someone used noise as an excuse... they used it as a buzz word to wave away impatient investors. The papers that have come out for QEC on logical qbits proves as much. It's getting increasingly frustrating watching companies flail in the space and spread disingenuous quantum hype and quantum excuses to pump their stocks up and while I'm not going to name names, they're everywhere and I hope they're self evident to the critical eye. Look for the humble, steady releases on arxiv.org not the \"we just made a computer 10 million times faster at everything but you can't independently benchmark it yet\" articles.\n\nIt's not the next Fitbit or iPhone, that's for sure but computing is shaping the future and specialized compute units have consistently been the answer. Look how Important companies like Intel, AMD and Nvidia are and they spend a lot of time just making specialized graphics cards, Xilinx just makes FPGA's and Bitfury, ASICS.\n\nWe're rapidly seeing cloud accessible commercial systems that are being leveraged by multiple industries to calculate the solutions to everyday problems. I would bet the first \"wow\"problem  will be chemistry based but it could be natural language processing, logistics, cryptology, or something unexpected. This isn't a video game, these research problems aren't time fungible so I can't possibly know which one will break through first.\n\nI guess my thesis would be, \"don't bet against this technology evolving and improving exponentially\"",

        "body": "I think they are trading off different scenarios right now, even though both are near ATH.  AMD is trading on taking share from INTC plus I think people are starting to treat the XLNX acquisition as accretive.  Yes they do have a graphics business but it wasn't an earnings driver in the recent earnings call.  NVDA I think is riding a bigger tail wind from crypto, and IMO is more priced to perfection (disclosure they are above my sell target price), but they have done a good job with software offerings that are quite profitable too.\n\nAll the analysis from Fidelity etc say INTC is undervalued and a buy while they say stay away from AMD.  I think they have it wrong on AMD and INTC but that's what you get from sell side analysts whose job is frequently to pander for investment banking opportunities.",
