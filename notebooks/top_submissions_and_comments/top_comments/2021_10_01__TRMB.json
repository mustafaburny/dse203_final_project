AMD is a ant company compare to Intel, Samsung and TSMC. On top of that China SMIC is growing like a weed. This is why Lisa Su is trying to close the deal with Xilinx. She knows they need them to survive. It is though to be in semiconductor business. PLTR on the other has a huge moat it is national security business with next to zero competitor.

Similarly they'd have no problem selling more CPUs in the laptop/desktop market, chips for the PS5 or hugely in demand GPUs (even though nvidia still has an edge there). \n\nThey'll also buy Xilinx, which adds some nice synergies with the FPGAs. I feel like they most of all need to work on their software and GPUs, but they kind of already have the product range that nvidia would like to achieve by purchasing ARM (which so far doesn't seem to happen).",

I'm guessing you're only getting this extra benefit, because the common Joe Blow retail investor doesn't really know about this, and they just buy AMD shares, while bigger insiders that feel this merger is a slam dunk buy XLNX instead. The spread you're seeing is this slight difference in understanding, also some people don't want to take the 20 percent risk the merger somehow doesn't happen",

Idk exactly what the catalyst was at that time, but I imagine the WSB hype added to the push (+good Q2). The stocks have been moving very similarly apart from that bull run. \n\nIts impossible to say how aware of the full picture the average retail investor is, but my guess is that they've barely heard of Xilinx whilst AMD is more of a household name. \n\nCheck out this link for ratio movement over time: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio",

One of my favorite stocks going forward.\n\n(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",
