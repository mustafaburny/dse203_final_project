        "body": "Well it\u2019s possible for one tomorrow and Friday and the gamma to force the naked calls to cover and buy, but that takes a lot of volume. If somehow this closes above $9 on Friday this thing would sky rocket. But we are talking 10s of millions in volume. You would need to get all of retail in on it to buy tonight until Friday. The float on this thing is so small that a coordinated squeeze would take this literally to the moon. Short positions are also disclosed and there are a lot of institutions that opened shorts last week. Forgot exactly what prices. There were also buyers that bought puts to cover risk. I am no fortune teller so I can\u2019t tell if or when it\u2019ll happen. But an article did come out saying investment firms are expanding positions in this. \n\nhttps://www.gurufocus.com/news/1504573/ardsley-advisory-partners-lp-buys-sunrun-inc-western-digital-corp-alibaba-group-holding-sells-baidu-inc-the-aes-corp-vertex-pharmaceuticals-inc/?r=21637c73084e87d770a98f867757282f\n\nThis portfolio is an example. They are selling off tech and getting into renewables and infrastructure. This will be the trend but it will take off more in The coming weeks. Right now you have options that need to expire before MMs let it run. But catalysts and squeezes can beat MMs. Hell if WSB jumps on this and starts buying and holding this will run past $20 EOW. After options expire in the money sky is the limit. \n\nVery unlikely like I said I am looking at the long term growth and see a lot of value in this. Best bet is buying leaps or calls very far out. The price point right now is at a critical level and the support is strong but it needs to stay above $6.82 tomorrow. If not she will slide further. If she holds then we reverse and go up, which is what I believe will happen.",
