I\u2019m not a technical analyst, and I\u2019ve only been investing for about 4 years (I am 26). Everyone\u2019s a genius in a bull market anyway so I\u2019m sure a monkey could\u2019ve performed similarly anyway - but you asked so I\u2019ll share. \n\n1) only invest in companies you use and enjoy\n2) only invest in companies who have forward thinking leaders with proven track records\n3) only invest in companies who are building products/services for the future and don\u2019t base your investment on historical performance \n4) don\u2019t buy meme stocks and no one on the internet has the answers I learned this the hard way and am bag holding stocks below. \n\nI did not lose money on any meme stock. I made a lot off the video game store - this is probably part of the reason I got over confident and started breaking my own principles. \n\nI lost money on picks made by people on the internet ($FUBO, $CRLBF, $APPN, $FLGT) \n\nA good example of this would be SQ. I bought SQ back in 2017 when I first started investing. I\u2019ve used their product at the barber, at the coffee shop up the road, at a farmer market. I thought to myself. \u201cWow, a mobile phone credit card reader for any small business, I only use card so this just made my life a whole lot easier - who made this?!?\u201d \n\nJack Dorsey obviously created twitter, and scaled one of the most popular social networks to billions of people and billions of dollars. I believed in him, and he\u2019s a very\u2026. \u201cpassionate\u201d individual about the future. \n\nWith the rise in SMB\u2019s (I work for a tech company that serves SMB\u2019s and realized how easy it is to start a biz now a days, I realized that this little mobile credit card processing company was only just getting started, and I bought a couple dozen shares of $SQ (wish I had more money back then). It\u2019s my 2\u2019d best performer behind $PENN (who fits this mold as well). \n\nAgain, I know this is flawed, not-proven, and there are much better ways to go about investing. The 2020 bull run helped make me a ton of money and I\u2019m very lucky in that sense that i invested in companies like $APPL, $SQ, $MSFT, $TSLA using these principles. Confirmation bias? 100%. But I\u2019m gonna stick to it and hope it keeps working and gets me out of the hole I dug by taking the internet\u2019s advice. \n\nA few stocks I\u2019m currently interested in:\n$CRM, $MSP, $S, $FTNT",
