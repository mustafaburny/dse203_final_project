I\u2019m not a technical analyst, and I\u2019ve only been investing for about 4 years (I am 26). Everyone\u2019s a genius in a bull market anyway so I\u2019m sure a monkey could\u2019ve performed similarly anyway - but you asked so I\u2019ll share. \n\n1) only invest in companies you use and enjoy\n2) only invest in companies who have forward thinking leaders with proven track records\n3) only invest in companies who are building products/services for the future and don\u2019t base your investment on historical performance \n4) don\u2019t buy meme stocks and no one on the internet has the answers I learned this the hard way and am bag holding stocks below. \n\nI did not lose money on any meme stock. I made a lot off the video game store - this is probably part of the reason I got over confident and started breaking my own principles. \n\nI lost money on picks made by people on the internet ($FUBO, $CRLBF, $APPN, $FLGT) \n\nA good example of this would be SQ. I bought SQ back in 2017 when I first started investing. I\u2019ve used their product at the barber, at the coffee shop up the road, at a farmer market. I thought to myself. \u201cWow, a mobile phone credit card reader for any small business, I only use card so this just made my life a whole lot easier - who made this?!?\u201d \n\nJack Dorsey obviously created twitter, and scaled one of the most popular social networks to billions of people and billions of dollars. I believed in him, and he\u2019s a very\u2026. \u201cpassionate\u201d individual about the future. \n\nWith the rise in SMB\u2019s (I work for a tech company that serves SMB\u2019s and realized how easy it is to start a biz now a days, I realized that this little mobile credit card processing company was only just getting started, and I bought a couple dozen shares of $SQ (wish I had more money back then). It\u2019s my 2\u2019d best performer behind $PENN (who fits this mold as well). \n\nAgain, I know this is flawed, not-proven, and there are much better ways to go about investing. The 2020 bull run helped make me a ton of money and I\u2019m very lucky in that sense that i invested in companies like $APPL, $SQ, $MSFT, $TSLA using these principles. Confirmation bias? 100%. But I\u2019m gonna stick to it and hope it keeps working and gets me out of the hole I dug by taking the internet\u2019s advice. \n\nA few stocks I\u2019m currently interested in:\n$CRM, $MSP, $S, $FTNT",

And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nIt is my view that the FSD tech would be more of an open space. Most of these companies will start using third party companies, akin to how PC manufacturers used Windows from Microsoft instead of creating their own OS. Initially some will try their hand at the market with their own bespoke solution(like the wild west days of 80's when we had commodores and sinclair spectrums). However after some time their will be a standardization(IBM PC). \n\nAt best I can see Tesla becoming like the Macintoshes:  \nTesla: Proprietary full self driving system:: Macintoshes : Proprietary OSes\n\n\\&gt;If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.  \nTesla is boasting about FSD(which is between a very good cruise and a poor self driver). The key difference between waymo and tesla is that tesla is heavily reliant on an AI based system, whereas waymo(which does use AI) is heavily dependent on Geolocation and real time data.\n\n\\]&gt;The thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nRun away from any person who says that leads are insurmountable. Just look at Intel. Went from being a market leader to being overtaken by near bankrupt competitors(See: AMD)",

There's zero evidence that they are facing problems with scalability. However there has been consistent evidence all year that they have entirely solved it or they have continually gone far in the right direction.

More people using phones for internet than full computers also doesn't help tell you what people use at work.\n\nCloud services are only profitable in the business to business uses. Businesses using google cloud are more likely to be doing so because they have small needs, they're not spending money on network services. Businesses who have core business \"in the cloud\" are using AWS, Microsoft, or IBM. Google can't really tap into that business, because their history of cancelling services means that nobody builds their core business on top of google services. It would be a completely insane thing to do.\n\nAutonomous driving is snake oil, because they're using trained AI. That's a dead end for this use case, because what happens when the Dept. of Transportation tells you, \"In XYZ situation, you need to do A B and C and never L M or N.\" You can't! You don't even know how your software really works with a trained AI. It takes a long time to make small changes.

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

Global foundries failed to develop high end chips after they abandoned their rnd, but they hold a 15% market share(at last check) in markets which use lower grade nodes. Best part is, that they are supposedly going public in 2022.

Most of these companies will start using third party companies, akin to how PC manufacturers used Windows from Microsoft instead of creating their own OS. Initially some will try their hand at the market with their own bespoke solution(like the wild west days of 80's when we had commodores and sinclair spectrums). However after some time their will be a standardization(IBM PC). \n\nAt best I can see Tesla becoming like the Macintoshes:  \nTesla: Proprietary full self driving system:: Macintoshes : Proprietary OSes\n\n\\&gt;If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.  \nTesla is boasting about FSD(which is between a very good cruise and a poor self driver). The key difference between waymo and tesla is that tesla is heavily reliant on an AI based system, whereas waymo(which does use AI) is heavily dependent on Geolocation and real time data.\n\n\\]&gt;The thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up.

So if the AAR% was 4% and you have 1000 placed there, it would have gained about $40 during the year.  \n\nBunds are have recently been returning close to nothing.  Someday that might change but for now they're pretty much a worthless option for you.",

This is no go and it may turn around a bit on buybacks, financial engineering they have a ton of money but it's not on the back of technology.  \n\nAny non boomer working in cloud computing/semi field can tell you INTC is not where you want to put your money.  I believe Pat is more tech inclined but it's a long road and in the mean time you can invest in AMD, TSM, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, APPL etc if you want exposure to semi or cloud computing.  \n\n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/panf65/intel_is_50_bucks_just_saying/ha79m4v/",

        "body": "So I'm actually going to do some market analysis on the direction of the market, and I'd like thoughts and a discussion if possible. Think Socratic discussion. \n\nIn the U.S. I think that the markets are going to soon start a rotation to value, and you can sort of see it starting to occur as bond yields have started to rise, meaning that growth stocks will start to become less attractive relative to value stocks. You've been seeing supply chain and logistics companies like Matson, Maersk, Zim, and other assorted shipping stocks boom during this time period. Commodities stocks in the aluminum sector are poised to outperform, because Guyana just had a coup, and it's a huge exporter of aluminum... Especially to China. With that said, steel and iron ore are the same with exports to China from Australia of iron ore outperforming despite negative relations between these two nations. Both of these types of stocks have outperformed year-to-date, and will continue to do so for the next month or two as forward looking investors look at commentary stating that supply chain, and commodity prices will be elevated well into next week. Finally, home builders have outperformed, and are poised to continue their outperformance due to a massive shortage of homes that will take years to a decade to fix.\n\nI believe in the latter months, in 2022, and heading into 2023 financials will outperform as yields for the 10 year T note rise. First, domestic debit and credit card transaction volume will rise (which bank CEO's , and Visa's CEO, have noted has already started to happen), and this will be followed by international travel spend (Which is very lucrative). This will primarily help Visa, and Mastercard as they have been essentially flat year to date and on a yearly basis. It will also help American Express, and Discover Financial to a lesser extent. Then, credit card balances will grow and forward looking investors will start looking at interest rate hikes by the FED in late 2022-2023, which is the one-two punch that bank stocks will need to see outsize profitability. The strong M&amp;A activity, even in the face of anti-trust scrutiny, is also helping banks. Third, ADP and other benefit provider/payroll companies will do well as payrolls continue to increase, and unemployment continues to go down. The runway is still clear there. Then, there are the mortgage companies where there currently has been a pricing war which should cool sometime in early 2022, allowing for Gain on Sale margins to normalize to roughly 115-185BPS, while the value of their Mortgage servicing rights should increase alongside the yield for the 10YR T notes. Open banking should continue its outperformance, with strong markets in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin and South America, and growing adoption in North America. Companies like Paysafe, PAG, Razer, etcetera should do well in this environment. Finally, the moratorium on school loan payments should cease very soon allowing companies like Navient and Sofi to regain momentum.\n\nI also believe that airlines will start to outperform starting in Q1-Q2 2022, as flight restrictions start falling away, and business travel starts to resume at a more normal tempo. Personally, Delta Airlines and the budget airlines are my preferred ones. Then, there are homebuilders who will continue their outperformance as they have significantly deleveraged and still have long runways for price to earnings growth. I'd expect dividend increases in the latter half of 2022 to reflect this. Third is General Electric under Larry Culp, who's turnaround efforts haven't recently been noticed, but who's conducted strong execution. From their wind turbines, to their jet engines, to their medical division, there is strong growth to be had and I believe we'll see a spurt in the share price to reflect the reality of 2022 and Culp's momentous turn around. I also believe chip fabricators (and chip designers) will outperform. TSM has been relatively flat in the last 3 months, save for a one week burst of over 5% to reflect the fact that they're increasing prices across the board from 10 to 20%. Intel, meanwhile, is building a chip fabrication plant in Ireland which will be entirely dedicated to vehicle chip manufacturing, which I think will be a success. Finally, I believe the used car (autonation), and new car companies such as Ford and GM as well as Volkswagen will outperform in 2022 due to the scarcity of vehicles, compounded by Hurricane Ida's destruction of numerous vehicles (And the risk that other natural disasters destroy even more vehicles).\n\nThe China rally, meanwhile, is unsustainable in the light of the regulatory tempo on the free market principle that China ever so briefly embraced. In light of all these actions, it is my firm belief that  China is, or will, embrace capitalism \"with chinese characteristics.\" The crackdowns are far from over, and I believe the state will go further in the realm of entertainment and video streaming, such as suspending screen time for minors on video streaming platforms (something they already do) to a level consistent to where they've placed video gaming limits to combat the myopia epidemic as well as fan culture. They are also likely to crackdown on drinking establishments, and liquor companies to crack down on the excessive drinking in China, in an attempt to stave off chronic health conditions that could accrue, as well as crack down on companies trying to profiteer off a rapidly aging China. These are just a few sectors where I see potential intervention, but there are likely others. The fact that systematic debt has reached such dizzying levels in China is also worrying, and presents a structural issue. A house of cards, if you will. The fact that JD bought an insignificant sum of shares, means that there is a rally in tech stock shares today is foolish, especially since it's broad based and not tailored means there's no solid shoring. Furthermore, the debt to equity levels for some companies, such as Iqiyi, Evergrande, and other stocks is extremely worrying.\n\nI believe emerging market stocks in Brazil, Mexico, India, the Middle East, and Turkey present better opportunities.",

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

A lot of investors expect AMD to win those contracts when they come up for renewal. Will that happen? Who knows. A lot of US govt. contracts are still being renewed with intel because intel manufacters their chips in the US.\n\nI personally don\u2019t see AMD as over-priced for its potential, but I do believe most of its potential is now priced-in unless a major positive event occurs. I see more downside risk in the event intel makes a breakthrough (although that is highly unlikely for awhile) or a negative event occurs. \n\nRegardless, AMD\u2019s run up is backed by fundamentals and reasonable expectations. There are definitely major downside risks since it has a P/E of almost 40, but it can definitely grow into that P/E if it continues its current trajectory. The biggest problem with AMD is their value isn\u2019t primary driven by its own performance, but the poor performance of its competitor, which makes the investment a bit risky.",
