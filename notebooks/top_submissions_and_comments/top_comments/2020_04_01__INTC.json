You cherry-picked modem, but optane is crushing NAND in performance, they're now the top [silicon photonics](http://www.reddit.com/r/siliconphotonics) supplier.  On the CPU side, they made a bad decision to tie their innovations so closely to the process, then another one when they refused to back-port said innovations for several years, so yeah it looks like they haven't innovated.  I imagine they'll surprise in the next year or two now that the process is un-gummed.\n\n&gt; They are mostly paying/bribing other companies to make worse amd products/not advertise amd products/not carry amd stuff. They've done it in the past and got fined 1 bilion dollars. \n\nUnless you have a more recent allegation, that was 15 years and 3 CEOs ago.

Intel didn't drop because they're losing a small amount of earnings on Apple machines when apple makes the vast majority of their money on iPhones. They dropped after a 23% earnings growth and an estimate beat because of their shaky Q2 guidance. The fact that their even providing Q2 guidance puts them ahead of most other companies.\n\nAMD is coming up behind them, but take a look at their balance financial statements and PE. Intel is a great value buy right now (I don't own any). I'm fine being told I'm wrong, but if you're not doing it with facts and numbers you just being emotional. Intel grew earnings 23%; they're not tanking next year. The question is whether or not you think AMD is going to grow at a rate to justify the premium and why you think Intel is DOA given the facts.",

I think this is okay to do here, because it's not the daily thread. \n\nI'm pretty new to WSB, but I have been trading [badly] for a long time, and I have to say it's felt like treading water. I used to think that unless I was some trust fund baby with 2mil in cash waiting to be invested, it was gonna be the long haul for me.\n\nThen I found WSB, and it was great, but with each gain, there'd be things I couldn't control, or I'd chase the advice of people who didn't really do their DD. I was convinced that with all the bad news we were getting, that stocks would plummet last week, as I learned the hard way something I [and I would imagine, all of us] already knew -- the market doesn't do what it is supposed to, it does what the MMs want it to do, and in the process it takes advantage of the common trader.\n\nBut every once in a while, we get someone like /u/Variation-Separate who not only takes the time to share his secrets, but breaks it down for us, interacts with the community, and even fucking gives us confidence when the market seemingly isn't following the prophecy. He doesn't have to do any of this.\n\nI cannot do what he does as well as he does it. Not yet. But I am thankful for the knowledge I've gained, thankful for the tendies, and thankful for having my faith in good people and challenging corrupt systems resurrected.\n\nMuch love, OP.

I've got a bit riding on this, a lot of which will die if a viable downtrend doesn't start before May and I can't adjust. I don't subscribe to telling people diamond hands, or blindly worshipping VS. We all have to adapt. But I am incredibly appreciative for the time he's put into these posts and educating us.\n\nThat said, we have no idea yet what will actually happen long term. /u/Variation-Separate has put together a really compelling plan. He didn't have to share it. No one has to follow it. But if you, like me, believe that there is validity and truth in his analysis, then do your own DD to embrace that vibe. Yesterday, people were freaking out in the first two hours of intraday when there was no drop, then we plummeted. Today, we flirted with 252 and are at risk of another leg up. If in the last two days, you have decided that this uptrend in the market is enough to call it quits, no one can blame you, but I would argue, maybe VS's posts aren't for you. \n\nI am a bear rn. I'm a bear not just because I have positions that reflect it -- I truly believe we're in a bad spot, and corporations, MMs, the Fed are being really irresponsible right now.  We're being set up for some horrible economic rebuilding in the 2020s. The longer the market waits to reflect this, the more fucked ordinary people are when they do. They don't have our best interests in mind. Deep down, I want us all to get through this and come out on top.\n\nI hope I'm not foolish in thinking that, collectively, we have the tools and minds to figure this out and at least make a little money before things get really bad. It's a difficult time to have conviction, but that's why I'm here in this thread (and no longer checking the dailies). Keep strong, fellow autists.

We all know record unemployment. We all know companies are guiding down. \n\nAnd it\u2019s only going to last a few quarters to a year maybe. We don\u2019t even need a vaccine  but if one comes to life, great.. Hell we don\u2019t even have one for the flu. Shots don\u2019t do much. Last I checked people still die every year from flu season. \n\nMarket is moving as if this is a short term concern. Which is it. Bears want to believe the sky is falling and the world is going to stay on fire for a long time. When that becomes reality the market will price it in. Right now it ain\u2019t a reality. \n\nRight now there\u2019s no new uncertainty (besides oil drama but that\u2019s a different narrative). But there is more $$ in the system. And that cash is to go somewhere. Stocks are a pretty fucking good place for it to go compared to the other shitty options (bonds, gold, oil, sitting in cash , etc)\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to it. Money supply bigger. Money had to be allocated somewhere. The folks who get to play with this $$ are throwing it into the market. The end. You don\u2019t get to decide where it goes. I know some of you think it\u2019s unwise for it to go into stocks lol. \n\nGood luck on telling them they should pull out and be scared lol. I\u2019m sure they wanna listen to redditors who snort zerohedge articles for breakfast.",

He is saying that there is major support point around SPY 248 - if the market lands above 252, it signals an upward movement to 263 which, if broken, means we are going to 270. If we hit 270, we are going to 300. It would be a sharper \"V\" shape recovery. \n\nTomorrow, or even next week, it is possible to do battle at 248 and win and signal a downward movement towards 231. Here we get into a faster free-fall.\n\nIt looks like a bear flag is happening on SPY and it is possible that the movement down is an escalator. If SPY breaks 263, the bear flag is pretty invalid IMO. VIX would mellow and we could reach the goal, but with more sideways trading (drawn out over months).\n\nCorrect or comment, please\n\nEdit: could also be other continuation patterns, but this theory more aligns with a quicker drop, like the bear flag...",

        "body": "GEX: -773m\nDIX: 51.1%\n\nMy interpretation: Market makers are short gamma (GEX is negative), meaning they\u2019ve sold a lot of option contracts. In order to delta hedge those contracts they are having to sell more underlying equities which is putting even more downwards pressure on the market. \n\nGiven that DIX is the second highest print the system has ever seen, even on a -5% day, it\u2019s likely that market makers are being forced to buy to prevent an even greater collapse. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong here but this could get ugly tomorrow.\n\nEdit: looking at December 2018 recovery we saw a large discrepancy between the DIX and GEX. DIX was in the high 40\u2019s and GEX was extremely negative. Negative gamma causes the movement of the market to be accelerated, no matter if it\u2019s up or down. In the 2018 recovery it was an upward movement...today we\u2019re seeing a downwards trend. This is why I think it will continue to trend downwards.",

VS is obviously a nice guy, not just because he shares his thoughts, but mostly because he's willing to answer VERY REPETITIVE UNNECESSARY questions. Here's the thing, when you constantly ask questions and bring doubt into the conversation, a good trader will lose their way. Pressure can also be detrimental, so the high praises and nut licking doesn't help. We all lost a lot of money here, so please chill out so your \"Messiah\" can focus.\n\nOn a brighter note, for those who need some bias to get through the night:\n\n1. SPY closed at 251.83. If I was a MM and I had a dick load of puts headed my way tmmw, knowing the feared resistance line is 252, I'd crank it up to 251.99 just to fuck with you.\n2. Gundlach is shorting.\n3. Goldman sees 200 by mid year.\n4. SPY gap at 230. SPY always fills its gaps.\n\nNote to self: Stop betting against TSLA, you fuckin bafoon!!!!!!",
