The fact that their even providing Q2 guidance puts them ahead of most other companies.\n\nAMD is coming up behind them, but take a look at their balance financial statements and PE. Intel is a great value buy right now (I don't own any). I'm fine being told I'm wrong, but if you're not doing it with facts and numbers you just being emotional.
