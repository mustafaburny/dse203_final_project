        "body": "Rate my portfolio: 28  \n\n\n* MSFT - impressive growth with new CEO and who stops them? Leader in the enterprise area as a cloud-service provider, team communications provider, Office 365, data analysis and BI facilities. Missing AI component, but their business is well diversified and very steady. International exposure.\n* AAPL - until revolution in smartphones (like NeuraLink or any other interface which will remove smartphones at all) very decent business. 5G is coming, a diversified business, large pile of the cash in the pocket. Apple Music is eating Spotify pie, new SE &amp; iPhone 12 should be a best-seller during X-Mas time. International exposure.\n* V - leader in the world of payments, slowly entering the crypto area, and its balance-sheet a bit better than Mastercard. In general both are good choices. The only issue is that for Visa default currency is USD, while for MA - EUR, and USD might be weakier soon.\n* INTC - leader in the retail chipset area, right now controls almost the entire CPU area.\n* NVDA - one of the few \"growth\" stocks here. Its P/E is very high, but low leverage, impressive P/S and amazing return on employed capital is making the day. NVDA is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI industry coming, as well as auto-pilot vehicles.\n* CTXS - ok, there is another growth company. Citrix provides capabilities to work from home without buying dedicated hardware. It means you don't need to buy everyone a corporate laptop to enable them to safely join from home. It is held by top index funds, and attracts a lot of S&amp;P 500 clients, who have high hopes in them.\n* BABA - yes, not the AMZN. BABA right now is extremely undervalued. They look absolutely amazing in every financial aspect, and thanks to extreme digitalisation of Asia, their revenue is growing super fast.\n* NKE - from one hand this is a consumer cyclical company, but from another - very strong brand. Their online shopping presens is huge, as well as exposure to a world market including China. I might assume they will stay around for a while thanks to the new trend of being healthy.\n* ACN - top IT consulting company, basically working for every Fortune 500 company. Right now I see 3 factors they will keep growing. At first, companies needed expertise to migrate to new cloud infrastructure. At seconds, companies will reduce their hiring budget for a while, but will instead hire external resources more intensively. At third, ACN made few acquisitions in the cyber-security area.\n* (Disclaimer: I had worked for EPAM for 5 years and might be biased)  EPAM - one of the faster growing IT services companies in the world. They have a very strong expertise in almost every area, like integration of complex IT solutions, cloud migrations, online shopping, etc. I see them a long term winner of the current setup. Also they start expansion to the Asia market.\n* CIEN - another long-term winner of working from home setup providing hardware configurations for organizing IT servers, clusters, telecommunications, etc.\n* LDOS - one more IT services company but working in the aerospace &amp; defense area with governments. One of the key vendors in the area of COVID-19 tracking facilities and digitalisation of government infrastructure to control COVID-19. Currently holds a portfolio of almost $30 bln agreements.\n* AVGO - another 5G chipset producer winner. Very solid diversified portfolio, good fundamentals.\n* TSM - semiconductor manufacturer, one the largest in the world. Produces chipsets for NVDA, INTC, AVGO, AMD and others. In my opinion, if I bet on the chipset industry it would be weird to not bet on TSM who is located in COVID-19 free area now and also has clients not only from the USA.\n* LRCX - yet another semiconductor company, but this time a leader in the area of automatisation of production lines. They produce solutions which help to automate facilities - the thing most factories will look into to reduce risk of COVID or any other pandemic.\n* MRK - one of the biggest healthcare companies. While everyone is watching Moderna, MRK also participates in the race for COVID-19 vaccine and has a very decent fundamentals and portfolio of products.\n* REGN - innovative bio healthcare company, their financial and earnings are skyrocketing with a huge potential to grow.\n* ROG - Swiss based healthcare company, very strong portfolio and financials\n* BAYN - I am not a super big fan of Bayer, but they are definitely undervalued now due to all PR recent PR issues. Expect to grow 50% in upcoming years, with strong fundamentals. \n* VIAC - one of the most undervalued TV companies right now. Very strong portfolio and strong fundamentals, clean balance sheet. Frankly I spent hours trying to find a reason for such a low price and didn't manage to find any except for \"index fund problem\".  \n* CI - insurance industry under the huge hit due to increasing expenses (people suffer from COVID) and reduced payments (people loosing job and might start cutting their spendings), but Cigna looks like one of the best to survive the storm and has a bright future for a long term. Faitly under-valued strong balance-sheet company.\n* SU - European large cap producer of energy, data and sustainability facilities. \n* BN - Another European large cap company: food producer. They position themselves as a healthy food producer, and COVID should not distract them as much as Americans food producers are. \n* HD - One of rare bets on American consumer spending. Leader in the area of organizing houses in sub-urban zones. With growth of WFH setup, more people expected to migrate to the country-side, so in the long term HD might benefit. Their balance sheet is also very solid.\n* VMC - Basic materials bet. Among all other basic materials companies, VMC looks the best. Also, despite I have high doubts about 1 tln infrastructure package to pass the Congress, VMC would benefit from this idea.\n* BRK-B - no introduction is needed. Buffet underperformed S&amp;P for a long time, but his portfolio is decent, he sits on a large pile of the cash and proper timing of deploying this cash would result in a great return later on. Still pretty safe to add BRK into my portfolio, their long term run looks pretty good.\n\nAlso I am considering adding 4 strong dividend companies with still promising futures.  \n\n\n* IBM - it might look like a dying mamont, but IBM for years is a leader of patents. They year by year increase their presence in cloud infrastructure, AI, robotics and other topics. With new CEO targets growth, IBM has a pretty decent future for the moment with a diversified portfolio of technologies &amp; patents. High hopes on IBM AI technologies. As well, IBM pays very huge dividends, so why not hold them for some time?\n* T - the same story but in another segment. Might benefit from 5G, has a diversified portfolio, enters the \"stream wars\" area and pays a huge dividend. As a diversification for stocks who pays small dividends but grow in market cap, good choice. \n* STX - Another high dividend representative from the hardware storage business. This area will stay around for a while, and STX is healthier than their competitors, look like a safe bet for a long term holding. \n* ABBV - And the last high-dividend company from the healthcare segment. There is a lot of analysis of ABBV around, so no reason to repeat it all.\n\nAnd 1 ETF:  \n\n\n* EXV6 - since I am EU resident, I need to invest into UCITS, and this is a basic materials ETF mainly RIO, BHP, GLEN, AAL. This segment supports all manufacturing around the world, why should they have gone?\n\nThat's basically it. I am still playing around numbers to calculate the potential risk of this portfolio and define the proper % allocation of stocks, but what's your thoughts on the companies from the list?",
