Or do you mean making living organisms with computers?  \n\n\nOh thats cool I didn't know DNA data storage was computational biology but I guess it makes sense when I think about the name haha. I agree with you on that, super interesting partnership that you're prob familiar but [just in case](https://investors.twistbioscience.com/news-releases/news-release-details/twist-bioscience-illumina-and-western-digital-form-alliance)...  I love TWST, wanted to put it here but there was the $50 rule, they seem like Levi Strauss of genomics industry but with visibility to see what mines have a decent chance of striking gold then just [partnering with them for a % of the gold](https://investors.twistbioscience.com/news-releases/news-release-details/takeda-partners-twist-bioscience-expand-biologics-discovery). They're my highest weighted genomics position at 3.5% currently.",
