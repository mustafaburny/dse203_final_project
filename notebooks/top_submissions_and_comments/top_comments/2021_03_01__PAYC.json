I look at the next industry that no one is talking about. \n\nHuman capital is further along but still has so much realistic growth ahead of it; workday/paycom/etc. are really only the beginning of the possibilities and technologicification of the workplace and employment; they\u2019re just trying to do it decently; the next iteration will be explosive and creative building off that. HR tech is like 50% built. \n\nAll that said about HR, Ed tech has 99% of an industry to grow. The actual industry itself has barely even begun to evolve. E-learning now officially legit forever\u2014everyone from k-12 to higher education will be looking to not just survive but find long term solutions to thrive, impress and engage students and in higher Ed, highly paying students with high expectations. Who will land DOE contracts? Who will the major players be? All markets are open for taking. Good move Zoom could make would be Ed services expansion. Connect content providers to educational institutions. Students and teachers hate most of the software and platforms they\u2019re using because they\u2019re super old but accepted, or are ad hoc with lots of issues. \n\nOwn Adex, eac, more.",

        "body": "Thanks bro, same happened for Paycom last year lol. My January Stock purchases seem to never go well lol xD. I had to wait a whole year for it to break even, but that was cause of coronavirus which impacted the whole marker. My biggest worry is this whole inflation and rising rates deal. Because the NASDAQ has been getting hammered lately so now instead of impacting the whole market it seems to be impacting only growth stocks. And the coronavirus you knew it was going to end at some point, but the inflation deal idk what will happen. How do you feel about the inflation and NASDAQ going down though, and has it scared you out of the stock??",
