The growth potential is huge regarding 5G, AR/VR, autonomous driving ... etc. It\u2019s been on a downhill since the earning\u2019s report, but I think this stock deserves at least a double of current price.",

Better tech than Intel but cheaper than NVIDIA, no fabrication operations because they were losing money on it a few years ago so sold it off to focus on design, which I think gives them more flexibility to adapt to capitalize on any investments that could be coming from the public sector, and they probably aren\u2019t bleeding money from production constraints like the others. Probably the best CEO in the space as well. \n\nI also like Qualcomm a lot for similar reasons, but also because they\u2019re positioned to win big in 5G and will probably do well in the IoT space as well. Much more mature company too with a nice dividend ($.65/share).",

They have a great chart that breaks down company, industry, estimated earnings per share in a 12 month period, the trailing EPS, sales growth (if applicable), speculative price target and a dividend yield. This is a very thorough list and has companies such as many major banks, Cummins (CMI), Qualcomm (QCOM), World Fuel Services (INT) to name a few (there are many more). My personal choice would be KemPharm Inc (KMPH).
