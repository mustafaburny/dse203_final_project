Which is exactly what's happening. I would not want them to jack up the price to make some short term revenue, and then abandon all their loyal customers who right now, could easily switch to AMD and get similar performance.\n\nA lot of other companies are in similar positions, TSM comes to mind.

Also the move to do custom fabs for competitors actually let's them partner with the googles, Amazon's, etc of the world as they desire more customization/specificity for their particular cloud servers.\n\nI think people are giving AMD too much credit considering half their earnings last year was tax provision related (I do tax provisions for public companies for work), buybacks at rieic valuations (they criticized Intel for this but not AMD), inability to increase supply/sales because TSMC is in charge, likely margin pressure due to TSMC passing costs to them for buildouts and better margins supply shortages, refusal to integrate thunderbolt. Businesses are increasingly moving to laptops with a docking station. They want the laptop that lets you hook up to everything via 1 cable.\n\nThat's just my 2 cents.

        "body": "I have had FSELX for a couple months so far. It took a huge dip about a month ago. NVIDIA had a great week last week. Which is the top holding of the fund, but its down again today. It seems like the demand for semiconductors is not going away. The question is what type of factories will be producing them, well known semiconductor producers or fringe ones and will they get government assistance  for production. Schumer wanted to pass some legislation to fund them recently and to my knowledge it didnt go through. Hard to say. Tech stocks are always going to have risk associated with them. For me it would be too ballsy to put all my money in FSELX. Im similar to you. My FSELX is in my retirement. So I have 35% in FSKAX for total market, 20% in FZILX for foriegn. About 25% split up between FBGRX and FSELX and then some in bonds and individual stocks. My portfolio is extremely ahgressive for most people but this isnt my primary retirement. My work offers a pension so my ROTH is secondary  so I can stomach more risk if that makes sense",

Is it probable they have a pullback in that time, I'd say more than likely. I agree with you that FCF fluctuates, that's why I take the previous 5yrs for an avg to come up with my figure. The #s in my 1st message are an average based off the past 5yrs. If you took INTC alone in 2020, then their PFCF is 12x. AMD would be 97x. NVDA would be 85x. They are both awesome companies, but I'm saying what they are doing now does not justify their stock price right now. I don't want to pay x amount for a stock now for what they will do in 20yrs.
