If intel does well somehow, then amd moves up in sympathy because it shares the same space.  Just like how nvda and amd seems to move together too.  \n\nI tried to use dicks sporting goods against big5 but it ended up that my puts offset my gains on big5, turns out being in the same space affects other stock prices.  \n\nAlso interesting to note that when intel sold off their nand drive to sk hynix Western digital popped",

There have been no insider sales of the stock.\n3. Kioxia(previously Toshiba Memory) is a very close comp that is projecting a $24b marker cap vs the 11-12b of WDC.  These are direct comps.\n4. There are no dividend payouts to take out $2.00 a year off of the stock price\n5. The recent division of business units makes WDC as a whole, or either unit a takeover target\n\nObviously this thing has a lot of room to run, and being featured on Amazon Prime Day has massive upside potential in terms of exposure.  WD Black is currently the best in market for gamers and the sales of PS5 and other consoles at year end will flow into WDC for this reason as well.",

I didn't follow them to wherever they moved sadly.\n\nYou can still pick up some good information from forums such as [LTT](https://linustechtips.com/main/) and [HWBot](https://community.hwbot.org/) but it's snippets here and there, not a lot of dense technical information about what's really going on.\n\nSome tech companies like Huawei and Western digital have their own forums, but traffic tends to be a little slow. You can occasionally get a good nugget from them though in instances such as the support board blowing up after the release of a product or somebody posting something along the lines of \"Is anyone even buying this hot garbage? LoL\"\n\nRemember that people love to complain though, if there isn't a serious amount of agreeing opinions it's not a problem.\n\nHonestly I just spend too much time on the internet and end up coming across information that I'll never put to practical use.",

There have been no insider sales of the stock.\n3. Kioxia(previously Toshiba Memory) is a very close comp that is projecting a $24b marker cap vs the 11-12b of WDC.  These are direct comps.\n4. There are no dividend payouts to take out $2.00 a year off of the stock price\n5. The recent division of business units makes WDC as a whole, or either unit a takeover target\n\nObviously this thing has a lot of room to run, and being featured on Amazon Prime Day has massive upside potential in terms of exposure.  WD Black is currently the best in market for gamers and the sales of PS5 and other consoles at year end will flow into WDC for this reason as well.",

For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

Before I list out the portfolio I am considering, please see my answers to the relevant information questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How old are you? **23**\n* Are you employed/making income? How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out.

Social search is the future and I now see the genius advertising potential of the Pinterest platform; I see them stealing advertising dollars away from Google and growing much better than Google over the next 5 years.",

She tells me she bought 100 shares of TSLA. She is totally risk averse. Prior to buying TSLA she was in full boomer stock mode. PCG, F, GE, UPS and the majority in conservative Vanguard funds. I swear to God nothing gets her going more than a dividend. My first thought when she told me she just dropped nearly 50k on TSLA was holy shit I need to get some fucking puts on that right now. Needless to say it was August 31st. Didn't but the puts...she gets pissed anytime I even mention TSLA. I bought some in the mid 300s. Told her I was cost averaging down on it for us. We have separate finances for most things. Told her about the money I lost on MSFT and AAPL options to make her feel better. Didn't work. Said that it made her more pissed. \n\nTLDR wife holding TSLA bags, gets pissed everytime TSLA comes up.",

Looking at ITOT (ishares total market etf) about 19% or so is in Microsoft, Apple, Amazon Facebook and Google, so these would definitely help elevate the total index value.\n\nEdit: ITOT also only fell about 1% friday when most of those stocks were down about 5%, so there is a buffer there.",

IBM was a computer company.\n\nThe brilliance of MSFT was in - and this seems weird today - realizing that a company could make money just selling software. A ton of money. More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",

Just look at the fact that this week travel stocks got fucked like tech stocks. That\u2019s not because of corona. Apple and amazon after good earnings report got fucked, same for Microsoft. People are limiting exposure to the market as a whole and just waiting to get back in the stock and don\u2019t want to get fucked by the election and corona news, but decided now wasn\u2019t the time. When it is the time, the trend will reverse hard. Apple was down 6% after a good earnings report and amazon was 5.5%.",

It's all about data. Something interesting will emerge, and it will be bought right away. Why do you think these companies have more cash than most countries combined.\n\nSure they can go lower in the short run but what do you think is going to happen a year from now.\n\nDo we think MSFT adding 8-10% rev growth on a 40bn revenue company will be $100 per share? Kingpin Bezos? Daddy Cook? Zuck?\n\nIf big tech was supposed to go down, they should have been broken apart already. It is too late now.
