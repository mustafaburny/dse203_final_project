There have been no insider sales of the stock.\n3. Kioxia(previously Toshiba Memory) is a very close comp that is projecting a $24b marker cap vs the 11-12b of WDC.  These are direct comps.\n4. There are no dividend payouts to take out $2.00 a year off of the stock price\n5. The recent division of business units makes WDC as a whole, or either unit a takeover target\n\nObviously this thing has a lot of room to run, and being featured on Amazon Prime Day has massive upside potential in terms of exposure.  WD Black is currently the best in market for gamers and the sales of PS5 and other consoles at year end will flow into WDC for this reason as well.",

        "body": "Talk with the people who build the servers.\n\nI'd tell you where they haunt, but they migrated because the forums got sold to an ad company that was spamming everyone with banners for generic Canadian Cialis and penis enlargement treatments, then paying to throw everything into the top results of google searches for tech support questions. I didn't follow them to wherever they moved sadly.\n\nYou can still pick up some good information from forums such as [LTT](https://linustechtips.com/main/) and [HWBot](https://community.hwbot.org/) but it's snippets here and there, not a lot of dense technical information about what's really going on.\n\nSome tech companies like Huawei and Western digital have their own forums, but traffic tends to be a little slow. You can occasionally get a good nugget from them though in instances such as the support board blowing up after the release of a product or somebody posting something along the lines of \"Is anyone even buying this hot garbage? LoL\"\n\nRemember that people love to complain though, if there isn't a serious amount of agreeing opinions it's not a problem.\n\nHonestly I just spend too much time on the internet and end up coming across information that I'll never put to practical use.",
