I am getting ready for a pullback that allows me to add to existing positions and start some new ones.\n\nPSTG is the position I started yesterday.  It has been holding up and I am looking to add more to the position if we get a pullback.  They are well-positioned to win storage deals away from Dell and NetApp. \n\nHP is still not breaking out.  I am not going to give up yet as I see more investment in this area and I want to hear what they have to say during the upcoming earnings call.\n\nSBUX has bounced between 72 and 75 for while now.  I have decided not to trade and stick it out in the name.  \n\nAZN has come back and my calls are in the green.  I was hoping it would hold 60 where it was trading in pre-market. Not that lucky so I am still holding.\n\nMAR has been holding up well and I am not adding or selling.",

Voo, VTI, VT. if you dont have enough to buy whole shares of those robin hood offers fractional shares but I have never gone that route so I honestly don't know how good of a thing they are. Other then that do a lot of research. Read a lot. Dont buy and think your going to sell again any time soon. Ive only been actually investing for about 2 years. In that time I have only sold 1 position because I no longer liked the investment long term. Everything else i have bought with the intent to hold for 10+ years baring something extremely unforeseen. I buy a lot of blue chips and companies im somewhat familiar with as well. I work in tech so I own cisco, palo alto, fortinet, netapp because I work with there products a lot. But i probably only own about 30 individual companies and over 50% of my portfolio is in those index funds i mentioned earlier. Is this winning advice, I have no idea but its been working for me.",
