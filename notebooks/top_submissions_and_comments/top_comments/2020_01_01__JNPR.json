The fact that is irrational is simply an opinion and maybe you are right that, \"it Truly is Different This Time.\"  I really wasn't happy when JNPR went to the teens as I had bought in at $63, $84 and $112, but that was a long time ago.  I wasn't happy when ADAP went bankrupt as I had paid in the $40's.  I wasn't real happy when Exodus went BK as I had bought in in the $60's.   But back then I was young and stupid and really thought it was \"Different This Time.\"  We ignored debt and little to no earnings because Growth was going to carry us all to the Moon.",

        "body": "I am more intrigued by forced shift in sourcing for UK importers' actual stuff than in securities of any sort. I think the real opportunities are tariff arbitrage. I've give a micro example.\n\nThe gin industry is booming right now. Quite a few small brands starting and consumption trending upward. However, the majority of the botanical ingredients in gin are sourced from EU states. Depending on how the deal is structured, those botanicals could become no longer cost competitive pretty soon. \n\nUK gin producers could see their primary inputs increase in price literally overnight. That creates an opportunity for anyone with access to, for example, juniper berries, in a nation with whom UK has low tariffs for that particular commodity.\n\nThere are tons of pecialty commodities falling under this general heading of \"imminent potential tariff arbitrage opportunity\". The trick is:\n   1. You probably need to hire a customs broker to identify them\n  2. we won't know what they are until the end of this year, ir until a deal is signed, whichever comes first.\n   3. You need a relationship with a real counterparty. Can't trade juniper berries in your fidelity account.",
