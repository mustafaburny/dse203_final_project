Moderna is owned by George Soros, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and several other super rich liberals. I'm afraid they're going to put some microchip tracking device in the vaccine. Pfizer was first one out with a vaccine, which is supposed to be 97% effective. They are a good reputable company\"\n\nSo if you are relying on science to choose your investments, you'll need to consider the Facebook misinformation angle.

The immune system sees this foreign protein and declares war on it.  The person feels hungover and sick and feverish as the immune system is amped up.  They give two shots to really get this process going.  After the initial battles against this protein, antibodies are created which circulate in the blood, so when you get exposed to Rona, the antibodies bind to the Rona inactivating its infectivity or something.  How long the antibodies last or your body remembers how to make them is unknown.  But one week after the second dose like 10x less people caught Cerveza sickness than the ones that got fake shot.  Questions for me are what happens if your body has other proteins that get targeted by your immune system so you get some autoimmune disease or cancer or for real autistic or something. Also, does this process kill the cells that take up mRNA and cause problems.  How long do the cells with mRNA have the mRNA and what else can it do?  Conspiracy theorists also believe an undisclosed microchip will be in the shot.  etc etc etc",

They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

If you look at Big Commerce's or Lemonade's financials, they aren't great.  And some of the SPAC mergers are pretty suspect especially when compared to how much they run up around merger time.  \n\nI agree that there was more vaporware back in the late 90s, BUT, the fervor, the blind investing into companies without knowing anything about their financials, the double or triple digit gains within a single year.... remind you of any recent times?",

        "body": "What kind of price-to-sales multiple will GME have in the next 2 years? Currently at 0.13\n\nIf GME successfully grows their e-commerce business to \\~50% with same day delivery (currently being rolled out now), the products they sell could reasonably provide a 1x sales multiple. (Compare other e-commerce P/S - OSTK 1.2   CHWY 4.2)\n\n4 new revenue streams for GME will include: Monetization of customer data, digital downstream revenue from MSFT Xbox platform, online advertising revenue, and PC hardware sales. All 4 offer good margins.\n\nAll of these new revenue streams and e-commerce growth represents a very big change (almost 'tech' like) than that of the former business model of purely B&amp;M with mostly just gaming product inventory. The real big money to influence a major share price rise is in the customer data. If leveraged properly, GME has a true 'tech' side to their business model.\n\nGME looks to grow revenue YoY, estimating 6-7bn for 2021, and 8bn+ in 2022 with a P/S of 1, we are looking at a 8bn market cap in 2022. Share price of $120+\n\nYou could compare with BestBuy, which has a P/S of 0.8. Give GME the 0.8 P/S and they reach a market cap of 6.4bn (assuming 8bn yearly revenue in 2022). That's $99/share and an 800% increase from current market value.\n\nMost investors are not aware of what the company has to offer, hence why the reference Blockbuster so much. There is a reason we have seen larger stakes being taken by bigger players. Just last week we saw some more big boys jumping in. Wells Fargo, Jefferies, Hussman all taking positions. When GME shorts flip to longs (will happen eventually) they will drive up the share price.\n\nIn the next 2 years, if the street decides to view GME as a e-commerce/digital data business within the gaming/PC industry, valuations can run high and P/S multiples could run even higher.",

Why nobody mentions this is beyond me, arguably one of the most important high margin revenue streams GME can benefit from.\n\n**E-Commerce omnichannel business model** that offers same day delivery and is continually improving. This is the \"beat AMZN' part of the business model.\n\n**PC hardware sales** ($40bn/yr and growing TAM)\n\n**Online ad revenue.** From website + App\n\n**E-sports experiences**. Currently partnering with gaming pros and streaming on twitch. Will **build brand recognition**.\n\nMassive **reduction in SG&amp;A.**\n\n**SKU optimization**. Better inventory and inventory turnover.\n\n'Digital everything' is not as strong of a bear thesis as it was 2 years ago. Especially considering GME has the MSFT partnership to share digital revenue.\n\nGaming industry TAM is growing YoY.\n\nCompetent management team. Finally.\n\nBigger firms/institutions are taking a position in GME. So far as of end of Q3 we have had new or increased stakes from: Senvent, State Street, Russell, Wells Fargo, Hussman and finally Jefferies taking an sizeable position in Call options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a $700MM company. This is not the old GME where you simply buy and trade in videogames. It is very undervalued at current market price of $11\n\nI think GME has potential to be valued at $2-3bn valuation within 12 months ($32-47)\n\nWhen it finally appreciates in value after a few good quarterly earnings then there should be a slow squeeze. You have to be patient with this play. It will most likely take 6+ months until we see good Q4 and Q1 earnings to convince shorts to capitulate.",

Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest is a success and can be big for them, but the VR market is still very niche. \n\nAmazon has a ton of upsides, especially during and even after COVID, where everything will move towards online, everyone already knew. Despite how big Amazon is, eCommerce is still only 16% of retail sale, so there\u2019s still room. Cloud is booming, and AWS is still king.\n\nI am the most bullish on MSFT. They have a good mix of the old stuff that have been steadily making them money for decades and are still here to stay (Windows, Office/365, .NET, SQL, Xbox) and the cool new stuff that has a lot of growth potential (Azure/Cloud, Surface, GamePass, Teams). On top of that, their recent acquisitions have been doing a lot better than the failed ones in the past.

Normally this would be their worst earnings of the console cycle, but the last one had forced store closures.  I'm thinking we see better numbers this quarter. And better than worst will be a surprise.\n\nThat said, I've been saying for months that I expect the stock to drop on EPS posting for Decembers ER, but I expect a huge rally during the call.  They will absolutely talk about console presales and interest.  That itself is pretty bullish.  They're sold out of preorders and will continue to be even after the next batch drops.\n\nThis will also be a great time to talk about other activities.  Is Cohen taking an active roll in the turnaround?  He is still invested, so this is still very feasible, and an official announcement that he is actively involved would be good for at least +2-3 bucks tacked onto the stock price.\n\nTalking about continued increase in website sales and how people are responding to the massive improvements is also a likely topic.  If they don't bring up the MSFT deal, there will absolutely be questions from investors about it.  If they start forward guidance again, we could see crazy movement on that as well.\n\n\nFinally, and rather amusingly, a lack of console supply is actually bullish for GME.  People start selling used consoles to gamestop starting the day they release.  Why?  I can't fathom a legitimate reason for this, but it happens.  Super demand and no supply means people will pay new console prices for used consoles.  There will be a massive profit margin on these for gamestop, and even better, when the console is an XBox, that console starts generating passive revenue for them as well.",

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

Before I list out the portfolio I am considering, please see my answers to the relevant information questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How old are you? **23**\n* Are you employed/making income? How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out.

We have separate finances for most things. Told her about the money I lost on MSFT and AAPL options to make her feel better. Didn't work. Said that it made her more pissed. \n\nTLDR wife holding TSLA bags, gets pissed everytime TSLA comes up.",

IBM was a computer company.\n\nThe brilliance of MSFT was in - and this seems weird today - realizing that a company could make money just selling software. A ton of money. More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",
