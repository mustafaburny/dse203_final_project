Every other major manufacturer of photolithography equipment either never tried to do EUV, thought it couldn't be done for mass market, or tried to do it but gave up after years of research and billions in R&amp;D.  ASML is the only one that stuck through it and ended up bringing an EUV device to market and are the only ones to have done so.  Literally every new microchip that is around 7nm or smaller uses ASML's EUV equipment.  Even Intel has been talking about giving in and buying ASML's gear to build their next generation chips.  It's actually a major reason why intel fell behind AMD in performance. AMD switched to EUV 2-3 years ago and as a result their chips have been superior to Intel.  Intel has been stuck at the technological wall everyone knew they would hit unless something new came out.  So this isn't a buzzword thing.  ASML is legit and their market cap is over $300B thanks to this.  The question isn't whether ASML is dominating the microchip market...the question is how long it will take for anyone else to even match their EUV machines.

I have then as a small part of my portfolio, but I am considering buying a little more over time. \n\nMy logic is that lithium seems to be one of the major bottlenecks in battery production, and as demand for batteries for things like electric cars, renewable energy, and general household devices increases, it will likely lead to the price of lithium rising over time. \n\nOf course, this is still a bit of a risky play as it can easily be disrupted by new technology, and the higher the price goes, the more money will be put into research for alternatives. It just seems that once the microchip shortage lessens a bit, this will quickly be the new bottleneck for production of electric cars. \n\nSo far, my stake in lithium has been profitable, which is why I am considering it. I am going to do far more research before I invest any significant amount of money here, but does anyone have any insight here?",

It's a person calling out a dam burst and there's no way you can time it or convince enough people in time to prevent it from happening. I myself believe in the things you say and have been expecting a crash for a long time now. None of these highs make sense or look sustainable in the long run. I am greatly concerned that the people do not understand that each subsequent crisis or string of bubbles is adding more dimensions to the unpredictable nature of the problem.

Folks, I know you don't want to plow through the SEC filings and nit pick them. But you really have to. Zy had already been borrowing massively from the dubious Perspective Credit Holdings II, **second line** in their s-1. When a company tells you it is in trouble, believe them. They RUSHED to IPO, with no revenue in Covid, because they were going to have to fork over everything to their creditors unless they had a big cash raise. They had a 100 million credit facility on December 31, 2020. They had liens on substantially all their assets when they IPO'd. Perceptive Credit Holdings will own every patent of ZY within days, now. Read your SEC docs, folks. Rely on teams with great lawyers and auditors that provide us with well crafted SEC filings in a timely manner. Edit: I mean it could still be salvageable because they raised about 548Mil in the IPO to service their debt, but the evidence was in the s-1s. And the analysts have only downgraded to hold, left them with a $12 instead of a $54. lol. who knows. My point is related to the SPAC vehicle and the SEC filings. Follow your teams and follow the quality, and please don't compare ZY to $DNA, they really do not match.",

        "body": "Tritium makes charging hardware and is going public under the DCFC ticker symbol (SPAC). I know very little about them.\n\nCHPT - Chargepoint - Their business model relies on the sales of cloud services to partners that provide colorful reports on charger utilization. The partner provides the power and in many cases the maintenance as well. Each charger nets them at least $300/year in revenue, with more if the customer buys a maintenance plan.\n\nEVGo - EVGo builds the infrastructure and pays for the power, and profits based upon how they bill customers. Their primary revenue source is customers using the network. Their prices are a bit high, but they are working on getting really valuable locations.  \n\n\nBLINK - They revenue share with the site hosting the charger and are mostly installing low-reliability chargers at usage prices that make gas look dirt cheap. Without a major change in their business model, I don't see this going far, but the upside is that low information site hosts (often in the hospitality industry) find them appealing.\n\nVOLTA - Advertising based free charging. The way I see it, these guys have figured out a way to buy billboard space in high traffic areas for &lt;$100/month in operational costs. Its a really clever business model. Not sure how sustainable it is, but maybe?\n\nElectrify America &amp; Tesla Superchargers - Automaker subsidiaries, so not independently traded. Probably closest business model-wise to EVGo, though with slightly different pricing strategies.\n\nI've probably left out some other charge equipment manufacturers, but I can't think of them right now.",

        "body": "Yep, at the end of the day: all investments are return mechanisms.\n\nYou lay out money today (principal) to get a return over time.\n\nTherefore, when the 10 year is at 1.2%, it doesn't even make sense to invest in bonds so people have been heavily investing in equities because the current S&amp;P earnings yield is around 3.3% (The S&amp;P PE ratio OP provided does not include Q2 earnings which means the real S&amp;P PE right now I think is between 29-30)\n\nA return of 3.3% with the ability to reinvest itself compared to 1.2% which is stagnant... not a hard decision to make there.\n\nThis is incredibly simplifying things but this is the general view that Buffett and Munger hold with investing. It's all about opportunity cost, and the benchmark they largely compare investments to (and discount future cash flows with) is the risk-free rate of return, which is the 10-year note.\n\n**EDIT:** The kicker of this highly unusual market is that many investors, like Buffett, seek 10% returns. If you see above, the TTM earnings of the S&amp;P is far from 10%, even with expected growth priced into the equation. BUT by pure investing standards, when the S&amp;P TTM earnings yield is over double the return of the 10-year yield... equities are without question the smarter investment. BUT (x2) is a 3.3% yield today (probably 4.5% by January 2022) a return you want to lock yourself in for the long term?.. BUT! (x3) Sitting in cash, or even government bonds, you're guaranteed to lose money with inflation..\n\nTLDR: The market is both objectively cheap and historically expensive. Some people call it a \"logical bubble\". Only time will tell what will happen, but remember the job of the investor is to not get sidetracked by macro factors and instead continue to assess the earning power of companies for the long term.",
