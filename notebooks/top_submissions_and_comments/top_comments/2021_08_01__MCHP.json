Every other major manufacturer of photolithography equipment either never tried to do EUV, thought it couldn't be done for mass market, or tried to do it but gave up after years of research and billions in R&amp;D.  ASML is the only one that stuck through it and ended up bringing an EUV device to market and are the only ones to have done so.  Literally every new microchip that is around 7nm or smaller uses ASML's EUV equipment.  Even Intel has been talking about giving in and buying ASML's gear to build their next generation chips.  It's actually a major reason why intel fell behind AMD in performance. AMD switched to EUV 2-3 years ago and as a result their chips have been superior to Intel.  Intel has been stuck at the technological wall everyone knew they would hit unless something new came out.  So this isn't a buzzword thing.  ASML is legit and their market cap is over $300B thanks to this.  The question isn't whether ASML is dominating the microchip market...the question is how long it will take for anyone else to even match their EUV machines.  Until then, ASML will continue to dominate and grow because if anyone wants to build chips that are any faster than what was coming out about 2-3 years ago, they HAVE to use ASML's EUV machines.",

As it stands right now, AMD will lose out on this sector entirely in the next few years with AAPL using their own hardware.

I have then as a small part of my portfolio, but I am considering buying a little more over time. \n\nMy logic is that lithium seems to be one of the major bottlenecks in battery production, and as demand for batteries for things like electric cars, renewable energy, and general household devices increases, it will likely lead to the price of lithium rising over time. \n\nOf course, this is still a bit of a risky play as it can easily be disrupted by new technology, and the higher the price goes, the more money will be put into research for alternatives. It just seems that once the microchip shortage lessens a bit, this will quickly be the new bottleneck for production of electric cars. \n\nSo far, my stake in lithium has been profitable, which is why I am considering it. I am going to do far more research before I invest any significant amount of money here, but does anyone have any insight here?",

        "body": "&gt; I think you\u2019re also failing to mention one very big hurdle too. If someone steals my credit card, the bank will likely reverse the charge (sorry merchants) and I\u2019ll be issued a new card number. \n\nNo, actually those mechanisms are part of the network, and would not be funded by the merchant side but by the issuer/credit card company.  \n\nIt's because their private network solution promises security, a rapid way of determining if a card has been reported stolen or has other indicators of fraud.  \n\nAnd they didn't do that out of the goodness of their hearts, they did it to avoid/placate regulation.  And it's a responsibility they're actively trying to shed right now.  They're trying to build the business and social case that if the cards and network are \"secure\" then any breaches must be someone else's fault.  Someone else meaning the store, for being dumb enough to accept it.  Or the consumer, for not being careful enough with their card.  It's a huge part of their justification for having a little microchip on the card.\n\n&gt; Similarly, if I lose my card, they just mail me a new one.\n\nNo, they don't.  Their customer, the issuing bank does.  And the choice whether or not to charge you for that is up to the issuing bank, not MA/V.  At the current moment, many do not, because of competition.  But for years prior, they did charge for that, and they certainly could again.\n\nBut you bring up kind of a self defeating argument, because a card itself is rapidly becoming obsolete.  The chip on a card is nothing compared to tech on a phone.  That's why you see cardless payment systems growing.",

Car manufacturers are having a hard time producing cars because of a microchip shortage, the hospital I work at is slow to buy more computers for charting for the same reason.
