        "body": "I agree with most of this. Although, It\u2019s skewed to be negative. Businesses expenses being used as a complaint to counter marketshare gains? JCP will be a good stock option for you, as there business expenses will be zero by end of year. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t ever consider buying ZM, but I want to point out that AMZN wasn\u2019t profitable for several years the company existed. I remember in 2012 it had a P/E over 3500. At around 250 it would that would have been a great investment. \n\nCOST just reported 1.5 billion YOY revenue increase for March. I think that this leans in the direction of it\u2019s not merely e-commerce. \n\nDisney+ (DIS) reported recently it has over 50 million subscribers as of 2 months ago being around 20. \n\nWorking from home requires additional security. You are vastly under playing the business required for this. Home based networks can make confidential information more vulnerable. PAWN and CSCO both stand to benefit from this. (Carbonite mcafee, etc). There is also additional companies that help provide a safe portal (NTAP, CSCO, MSFT) to access the infrastructure. The servers networks need built (INTC, AMD, NVDA) and then stored (DLR). Then maintained (JNPR CSCO). \n\nBeyond al of that Stock market is speculative. I speculate this is a great country and we have great people in this country that will pull through and make it a better place to live. \n\nGood luck to you sir, you are your family stay safe.",
