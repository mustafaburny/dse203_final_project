I remember in 2012 it had a P/E over 3500. At around 250 it would that would have been a great investment. \n\nCOST just reported 1.5 billion YOY revenue increase for March. I think that this leans in the direction of it\u2019s not merely e-commerce. \n\nDisney+ (DIS) reported recently it has over 50 million subscribers as of 2 months ago being around 20. \n\nWorking from home requires additional security. You are vastly under playing the business required for this. Home based networks can make confidential information more vulnerable. PAWN and CSCO both stand to benefit from this. (Carbonite mcafee, etc). There is also additional companies that help provide a safe portal (NTAP, CSCO, MSFT) to access the infrastructure. The servers networks need built (INTC, AMD, NVDA) and then stored (DLR). Then maintained (JNPR CSCO). \n\nBeyond al of that Stock market is speculative. I speculate this is a great country and we have great people in this country that will pull through and make it a better place to live. \n\nGood luck to you sir, you are your family stay safe.",

Now nVidia are very well positioned to take advantage of this but there is no guarantee they will be the only players in this field, in fact I expect the software guys to come and steal their lunch because: \n\n1) Game publishers are rich as fuck and have all the money necessary to create this AI hardware divisions\n2) Epic Games who own Unreal Engine are 49% owned by Tencent and China has been ramping up their own silicon lately, and I can guarantee they will not miss this chance of controlling PC gaming hardware\n\nBasically nVidia's pie will continue to dwindle on the PC gaming and their growth on emergent markets will also be capped pretty soon.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk",
