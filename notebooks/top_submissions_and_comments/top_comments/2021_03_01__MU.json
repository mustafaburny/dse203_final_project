Sure I lost $300 so far which is all I invested but it's cool how this brokerage that I'm into gives me like those betting side free credit which they call margin something. In fact I'm down like $8k so far, but I only lost 300 dollars and rest this brokerage just pays for me. And I learned so much while taking minimum risk.\n\n I think I'mma just reinstall this app with different email and my wife's credit card and try to do another take and try mu luck with wife's $300.",

MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC. Samsung is still in the game and SMIC is trying to catch up. But basically TSM takes the majority of the market. \n\nDisclosure: I have been holding TSM for a couple of years.

Trust me: I\u2019ve been a degenerate gambler since back before (and during) when r/WSB was a.) good and b.) pushing MU like it does GME now and I\u2019m putting my fucking stimulus toward the credit card debt I\u2019ve basically been forced into accruing due to this last shit year as an \u201cessential work\u201d. So fucking \u201cessential\u201d my work can slash my hours to damn near single digits.   \n\nWhat fucking pisses me off the most is seeing this shit posted on subs that are on the one hand claiming \u201cthe media and hedge funds are manipulating stocks\u201d while not realizing that these SAMe fucking media are making these claims.   \n\nGuaranteed we\u2019re going to see the argument: \u201cMost people gambled their stimulus away on Bitcoin and GME!
