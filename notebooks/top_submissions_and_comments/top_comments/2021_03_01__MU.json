        "body": "Last week saw some recovery for the hard hit tech and growth stocks as investors became slightly more comfortable with inflation forecasts, meaning US bond yields tapered off, which raised stock prices *(they essentially have an inverse relationship, as one rises, the other drops).* In addition, the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill was completed by the US govt.\n\nFor some, reduced stock prices provided a buying opportunity, or at least an opportunity to average down the cost of some of the positions.\n\nI don\u2019t expect us to be fully out of the woods yet in terms or recovery, with monday market opening likely to be red all over, as late on friday, bond yields jumped again following low demand for US govt bonds in auction *(when you take into account inflation, the yields on those bonds means you essentially have less money value than what you invested),* however, that should reduce by end of the week.\n\nStill bullish\n\nTaking a step back and Looking at the overall market, this correction was not just healthy, but overdue. While some assets are still overpriced, overall economy recovery provide a good backdrop for further mark growth, at least in the short-medium term. This current period provides an opportunity to *\u201cbuy the dip\u201c* on stocks which have a solid future, but also to reap the gain from some sectors that will see rapid growth over the next year. After all, rising inflation forecasts are due to the fact that most economists see the world economies recovering rapidly from the return of normality from COVID.\n\nWhat will be the recovering sectors?\n\nIn short, think of any the stocks that you have not been able to use or shop from over the last year.\n\n* Airlines &amp; Travel\n* Hospitality\n* Manufacturing\n* Consumer cyclical\n* Events\n* Retail\n\nBuzzing stocks this week\n\nI have created an algorithm that tracks chatter on social media to identify which stocks are trending, by measuring the shift in mentions this week compared to previous week. Meme stocks are purposely filtered out here.\n\nThe full results can be found here: [https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png](https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png)\n\nHere\u2019s my commentary on the most interesting ones in there:\n\n* **3D Systems, ticker: DDD**  \nSince the time of writing and creating this graph, this stock has shot up **%4.2** and up another **%1.5** in pre-market. Down from All-time high from earlier this year, DDD benefitted from analyst upgrades last week, as its price suffered a big tumble. Furthermore, ARK initiated DDD position in ARKQ (Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics) ETF yesterday, putting it in the same basket as TSLA. Expect further gains short-term, and high volatility.\n* **Accsys Technologies, ticker: AXS**  \nThis is a very interesting one, especially long-term. A sustainable wood company that produces high technology, alloy-like wood, planting a tree for every one it chops down. Has recently completed the building of 2 large production factories. I might even cover this on a separate article. ***Note:*** *This company has a small market cap, meaning a low number of shares traded, which means it could take longer than you\u2019d like to buy/sell your shares.*\n* **Vermilion Energy Inc, ticker: VET**  \nSaw a price jump as analysts upgraded its price target last week. Energy companies are rising as demand is forecast to increase over the next few months. Not sure how this one will move in the near-future, one to watch.\n* **Teradyne, ticker: TER**  \nAnother one seeing lots of chatter on the back of ARK positioning. This one is a very exciting prospect to me, and ticks A LOT of boxes, most importantly, very solid finances. The company saw Earnings per share *(total earnings of the company, divided by number of shares, the higher the better)* growth of 64% last year.\n\nSummary\n\nExpect a less wild ride next week than the last few weeks, but still with some turbulence. Reduced prices have created a number of opportunities, which are being picked up by the algorithm.\n\nWhile there is likely still some downside in the market, longer-term I see a rosier picture, especially as economies recover and return to normality. I see now as an opportunity to purchase some opportunities at strategic prices, as well as a time to rotate into some of the recovery stocks, taking some profits from the growth/tech sectors along the way.\n\nWhat are your plans for the week? Let me know in the replies\n\n***None of this is financial advice, please do your own research on any stocks highlighted above.***",

Now, I have a few options on how to buy it:\n\n\\- SIX Swiss Exchange (in CHF), would be the cheapest fees (and no FX), it trades at a volume of \\~180k USD \n\n\\- Amsterdam Euronext (in EUR), low fees (but a bit pricier), trades \\~6.5m USD/day\n\n\\- London LSE (in USD), this would be the priciest, trades \\~10m USD/day in volume\n\n\\- London in GBP, I don't see the upside of trading this\n\nThe differences in commissions at the amounts I invest will be \\~0.5% more expensive in LSE than in SIX, with Amsterdam somewhat halfway.\n\nIn what exchange would you recommend I invest? Should I prioritize minimizing fees (by investing in CHF), or higher volume exchanges? Is there any upside to trading it in USD as it's a US stock ETF? I assume underlying prices are just corrected by FX so there should be no hidden cost there? \n\nThank you",
