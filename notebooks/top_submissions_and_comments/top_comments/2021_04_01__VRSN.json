        "body": "Over/under-valued is supposed to be fundamental. You should keep that separate from your opinion on it.\n\nYou should be psychologically and emotionally able to say, \"I recognize that the stock is currently over-valued, but I think it has a better future than the professionals realize, so I still like it at this price.\"\n\nWhen you're completely honest about your evaluation, you end up with better information about what your opinion actually is. In this case, do you actually have better information about Apple's future than everybody else? Is there some popular idea about Apple that pulls the stock price down, that you think is incorrect? Are they planning to move into some new area of business that you understand, and most people don't realize is important?\n\nFor example, AMD. My day job is firmware engineer. AMD put out a press release earlier this year about two new patents. All the analysis I read, both in the stock market, and on the engineering websites, presumed these are two different, unrelated things, that they just coincidentally talked about on the same day. I disagree; I think they're part of one new future product, that is also related to their Xilinx acquisition, and will bring real advantages to their server products. Right now their server market share is only 10%; the forecasts are that they will increase this to 20% in about 18 months. If they come out with a new product that enhances their competitive position in this area right when they're also already expanding their market share, that could be a huge driver for them and for the stock. So I think the stock is really worth at least 15% more than it can be objectively valued at now. But that doesn't mean it is undervalued now; just that I have a higher price target!\n\nAnother example is if a hedge fund releases research report that bad-mouths a company, and the stock goes down, and you read the report (most people don't even read it, they just sell!) and you think the report doesn't actually accuse them of anything. So then you might reasonably have a different evaluation than others.\n\nAs with all other parts of trading and investing, psychology is the most critical aspect of success. Don't be credulous of your own opinions; and treat your emotions with skepticism. When you love a stock, be nervous about your evaluation. You want to trade on what you rationally think will go up, not what you love.\ud83d\udc7c",

It became almost ritual to hop on the computer every day to deep dive into the Semiconductor Industry and comb through news, data, and rumors. All my gaming buddies thought I was insane, touting within 5-10 years AMD would be the lead fabless chip designer in the industry. I bought $300 worth of stock through $5-17  and held onto it.\n\nI was extremely fucking bullish then, and have only remained as such now. \n\nThey execute their roadmaps flawlessly, maintain product portfolio diversity and scalability, company and team structure is rock solid and lead by experts in underlying fields, they possess numerous probable untapped markets through their full-stock acquisition of Xilinx and tech, maintain monster momentum in revenue and market share gains through industry-shaking partnership deals, have successful leapfrogging RnD teams for unmatched product performance gains annually, partner with fabrication leader TSMC for astounding chip yields and performance for most of its portfolio, etc......\n\nThey've only just begun imo.",
