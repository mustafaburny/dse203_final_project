He is saying that there is major support point around SPY 248 - if the market lands above 252, it signals an upward movement to 263 which, if broken, means we are going to 270. If we hit 270, we are going to 300. It would be a sharper \"V\" shape recovery. \n\nTomorrow, or even next week, it is possible to do battle at 248 and win and signal a downward movement towards 231. Here we get into a faster free-fall.\n\nIt looks like a bear flag is happening on SPY and it is possible that the movement down is an escalator. If SPY breaks 263, the bear flag is pretty invalid IMO. VIX would mellow and we could reach the goal, but with more sideways trading (drawn out over months).\n\nCorrect or comment, please\n\nEdit: could also be other continuation patterns, but this theory more aligns with a quicker drop, like the bear flag...",

Look at SPCE as a prime example that is a piece of shit company that hasnt done anything but sit there for yeeeears but a bit of press and people pumping it caused it to fly all over.  \n\n\nYou look at balance sheet to know how much debt the company has and what kinda cash reserves. You can dig deeper to see what kind of debt short term/longterm and when they mature if you really want to. But usually im just browsing to see if any major variations from q to q that would cause a major hedge to change their rating because ultimately the bigger stocks move on bigger trades a person throwing 10k in wont move price, a person throwing 100 billion in will. So thats really what your lookign to do in the short term is beat the hedges to their own valuation. So not looking to see if its good or bad but is it good or bad compared to last year and when was the last time the major hedges updated their valuation and will they before next quarter after that will it trend that way for awhile or will it reverse right away. Its all guessing but the more information the better you can guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLongterm I just invest in Indexes and stocks I believe in and actually use everyday like V and WM etc.",

This virus is also estimated to have a quite high basic reproduction number (\"R0\" or \"R naught\") of about 5.7 per the CDC's best estimate.

Just wait.\n\nThe stock market cannot continue to climb like this- eventually some retard is going to put two and three together and make five and realize there is nothing of substance holding stock market values up and everything is going to fall. \n\nBased on how easy TrumpyTrump is losing his tempers at his COVID campaign TV Rallies- I'm guessing fairly soon. Remember this same Agent Orange said stock markets would be open by Easter and now it's \"open by May\". No one is buying shit except milk and bread and millions of people are unemployed. There is no \"V\" back to pre-virus times. \n\nAt least hold onto your puts until the next red day- then go back and buy more puts expiring in December 2020 or January 2021. If the US economy opens up by May, round two of Covid is coming June/July with a vengeance. And there is a zero percent chance the US will be ready for round two when it's already getting ass-fucked by round one.",

        "body": "Despite the panic sell off, general sentiment is still greedy as opposed to fearful. I think people do understand that Q2 will take a hit, but I don't think they really have a grasp on what the longer term repercussions are. There's been a lot of talk of V recovery and fast economic snap back, which I think has lulled many into a false sense of confidence. A lot of greed and jumping in, thinking this was a run of the mill overbought correction. There's also probably a lot of new retail investors that don't really know much about the market but saw the fast sell off and think this is a great time to make a fast buck.\n\nI'm not saying a second falling out is a sure thing (though I've bought puts), but I think when you start seeing new money jumping in and getting greedy, that's not indicative of a market that has capitulated and hit a bottom. Usually when people have fully hit the fear button and freak out, that's when you finally reach that oversold bottom. I think when you take the macro into account, factor in some of the issues that were coming up before this crisis took place, I think this new money could get left holding the bag. \n\nIf anything, this crisis might be masking some of the underlying issues that were starting to crop up most of last year. Things weren't all roses, but with this crisis, people are so focused on this (new cases, flattening the curve, etc.) that they've completely lost sight of the long term, which was a highly overbought market that was overdue for a correction. Now you have a market that was overdue for a correction and got hit with a crisis that shut the economy down to a significant degree. Trying to predict when the other shoe drops? Hard to say. The fed isn't going to make that easy. They've completely distorted large portions of the market.",

The greatest outbreak center in the US is slowing down and investors see this. This signals to investors that the virus-curve is flattening and we are on our way to recovery. So in the short term (1-2 months) we will be fine. What remains to be seen are the long term effects the shutdown will have on the economy and business.\n\n \n\nToday, you are seeing investors be more optimistic about the market in the short term w/ a near-term recovery (V-shaped) and are moving money back from Tech into the more traditional sectors which explains why tech is down today but SPY is up bigly. If techs earnings are within the pessimistic expectations of wall street, we will keep mooning.\n\n \n\nTLDR: If you are a bear, you better be fucking hedged.",

I was convinced March 26 was a dead cat bounce, felt confident in the next few days as it started to slide again, but started to consider if I should jump back in at about the same level I sold at, to make sure I wouldn't regret my choice to sell.\n\nNo, I felt the economic data looks too ugly, surely it's going down more before any real recovery... and then it zoomed. Plenty of anxiety and disgust with myself in the past few days and now I have to deal with deciding when to get back in (if I do it now will it drop right back, taking the same losses twice? if I don't is it headed to the moon?)\n\nThis confusion is real. There shouldn't be a v shaped recovery from mass unemployment and a worldwide recession, and one this quick just blows my mind. Maybe it won't hold? I honestly have no clue whatsoever. Right now I have no choice to count this as an expensive life lesson, I was 100% certain it would dive well under 20k for a while, or at absolute best hover at 20k, with 0% chance of things skyrocketing up as the pandemic gets worse and worse. I'll never do anything but hold long term through a bad situation again.\n\nThe anxiety is still with me though, and I don't know how long it'll take for it to wear off. There's no choice to accept what's done is done but it's a tough pill to swallow. I try to look at the positives... I'm still more than double where I was 10 years ago, and would have been happy with that if you told me back then. Other people have far worse problems lately, thank god I'm not struggling to breathe with the virus right now.\n\nBut man, it hurts to know that I caused this for myself.",
