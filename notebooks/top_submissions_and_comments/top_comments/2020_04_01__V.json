EZPZ to fix just buy up the debt and you're good.\n\nRight now? Collapse of supply chains and demand globally. To fix it you have to literally just buy everything people don't. This isn't a trillion dollar problem. This is a 20 trillion dollar problem. Now maybe the fed can do that. But it doesn't change how absolutely insane it is. Also if there is no consequence to the fed literally buying 20 trillion of stuff and keeping it on its balance sheets forever what precludes them from simply buying like that to prevent all slowdowns. At some point demand and simulated demand diverge never to be reconciled again.\n\nWe aren't there yet but a V recovery will probably take us in that direction.",

He is saying that there is major support point around SPY 248 - if the market lands above 252, it signals an upward movement to 263 which, if broken, means we are going to 270. If we hit 270, we are going to 300. It would be a sharper \"V\" shape recovery. \n\nTomorrow, or even next week, it is possible to do battle at 248 and win and signal a downward movement towards 231. Here we get into a faster free-fall.\n\nIt looks like a bear flag is happening on SPY and it is possible that the movement down is an escalator. If SPY breaks 263, the bear flag is pretty invalid IMO. VIX would mellow and we could reach the goal, but with more sideways trading (drawn out over months).\n\nCorrect or comment, please\n\nEdit: could also be other continuation patterns, but this theory more aligns with a quicker drop, like the bear flag...",

Look at SPCE as a prime example that is a piece of shit company that hasnt done anything but sit there for yeeeears but a bit of press and people pumping it caused it to fly all over.  \n\n\nYou look at balance sheet to know how much debt the company has and what kinda cash reserves. You can dig deeper to see what kind of debt short term/longterm and when they mature if you really want to. But usually im just browsing to see if any major variations from q to q that would cause a major hedge to change their rating because ultimately the bigger stocks move on bigger trades a person throwing 10k in wont move price, a person throwing 100 billion in will. So thats really what your lookign to do in the short term is beat the hedges to their own valuation. So not looking to see if its good or bad but is it good or bad compared to last year and when was the last time the major hedges updated their valuation and will they before next quarter after that will it trend that way for awhile or will it reverse right away. Its all guessing but the more information the better you can guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLongterm I just invest in Indexes and stocks I believe in and actually use everyday like V and WM etc.",

This virus is also estimated to have a quite high basic reproduction number (\"R0\" or \"R naught\") of about 5.7 per the CDC's best estimate. That means one infected individual -- without any other intervention or behavioral change -- will infect about 6 people during the course of their illness.\n\nHowever, there is some good news that predicts wearing masks and behavior changes -- e.g. excessive hand washing, distancing -- will significantly reduce the R0. Taleb believes these changes will likely create a convex payoff -- as he likes to say -- which may reduce infection spread by 95%. \n\n [https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1249296844712218624](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1249296844712218624)",

I think people do understand that Q2 will take a hit, but I don't think they really have a grasp on what the longer term repercussions are. There's been a lot of talk of V recovery and fast economic snap back, which I think has lulled many into a false sense of confidence. A lot of greed and jumping in, thinking this was a run of the mill overbought correction. There's also probably a lot of new retail investors that don't really know much about the market but saw the fast sell off and think this is a great time to make a fast buck.\n\nI'm not saying a second falling out is a sure thing (though I've bought puts), but I think when you start seeing new money jumping in and getting greedy, that's not indicative of a market that has capitulated and hit a bottom. Usually when people have fully hit the fear button and freak out, that's when you finally reach that oversold bottom. I think when you take the macro into account, factor in some of the issues that were coming up before this crisis took place, I think this new money could get left holding the bag. \n\nIf anything, this crisis might be masking some of the underlying issues that were starting to crop up most of last year. Things weren't all roses, but with this crisis, people are so focused on this (new cases, flattening the curve, etc.) that they've completely lost sight of the long term, which was a highly overbought market that was overdue for a correction. Now you have a market that was overdue for a correction and got hit with a crisis that shut the economy down to a significant degree. Trying to predict when the other shoe drops? Hard to say. The fed isn't going to make that easy. They've completely distorted large portions of the market.",

[Smithfield closed their largest plant indefinitely this weekend](https://www.wattagnet.com/articles/40043-smithfield-closes-south-dakota-plant-indefinitely) (produces 5% of the US supply), and there are reports that others might follow suit. Also [there have been labor disputes and protests](https://www.wattagnet.com/articles/39893-perdue-farms-employees-strike-over-covid-19-concerns?v=preview) by meat industry employees that might escalate if covid safety conditions aren't improved. If meat actually starts running out I'm predicting big riots as soon as the weather starts to get warmer. People are already restless, which will get worse whenever the sun finally comes out, and it should only take a whiff of a food shortage to turn the country into 1992 Los Angeles.",

If you wouldn't buy a stock at its current price, why would you continue to hold that stock at that price?\n\nnow i'm not saying this is the endtimes for the US economy and stock market. I absolutely believe, fundamentally, that our economy will truly recover and we will hit ATHs again, sooner rather than later. but just like 2008, I think some companies will survive and others will die, and holdings in certain companies aren't worth holding through the uncertainty. If you're a total market index investor (like a lot of us), then absolutely just hold through. Loss is just a cheap time to buy. but holding some specific securities through this is probably more risk than is worth.",

Sunday, Cuomo announced that NYC hospitalizations have been steadily decreasing over the last 14 days and virus deaths hit a one-month low. The greatest outbreak center in the US is slowing down and investors see this. This signals to investors that the virus-curve is flattening and we are on our way to recovery. So in the short term (1-2 months) we will be fine. What remains to be seen are the long term effects the shutdown will have on the economy and business.\n\n \n\nToday, you are seeing investors be more optimistic about the market in the short term w/ a near-term recovery (V-shaped) and are moving money back from Tech into the more traditional sectors which explains why tech is down today but SPY is up bigly. If techs earnings are within the pessimistic expectations of wall street, we will keep mooning.\n\n \n\nTLDR: If you are a bear, you better be fucking hedged.",

They had their chance in 2010, but they just couldn't help themselves. Before Powell, in 2015, this poor woman was at the helm. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YAEHJvNscs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YAEHJvNscs)\n\nOne headline tied to this incident was that she suffered a mini-stroke while the US economy was on \"life support\".\n\nIn 2013 Ben Bernanke lied to congress when he stated that they had \"belts and suspenders\" and would be able to unwind the balance sheet soon enough.\n\n[https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2013/02/ben-bernanke-testimony-we-have-belts-suspenders-to-unwind-balance-sheet-money-morning/](https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2013/02/ben-bernanke-testimony-we-have-belts-suspenders-to-unwind-balance-sheet-money-morning/)\n\nHe then proceeded to issue warning after warning about doing what he said he could. This was after he lied about subprime not being a problem. \n\nDoes anyone really believe that this is temporary? That Powell will be able to wind down? \n\nI doubt it. \n\nSo, what will happen when a nation prints trillions of dollars on a regular basis, to prop up their companies and stock market? \n\nSurely, the stock market will rise, but the nation. Well, in my opinion, these are the death spasms of a failing nation. The last hooray before the baton is passed to the next in line.",
