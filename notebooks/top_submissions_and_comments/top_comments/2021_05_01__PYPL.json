        "body": "Also you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. \n\nThey developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.\n\n It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.\n\nThey fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.\n\nThen for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?\n\n They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. \n\n\n\nThey actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. \n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development\n\nThis is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. \n\nBut like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. \n\n\n\n\nAlso people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. \n\nBasically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. \n\nSo listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.\n\n If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. \n\nI know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",

Given what you owned before try researching Square, Paypal, Coinbase, and Riot.\n\nNow on to your current positions, I will try and give you my DD on them short and long term.\n\n**Short term** *aka wth happened to them*\nIn Q1 of this year the market rotated from tech/growth (your stuff) to re-opening stocks. Don\u2019t panic, you\u2019re in good stuff, you just timed your entry badly. Patience will very likely solve this mistake on its own, if you believe in those holdings now could be a good opportunity to add to them. (But learn more first as I said above) do not panic and switch to re-opening stuff, \u201cchasing the trade\u201d rarely works.\n\n**Long term** *will this be forever?*\nI hold two of the five tickers you mentioned and I plan to have them for years. The market will rotate back into tech / growth it just needs to cool down a bit because it was overbought during the pandemic. How do I know investors will come back to the tech sector (and specifically the stuff ARKK holds?)\n\nWhat else are they gonna do? **not** invest in the future???\n\nI\u2019m also a highly contrarian investor so Wallstreet\u2019s jealousy of Cathy Wood\u2019s gains and criticism of her methods makes me more interested in her fund not less. Try reading some of ARKK\u2019s investor communications you can learn a lot from them.\n\n**final thought** if none of the tickers I suggested make your heart soar and your mind sing, then consider the three following options while you continue learning.\n\n1. Hold cash (yes I know inflation is scary but it doesn\u2019t happen overnight)\n\n2. Dollar cost average into an index fund for the next year+ until you find something more appealing\n\n3.

I think that the discussion on its venture arm is severely overlooked. I have looked into their investments in India and they will come out as bandits when these startups IPO. For example, BABA has invested in some of the biggest startups in India in their respective fields: Fintech (Paytm), e-com (Snapdeal), daily fruits/veggies/groceries (BigBasket), online delivery (Zomato). All these companies are highly successful and will be north of $50B in 5 years as more and more Indians get online. \n\nLast year because of escalation at government level between India and China, Alibaba halted their Indian investments. But I think they have already invested in Paypal, Doordash and Amazon of India and have even used the same playbook in other countries. \n\nIf China FUD was not a thing, Alibaba would make FANG look like boomers when their startup investments come to IPO. But again may be I am missing a piece of the puzzle somewhere. But for me, Alibaba itself is doing great, but I will continue buying since its my best way to gain exposure in upcoming behemoths in developing World.",

Though nowadays, maybe the \u2018too cold\u2019 scenario is preferred.\n\nMore earnings today as well: Hilton Worldwide just came out with a miss. GM, Allstate, and Etsy report later. After the bell we get Uber, Booking Holdings, and PayPal.",

I think they are just smart businessmen that saw an opportunity in Canada which would set them up for success in all other markets. Just feels like a difference between hype (Clov) and solid business fundamentals with not much hype (Well). I also personally won't contribute any more money to the clintons lol",

        "body": "This is... completely incorrect. The OP says nothing about international money movement, which is really all that matters. I work in information technology for a major FINTECH and treasury management corporation. The system used to transfer money internationally is called SWIFT, and was created decades ago. It is very expensive to wire money internationally as it's not a flat rate, but a percentage. Sending multiple millions of dollars can add up to tens of thousands of dollars and isn't fully settled for three days. With Bitcoin, right now, one can send one billion USD for under $50 and have it settled near instantaneously. Read that again. \n\nThere is a reason that Paypal and Square are heavily moving in to the crypto space. It allows them to transfer money internationally exponentially easier and cheaper to serve as a back-end for their money transfer services. \n\nThe reputation of Bitcoin has been damaged by alt-coins. It is correct to be cautious of crypto as a space in general. There are thousands of scam and copy-cat coins. The only one that is trustworthy, proven over a decade, decentralized, and has a large enough market-cap to be useful for corporations is Bitcoin. If publicly traded and SEC-regulated companies are making purchases and moving in to Bitcoin, you can rest assured that it is safe for the consumer.  Don't make that assumption for any other coin, including Eth.\n\nFinally, the other major reason that Bitcoin will continue to move in an exponentially upward trajectory is the adoption by the entire rest of the planet that is not the USA or EU. There's a lot of talk about inflation and the danger of keeping your reserves in fiat money right now. Take whatever concerns you have and multiply that by one-thousand if you live anywhere else in the entire world, such as Turkey, Greece, or Africa, where new adopters are being onboarded at unprecedented rates. Bitcoin is rapidly becoming the new, decentralized, universal and trusted way to store and transfer value for normal people. I work in FINTECH and cryptology  and can tell you that this is only the beginning.",
