I think that the discussion on its venture arm is severely overlooked. I have looked into their investments in India and they will come out as bandits when these startups IPO. For example, BABA has invested in some of the biggest startups in India in their respective fields: Fintech (Paytm), e-com (Snapdeal), daily fruits/veggies/groceries (BigBasket), online delivery (Zomato). All these companies are highly successful and will be north of $50B in 5 years as more and more Indians get online. \n\nLast year because of escalation at government level between India and China, Alibaba halted their Indian investments. But I think they have already invested in Paypal, Doordash and Amazon of India and have even used the same playbook in other countries. \n\nIf China FUD was not a thing, Alibaba would make FANG look like boomers when their startup investments come to IPO. But again may be I am missing a piece of the puzzle somewhere. But for me, Alibaba itself is doing great, but I will continue buying since its my best way to gain exposure in upcoming behemoths in developing World.",

When you see things like Weed Stocks, Gambling Stocks, Vaporware cyrptos, excess financial leverage.\n\nAlso systemic risk is brewing everywhere, especially in the Defi space. That is the new unregulated dark pools, except this time its going to destroy retail when it unravels.  Its amazing that there is zero concern for these giants like paypal, square, becoming quasi banks.\n\nDefinitely going to be a fun movie to watch.\n\nI think the boom/bust cycle could be faster than people anticipate. This morning on CNBC a advisor already had mapped the entire year, a 10% correction 2 months before the new tax plan, and until then the market can go sideways or up. Zero risk apparently.\n\nAs someone who was around and traded in the .com, this bubble is dwarfing .com mania.",

I don't think his companies have no value behind them, in fact I think he will be a major shake up in the current industry model of how a CEO will act and will be viewed in the future, but I don't think that he takes a lot serious anymore. He has more than enough money to retire and pay bills for the next 100 generations of his, if wanted. I would recommend you reading more about Elon Musk's history in general, his role in Paypal and what exactly he did, his affair with Amber Heard while she was with Johnny Depp, his start with Tesla and how it progressed.\n\nNote that this has been done a couple of times in the past, mostly reminds me of Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes, who faked everything until it blew up. She was one of the most promising persons of that time, but imploded into nothing (though with a ton of money). Contrary to that Musk actually has a lot to show, but definitely not the value it currently has on the market. That's good for believers to not fall back to 0.",

I also own PSFE, which is stupidly undervalued.\n\nAnd SQ is only overvalued if you're looking at PE.  On a P/S metric it isn't overvalued at all.  And with a market cap of $94B it still has a lot of room to grow.",
