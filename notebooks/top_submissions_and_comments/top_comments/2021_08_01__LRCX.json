It is not just a rental contract - it is a rent to own short term contract - you may get you property called from you at the assigned strike price...\n\nMy advice is to spend 95% of your research and training time on how to invest in stocks - not all the complex options strategies. In the end - regardless of how you use options - It's picking the right stocks, staying diversified, etc - this is what will help you make $$ in the market...\n\nI have not used TD before - but I have heard very good things about that platform - I would use it...\n\nI run a fund with about 20 stocks in it. I use the wheel strategy to generate income. The wheel is simple - I sell calls on stock I own, and sell puts on stock I want to include in my wheelhouse...\n\nCurrently I have the following in my Fund - MU, PLTR, STLD, C, WFC, AR, BMBL, CSIQ, FSLR, TSLA, ZEUS, LRCX, etc...\n\nHope this helps;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nESP",

The announcement puts significantly more pressure on MSFT to acquire the NED vertical, especially considering the national security risks associated with this critical IP being vital to the $22B US Army IVAS contract. The Department of Defense has conducted a thorough review and I\u2019m sure they have identified that Microsoft not owning the rights to the \u201cMiracle *MicroVision* Display Engine\u201d represents a national security threat. It would make sense for the DoD to put pressure on MSFT to acquire this IP to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.\n\nor\n\nB) Microsoft gave MicroVision the green light to announce the relationship because MSFT is about to announce acquiring the NED vertical.\n\nEither way it is BAFF (*Bullish as F#cking F#ck*).\n\nAlso, MVIS is positioning itself to be a global leader in automotive LiDAR with best-in-class tech in terms of resolution, specs, and scalability. The IAA Mobility Summit in Munich is coming up in September and MicroVision is hosting the DVN Automotive LiDAR Conference and Expo in Frankfurt in November. Soon the whole world will see we have best-in-class automotive LiDAR.\n\nPosition: 13,450 shares at $7.46 avg, will be adding more JAN23 $42 LEAPS tomorrow. \n\nThis is the way.",

TSLA on the other hand could realistically lose 75% of it's value and it might still not be worth it if they can't keep up their ridiculous growth.

It's the net value of the company (i.e., assets - liabilities).

If it did that would mean that people would always be paying more and more for each $ in equity and at some point, valuations would definitively be ridiculous.

I used to have Proctor and Gamble and absolutely love them, but had to pull some money out last week, so they got sacrificed.\n\nWith AAPL and MSFT, I short 2 puts per week (and one covered call).  This week, for example, I shorted:\n\n* 2 MSFT $285 puts @ $1.35\n* 1 MSFT $290 call @ $1.51\n* 2 AAPL $147 August 20 puts @ $2.32\n* 1 AAPL $147 August 20 call @ $2.52\n* For DIS and AXP, because they've been a little more volatile, my options are a bit further away from the stock price and I'm rolling them forward getting about $100 per week in cash on each.\n* 1 WMT $145 call @ $1.20\n* 1 WMT $145 put @ $1.44\n\nIf you add up these numbers (counting only half of Apple), you get a little under $1000.  That's slightly deceiving because remember I have to close the old position in order to roll it forward.  So say Apple is trading at $149 come August 20.  I'm going to have to pay $200 to close it (and the $147 puts will expire as worthless).  So if I get, say, $450 for setting my August 27 options, I really only made $250 on that deal.\n\nBut I have a few other smaller stocks and I do a few vertical spreads.

I don't expect a whole lot of price movement THIS earnings report, I anticipate a much larger move near Q3 ER if Q2 provides confirmation (43m to 44m in rev) that they are on target to hit their revenue projection this year (already raised once). At some point as long as AvePoint executes as planned,  the market will respond. \n\nI don't really see a way that the largest SaaS cloud partner for the world's largest software/cloud company growing at 25% to 30% CAGR continues to trade at 9X when similar companies are at least trading at 30% higher. AvePoint also has a great team,  Jeff Teper, VP at Microsoft on board,  Jason Beal from Palo Alto Networks, Epstein as former CFO of Oracle, Koenig as former head of global technology investment at Goldman Sachs who's first IPO was ironically MSFT. \n\nThey have been executing a parallel M&amp;A plan alongside the SPAC process according to CEO, I expect acquisitions soon and AvePoint to execute as planned. The downside here is limited its already at the low range of valuation with a $23 bull target (VRNS revenue multiple). I feel very confident holding this, there's a ton of far worse holds making zero revenue or going backwards. \n\nAvePoint has zero debt (as of now,  who knows if their M&amp;A strategy changes that)  and is in my opinion a strong play whether the economy remains open or shuts down again. Another shutdown will actually benefit AvePoint,  and as we all know,  most companies are either permanently adopting WFH models to save on real estate costs or moving to a mostly WFH model. With so many working from home with access to sensitive data there going to be far more foreign actors attempting to compromise those systems and gain access which will result in more reliance on companies like AvePoint (Varonis too).",

For example take the book value of Google or Facebook, or even Microsoft. They actually don't own a whole lot of physical assets, a few offices and a bunch of servers , probably some good will from acquisitions what graham doesn't even count\n\nIf you used those methods to value the companies back in 2010 you would assume they are all massively overvalued ; however we know from the massive amounts of money they made and where they are today there were not overvalued back in 2010.\n\nThere are a few pages that are good that sort of go over the mind set of investing but honestly out of a 550 pages maybe the 25 about general mindset are good.",

My idea is to just stop averaging down and watch for a real pull back, or if anything continue DCAing patiently into my positions rather than stubbornly buying all the little dips.\n\nAlso make sure you actually have good stocks and not speculative junk.  I have good stocks and they're still down.  Things will always get back to fundamentals, though.  It's a weird market right now.",

It's a person calling out a dam burst and there's no way you can time it or convince enough people in time to prevent it from happening. I myself believe in the things you say and have been expecting a crash for a long time now. None of these highs make sense or look sustainable in the long run. I am greatly concerned that the people do not understand that each subsequent crisis or string of bubbles is adding more dimensions to the unpredictable nature of the problem.

Folks, I know you don't want to plow through the SEC filings and nit pick them. But you really have to. Zy had already been borrowing massively from the dubious Perspective Credit Holdings II, **second line** in their s-1. When a company tells you it is in trouble, believe them. They RUSHED to IPO, with no revenue in Covid, because they were going to have to fork over everything to their creditors unless they had a big cash raise. They had a 100 million credit facility on December 31, 2020. They had liens on substantially all their assets when they IPO'd. Perceptive Credit Holdings will own every patent of ZY within days, now. Read your SEC docs, folks. Rely on teams with great lawyers and auditors that provide us with well crafted SEC filings in a timely manner. Edit: I mean it could still be salvageable because they raised about 548Mil in the IPO to service their debt, but the evidence was in the s-1s. And the analysts have only downgraded to hold, left them with a $12 instead of a $54. lol. who knows. My point is related to the SPAC vehicle and the SEC filings. Follow your teams and follow the quality, and please don't compare ZY to $DNA, they really do not match.",

The partner provides the power and in many cases the maintenance as well. Each charger nets them at least $300/year in revenue, with more if the customer buys a maintenance plan.\n\nEVGo - EVGo builds the infrastructure and pays for the power, and profits based upon how they bill customers. Their primary revenue source is customers using the network. Their prices are a bit high, but they are working on getting really valuable locations.  \n\n\nBLINK - They revenue share with the site hosting the charger and are mostly installing low-reliability chargers at usage prices that make gas look dirt cheap. Without a major change in their business model, I don't see this going far, but the upside is that low information site hosts (often in the hospitality industry) find them appealing.\n\nVOLTA - Advertising based free charging. The way I see it, these guys have figured out a way to buy billboard space in high traffic areas for &lt;$100/month in operational costs. Its a really clever business model. Not sure how sustainable it is, but maybe?\n\nElectrify America &amp; Tesla Superchargers - Automaker subsidiaries, so not independently traded. Probably closest business model-wise to EVGo, though with slightly different pricing strategies.\n\nI've probably left out some other charge equipment manufacturers, but I can't think of them right now.",

        "body": "Yep, at the end of the day: all investments are return mechanisms.\n\nYou lay out money today (principal) to get a return over time.\n\nTherefore, when the 10 year is at 1.2%, it doesn't even make sense to invest in bonds so people have been heavily investing in equities because the current S&amp;P earnings yield is around 3.3% (The S&amp;P PE ratio OP provided does not include Q2 earnings which means the real S&amp;P PE right now I think is between 29-30)\n\nA return of 3.3% with the ability to reinvest itself compared to 1.2% which is stagnant... not a hard decision to make there.\n\nThis is incredibly simplifying things but this is the general view that Buffett and Munger hold with investing. It's all about opportunity cost, and the benchmark they largely compare investments to (and discount future cash flows with) is the risk-free rate of return, which is the 10-year note.\n\n**EDIT:** The kicker of this highly unusual market is that many investors, like Buffett, seek 10% returns. If you see above, the TTM earnings of the S&amp;P is far from 10%, even with expected growth priced into the equation. BUT by pure investing standards, when the S&amp;P TTM earnings yield is over double the return of the 10-year yield... equities are without question the smarter investment. BUT (x2) is a 3.3% yield today (probably 4.5% by January 2022) a return you want to lock yourself in for the long term?.. BUT! (x3) Sitting in cash, or even government bonds, you're guaranteed to lose money with inflation..\n\nTLDR: The market is both objectively cheap and historically expensive. Some people call it a \"logical bubble\". Only time will tell what will happen, but remember the job of the investor is to not get sidetracked by macro factors and instead continue to assess the earning power of companies for the long term.",
