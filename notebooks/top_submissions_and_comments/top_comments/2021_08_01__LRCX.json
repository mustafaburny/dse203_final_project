But when it goes below 35, it's great for swing trade. \n\nIt's risky buying puts on it with the momentum of AMD and all the semiconductors beating earnings left and right currently, ie klac, lrcx, swks, qcom, amd, asml, txn, mchp, and upcoming amat, adi, qrvo.  Since it swings up 3x, it will render your puts worthless extremely fast.  \n\nOn 3x etfs, you have to be watching the minute chart because it can swing in both directions extremely violently.  It's not really a buy a put / call and forget it kind of ticker.",

But now I'm cautiously optimistic with Gelsinger at the helm. Gelsinger needs to (and I think he is)  identify all the negatives (or current issues they face, including internal bureaucracy) and quickly address the vision on how to rectify these issues. At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction.  Once he does that,  and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal,  he might have the most successful turn around story ever.   I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years.  If successful I'll be rewarded. If not,  another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",
