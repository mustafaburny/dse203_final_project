        "body": "SQ was on a roll last few months, I'm glad I didn't sell, and now it's close to doubling my position. But I truly believe they'll keep growing. They're still minuscule when compared to even to PAYPAL, so I believe there's still plenty of growth left. Same with MC. So, if I was you, I'd buy them, especially if there's a pullback. \n\nI do own SQ, MC, and AMZN strictly because of the growth that is still ahead of them. There's also two growth stocks I'm truly impressed with - PAYC (I do own them) and PAYX - don't own, but tempted to jump on their ride. They're also in growth mode, still tiny compared to industry behemoths like ADP. Personally, I think MC is a good buy at this price, SQ is a bit overbought, AMZN too, but if you're buying to hold them for long period of time it don't matter.",

        "body": "Not necessarily true. You can buy plenty of stocks with the realistic possibility of 10x gains in 5 years where the most likely scenario is simply much more modest gains or, in a realistic worst case scenario, a modest loss before the company is bought out.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia has a realistic chance of 10x gains in 5 years as they have a modestly growing gaming segment, fast growing data center and AI segments, with autonomous vehicles and associated AI/data center growth essentially a coiled spring ready to explode but not yet contributing any meaningful revenue. If that takes off within 3-4 years, they could hit 10x in the 5 year window. But it\u2019s not like they\u2019re just going to fall off the map if it doesn\u2019t. \n\nZoom has a realistic chance of becoming the de facto method for business communication. With a few more 250% YoY growth quarters still to come, they could have a big head start by next year.   \n\nOr look at any one of the high growth enterprise software companies with a smaller market cap. MongoDB, Alteryx, Twilio, PayCom, Okta, CrowdStrike, Datadog, Fastly, etc. If they had a meaningful drop in share price there is a good chance a company like Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Salesforce, or Oracle would just buy them out. So they aren\u2019t going to zero. But if they\u2019re able to keep up growth with only mild declines in growth rate over 5 years, they could reasonably increase revenues by 10-20x in 5 years and with a relatively stable valuation they would also be worth 10x.",

Things have been opening up again, so Q3 earnings will start to confirm whether this really is looking like a \"V-shaped\" recovery or not.\n\nYes, I know people already have their opinions.  I'm just saying that if you want to have actual numbers for a hypothetical V-shaped economic change, you need the upslope of the V and not just the downslope.  People are buying stocks based on what they think the future holds, not the present.

Bitcoin will either continue to rip up exponentially higher than it has previously done all whilst having major corrections thereafter but at the same time being exponentially higher than the previous correction or it will just all go to zero.

Add all this shit together and that\u2019s reason enough for me. \n\nI\u2019m never expecting bitcoin price to be similar to growth stocks. If anything it mimics precious metals pretty closely , the only difference in the huge ass swings and volatility between the two? It\u2019s only a $299 billion market.

For all we know airlines will continue lower. It's pretty certain that airlines will simply be smaller companies for the next 3-5 years.\n* Tech/growth stocks have bounced back quickly in a V shape since the market crash. Are you going to let a few weeks of volatile market data be the deciding factor with regard to a long-term investment decision? What if tech/growth stocks crash next week?\n* Dominion fell on the news of their divestiture to Buffet. This tells me that Buffet had the better end of that deal.\n* If you're only 50% weighted into BRK, you should still have decent diversification if the rest of your portfolio is invested in broad index funds. VTI or VUG would compliment BRK well.",

Just buying more as it went down. \n\nIf they didn't already have some stocks in mind on their watchlist and just ready to buy, I don't know what to say to people when they're panicked.

Looks like your E/V weighting is calculated using book value of equity instead of market value.

This should give you a WACC much closer to 12%, which might bring the intrinsic value per share down around the actual price. \n\nWords, yo. How do they work?",

In a world where everything is built on credit and money is being printed like crazy, it shouldn't be considered crazy to invest in btc as an insurance.\n\nI get a lot of people mention gold. I love and hold quite a bit of precious metals as well, however seeing how the future generations are much more in tune with technology, they may be more inclined to stick with digital currencies instead of gold. My biggest paranoid with gold sometimes is buying fakes.... This issue doesn't really occur with bitcoin as long as you're not buying bitcoin gold or something stupid.\n\nAnother reason why bitcoin may be worthwhile to consider is the market cap at where it's at right now. Currently bitcoins market cap is almost half the size of Tesla. Sure it looks expensive at 13k CAD each but in the grand scheme of things, it could actually be extremely undervalued.\n\nThere are around 44 million millionaires in the world right now and there will only be a fixed cap of 21 million bitcoins. So in reality there isn't enough bitcoins to go around for every millionaire there is. Not to mention much of the original bitcoins have been lost in the early days. \n\nAnother thing I look at is the direction of how governments are treating crypto. PayPal, Goldman Sachs and visa are all looking to hire ethereum developers. The US federal reserve is endorsing an eth-backed alternative to LIBOR. I think these news are a positive tailwind for this asset class.\n\nEdit: corrected number of millionaires",

He's an American citizen who is chairman of an American company and if he wanted to just make money, he could chill out and invest his billion dollars -- which would be a lot easier than creating a lot of fake news in hopes to gain a bit more capital through some shell company. It just doesn't add up for me or seem worth his time. I'd imagine companies doing shady things want to stay on the downlow, and Ideanomics is doing the opposite of that",

And the government can and will seize them, whenever it needs more money to spend. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102\n\nAs to the FUD toward Bitcoin :\n\n1. All tech starts complicated, then the iPhone comes along and fixes it, see Libra and the abject fear from government officials just the suggestion created. The first email providers were clunky as hell, you had to set up these two different servers, one to send, and one to receive, it was the dumbest thing ever, it could never catch on that way, but it was clearly better than snail mail, and once a decent web client abstracted away the hard part, then it took over, and the rest is history.\n\n2. Bitcoin is easy to steal with malware, at least from a software wallet, but Hardware Wallets make this almost impossible, and once you get one, its no longer an issue, unless someone tricks you into sending your Bitcoin to them, but people have been tricked into sending Western Union wires to thieves as long as sending money has been a thing, so its not much more steal-able, with precautions.\n\n3. Proper backups make this very unlikely, but not impossible. Anything can be lost, if its physical. Most people just have money in the bank, and its not going to get lost very easily there, so some care is required to avoid this problem.\n\n4. 3000 + new digital currencies have already been created, and some people have purchased them, but then again, some people bought Venezuelan Bolivars as well, but then they learned not to buy candy wrapper money, and then they stopped. A new digital currency doesn't make Bitcoin worthless, its just another thing people might buy, and then they will learn not to. I could offer you a hunk of Pyrite, but only a fool would buy that instead of gold...\n\n5. Yes, requires these things, but modern smart phones have all three of these things, and most people have one, so its less of a barrier as it appears.\n\n6. This is always possible, but since Bitcoin is a distributed ledger, any successful hack could be rolled back (old copy of who owns what is used), or the coin forked to an unbreakable variant (hard fork upgrade), so its not as catastrophic as it appears.",
