        "body": "SQ was on a roll last few months, I'm glad I didn't sell, and now it's close to doubling my position. But I truly believe they'll keep growing. They're still minuscule when compared to even to PAYPAL, so I believe there's still plenty of growth left. Same with MC. So, if I was you, I'd buy them, especially if there's a pullback. \n\nI do own SQ, MC, and AMZN strictly because of the growth that is still ahead of them. There's also two growth stocks I'm truly impressed with - PAYC (I do own them) and PAYX - don't own, but tempted to jump on their ride. They're also in growth mode, still tiny compared to industry behemoths like ADP. Personally, I think MC is a good buy at this price, SQ is a bit overbought, AMZN too, but if you're buying to hold them for long period of time it don't matter.",

        "body": "Not necessarily true. You can buy plenty of stocks with the realistic possibility of 10x gains in 5 years where the most likely scenario is simply much more modest gains or, in a realistic worst case scenario, a modest loss before the company is bought out.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia has a realistic chance of 10x gains in 5 years as they have a modestly growing gaming segment, fast growing data center and AI segments, with autonomous vehicles and associated AI/data center growth essentially a coiled spring ready to explode but not yet contributing any meaningful revenue. If that takes off within 3-4 years, they could hit 10x in the 5 year window. But it\u2019s not like they\u2019re just going to fall off the map if it doesn\u2019t. \n\nZoom has a realistic chance of becoming the de facto method for business communication. With a few more 250% YoY growth quarters still to come, they could have a big head start by next year.   \n\nOr look at any one of the high growth enterprise software companies with a smaller market cap. MongoDB, Alteryx, Twilio, PayCom, Okta, CrowdStrike, Datadog, Fastly, etc. If they had a meaningful drop in share price there is a good chance a company like Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Salesforce, or Oracle would just buy them out. So they aren\u2019t going to zero. But if they\u2019re able to keep up growth with only mild declines in growth rate over 5 years, they could reasonably increase revenues by 10-20x in 5 years and with a relatively stable valuation they would also be worth 10x.",

Think I have a decent feel for it, although it is still wildly unpredictable at times.\n\nI'm in a discord with some guys who were chasing TSLA all day buying calls and puts, but kept getting stopped out. So I thought about the inverse.\n\nLooking for an EOD play, I decided selling OTM TSLA calls could be a way to collect premium considering how Theta would be aggressively gnawing at them.\n\nFirst sold a TSLA 7/24 1485c first time TSLA came up to 1450, with the hypothesis that TSLA wasn't going to break the high of the day, nor shoot up to 1485.\n\nWhen I saw the double top forming around 2:30 I sold a TSLA 1475c thinking bulls wouldn't be able to push it up any further. And it did stay in a downwards trend for the rest of the day. \n\nNext I sold a 1470c as the stock surged around 3:15 and actually collected larger premium. \n\nI also tack SPY closely and could see that wasn't shooting up so I sold a 1450c pretty late in the trading session because I didn't think it was likely to regain 1450 before closing considering how SPY was moving.\n\nI managed them closely as was ready to buy back the contracts if TSLA started to shoot up, which it is known to do. \n\nI just set the calls to fill at market and they would take quite awhile to fill. Like over a minute, which has never happened to me with Schwab; market orders usually fill right away. \n\nI decided to ride them out the whole way to expiration to collect the full premium. Schwab always pays either night of or next day with expired contracts.\n\nI understand that there is theoretically infinite amount of risk, but thought the chances the calls expiring OTM and collecting the premium outweighed the risk; so I sold the calls.",

        "body": "I'm from Vietnam and our money has little value, 500usd is like average monthly salary here. It's pretty hard to access US stock trading from where I'm from. I got a TDA account, they allow foreign account, then ask a friend of mine in the US to fund it and I send him money over Paypal or Transferwise. My countries doesn't even allow bank wire to fund international investing. \n\n\nI started in Feb with the SPCE crazed, missed TSLA, MSFT due to TDA handling my account creation a bit too long (was my fault at first but their handling was the main problem). Proceed to make big with SPCE in a week, I turn 2k into 6k and it was amazing, that's like a year of salary for an average person here and still being in uni that was a dream for me. I work pretty hard to make money here, part time and trying to open my own company and making 6k in such a short amount of time was crazy. \n\n\nI did spent a few years learning before I was 18 (to be allowed to create an account). Wanted to get in heavy on AMD when they were sub 2 (I study Computer Engineer and love PC so I kinda felt how big Ryzen was) but didn't have the chance. \n\n\nSo after SPCE was around Feb 20 and the market started crashing, lost a lot to sub 1k then I moved to SPY put and made back to 3k.\n\n\nThen lost a bunch on The Witching. Down to 300 and proceed to lose them with put when market shoot back up. Finally some friend decided they wanna give it a go and invest some money with me trading and he'll just watch.\n\nHaving learnt a bunch from my past experience, I managed to turn his 500 into 4000 with pennystock and I get to keep 2000 which was back to even. Took a lot of good risk management and making multiple small smart play.\n\n\nThat was a month ago, now I'm down to 800 but I'm feeling like I'm getting a lot better compares to when I start.\n\n\nMost of the lost was due to lack of day trading with penny stock and some momentum options play gone wrong.\n\n\nMy biggest mistake and biggest gainer was both due to going too big on a position. I'm learning to control that.\n\n\nAnw, that was a long rant, I never really share these things since there's no one around me that I can talk about this. All I hear people say is that I'm gambling, which might seems like it looking at my history but I kinda think it's justified right now due to never before seen volatility.\n\n\nI learnt a lot and feel excited for my trading future but man the losses take their tolls. Probably gonna finish uni next year and try to get my company of the ground while doing small investing. Learning about the market, news and general financial, business helped me a lot with my career I feel.\n\n\nHope this somehow answer your question and good luck to us all. At the end of the day I just want everyone to live more comfortably with their side income and seeing the loss porn might be hilarious but there's always a person behind those loss as well as their family. It's fine if you lose 100k while sitting on millions but man some adults just scares me and I'm grateful to learn from their mistakes.\n\n\nI want to make 25k before the end of next year so I can day trade. Just making 100 usd a day would allow me to fund my company and let my parents retire soon especially during this harsh Covid time. \n\n\nVietnam was free of covid for a month or two but just yesterday we have emergency news that a case popped up and spread.\n\n\nSorry for my long rant, hope you all enjoy your weekend and get those tendies next week. Sorry for my bad English :)",

        "body": "Personally, I find a lot of the alt coins to be quite scammy and doesn't really solve a hair on fire issue (yet). \n\nHowever, bitcoin and to some small extent ethereum to me do serve a purpose. In a world where everything is built on credit and money is being printed like crazy, it shouldn't be considered crazy to invest in btc as an insurance.\n\nI get a lot of people mention gold. I love and hold quite a bit of precious metals as well, however seeing how the future generations are much more in tune with technology, they may be more inclined to stick with digital currencies instead of gold. My biggest paranoid with gold sometimes is buying fakes.... This issue doesn't really occur with bitcoin as long as you're not buying bitcoin gold or something stupid.\n\nAnother reason why bitcoin may be worthwhile to consider is the market cap at where it's at right now. Currently bitcoins market cap is almost half the size of Tesla. Sure it looks expensive at 13k CAD each but in the grand scheme of things, it could actually be extremely undervalued.\n\nThere are around 44 million millionaires in the world right now and there will only be a fixed cap of 21 million bitcoins. So in reality there isn't enough bitcoins to go around for every millionaire there is. Not to mention much of the original bitcoins have been lost in the early days. \n\nAnother thing I look at is the direction of how governments are treating crypto. PayPal, Goldman Sachs and visa are all looking to hire ethereum developers. The US federal reserve is endorsing an eth-backed alternative to LIBOR. I think these news are a positive tailwind for this asset class.\n\nEdit: corrected number of millionaires",

Everyone knew this deadline was approaching and I think PayPal prepared itself for the divorce well by investing heavily in Venmo and new payment verification innovation (the backbone of the coin markets that shall not be named). Venmo is also a huge component of paypal\u2019s portfolio. People are getting hard-on\u2019s for $SQ but I think SQ is in a worse position than PayPal. Venmo has 54 million users to Cash App\u2019s 22 million. SQ has a phenomenal POS system but physical storefronts took a big hit in Q2 which generates that revenue for them. I\u2019m long SQ and PayPal but I\u2019m way more confident in $PYPL. \nEdit: added everything after the first sentence cuz I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how this guy doesn\u2019t seem to realize that Q2 earnings don\u2019t reflect the immediately prior months.",
