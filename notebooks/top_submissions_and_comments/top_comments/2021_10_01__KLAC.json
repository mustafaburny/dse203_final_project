        "body": "Possibly Very Bullish Sectors for the Next 3-12 Months Amid Troubled Times. The examples below are certainly not buy recommendations. Just examples.\n\nBelow is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\nAnyway enjoy the dips now because these are likely to get beefed up as the supply chain &amp; worker shortages unwind\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

Small periods of sideways movement or short term dips are fine, but sustained downward movements, or big moves down with a new resistance level that is made out of titanium steel is a disaster for a wheel.\n\nAs already noted in another reply, SPY isn't ideal for Wheels for pretty much the reason you already said: since SPY is well diversified, on average SPY is less risky and less risk means less reward. The risk premium on SPY is therefore relatively low.\n\nUsually the best Wheel stocks are dividend paying blue chips, like AAPL, MSFT, JNJ, BLK, XOP, etc. Most people can't afford to wheel those stocks, though, so you need to find lower cost stocks that still have solid growth potential in the short term. Not meme stocks, that's a volatility play. You want steady and predictable, not boom or bust.",

Also, Microsoft nor other PC vendors (except for Samsung maybe) are not building their own ARM processors at the moment. Qualcomm is the only player right now and they didn't have great offerings lately, particularly for WoA.

I don't currently own any shares, but I'm rooting for this company longterm because he seems like such a genuinely good natured fellow.\n\nI've daytraded and swing traded the stock a few times. Buying the stock at it's price right now, (around 8 bucks), seems like a screaming steal. You can be conservative with it, and just ride it from $8 to $12. The only real problem is that I do think we're headed for a major correction which is going to see huge megacaps like AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA all down 20 to 25 percent off their all time highs, and what does that mean for a tiny company like HYLN? Could HYLN drop all the way to say 6 bucks a share if the entire market tanks?\n\nThat's really my only hesitation in loading the boat on HYLN. I will say this though, if the market does indeed tank, and HYLN drops to $6, it will be time to buy as many shares as I possibly can stomach.

Steel buildings are great and in a normal market the cost difference between a steel building and a wood building is negligible. What causes steel buildings to be more expensive in even a normal market is the cost of the foundation. You don\u2019t need near the concrete for a pole barn, but you can still get it about 95% as efficient for heating and cooling.

        "body": "So let's get at this for real.  What uses steel, and in particular what uses steel mined and smelted in the US to the exclusion of imported?\n\nNot US residential housing stock.  Most of those units are wood frame construction, with maybe a few cables in the foundation.  \n\nNot US office buildings and malls.  Yes, they require steel to build them, but we have vacancy rates in excess of 50% as everyone has pivoted to work and shop from home.  No one needs a new steel building in this country for the next 5 years.\n\nCars (and other motor vehicles)?  Yes, cars require steel to build, although not the US' best selling vehicle the F-150, that's aluminum chassis and frame now, and many vehicles will follow suit.  Overall the trend will be less steel to make more cars.\n\nSo what the fuck exactly would induce someone to drop 2 bands a ton on steel in 2021 when they could just as easily defer their project to 2023 or not do it at all?\n\nSimple:  a Congressional mandate to spend tax dollars to build infrastructure.  Roadways?  Require steel.  Bridges?  They are made of steel.  Railways and railcars?  Those are pure steel, with a pinch of engineering added for flavor.  New factories?  Steel.  Solar installations?  Steel.  Power transmission lines?  Steel.  The CAT equipment (cranes, dozers, loaders, et c.) to build all this stuff?  Made of steel.\n\nIt pretty much boils down to whether Congress can get their act together.  If they pass Infrastructure Jr, (1.2T), a lot of steel will get bought and used.  If they also somehow put Manikin's balls in a vice and Kyrsten dies of COVID and they get the $3.5T bill passed, steel prices will rocket to the moon and holders will be blessed as the dividends rain down like flakes of slag from a hot-press.\n\nDon't hold your breath.\n\nEDIT:  I see most of your calls are dated Oct 15th.  The trust in Congress runs strong in you, little one.  I'd sooner dip my balls in an industrial grinder.",

        "body": "I think people adding up all of the issues right now and saying it's not a normal economic period are right that it's not a normal economic period, but by those measures, last year wasn't a normal economic period, as well.\n\nInflation: It's actually declining month over month, whereas last October it was increasing. People forget that the inflation metrics they cite are YoY and while inflation is in the zeitgeist now, it was also in place last year.\n\nThe debt ceiling: This is an actual problem, that could create a 2018-style long bleed. I've worried about this, but the government funding deal shows that there is likely a positive outcome. It represents some degree of blinking on the parts of those opposed to raising the debt ceiling, so I think we can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nCOVID: The economic data is much better than last year, and as much as it disappoints people who hoped for a full recovery by now, the soft re-opening from delta is still a relative increase in economic activity that is likely to get better as time goes on. We're in the upswing. Vaccines \\*do\\* work, and that's in the data. It just takes time for the end of a pandemic to happen.\n\nChina and supply issues: These concern me, and I think we're looking at supply issues for 6 months to a year, and this will cause some issues... but we have to remember that this is all due to an increase in overall demand and largely related to issues that specifically affect China. This isn't to say there won't be some problems from this, but we're not talking a 2008 larger systemic issue that is global. There are solutions to these problems that are in-play, and they're happening in an environment of very high demand for goods and services relative to last year... these are ultimately bullish, growth environment factors.\n\nTaxes/Taper/Rate increases: Will create a short term correction when they happen, but they're not unexpected and the impact of tax increases to corporations are not going to really effect growth the way that people think. Macroeconomically and historically, the reality is the opposite of what people think it will be with increased taxes creating more local capital velocity which means more revenue, more profits, and more growth opportunity. Companies are good at finding various ways to create efficiency in pricing, and Jeff Bezos getting some extra taxes won't impact the value of Amazon. The stock taxes proposed, like the estate tax on unrealized gains and the removal of the in-kind ETF tax break will largely have a null effect because the people concerned about them aren't taking into account how much they don't matter or aren't available to consumers. This is a bigger topic, but fears over these taxes are nothingburgers once you introduce human behavior into the mix.\n\nWorker shortage: Adjusted participation has close to returned to normal, with the exception of about a million workers based on the last data and it's probably tightened since then (most people getting higher numbers aren't accounting for historical reduction from baby boomers retiring since 2000 and pandemic mortality) and these forces are due to high demand, an expansion of higher pay work in the country post-pandemic due to supply chain issues, and come with higher overall wages which is an offset to inflation pressure, reducing the likelihood of a crash. This is actually a good signal even if it's a problem for insolvent businesses.\n\nAlmost all of the things people cite as problems are artifacts of positive economic growth.  \n\n\nIn the end, I expect October to be volatile, but I think there's little reason to automatically assume that it will be blood red... it depends on a number of factors. Me? I'm keeping a close eye on things and playing a bit conservative with my portfolio right now, but I'm looking for the broader entry point in the coming month, because I think this could look a lot like last year... but I also think human psychology dictates that we could have a short red period because the fundamentals matter less than people wrongly believing we're in a crash in the short term. In the long term, all of these forces will actually bring people to the market.",

Unless you\u2019re holding for 10+ years no matter what, now is absolutely a good time to sell.",
