Telsa just took delivery of Anode equipment in TX and the timeline for both companies seems to line up. They could have Ford, VW, or whatever as a customer but it doesnt matter. The point is that NMG is on the verge of major revenue very soon. I'm expecting an announcement of who their customer is by Q1 or Q2 but it could be sooner or it could be later.  \n\nPYR - Pyrogenesis - This is a company who's about to break out with an order of magnitudes revenue increase from any one of many verticals such as 1. Their partnership with HPQ Silicon and their battery anode material. 2. The iron ore pelletization industry. 3. They're in the last stages of qualification with a tier1 aerospace manufacturer for their titanium powder. Other things like their waste to energy systems and other things will continue to add revenue gains to their bottom line. \n\nAXU - Alexco Resources -  This is a Canadian Silver mine that just began production, but is still valued as a non-producer, and they are about to report earnings. Silver itself would appear to be on the verge of a price increase due to inflation and other things and silver mines trade at a high beta to the price of Silver, generally they move in price by 2X-5X of whatever Silver does. \n\nDo your DD!",

Silver is a different kind of play. \r\n\r\nI'd split between PYR and NMG. \r\n\r\nWhat if you bet hard on PYR because it's got a list of massive things that can make it pop any day, but NMG announces who their big EV customer is and it jumps to something like $30-$50? Then what? \r\n\r\nWhy couldn't it do at least that? Look at what PLL did when they announced. That's Piedmont Lithium. You never know how the market will react, it could take longer. \r\n\r\nLithium is 1% of the Cathode in a Li-Ion battery, Graphite is typically over 95% of the Anode. \r\n\r\nJust like PYR, NMG has some massive things about to happen.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, you could peel off maybe 25% and give birth to a Fidelity account. With it you can access the OTC. That\u2019s a different kind of wild, be careful and stick to the fundamentals. Do deep DD, YouTube is your friend. HPQ Silicon's ticker is HPQFF. They've figured out how to efficiently and responsibly process and form Silicon in a way where it can be used in the Anode and displace up to 20% of the Graphite. HPQ's partner is PYR. Silicon adds a lot of performance to a battery. \r\n\r\nTesla just received their anode equipment at Texas. If Tesla is the customer of NMG and HPQFF, with how quickly they move, its hard to know when we'll know something. It could be tomorrow or it could be months, perhaps quarters. Both NMG and HPQ have signed NDAs with major battery/auto manufacturer(s). At minimum they\u2019ll tell us when every last detail is finalized or when there\u2019s a material change to the business and they\u2019re required to disclose.\r\n\r\nI'm eager to find out who it is... it might not be Tesla, it could be Ford, VW, or someone else. Maybe it\u2019s more than one? No one knows. \r\n\nDiversity is really important. It's better to have more than one moon shot. \n\nHave you looked at Dogecoin? Things go up when there's more buyers. Usually there's more buyers during peak media. When SpaceX launches the DOGE-1 mission in 1Q22 and sends a satellite in orbit around the moon, what do you think the media cycle will be like around Dogecoin?",

This can be fixed by spending a bigger share of the profits on capex and buying a lot of these advanced EUV machines themselves and that is exactly what they are going to do and what pissed of some investors. Intel announced they will be the first to receive the next iteration of even more advanced EUV machines soon.\n\nBy being a foundry Intel can use all their IP for their customers. This will give them an advantage over TSMC and Samson for a sizable chunk of the market. Simply because they can throw in this IP so customers can design product only intel can make. Their packaging techniques are not the same as those of TSMC and at least a sizable share of the market will benefit from these. I'm not going to claim they will steamroll TSMC but they will be able to take market share. It's a new market. It will be the same as AMD doubling their data center business by taking a few percentages of market share from Intel. In the foundry business TSMC will be like Intel and Intel will be like AMD.\n\nAs a foundry you can make whatever the client designs. Intel clearly stated they will go for a mix and match strategy where clients can combine external IP like ARM with Intel IP like packaging or networking. X86 will always have a place but Intel clearly accepted that it's not only x86 anymore and they are adapting.",

With dividend and buybacks combined they return aboud 7% per year if their revenue of profits wouldn't increase which they almost certainly will.\n\nSamsung makes most of it's money from it's foundy business and retail electronics. If it's foundry business' orders decrease they can fill up the remaining space with their own needs. (same as intel)\n\nTsmc is the real leader in the industry with customers having reserved all capacity for years ahead.\n\nFor price targets i would recomend [this DFCF tool](https://tracktak.com/dashboard).

        "body": "If you don't understand the risks, you don't understand the company. I'm not getting  spoon fed my opinions from online articles, I'm a software developer intimately familiar with Intels problems over the last few years.\n\nWe can ignore that they've fallen so far behind in process, and assume new CEO PatG is going to fix that by throwing tens of billions in new capex at it. So higher PP&amp;E costs but hey, they have the cash flow to support it. \n\nAnd we can ignore that TSMC and others are investing even higher amounts in maintaining their process lead, including in US based (Arizona) manufacturing.\n\nLastly lets ignore that AMD has been eating market share over the last decade and is positioned to maintain or grow x86 market share in the future.\n\nBut it's hard to ignore that Intel is losing probably their best PC customer, Apple. Apple never bought from AMD, always Intel, and always Intels higher end CPUs where it makes it's best margins. Last year Apple was likely close to 10% of Intels PC CPU business (not counting chromebooks which buy super cheap shitty CPUs).\n\nThis is only starting to show up in Intels financials. Apple moved their lowest end Macbooks and Mini to Apple Silicon in December of last year, just moved low end iMacs this summer, and now is moving all high end MacBooks to Apple Silicon right now. High end iMacs and Mac Pros get their Apple Silicon by mid next year and it's over, Intel permanently loses over 20M higher end CPU sales a year.\n\nBut worse is that Apple's M1x is not only faster than the fastest of Intel's new Alder Lake CPUs, its offering that performance at  roughly 1/3 the power draw and less than half the cost. Each of those new high end MacBook Pros would have had $500 Alder Lake CPUs (actually they would have been delayed till 2022 till Intel had volume) but TSMC is building Apple's M1x Pro and Max for $150-$250.\n\nYou might say, who cares? Apple was only 8% of PC market by units, even though those were all high end. Microsoft cares. Dell cares. Lenova cares. Now they have to go toe to toe with Apple MBPs that aren't just as fast or faster at the same price points, they are offering double the battery life, and run super cool.\n\nMicrosoft already sells the Surface X using an ARM processor. Their ARM processor sucks, but Apple Silicon has just given them the blueprint for fixing that. They are working on their \"Microsoft Silicon\" higher performance PC ARM processor as I write this. As is Samsung, Qualcomm, etc, etc. They can't sit buy and bleed sales to Apple because Intel's CPUs are too hot, too expensive and use too much power.\n\nSo these things are going to take a while, and unless Intel figures out how to take the cruft out of x86 to make it run far cooler and with lower power at the same performance levels, the ARM trend will continue to pick up speed and market share. Catch x86 up in process size is only one aspect of the ARM lead, on equal process sizes x86 is still at a big disadvantage in power consumption, maybe 2 to 1 instead of 3 to 1, but still big.\n\nBut the even bigger near term threat is to Intels' dominance in servers. Amazon's ARM based server architecture has huge advantages. It doesn't offer anywhere near the same level of single CPU performance, but that matters little to the vast majority of server customers. Instead it offers far more performance per dollar and because it uses so much less power it generates far less heat, meaning more can be packed into server rooms. This has led to some of the highest growth rates the industry has seen in decades, and it's already at 10% in one measure of cloud computering.\n\n[https://www.techpowerup.com/275971/aws-arm-based-graviton-processors-sees-the-biggest-growth-in-instance-share](https://www.techpowerup.com/275971/aws-arm-based-graviton-processors-sees-the-biggest-growth-in-instance-share)\n\nIt's a real risk that ARM based server architectures could have over 50% of cloud server installs in 5 years. That would gut Intel's biggest CPU market.\n\nSo no catch phrases, just some very real, and some very likely risks.",

        "body": "That is why I said contract with the new fabs being built. INTC would probably jump at the chance to add a big fab customer before their plants are even built. Also gives FB 18-24 months to get their designs done before the fab is even ready to start producing.\n\nThere will be a surplus of fab production space in 12-24 months so that isn't going to be an issue. Chip shortages are already starting to subside and the new fabs won't be in production for another year or two and the US govt is going to be throwing a bunch of money at it as well.",
