Other than numerous applications in the chemical, medical and solar industry, what interests me most is the use of silicon in the battery storage industry to improve the Li-ion battery performance. As per UBS, energy storage industry could grow to 426 billion in next 10 years. \n\nHPQ's tech potential has already generated NDA's with battery manufacturers and advanced material companies. In addition, HPQ has received firm order for Si nano powders from major car manufacturer (name not disclosed by the company yet). \n\nQuebec government (nvestissement Qu\u00e9bec) is one of the major investor in the company and the recent news that the Quebec government is in talks with Tesla about the automaker investing in battery production in the province, makes me think that the major auto manufacturer could be Tesla (pure speculation for sure ).",

Telsa just took delivery of Anode equipment in TX and the timeline for both companies seems to line up. They could have Ford, VW, or whatever as a customer but it doesnt matter. The point is that NMG is on the verge of major revenue very soon. I'm expecting an announcement of who their customer is by Q1 or Q2 but it could be sooner or it could be later.  \n\nPYR - Pyrogenesis - This is a company who's about to break out with an order of magnitudes revenue increase from any one of many verticals such as 1. Their partnership with HPQ Silicon and their battery anode material. 2. The iron ore pelletization industry. 3. They're in the last stages of qualification with a tier1 aerospace manufacturer for their titanium powder. Other things like their waste to energy systems and other things will continue to add revenue gains to their bottom line. \n\nAXU - Alexco Resources -  This is a Canadian Silver mine that just began production, but is still valued as a non-producer, and they are about to report earnings. Silver itself would appear to be on the verge of a price increase due to inflation and other things and silver mines trade at a high beta to the price of Silver, generally they move in price by 2X-5X of whatever Silver does. \n\nDo your DD!",

Silver is a different kind of play. \r\n\r\nI'd split between PYR and NMG. \r\n\r\nWhat if you bet hard on PYR because it's got a list of massive things that can make it pop any day, but NMG announces who their big EV customer is and it jumps to something like $30-$50? Then what? \r\n\r\nWhy couldn't it do at least that? Look at what PLL did when they announced. That's Piedmont Lithium. You never know how the market will react, it could take longer. \r\n\r\nLithium is 1% of the Cathode in a Li-Ion battery, Graphite is typically over 95% of the Anode. \r\n\r\nJust like PYR, NMG has some massive things about to happen.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, you could peel off maybe 25% and give birth to a Fidelity account. With it you can access the OTC. That\u2019s a different kind of wild, be careful and stick to the fundamentals. Do deep DD, YouTube is your friend. HPQ Silicon's ticker is HPQFF. They've figured out how to efficiently and responsibly process and form Silicon in a way where it can be used in the Anode and displace up to 20% of the Graphite. HPQ's partner is PYR. Silicon adds a lot of performance to a battery. \r\n\r\nTesla just received their anode equipment at Texas. If Tesla is the customer of NMG and HPQFF, with how quickly they move, its hard to know when we'll know something. It could be tomorrow or it could be months, perhaps quarters. Both NMG and HPQ have signed NDAs with major battery/auto manufacturer(s). At minimum they\u2019ll tell us when every last detail is finalized or when there\u2019s a material change to the business and they\u2019re required to disclose.\r\n\r\nI'm eager to find out who it is... it might not be Tesla, it could be Ford, VW, or someone else. Maybe it\u2019s more than one? No one knows. \r\n\nDiversity is really important. It's better to have more than one moon shot. \n\nHave you looked at Dogecoin? Things go up when there's more buyers. Usually there's more buyers during peak media. When SpaceX launches the DOGE-1 mission in 1Q22 and sends a satellite in orbit around the moon, what do you think the media cycle will be like around Dogecoin?",

Other than numerous applications in the chemical, medical and solar industry, what interests me most is the use of silicon in the battery storage industry to improve the Li-ion battery performance. As per UBS, energy storage industry could grow to 426 billion in next 10 years. \n\nHPQ's tech potential has already generated NDA's with battery manufacturers and advanced material companies. In addition, HPQ has received firm order for Si nano powders from major car manufacturer (name not disclosed by the company yet). \n\nQuebec government (nvestissement Qu\u00e9bec) is one of the major investor in the company and the recent news that the Quebec government is in talks with Tesla about the automaker investing in battery production in the province, makes me think that the major auto manufacturer could be Tesla (pure speculation for sure ).",

Telsa just took delivery of Anode equipment in TX and the timeline for both companies seems to line up. They could have Ford, VW, or whatever as a customer but it doesnt matter. The point is that NMG is on the verge of major revenue very soon. I'm expecting an announcement of who their customer is by Q1 or Q2 but it could be sooner or it could be later.  \n\nPYR - Pyrogenesis - This is a company who's about to break out with an order of magnitudes revenue increase from any one of many verticals such as 1. Their partnership with HPQ Silicon and their battery anode material. 2. The iron ore pelletization industry. 3. They're in the last stages of qualification with a tier1 aerospace manufacturer for their titanium powder. Other things like their waste to energy systems and other things will continue to add revenue gains to their bottom line. \n\nAXU - Alexco Resources -  This is a Canadian Silver mine that just began production, but is still valued as a non-producer, and they are about to report earnings. Silver itself would appear to be on the verge of a price increase due to inflation and other things and silver mines trade at a high beta to the price of Silver, generally they move in price by 2X-5X of whatever Silver does. \n\nDo your DD!",

Silver is a different kind of play. \r\n\r\nI'd split between PYR and NMG. \r\n\r\nWhat if you bet hard on PYR because it's got a list of massive things that can make it pop any day, but NMG announces who their big EV customer is and it jumps to something like $30-$50? Then what? \r\n\r\nWhy couldn't it do at least that? Look at what PLL did when they announced. That's Piedmont Lithium. You never know how the market will react, it could take longer. \r\n\r\nLithium is 1% of the Cathode in a Li-Ion battery, Graphite is typically over 95% of the Anode. \r\n\r\nJust like PYR, NMG has some massive things about to happen.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, you could peel off maybe 25% and give birth to a Fidelity account. With it you can access the OTC. That\u2019s a different kind of wild, be careful and stick to the fundamentals. Do deep DD, YouTube is your friend. HPQ Silicon's ticker is HPQFF. They've figured out how to efficiently and responsibly process and form Silicon in a way where it can be used in the Anode and displace up to 20% of the Graphite. HPQ's partner is PYR. Silicon adds a lot of performance to a battery. \r\n\r\nTesla just received their anode equipment at Texas. If Tesla is the customer of NMG and HPQFF, with how quickly they move, its hard to know when we'll know something. It could be tomorrow or it could be months, perhaps quarters. Both NMG and HPQ have signed NDAs with major battery/auto manufacturer(s). At minimum they\u2019ll tell us when every last detail is finalized or when there\u2019s a material change to the business and they\u2019re required to disclose.\r\n\r\nI'm eager to find out who it is... it might not be Tesla, it could be Ford, VW, or someone else. Maybe it\u2019s more than one? No one knows. \r\n\nDiversity is really important. It's better to have more than one moon shot. \n\nHave you looked at Dogecoin? Things go up when there's more buyers. Usually there's more buyers during peak media. When SpaceX launches the DOGE-1 mission in 1Q22 and sends a satellite in orbit around the moon, what do you think the media cycle will be like around Dogecoin?",
