Would I have cut my losses with NEO if my fellow apes here not such good confirmation bias palls?  Gotta be on guard for group think --  Road Corning down from 27 to under $2 a share.  Bought at $19-- Could have sold for a gain but cuz I thought $7 down in 1 day was a bit much...  And it just trended down and down.  My wife has a CPA but she says she has never seen a  company do the books like she was taught in school.  So she isn't a fan of stocks.  Corning did eventually recover... But I traded out prior so I got it both ways on that stock so that may be the worst... And my profilo(sp so far off spell check isn't helpin) is big enough that my watch list is usually things I have buy orders on...  Had a buy order on DRN and it didn't trend down that low.  And I keep watching it rally.  Did the same thing with industrials.  Tried to be patient but instead of trending down to my patent entry it been trending up and up...  But don't feel bad for me I'm up 73% from a year ago...",

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

        "body": "&gt;In the US markets, it's a penny stock: 6 months ago it was trading at $4.81\n\nBy that logic, GME is a penny stock too. The strikes are disjoint but the vol trades reasonably tight, and there's enough volume to hedge a moderately sized position if you need to.\n\nAs you mention, Intel has been in the foundry business before; Intel Custom Foundry was the entryway for the Altera acquisition. Not really a failure in that sense, although it's telling that they dropped ICF around when their roadmap and yield woes began to arise. I don't think that's where people will be looking in order to judge Intel short term, but I agree it's a big deal for custom datacenter applications. What matters most IMO, short term (1-3y), is the 7nm roadmap, as well as a swift commitment to capex. If Intel sends the right signals that they're executing on those two factors, the rest of the bricks will fall into place. AMD already started to lose a bit of market share in the past quarter, and the messaging around 10nm yield has gotten better. I guess it's obviously better because the 10nm chips are widely available. And I believe that Rocket Lake is a brilliant move because it keeps LGA1200 engaged and 14nm humming along.\n\nAlso, if you look at it from a valuation perspective, rotation to INTC makes sense. Personally I believe IDM is the ideal strategy for a supply-constrained market because you become less reliant on predictions and your lead times can get shorter when needed.\n\nIntel Foundry isn't immediately gonna be a game-changing player for most of these automotive chips. AKM is a big supplier and they had a big factory fire. They offloaded some production to Renesas, which also had a relatively sizable factory fire more recently.",

If you check their earnings transcripts you can see that they talk about their deliveries as well as their inventory.\n\n&gt;For that reason, I believe that we're going to start seeing this revenue certainly inside 2021. At least, the execs at companies like AMAT seem to agree, and the market seems to be anticipating the PEG.\n\nYou're probably right about the latter part and perhaps wrong about the former part. AMAT isn't going to book profits in 2021 for the new capex outlay that was announced in the past couple of weeks from TSMC and Intel and the others. It would be accounting fraud. Even a nontrivial expansion of an existing fab will take 2-3y minimum. But the market is certainly anticipating the forward earnings. I am long-term bullish AMAT and the others, have been for a while, but AMAT is trading at a 33 P/E and INTC is trading at a 12.5 P/E. Assuming their earnings are correlated (which they ought to be if you normalize for lead/lag), I'd rather play the cheaper valuation with far cheaper IV.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I so desperately want to be involved in the capex names but the entry point right now is mediocre. My thinking is that if they rip, they will carry the rest of the fab side of the sector with them. So I prefer the insanely cheap upside skew of INTC because it will rip if it can break through the psychological barrier that 65 represents for the spot price. My play is to wait for everything to get crushed in a correlation event later this summer and then scoop them up. The stars will have to align but I think they just might.",

Can happen again, not by law, but by whim.  \n* There are new factories planned but is there the capability to deliver?\n* Is the factory in China to meet demand (no more car transports out of Oakland to China) or to avoid paying tariffs on imports?\n* Plaid+ Model S pushed out to now middle of 2022, with a $10K price increase\n* CyberTruck, estimates but no deliveries.  \n* Model X will not be getting the newer battery (notice by range) as that's not even an option\n* Tesla body shops are slammed for repairs - either for parts or labor (May 7th or whatever in CA Bay Area)\n* Tesla authorized body shops can have delays in repairing vehicles, due to parts availability and when aluminum parts arrive, can be dented during transport needing it to be sent back and resetting the clock\n* Wholesale (wrecked) price on Teslas are high because battery packs are at a premium, causing insurance to total them prematurely and raising insurance rates\n* Beta FSD is seriously buggy (dangerous) as per the latest AI video shot in Oakland\n* Missteps in telling buyers they'd be able to get a Tesla loaner, then get cheated out of even the Uber credits, when the vehicles are brought in to be serviced\n* Increased difficult in talking to a human via email or phone.  \n* MCU1 NHTSA near-recall forcing Tegra board installs and service scheduling\n* GM and LG Chem teaming up\n* Apple Car competition\n* MCU / software slow failure to adapt (Slack to Spotify, but still no Waze nor CarPlay integration)\n* Large delays (due to warehouse supply chain) in deploying Solar PV installs (approx 2 months in Bay Area)\n* Biden administration push for tax rules which increase corporate taxes (21% to 28%), impacting revenue generated overseas in places like Germany where the other factory is going in to help with sales.  \n\nThere are probably more issues, but when you have other manufacturers starting to offer comparable options (including TACC) it increases the pressure on Tesla.  What does TSLA really have going for them?\n\n* Tesla Gigafactory is still working with Panasonic in Sparks.  Full shifts.  Buses for employees coming from as far south as Carson City NV.  \n* Toyota and TSLA teaming up\n* Leaps on the auto-pilot software ahead of everyone else\n* Sentry mode due to number of cameras\n* Name branding (fancier than a Toyota)\n* Potential tax benefits under the Biden administration for EVs.  States like NJ make it economical to buy a new TSLA due to the $0 sales tax for EV purchases.\n* Electricity costs in CA ($0.25 kW/h) along with outages due to \"wildfire and other threats\" make Solar PV a better option, along with the $10-$15K power wall for consumers\n\nI'd expect chip issues to drive issues in the future.  I followed TSLA since they migrated from Mobil Eye (and subsequent purchase by INTC) into creating their own solution.  This is the difference between AP1, AP2 and ultimately the options going into AP3 with users claiming better (smoother) performance from AP1 for months after AP2 was rolled out.  Anyhow, the NVDA and subsequent their own chips also play a role in terms of growing pains.  \n\nI am long on TSLA with a bit over $165,000 invested.  Current price is an interesting proposition but I have no active orders.",

It takes some of the benefits from ARM-like designs, and some from Intel-like designs.\n\nThere's reasons that Apple has done this while others haven't. First, they have the most to gain from this. They have two enormous lines of consumer hardware which will benefit from this investment. Second, Apple has more cash in their coffers than fucking everyone else, so the expense doesn't impact them materially. \n\nSamsung already has their own mobile chipset, and they don't have a significant product line in laptop/desktop world. They have no interest in making an M1 competitor. Huawei is in the same position. Fujitsu? Lol.\n\nThe M-series is an enormous win for Apple and no one is going to contest it for a long time unless Intel decides they want to do anything other than coast on their market share anytime soon.\n\nApple has so much cash that if TSMC doesn't handle the M-series fabrication in a satisfactory way, then Apple will just buy their own fabs and control their entire supply chain instead.",
