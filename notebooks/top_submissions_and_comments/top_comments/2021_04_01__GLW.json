Would I have cut my losses with NEO if my fellow apes here not such good confirmation bias palls?  Gotta be on guard for group think --  Road Corning down from 27 to under $2 a share.  Bought at $19-- Could have sold for a gain but cuz I thought $7 down in 1 day was a bit much...  And it just trended down and down.  My wife has a CPA but she says she has never seen a  company do the books like she was taught in school.  So she isn't a fan of stocks.  Corning did eventually recover... But I traded out prior so I got it both ways on that stock so that may be the worst... And my profilo(sp so far off spell check isn't helpin) is big enough that my watch list is usually things I have buy orders on...  Had a buy order on DRN and it didn't trend down that low.  And I keep watching it rally.  Did the same thing with industrials.  Tried to be patient but instead of trending down to my patent entry it been trending up and up...  But don't feel bad for me I'm up 73% from a year ago...",
