        "body": "To be entirely fair here, this whole thing\u2019s based on a really bad article title. Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term. I think that\u2019s a pretty massive difference.",

There's a reason they are so high, and it's not because it's a great company at a low price.\n\nThis play isn't new and has been seen by many previously low float deSPACs such as OPAD, SPIR and IRNT.\n\nAs for my play?  I don't know when the unlock will happen, but I suspect it will be sometime between now and December, so in about a week or so, I will be picking up 15P and waiting for the inevitable drop that's implied by the warrant-common gap.\n\nRemember that the PIPE has a $10 cost basis and unlike dumb Redditors, they will take a guaranteed 80% return on an investment and won't diamond hand it to 0.  And relative to the current float, the PIPE is huge so the drop will be very big, possibly even below 10.\n\nSeriously, after GME everyone is always looking for the next \"squeeze\", but chances are, if you've just heard of it it's too late.\n\n\nWe are not here to carry your bags for you, stop gambling on garbage hoping for an unrealistic return and pick a solid company like SOFI.  Seriously, 2023 25c LEAPs on SOFI will print better than 90% of these shitty squeeze plays.  Sure it might not be the 500% returns in 2 weeks that people seem to be hoping for, but at least you won't be -70% after a month bagholding something that someone told you would go higher.",

Now they know a \"shortcut\" that they can teach you about, well not directly, just enough to keep you intrigued.\n\nProblem is, even if you buy their stuff, you will never be as good as them because what is missing is the foundation that they have build and the exposure to the topic that they got. It pays off to work and learn for yourself, even tho it is painful and dagerous and tedious af.\n\nYou will never become a great musician, artist, programmer or investor by watching videos. What will get you there is reading books and grinding. Grinding, grinding, grinding.\n\nAnd most people are not willing to do that. So doing that already will bring you in the top 1% of people who COULD be successful.",

And if the company has value, why wouldn't small piece of that have value?\n\nBut of course... I understand why you are asking this question. Because if you just buy a stock and you let it stay there, unless the company gives dividends you will receive nothing in return. So you agree that a company that gives dividends does have value? Let's say a company that gives 10% of dividends each year, will make you back that money in 10 years and from there everything else is a bonus.\n\nNow. What is the reason why every company doesn't give dividends? The reason is growth. They and their shareholders both think it's better to invest the potential dividends back into growing the company. \n\nBut the company always will have \"potential\" to give out dividends, once they decide they don't need to grow anymore - they could start giving out dividends, but meanwhile you can think of dividends as constantly being automatically invested back into the company, however due to company growing the potential also increases an you can still cash out the \"dividends\" by selling the stock at higher price due to potential of dividends having been grown.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

The CEO sent out a company wide email basically saying expect a conversation with your manager as we're making changes.\n\nThey touched only the areas with the highest attrition (about 60% of workforce) and the starting salary.  We now have folks who have been here 1-5 years who are going to make the same as a new hire.  We now have folks who have been here 10 years who are going to be making $1-$5 more than a new hire.  We now have specialized technical experts getting paid the same as a college hire.
