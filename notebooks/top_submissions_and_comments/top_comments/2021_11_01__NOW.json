Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term. I think that\u2019s a pretty massive difference.",

My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.",

Everybody that matters in the market knows what it is, and they all knew it was going to pass the house. Remember, it had strong support by both parties in the senate months ago when it was passed. People have mentioned buying related ETFs (I.e PAVE) and construction companies (like CAT) for that entire time for this reason. Basically, it\u2019s priced in.\n\n2. Besides allowing for news,  speculation and possibly improved forward guidance (all priced in imo) this bill isn\u2019t going to make these companies more valuable overnight. It will take a long time for them to get these projects/money, and even longer for them to report their financial improvements from this, which does have an impact on stock prices. Even then, this is probably priced in.\n\nI hesitate to say this is 100% priced in right now because there are probably retail traders buying in, but the term \u201csell the news\u201d exists for a reason. In general, retail traders tend to buy the top and sell at the bottom, and this event will (probably not) be an exception.",

And I don't mean the namby-pamby 20% capital gains tax, these are going to be paid as if they were earned income.\n\nSo to deal with that his choice is either to take out a huge loan for all of the tax value and the cost to exercise.\n\nOr sell some of his existing stock, pay the much smaller capital gains on it, and use the money freed up there to exercise the options and pay the income tax.\n\nBeyond those two likely options the only third option would be to not exercise the options and let them expire worthless.\n\nThis tweet is all about framing the decision for public perception.

So you can sell it and take what the contract is worth right now. Or exercise it. Exercising means you'll be purchasing 100 shares at the strike price of which you bought the option for, you pay per share the strike price. So you bought .03 cent option strike price. You pay .03 cents for each share of 100. You then own 100 share of Said company, this is for going long on a company. There's much to option but it really isn't that hard to understand once you begin learning and understanding. Cause when you purchase a option contract your buying the \"rights\" to 100 shares of said company. Options are a tricky game but is a good game when played strongly. If you knew a stock was going up and you purchased many calls you can profit more for calls than buying said stock. Puts are like shorting, when you expect a stock to go down. Again man, I'm sure I'm making it confusing but YouTube it and read about it. Took me a minute to understand and then took me like months to understand completely across the whole options playing field",
