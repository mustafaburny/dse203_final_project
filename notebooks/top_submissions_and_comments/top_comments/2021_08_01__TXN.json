Any sales you make you'll have to pay taxes on.\n\nMy personal advice is to leave it in $VTI and dont look at it for 5/10 years. If you want to play around and trade some money. See how much in taxes it would cost to sell $10k and then use that 10k as \"fun money\" you have to be prepared to loose all of it. At your age let the VTI stay invested and get compounded returns.

Your \"it won't happen to me\" arrogance will lead to your eventual financial demise in the market. It's just a matter of time. \n\nI will give you an example of an actual trade that I am in now. A couple of weeks ago TXN had a 5% drop after earnings were released. It settled near 185, and had been at that level previously and recovered. So, I sold the Aug 20 182.5 put, and bought the 180 put. I took in .87 premium, or $87 per spread, minus commissions. TXN has since recovered and is now near 192-3, and the spread is at .12. If TXN stays about 182.5 on 8/20 the puts will expire worthless. If the market tanks my risk is limited to $163 per spread. If I were only short the 182.5 put my risk would be unlimited. Many hedge funds have been wiped out selling naked puts, so don't kid yourself into thinking it won't happen to you. Risk management is the key to surviving stock market trading.",

I have wiped out a million dollars a couple of times. \n\nI can tell from your comments that you are new to trading. When you sell a naked put, how many do you sell? Can you define your risk?\n\nHere's how I decide how many put spreads to sell. Let's say my account size is 10k. I want to risk no more than 2% in a worse case scenario. So, the spread (in my case TXN) is to sell the 182.5 put and buy the 180 put. The spread is 2.5 pts or $250. I take (did take in) .87, or $87 per spread. My risk is $250-87, or $163. For 10k risking 2% that's $200 of risk, so I can sell 1 TXN spread. I have taken in $87, and set aside $200 for the trade - that's 43.5% for a 4 week holding period. Not a bad gain. \n\nThe problem with naked put selling is you don't know your max potential risk, so you don't know how many to sell. With a vertical put spread you do know you max potential loss so you can easily calculate exactly how many spreads to sell. \n\nFor full disclosure I am short 23 of the TXN spreads.",
