        "body": "Your title is another way of phrasing \u201cDispersion Trading.\u201d\n\nIf you thought of this strategy on your own (even if it\u2019s not entirely refined), that means you are very smart. In fact these are the types of posts that I hope get on the top of r/options (I gave you an award - hopefully it pushes it up). Your post is a great post for people who are actually looking to learn more about options than just buying calls/puts. Half of the time I see posts that are just like \u201cyolo into calls on stock xyz\u201d or \u201cshould I get out of my position now or wait it out\u201d etc. get to the top, which is sort of disappointing to me. I don\u2019t have any issues with those posts, but they don\u2019t offer the insight your post offers. \n\nWhat you described is a rough sketch of dispersion trading. You probably won\u2019t be able to find much about it online but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a few articles and research papers that you can find on Google (just type dispersion trading into Google). There\u2019s also this on YouTube that gives you a brief intro: https://youtube.com/watch?v=32bVTQw7XDg. It\u2019s a *true options* strategy and much more sophisticated than the ones you generally see here on Reddit of just buying calls or puts. I would guess it\u2019s one of the core strategies almost all option trading firms make to generate profit. It\u2019s almost impossible to do as a retail trader (your set-up you described in your post will be very costly and almost impossible to manage), but if you have like some complex system of algorithms + a bunch of quants helping you out, there is a way to pull off this trade so that you can *have a positive profit no matter how the stock market moves*. \n\nThink about it this way with a super simplistic example in SPY. SPY is a function of its 500 stocks. So there must be a relationship between these 500 stocks (or sector of stocks) and SPY. If this relationship gets off in either direction, you can take advantage. If Stock X and Stock Y have IVs of a and b, then the basket that is some weighted combination of Stock X and Y *must* have an IV of f(a, b) where it\u2019s a *solvable function*. This means anytime it gets off, no matter how Stocks X and Y move, you can make money. \n\nAnyways that didn\u2019t really answer your question in your post directly, but I\u2019m giving some basic insight on the type of thinking you described in your post. As I said, I don\u2019t think most people have the resources to pull it off, but given you can even think of this idea, that\u2019s pretty impressive! And as I said, it\u2019s a great post for people to learn more about more advanced option strategies than just buying calls/puts.",

I adore all the degenerates here. I like the positions or ban requirement. Wsb was my intro to options. It told me about the jpow brrrr and the v-shaped recovery last year. I learned that TA is the best way to sound smart but be actually retarded. Wsb showed me that dividends and boomer stocks was for nerds. And it taught me how to lose money really fast and that I should always inverse myself. But in The last 3 months I\u2019ve literally learned 5x what I knew from the past 3 years. Gme is the most interesting story of the year. This megathread was going to eventually and naturally be replaced as apes learn new plays and the gme story unfolds. It doesn\u2019t make sense to make an executive unilateral decision to kill the thread and it just makes mods look sus af. Killing the thread only feeds the conspiracy/cultish mindset. Just like all the CNBC/motley fool/S3/etc... FUD proved to me that gme was a real threat. MODS: get a grip and use this growth as an opportunity to integrate a lot of beautiful minds so that we can collectively share the best ideas and the best gains and losses. Why shoot yourselves in the foot?",

        "body": "Cheers on a quality contribution to the community! We disagree on whether this whole charade is legit, but that's mostly because I'm confident any reviewing authority would accept any perceived shenanigans in view of the benefits of eventually effectuating this merger. \n\nFirst, for a legal thread, I think you're missing the major legal issue here. THCB plainly manipulated the procedural process of shareholder voting to get their desired outcome. Delaware has a decent amount of case law on this issue. Since you're a former attorney, I'd point you to *Blasius Industries Inc. v. Atlas Corp.*, 564 A.2d 651 (Del. Ch. 1988) and *Wisconsin Investment Board v. Peerless Systems Corp.*, No. 17637 (Del. Ch. 2000). Peerless is particularly relevant because it involved adjourning a shareholder's meeting because the board-recommended proposal was going to lose. Sounds pretty familiar, no? \n\nNow, ultimately I don't think THCB has anything to worry about on the manipulation front (check out *Stroud v. Grace*, 606 A.2d 75 (Del. 1992) for why I think that) but it certainly is a legal argument I'd make. \n\nAs to THCB violating their Charter, I admit it's one of the bolder arguments I've seen, but I do actually think it checks out. I think this mostly because the law surrounding contract interpretation is absolutely one of the wishy-washiest nonsensical areas you can get bogged down in. But the important thing is that the main document you point to is THCB's own Charter. If THCB wants to interpret their charter this way, and coincidentally enough in the way that allows everyone involved to walk away with piles of cash, who's going to say no?\n\nAgain, great contribution. This is a complicated issue that didn't get proper attention in the daily thread and I'm glad there's a post on it now.",
