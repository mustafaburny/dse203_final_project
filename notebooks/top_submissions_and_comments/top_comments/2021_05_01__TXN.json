It's only a stock and it's just business. Hell the stock I've held the longest in my portfolio is coming up on maybe 3 years? I've never held a stock anything close to 20 years so I have no clue what a company would have to do for me to stay around for holding it for 20 years. Now there's some industries that lend themselves to longevity in terms of investments. Banks, for example, tend to be very long term investments. I plan on holding $BAC for as long as humanly possible and I'm open to finding other banks to hold onto as they come along. Why? Because the median age for banks in the U.S. is 100 years old. A century. That's a lot of time to compound investment gains (this is assuming a perfect world and nothing goes wrong and everything compounds neatly and perfectly for the entire time you're holding the stock). What's the median age for a tech firm? No clue but it isn't 100. Don't focus too much time on what tech names can last that long. We're seeing the lucky few. Hold for as long as your reasons for why you bought are in place. The moment they leave. Sell. Nothing personal, strictly business.",
