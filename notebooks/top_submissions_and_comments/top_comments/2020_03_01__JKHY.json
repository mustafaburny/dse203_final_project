In terms of multi-year views and names that pay a dividend, things like CME, HASI (and honestly, given climate change and money moving towards ESG, HASI seems certainly more appealing to me as a long-term holding than owning an oil company), LVMUY, SBAC/AMT, MSCI, SPGI, BX (although volatile), ZTS, JPM, NEE, CHDN (although problematic if nobody's going to events this year), NXRT, MA, V, LMT, HD, BF.B, EL, FIS/JKHY, TJX, TMO, DHR, ECL, WM or WCN, PLD, INTU, ROP, WMT, EQIX, NKE. ABT. Starbucks and Disney obviously not doing well given what's going on, but at some point these are things to look at starting positions in if you have a long-term view. Hilton/Marriott have gotten hit by this situation and could certainly be further, but again, good businesses that at some point are worth looking at.",
