A few weeks ago I bought some slack stocks (because my company moved to them and its pretty awesome - up 42%) and some call options on ZOOM (because a school on tv was using it and it looked cool) that went up 150% before I closed it out (that was like 2/3rds of my \"winnings\"). \n\nMy current options are a put on AMD (doing bad, bought because I saw their factory closed and it was worth like 40% more than I paid at the end of the day, but the next day they released a statement saying all is good and the stock shot up and now it is pretty uh, negative) - that expires in May, then got some calls on HPE expiring in August that are up (something about a super computer helping solve the virus thing), some Micron calls currently losing expiring the end of next month (not really down much, bought because I heard RAM and SSDs are still in high demand, we we use Micron SSD's in our servers), then a put on ford expiring in May (mostly because I feel like they are trying to open the plants to save the company, and it will back fire when someone starts spreading a new round of rona and get forced to shut down).\n\nI guess my market research is just seeing shit on tv or the internet and believing it.

        "body": "I believe in terms of investment, you might be better off with investing in stocks or forex. Hear me out.\n\nThere are some articles published in different parts of the world that have mentioned things like how people are getting scammed millions/ billions off a \u201cbuy gold\u201d scheme, where they get people to spend X amount of money on say 10kg of gold, and they are promised with a return of 10% per annum. For example, person A is promised this level of return, then person B (unrelatedly to A) joins in and is promised the same thing, and they decide to invest. B\u2019s money is then given to A, and A feels that he\u2019s being promised good stuff. Then C comes in, and the process repeats. When the creator of this crowdfunding/ pyramid scheme gets enough people, they disappear into thin air with all the money, just like avatar Aang.\n\nThe main reason why these people fall to such scams is because they don\u2019t understand the business model. Gold doesn\u2019t magically grow to create new gold and give you money. However, a restaurant business (for example) does. They set up shop, have customers, sell food for a price greater than cost price, and then they give out dividends to people who decide to invest in them (very much like blue chip stocks). Of course, as the business grows, they may decide to give out greater dividends or keep the profits to themselves for business expansions, upgrading Chef skills or hiring new chefs etc.\n\nSo to summarise, it\u2019s important to understand the business model of every single investment. If you don\u2019t understand it/ are not interested in it (eg bitcoin), then DON\u2019T invest in it. As for your gold coin example, I personally feel that it\u2019s very similar to buying gold and holding it for the Long term, and there\u2019s not going to be much change in the near future. Ultimately, the choice is yours, now with the coronavirus going on and about, it\u2019s a great opportunity to buy into blue chip stocks or undervalued stocks within the market.\n\nOne example of this would be how the virus is affecting all businesses, whereas in reality, it should really be affecting businesses that require a flow of people, for example restaurant businesses. IT companies such as windows for example, technically shouldn\u2019t be affected, because they sell windows license keys (and others for example. But let\u2019s just keep it within e-commerce businesses for simplicity). But they\u2019re still experiencing a drop in stock prices because there are computers (AI programmes) that buy/sell stocks for big companies when prices hit a certain upper/ lower limit.\n\nJust my two cents worth on this topic. And again, it\u2019s entirely up to you to decide. If you know how your investment is going to generate you cash flow, then go for it. I wish you all the best!!",
