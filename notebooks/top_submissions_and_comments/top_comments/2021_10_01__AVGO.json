        "body": "There are so many companies that offer greater growth than Ericsson. The components that Ericsson makes are high cost and low margin. On top of that they have to compete to get contracts. The downside to this is that the number of contracts can be sporadic and unreliable. To my knowledge there isn\u2019t much, if any, advantage to choosing Ericsson versus Nokia components. Further, BofA recently came out with their 14 moonshot technologies report that said 5G will be the shortest cellular generation before we move into 6G. Also, the S&amp;P has risen 26% in the last year (98% in last 5 years) and Ericsson has risen 3.9% in the past year (54% in last 5 years) so it\u2019s significantly trailing the market. If you are dead set on 5G, I\u2019d suggest looking in $FIVG because they own holdings that have performed greater than Ericsson. Take a look at $FIVG holdings like apple, google, or semi companies like $AVGO, $QCOM.",

You walk in and your phone automatically starts charging anywhere in your house (within distance of the charging station - like WiFi). FCC and Apple squashed that idea when they didn\u2019t approve it and Apple went with Broadcom Qi. \n\nEven with this approval I\u2019m not so sure. There are a lot of physics hurdles that it would face. You would need a lot of these devices to cover a house or multiple devices to cover even a room in a standard US home. Also distance plays a big factor - longer = less charging power to the point it may not even be relevant.  WiFi has less of these hurdles obviously. \n\nThrowing a couple hundred at it as a speculative stock may be worthwhile.",

It doesn't matter whether Tesla had a bright future, I never denied that they have effective tech, an effective product and solid manufacturing potential. Tesla isn't going to collapse as a business. However, you can have great companies which are massively over-valued (think Cisco in dot-com era) and Tesla is one of these companies.\n\nTesla's current valuation doesn't make sense. In terms of EVs, VW is just a few % points behind Tesla in global market share (and has an equally bright future in this market) but is valued at 1/6 the value **despite having extensive market share in ICE markets**. That is absurd, Tesla made $31.5bn in revenue in 2020 whereas VW made $258bn in 2020. Fundamentally, the current valuation of Tesla is wrong. That's the problem with Tesla.",
