Sometimes the report goes out of whack. It's likely somewhere between ADP (which reported +742,000 jobs for April) and BLS (which reported +266,000)\n* Every talking head Jim Cramer and CEO (of services companies) is whining about unemployment benefits and how they can't find people to work. \n* Well. Too bad. Unemployment benefits are protecting vulnerable workers from work places that would expose them very willfully to a pandemic that is still killing 800 people everyday in the US. A pandemic that is still not contained enough. \n* I won't fell sorry for CEOs/bosses that suddenly have to pay more, protect their workers more, and have lost the lever of threatening with their workers with firing. \n\nI still think we get to +1 million jobs a month sometime in 2021.",
