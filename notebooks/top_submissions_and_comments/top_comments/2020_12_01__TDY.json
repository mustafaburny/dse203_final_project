        "body": "Also a grad here. I echo this advice. I set aside roughly $7500 for trips and invested the rest. Be disciplined about maxing out a Roth IRA and when you graduate contribute to the TSP (especially since you\u2019ll be under the blended retirement and the Army will match (up to a certain percentage)). \n\nIn the TSP I contribute 12% of my base pay (an arbitrary number I determined when I was a LT based off my budget back then. Obviously the monthly contributions increase as promotions come about and time in service increases. Don\u2019t mess around with Lifetime funds, they are too conservative for your age. Use the S and C funds in the TSP. As a reference 8.5 years of thIs TSP strategy is now worth ~100k (albeit its been a great decade). \n\nIn Roth IRA, I personally do about a 60/40 split in an S&amp;P 500 index fund and a target retirement fund (kind of my safety net). \n\nAnd then any extra money I have from my monthly budget or money made from deployments/TDY/PCS goes in to a separate brokerage account. And this is where I have fun and invest for growth. (10% cash, 10% S&amp;P index fund, 5% options, and the rest is spread out in about 15-20 mostly long term individual stocks). \n\nAlso look into real estate and see if it\u2019s right for you. A good way to put your BAH to use.",
