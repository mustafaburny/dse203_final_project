No other company is able to satisfy the demand placed by this industry right now. The only real threat they face currently (aside from COVID breakouts in the plant) is starlink systems. As much as this sub (and myself) love Musk, it is realistically several years away from being even moderately threatening to traditional FTTH networks. \n\nCombine that with other companies subcontracting their fiber manufacturing to Corning to meet demand, and you have a recipe for success.",

It cost you i think about 5 dollars a trade and later you had a monthly fee. Fidelity you had to have 15k and some of the others a high amount as well. this was easy to ignore when everything was going up not so much post 1999.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;i invested everything in november of 1999 from my time in the military after a financial planning meeting. I went with communications, Lucent, qualcom, nokia, JDS uniphase and glw. I just remember a mutual fund i had went from 1000 dollars when i bought it to 200 dollars the next month.  I had about 10k worth of stock and it lost about half its value in the course of 3 months and kept going lower. I sold some and bough marvel comics which was around a 1 dollar a share after the release of the first x-men movie but they were risky due to flirting with bankruptcy yet again.  I did really well with my 500 dollars i bought sold at 23 dollars a share wish i kept it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  My dad sold his Apple stock about 50k worth  (he bought one year after the ipo) in 1992 to buy Marvel Stock which went bankrupt.",

If I had bought at the bottom of the cup, there was no way of knowing whether it was forming a cup or about to trade flat or drop. Right now is the best time to buy in since there\u2019s a stronger probability of it completing the formation. Once it pushes through the resistance, it will go up by the difference between the resistance (~$13.80 for GME) and the bottom of the cup (~$11.80), which is $2. So anticipate GME reaching at least $15.80 this week. Just look at the cup and handle formed by GLW between July 28th and August 12th. \n\nRight now is when you buy, it\u2019s definitely not too late.",
