They invented the Gorilla Glass, which is basically indestructible. A few of the phone manufacturers decided to use it for a year or two, and then went back to cheaper alternatives. Planned obsolescence makes more profit.\n\nCorning is a solid company, holds the entire city up, and isn't going anywhere. I wouldn't look at it for short term gains, but it could be an interesting addition to a diverse portfolio.\n\nThey don't manufacture as much as invent. They create patents and then the smaller companies all try to reverse engineer them and mass manufacture a knock off version.",

        "body": "WSB is making assertions which can only be validated via conspiracy theories and wishful thinking. They explain the future rise of the stock by saying...\n\n1) Everyone is lying\n\n2) The media is being manipulated to DISTRACT from GME by getting everyone to go to silver or whatever instead.\n\n3) Hedge funds are using \"short ladder attacks\" to lower the price.\n\nWhen they take these points together they conclude that the hedge funds **must** be scared, ergo, a big squeeze is still coming.\n\nIn reality -- there is no evidence to support any of those claims. Occam's Razor also suggests that they're wrong. \n\n**For point #1** -- that Everyone is lying. Where's the proof? The conspiracy has to get ever larger to encompass people who backup the \"lies\". For example, first it was Melvin and Citron who *must* be lying. Then it was the media for repeating those claims. Now it's S3 and Ortex as well. What's next, the SEC when the reports come out in another week?\n\n**For point #2** -- Where's the proof? Okay, the media says reddit is into silver. There are in fact some posts in WSB saying silver is the ticket. More likely though, the media is lazy. They love that clickbait. Stories about reddit and stocks are very clickbaity right now, they draw attention because people want in on the \"next thing\". It's like dumb spam that says shit like \"We have the word on warren buffet's next investment\" or whatever. That doesn't mean it's some grand conspiracy by the hedge fund cabal to distract you from GME. \n\n**For point #3** -- The stupid short ladder attacks have become a damn meme. People post screen shots of trading data that looks nearly identical to trading data from another ticker. I've actually been tempted to post $IBM or someone's raw trading data over at WSB and claim it's $GME and evidence of short ladder trading! People don't know what they're talking about here and there's no actual proof that this is what's happening. It is just taken as a foregone conclusion that any low volume drop must be a short ladder attack. When in reality, it's also consistent with the slow deflation of a grossly overvalued stock.\n\nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This is like telling people who dismissed the QAnon nonsense that \"no one knows what's going to happen\". \n\nThe theory on GME proved correct and played itself out. People adjusted their expectations to think $1000 was a reasonable target and then convinced themselves that it must still be coming. The actual numbers though show that we saw a rise from $17 -&gt; $500 in the last month. That was the squeeze. People dismissed the rise in price over that period and said *the squeeze is still coming* when they were actually witnessing the squeeze all along. People are saying it's impossible they exited their positions on Friday when in fact they were likely doing it all of last week.",

        "body": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that  Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles (with some duplicates in there).  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... with many of these senior roles sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At an 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel are a recurring revenue stream so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto. \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

No current knowledge.\n\nIf you dig under the covers of your Snowflakes or your Databricks you'll find, fundamentally, almost exactly the same tech under the covers of each one. You can quibble about quality and use cases, but you'll find a metastore, some columnar storage, a fast/parallel MPP and maybe a batch engine alongside. If you're sitting there thinking CLDR is \"hadoop\" your information is from about 2012 and needs updating. \n\nAnd *that* is the real problem the company has. Its executive team simply do not understand what it is they sell and do not know how to communicate it to the market. What's a Salesforce? CRM on the cloud. What's a Snowflake? DWH on the cloud. What's a DB? DE/DS on the cloud. Easy, punchy, clear, accessible.\n\nWhat's a Cloudera? Well apparently \"We deliver an enterprise data cloud for any data, anywhere, from the Edge to AI.\"\n\nIf anyone knows wtf that means in today's market then I'd love to know, and I *worked at the company when that slogan was coined*.\n\nDig into the on-boarding experiences and how you're supposed to use this stuff and it just gets worse and worse and worse. They're not a cloud stock yet - they still do 80-90 percent of their business on prem in traditional form factors; this isn't a bad thing (e.g. they do actually turn a profit) but if you tell investors you're all cloudy then don't return cloud numbers then.... duh.\n\nIf and when CLDR decide to clean house and turf out their useless marketing function and hire a few product leaders who aren't just ex-Yahoo rejects out of their depth then they could easily be a force to be reckoned with. Until then they're probably going to spin their wheels praying for IBM to swoop in and buy them out at a price where not everyone is underwater.",

It's currently shorted by only 7%, BUT that works out to $3 billion in value (as compared to GME's $13 billion before this all went down). Say IBM announces a big breakthrough (maybe Watson actually does something valuable) and reddit jumps on it. Do the hedges get caught in a squeeze, or is the market cap enough that there's plenty of escape and it's business as usual?",

Amazon can afford to take some risks on inventory because that risk is spread across its entire product catalog; heck they can mitigate it even more by having 3rd party sellers be responsible for the inventory; your local town shop probably has to keep the most in demand items, and if that turns out to be a bad bet they're stuck with it; Amazon can use it as a loss leader to get you to buy other products from them. \n\nA more at home example? Institutions have much more capable research tools and teams at their disposal to see what trends on going on in the marketplace; they literally have complicated models that can even help them predict which dips are transient and which are more prolonged because they have almost unlimited access to data; for them the cost of these tools is a tiny fraction compared to the total assets they manage; for an individual retail investor it is almost cost prohibitive for most. That's a huge informational disadvantage for the little guy; add to the fact that they have much faster hardware, can pay for being much closer to the exchange, etc. They can also pay interns to just browse these subreddits and pick up on what retail sentiment is and send it to their analysis teams to see which may pay off [if you're a single woman intern in NYC: ;) call me ;) ]. You're already starting off at a huge disadvantage. And yes, through research or sheer luck you may find yourself in a hot stock, but if institutions didn't jump on it before you they will as soon as it becomes a positive blip on their model, and they will leave as soon as their models predict a negative trend, even if the market hasn't reacted yet.\n\nIn essence, the bigger you are, even if your risk profile as a % is similar (or even lower), the sheer absolute amount you put at risk is almost always going to be massively larger than any smaller competitor by orders of magnitude; not to mention the better tools these big institutions can afford to bring into the game. The small startups, or the successful retail investor, how do they win? They find a niche or a blind spot that has nobody there and they are the first or one of the very first to arrive. Once it gets mainstream the bigger players are moving in, and if you don't have an exit strategy or a survival strategy that's it for you.\n\nthat's not to say the little guy can't win; think Amazon vs B&amp;N; Netflix vs Blockbuster; Dell vs IBM; etc. it happens when you find a new market that the big guy hasn't exploited well yet and you can mount an effective defense. Look at DFV, he found something he felt was mispriced, and his returns is something that would make even the best institutional investor blush. But they all had something in common: they all had knowledge of what to look for and how to go about taking advantage of it. Of course they also had some luck along the way.\n\nDo the big fish sometimes do things a bit underhanded? Yes. Does it sometimes descend into an impossible barrier for the little guy to get across? Yes. Should they be investigated if it happens? Yes. Is it every time the little guy loses because the big guys are cheating? absolutely not.\n\ntldr: money is power; knowledge + a little bit of luck can be even more powerful. But not all losses are due to corruption. It happens.",

Just thinking out loud...also I think '90s data on this is a bit skewed because the average person didn't interact with their products like they do now.

Main reason why is that recently the stock saw a dip from the 100 down to the mid 80s level mostly due to hedge funds deleveraging because of the whole GME fiasco so you are buying it at a discount in my opinion. \n\nAnother reason why is that AMD is a classic turnaround story. It wasn't too long ago that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy due to failing product lines, but now it has CPUs that can rival and even outperform Intel and the specs for their GPUs shows they can actually go foot to foot with Nvidia. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the market for CPUs and GPUs are still growing so I don't really expect a deceleration of the company's revenue growth. \n\nLastly, keep in mind that the Gov is still doing QE infinity, that and the trillions of stimulus they are gonna give out this year means it is a perfect environment for risk assets, so don't overthink it.",

        "body": "I think you underestimated the importance of TSMC. Just think about how many things today's use chips, TVs, cars, computer, data center, phones, cameras. About half of them are from TSMC (based on market share). Now apply the current auto ICs shortage to every sector. That's what will happen if China invades Taiwan. We are not going to see a collapse of TSM, we are going to see a Great Depression. I dont think the western powers will allow that to happen.\n\nAlso the fact that TSMC is the largest fab and has the most capacity but is still at full capacity tells you the world needs IC. Apple, AMD along takes away so much of their 5nm and 7nm slot already. The fact that Nvidia didn't produce their rtx3000s in TSMC is actually bullish because TSMC couldn't care less about it to lower its price to compete with Samsung. \n\nOn the topic of Samsung, their fab is the only threat to TSMC. However, it has been shown from time to time that TSMC process is better, in terms of performance and power. Apple once used both TSMC and Samsung to produce one of their iPhone processor. You can Google the result, but basically TSMC wins in every metrics.\n\nIntel on the other hand, is a closed fab meaning they do not produce chips for other companies. They only make their own stuff. So even they figure out their 7nm, it is not a threat to TSMC. On top of that there is no capacity in TSMC for Intel (said TSMC). \n\nThere are many other fabs in Taiwan outside of TSMC. And they are all getting the benefit from TSMC being at full capacity. It will be interesting to see if they can take all those orders in and grow or TSMC will increase its capacity faster.\n\nOther ealier concern is China. It is spending a lot of resources in chip manufacturing. However, this is no long a issue because of US sanctions. ASML and other key equipment manufacturers are not allowed or limited to sell to China. This basically put a chock hold on Chinese fans. Unless they can develop their own equipment, there is no chance for them to catch up to Samsung or TSMC.\n\n\nThis is my two cents. I'm increasing my holdings whenever I can on a 2~3% dip day. I don't see any competition in the next 5~10 years minimum.\n\n\nTLDR: This world need ICs. TSMC has 55% share in it. So you want in then buy TSMC. This is not going to fall into the hand of China, or there will be greater concern than TSMC share price.",

        "body": "Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it\u2019s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that  Incident Response hours aren\u2019t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I\u2019ll take this as a bullish sign. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They\u2019ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles (with some duplicates in there).  \n\nBack of the napkin calculations are... with many of these senior roles sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At an 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel are a recurring revenue stream so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. \n\nAny upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I\u2019m not expecting much. \n\nFinally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn\u2019t confirmed these rumors, he hasn\u2019t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto. \n\nI\u2019m long with shares, considering LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",

This means that even with superior hardware, AMD may not be the best choice for buyers.\n\nLarge: Fab capacity. AMD is reliant on TSMC for product delivery, and with Intel and Apple both moving production into TSMC, the ability to meet demand is even more limited. Product shortages can torpedo sales. We are already seeing this with graphics card shortages globally, and the anemic rollout of the next gen consoles. Demand for chips with smallest gates far out straps production.\n\nFurther, Intel's fab problems run deep, due an idiot CEO who hasn't been properly investing in Intel's in house fabs, putting Intel at a direct competitive disadvantage. Intel is likely to seek more fab capacity at TSMC for 5nm and 3nm because they are incapable of doing it themselves without investing billions to catch up.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.extremetech.com/computing/315186-apple-books-tsmcs-entire-5nm-production-capability\n\nhttps://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/intel-set-to-outsource-select-cpu-production-tsmcs-5nm-process/",

But I am pretty knowledgable in tech, so figured I'd comment.\n\nI think AMD can (note, not *will*, but has the potential to) equal or exceed Nvidia within 5 years. Their rastorization performance is basically on par with Nvidia right now from what I remember, now they just need to figure out ray tracing and a DLSS equivalent (which they are going to add to current gen cards in the future, if they haven't already). If they get those down, then they're a true competitor. The big problem is if the customers will follow them. Nvidia has been so dominant for so long, I think the market will lag behind AMD's performance. Right now that doesn't matter too much, as both have major supply issues. However, more and more major companies using AMD's will definitely bolster them outside of their consumer supply. Nvidia is a bit behind in that aspect from what I can tell. Both AMD and Nividia are in good spots, it's whether or not you believe AMD can make up ground soon.\n\nI think Intel is in a rough spot. AMD is currently beating them in current programs with their CPUs. However, AMD's major advantage is core counts, and most programs aren't yet optimized to make use of all of those cores. When they start to do that, there won't be competition, the gap will increase. I read somewhere that Intel is working on phasing out their 14nm manufacturing, which should help them come back. But combine their losses to AMD with both Apple and Microsoft (allegedly, for the latter) shifting towards in-house ARM chips (who were both large Intel purchasers), and they really need to innovate if they want to get back on track.",

Is it allowed to operate more or less as it was, except with more pressure to hand over it's trade secrets to China?  Does China get first pick of it's output?  Does it get straight up nationalized?  Does it get destroyed in the fighting?

If 5G can deliver consistently low-latency, high bandwidth to mobile devices then being able to back UI delivery on mobile with cloud edge compute muscle is going to take AR to a whole different level in both directions (machine learning/vision analysis of mobile device data input, graphical overlays , realtime speech translation, etc.).",

They poached some senior level R&amp;D personel from TSMC. 10 Years later, Samsung has shown significant growth. Hard to judge the impact, but we joke about Samsung's transistors look like TSMC's so maybe they did copy  some.\n\nThat same R&amp;D person later moved to China SMIC (with God knows how many others, since China pay a lot more than Taiwan). I think it did save them a lot of time to not having to build everything from the ground up. However, semiconductor manufacturing is no joke. It takes years of experience to perfect, to know what to do, to enhance yield, to develop new technology. They may be able to do 14nm or 10nm, but them to be the leader and to develop new technology is very questionable to me. (I have interfaced with a few foundries like TSMC, UMC, ST, Lfoundry, towerjazz, etc. TSMC impressed me, ST are good, Towerjazz has yield issue, and I don't want to talk about the others...)\n\nMy point is, China is already doing what you said and will continue to do it (Taiwanese companies are very familiar with that). But it is still a very difficult task to pull off. Even if they do, I don't think it will be a problem in the next 5~10 years (looking at you Intel, where is the 10nm).",

Am I too spread out?\n\nCurrently I have:\n\n* AAPL - 3 @ $134 (Seemed like a stable long term investment)\n* AMD - 10 @ $87 (I'm more of an Nvidia/Intel person myself, but AMD has been giving them both runs for their money.)\n* DKNG - 2 @ $58 (With more states legalizing online gambling this seemed like it might be good?)\n* *Redacted bc automod*- 13 @ $7 (This one I will admit I got on hype alone which might be dumb. But did hear this could be good in the long run with their Lidar tech)\n* NOK - 9 @ $5 (Also another hype stock, but the talks of their 5G contracts in the EU made it also sound like a good long hold)\n* I also have 2 stocks RH gave me that add up to like $10 combined. Removed their names because it triggered the automod to remove the post.\n\n\nShould I consolidate my portfolio? Or maybe even just convert to an ETF? Any opinions are appreciated. Thank you for your time",

Reducing the process size results in increased transistor density and reduced energy requirements. So theoretically, if Intel were on a 7nm process, they should be quite a bit better than AMD  in both processing power and energy efficiency, just like they were in the mid 2010's when AMD was the one dragging their feet on innovation.",
