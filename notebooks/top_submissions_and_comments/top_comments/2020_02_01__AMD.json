It seems like most of the population is oblivious to economic volatility and change. Are we the 10%?",

We're all aware that this insane bull run isn't going to last forever, but nobody wants to be the idiot bear that blows their entire portfolio on QQQ puts, trying to do what Harvard educated hedge fund managers have been trying to do since the invention of the derivative. We've watched this thing go up and up and up, and anything less than a 1% week on week DOW increase feels like a pullback. Nothing can rock this market, not assassinations, not pandemics, not earnings misses, not a full scale nuclear attack. Stocks are trading at record high P/E's, with popular tickers like AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, AMD, and GOOG going fucking parabolic. In this market, anyone who's not an idiot is making money, but the question on every non-idiots's mind is:\n\nHow long will this last?\n\nSome people will try to sway you with charts and graphs, talking about market indicators, yield curve inversion, put/call ratios, and other bullshit that's hasn't predicted the past, and will continue to not predict the future. What I do know is that the stock market is a hot topic right now. Friends that haven't said a word about stocks before seem to be opening Robinhood accounts with the hopes of getting rich. If you look at google trends, you'll see that terms like \"options\", \"robinhood\", and even \"wallstreetbets\" are exploding in popularity. Everyone wants in on the action right now, and when everyone is getting in, it's time for non-idiots to get out.",

They had a teaser with a C-130 dropping people and a gas ring and people are 100% sure (reasonably so) that this is a BR trailer. Combine that with the already high fan base of the new CoD game (myself included) and it  could make them some money.\n\nThat being said over 60% of what they earn is from mobile games so that's really where the money is. If there's news I don't know about a new Candy Crush game or something which is their bread and butter then maybe.\n\nI have no idea what this guy thinks is going to make it explode unless he has tunnel vision thinking the ~3 fully populated streamer servers on WoW classic are making them anything more than chump change.",
