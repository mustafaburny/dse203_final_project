Cisco's stock is trading at roughly 120 times Mr. Kelly's earnings' estimate of $1.13 per share.  \nThe multiple, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a number that places a value on a stock. It is a ratio of the price of the stock to the profit of a company expressed per shares outstanding.  \n\"A low P/E usually signals investors are uncomfortable,\" Mr. Kelly said.  \nAs a reference, in 2000 Cisco's multiple of 120 compares to Microsoft Corp.'s multiple of 55 and Intel Corp.'s multiple of 42. Yet their values are below Cisco.  \n\"One of the reasons investors value Cisco so highly right now is that, unlike Microsoft, Cisco doesn't have the uncertainty of a Justice Department settlement--it's a much cleaner situation,\" Mr. Kelly said. \"Second, Cisco has had a tremendous track record of continuous upside surprises. And Cisco is viewed as opening several new markets, the biggest of which is optical, which is expected to be an explosive market.\"  \nPerfect returns  \nPaul Weinstein, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, believes a $1 trillion market capitalization (stock price multiplied by shares outstanding) is within reach in a few years. He said Cisco's stock has increased 1,000 times, a perfect 100 percent annual return since it launched its IPO in 1990.  \n\"We humbly submit that over the next two to three years, Cisco could be the first trillion dollar market cap company--and don't think they wouldn't love it,\" Mr. Weinstein wrote in his \"strong buy\" recommendation.  \nAs of March 14, Microsoft's market cap stood about $510 billion, compared with Cisco's $465 billion, which is threefold the annual revenue of the state of California.  \nMichael Neiberg, lead analyst in the communications equipment sector for Chase Hambrecht &amp; Quist in New York, said Cisco is turning a lot of investors long-term.  \nRecommended  \nTechnology  \nRedwood City-based Jasper Therapeutics drops nearly 19% in Wall Street debut  \nTechnology  \nIonQ sets sights on new growth targets after going public  \nTechnology  \nTesla is launching a lottery with a $10,000 prize to encourage workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19  \n\"If you had picked a price point to sell \\[high\\] at anytime in the past 10 years, you would have been wrong,\" he said. \"They have such an impressive track record of growing ... that the financial community isn't thinking in terms of a multiple of what they're earning this year, but what they will be earning three or four years down the line.\"  \nAn opposing view  \nThere are market watchers that are dubious, however, about the high valuation assigned to a large-cap company like Cisco.  \nJeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School, wrote this week in The Wall Street Journal that the high valuation assigned to large-cap technology stocks--Cisco is at the top of his list--are unsustainable.  \n\"History has shown that whenever companies, no matter how great, get priced above 50 to 60 times earnings, buyer beware,\" Mr. Siegel wrote.  \nHis statistical research concludes when companies reach big-cap status--ranked in the top 50 by market capitalization--their ability to generate long-term double-digit growth slows dramatically.  \nYoung bucks in a different field  \nLooking at multiples of high-flying valley gazelles that compete with Cisco is almost meaningless.  \nTake Juniper Networks Inc. The firm has rapidly gained a 15 percent market share in the high-end routing market, cracking a lucrative niche dominated by Cisco.  \nJuniper posted its first profit for the fourth quarter of 1999 of 3 cents per share. Extrapolating that performance out to a 12-month period would conservatively give the company a profit of 12 cents per share. But with its stock price closing March 14 at $245 a share, the upstart company can boast a P/E ratio of 2,042.  \nIs its stock more valuable than Cisco's? In a word, yes. At least Wall Street believes so.  \nBut both Messrs. Neiberg and Kelly note that what Wall Street is valuing is relatively short-term growth--the explosiveness of these new valley firms.  \n\"For the early adopters and early movers, Wall Street is willing to assign these values,\" Mr. Neiberg said.  \nBut he added that what Wall Street is betting on is extremely rapid growth for a year or two. As the rapid growth slows, the multiples will fall into a more earthly range.  \nComparing P/E ratios of other industry giants in different technology spaces may be tempting to investors, but Mr. Neiberg is wary of mixing two different dynamics.  \n\"Both \\[Microsoft and Intel\\] are benefiting from the PC revolution,\" Mr. Neiberg said. \"But they are in a much more moderate growth phase. The more rapid growth is to interconnect all those computers, and Cisco is the standard bearer for all that interconnection.\"  \nYou can reach Mr. Taylor at dtaylor@amcity.com.",
