Here is a response I made directed to a mod and the mod team about them and the new rules/way the sub will be run in the time being. \n\n&gt;Yall arent being too harsh, the issue is yall are being completely inconsistent. Heres some examples. \n\n&gt;Pin a comment saying low quality content etc will result in a ban. Same day a mod pins a comment of a balloon boner?\n\n&gt;Rule was already no penny stocks, then a mod approves the \ud83c\udf32\ud83d\udd28thread and makes a comment saying they're approving it. Even though they know the reason penny stocks are banned \n\n&gt;Pin new comments saying influx of users will require cracking down. But mod a twitch thot \n\n&gt;Bans being handed out to users who have been here 6+ months for personal grudges or dislike, not for breaking any sub rules. \n\n&gt;I can keep going if you'd like. \n\nI get the cracking down. 100% understand it and agree something needed to be done. But to add to this comment. Posts should have been blocked from reaching all the minute wsbgod went viral and for a week straight the sub had the highest growth for all of reddit (but this was also around the same time the book was released. Funny how that works) . \n\nTheres no consistency in the bans\n\nThe rules still apple to the weekend thread? Basically every other major sub has a free talk thread where anything goes. \n\nI would suggest maybe making a free talk thread non market related where people can shitpost and meme and have a serious more market related thread. I really do think that would work. Enforce the new penny stock/pump and dump etc rules on the serious thread. Allow a thread for people just wanting to chat after hours without fear of getting banned. \n\nI think everyone can agree the handling of the sub and the last couple of weeks have been an absolute train wreck. I still beleive things can be fixed and this sub become enjoyable again, but the mods have really got to be consistent for this to happen, or the sub will turn into stocktwits for high schoolers asking if options trade on weekends. \n\n--winkerpack",

        "body": "Disney might modestly go up next week. If the pandemic situation gets serious though, we'll have lows before we have highs. But yeah if I were you and in the red with DIS, I'd also just wait. It's not a penny stock, or a meme or fad stock, it's a solid company.\n\n&gt;What am I missing that you guys all seem to know?\n\nEh I've made some of the same mistakes you've made, so I dunno what I know, but my working thesis is that:\n\n1. First time when I heard \"buy on weakness and sell on strength\" it really didn't get through my thick skull. You gotta buy when there's a panic selloff, and sell when everyone is patting each other on the backs that stonks only go up.\n2. Patience. When there's a sharp move up or down in the stock, it's always an overreaction first. If the movement is down, it'll recover (unless something fundamentally horrible happened, like accounting fraud and their entire ER is bullshit), if it's up, it'll fall a little (like after positive ER). Trade accordingly. Don't panic sell on a drop. WAIT. And sell when it recovers. Of course for this to work you need to know the dip is not fundamental and long-term.\n\nI buy companies on a long-term uptrend, when they have a short term dip. Then wait for recovery.\n\nOr if you invest long-term, pick companies not bothered by mostly anything, like Microsoft. Virus? China? Fuck if they care. Microsoft is on a roll. Steady subscription revenue, cloud services.\n\nI'm not saying invest in Microsoft, but basically play it safe. One YouTuber likes to say \"trade like a spoiled brat. Don't just buy anything, be extremely picky and very spoiled, buy only the best stocks on the safest entry points\". And I mean, he's right.\n\nWhat level you bought Disney at? I mean it's not like they're going bankrupt. The company is doing great. But it's seeing a bit of uncertainty right now around their parks business due to the virus, and Disney+ is a lot of air right now due to trial and short-term subscribers (although I think it'll do well by end of year).\n\nApple might drop on next ER (logistics, company is fine) so after ER might be a good entry point, that's another solid company, but I'd be a bit cautious next 2-3 months.\n\nAnyway I've started just naming random stocks. I don't know shit. But h**ave patience and prefer repeated small wins, over risky big wins**. Small repeated wins get to the finish line.\n\nCase in point, buying before ER and selling after is risky. But you know what's safe? Buying DIS few weeks before ER, selling 1-2 days BEFORE ER, when it peaks. This way it doesn't matter that the ER is. You trade expectations, not results.",

You just have to be very proactive in buying offsetting positions when a trade isn\u2019t going your way. Don\u2019t buy too close to the money and make sure you have a decent amount of capital. As I commented above, if something isn\u2019t going your way either sell immediately or if you feel it\u2019s too late buy a longer dated offsetting position to mitigate losses. It\u2019s actually insanely easy to turn a quick profit. Be cognizant of what\u2019s going on in the news and if you\u2019re selling spreads on ETFs just know what they\u2019re made of. I\u2019ll be posting weekly updates on what I\u2019m doing starting tomorrow. I\u2019m also doing some Yolos but making sure they\u2019re at least 2 weeks out and selling quick once I make 750-1500.",

When you first start out you are going to literally bust your ass until you hit the point you can hire a driver to deal with the work.\n\nLets say you have a machine that takes 20 cases of soda to fill and you have 20 machines around. Your talking about 400 cases at 20 pounds a case. 8000 pounds.\n\nYour moving 8000 pounds at the store to your cart, from your cart to the truck, from the truck to the hand truck, from the handtruck into the machine. Can your back handle 32000 pounds and bending up and down each time you refill? Obviously rough math, but you get the idea.\n\nDo you have a vehicle that can handle this?\n\nRepair is dirty cheap if you have good machines and a good mechanic. Very easy to swap boards, validators, etc.\n\nStay away from snack and food machines if you are just starting out. Hassle to be cognizant of perishables and dates, etc. Need to consider how well candy holds as well - are you in Florida and have candy/chocolate machines?\n\nYou can absolutely crush it in the right location - but keep in mind its not get rich quick. It's get rich slow and by making sure your machines are all in a relatively close proximity (at least to start).\n\nWhen we do the rough math it usually comes out that 50% of sales price is profit. So for $1 can of soda, $.50 goes towards gas, products cost, commission, operational expense etc.\n\nHow do you plan on moving the machines? Each time you move its $150-$200. Where do you store them when not using?\n\nJust food for thought :)",
