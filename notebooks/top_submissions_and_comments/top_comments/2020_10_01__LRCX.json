        "body": "That is when factors that Nikola can't control come into effect. Their positioning on everything I think is to prop stock price until then, which used to include the now canceled Nikola World. \n\nThings that happen in Dec.\n\n1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. \n2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.\n\nQuarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. \n\nRest is storytime:\n\nIf this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.\nSell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. \n\nSo how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the \"new management\" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. \n\nSo the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:\n\nhttps://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98\n\nOkay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.\n\nFantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.\n\nBut there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.\n\nNow we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone. \n\nI know that was long story time. But if you believe they are fraud, then think about what you would need to do if you knew it was a fraud and had millions locked up and you wanted out with out seeing the inside of a jail cell.",

Once your cash heavy and people start to question you, take that cash and \u201cpartner\u201d with reputable names. GM and CNH Industrials are, to my understanding, just providing services. Now if nikola admitted that they don\u2019t have the expertise to build what they promised, they would be done with. \n\nThe trick is to call these contracted companies \u201cpartners\u201d.  Partner suggests a joint venture where both parties are contributing to a mutually beneficial goal. In the case of Nikola, the \u201cpartners\u201d have no skin in the game, if Nikola folded tomorrow, all they would lose is a paycheck for services. Now if your a contractor working for another company, you\u2019d be stupid to admit there is a problem publicly, so these companies express optimism knowing they have nothing to lose. All this builds investors confidence as the house of cards keeps being built.\n\nI could be wrong, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what this is. I am short Nikola.",

That doesn't seem to be coming to an end anytime soon either given all the delays they've had. Last they said, they won't have 7nm chips out until 2022! At that point, AMD will be rolling out 5nm chips.      \n   \nThen you can talk about the multiple security vulnerabilities they've had with in their chips, with their only solution being \"Turn off hyper treading, that will fix it\". Eventually they released some fixes, but this also hurt CPU performance. \n\nI'm not going to say INTC is a sinking ship or anything, I just don't really see them as being that undervalued.",

While many restaurants died because they couldn't weather the initial shutdown attempts against covid, there are many which are barely surviving because they get to have out door dining.\n\nAs the weather cools, out door dining will be far less feasible, causing even more to die at this point.\n\nIt's such a shame, if everyone wore masks and socially distanced from the beginning, and stayed home if they had covid, then this wouldn't have happened. We would have been in a much better position now.",

And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted.

The company filed bankruptcy and as part of the restructuring dropped their outstanding shares into warrants, at a conversion of 2.5%. The warrants are good for three years for the new ticker, DEN. Long story short, the company fucked you big time. Turned your shares into shit, restructured, launched new shares at around $17 a share and now have a shit ton of cash and you have a warrant for the new stock. Good luck. \n\nPlus side, the warrants are up 96% premarket today, told you to buy the dip....lol",

There is a reason they have already been able to enforce the patents against random Chinese companies.\n\nDon't believe me? Lets look at what happened when Google Waymo, one of the largest companies in the world, tried to sue Uber for LIDAR patent infringement:\n\n[https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html](https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) **rejected 53 out of 56 claims in Waymo's 936 patent**...One of the reasons for the rejection is that some of the core design solutions were **previously patented by another lidar manufacturer, Velodyne**. Coincidentally, Velodyne used to sell its lidars to Waymo before the latter decided to build a product of its own from scratch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Theoretically, **Velodyne could now accuse Waymo of infringing its own 558 patent**, based on the USPTO's recent ruling.",
