So i'm in a need of advice here, do i start growing positions in companies with a fast dividend growth(HD,LOW,MA,V,NKE,MSFT,AAPL,NEE,UNH etc) right now to have a nice yield on cost in the future, or just go pure growth and increase positions in AMZN,GOOG,TSLA,FB,SQ. Am i right in thinking that getting in those companies now for future yield on cost is a smart move? I'm a total amateur by the way. Would really appreciate some advice.",
