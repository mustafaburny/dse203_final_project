I was pretty interested in it before, but when I got a bunch more free time during the quarantine I really started to research into my investments more.\n\n60%-TSLA\n\n   I think in the future Tesla could easily be a trillion+ dollar company because of their domination in EVs, energy generation and storage, and autonomous vehicles.\n\n20%-FB\n\n   I originally bought Facebook after privacy issues left it severely undervalued. Now after coming back up I still see opportunity in their continued monetization of Facebook and Instagram and the prospect of future monetization of WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook Marketplace, Instagram Shops, and the potential of Oculus.\n\n10%-SWKS\n\n   The 5G revolution will be very beneficial to Skyworks Solutions as smartphone manufacturers will rely on them and their products. Other opportunities like more connected cars(entertainment becoming essential after FSD) could also help future profits for Skyworks.\n\n20%-Cash\n\n   I\u2019m in the process of finding other stocks, but have been very picky. Ones on my radar right now are Square, Spotify, and Bitcoin. If you have any recommendations or comments of any kind I\u2019m ready to hear them.",

I want that stability holding heavier weight in my portfolio. \n\nI have positions in 5 chipmakers (AMD, MRVL, NXPI, QRVO, SWKS) as well as the SOXX ETF. Those combine to be about as heavy as MSFT. \n\nI have AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL, and TSLA. Those combine to be a little heavier than MSFT. \n\nBABA, MSFT, chipmakers, FAANGs, TSLA = about 60%. The rest is Chinese EV, clean energy, recovery stocks, and smaller-cap longshots and speculative plays. \n\nI consider today a bad day, because I'm only up 0.5% right now while the S&amp;P is up 0.7 and Nasdaq is over 1.5. I'm underperforming for now.

He needs to start looking at stocks that do well in bad times or slightly risky  with enough cash on the sidelines to see themselves through this, I need stock little thrive by 2023 that will be back on their feet paying the dividends again imo. \n\nhere is the stocks i would buy then come back in 2023  Walgreens Dropbox Enbridge skyworks Solutions and Wynn resorts simply sell that crap you have and  buy some of those stocks and hold on to them till 2023 for a nice profit along with a nice dividend dividends from wynn and Walgreens and Enbridge.   you've got two choices you can sell and buy new stocks or funds or you can sell and dollar cost average  back in over 8 weeks like I said just because of markets are a bit in turmoil at the moment  or you can simply sell and rebuy  that's your two choices there is no third choice  of sitting on on the sidelines ready to time the market at the bottom it's a well-known crazy plan  for very weak investors that's where you miss the best bet trading days of the year by doing that.",
