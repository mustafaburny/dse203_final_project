Keep this in mind\u2026 This is the biggest threat to the communist party since the Tiananmen Square massacre. An absolute market crash would throw fuel on the fire, so what do they do? They are liquidity, they ban short selling, and I would imagine mandate the big money holders in the country to buy in. I have zero proof for this but it would be a great way to chain them to the oars of the ship, make sure the critical stakeholders Who you need aren\u2019t selling and running. An 8% route suits their narrative well\u2026 That it\u2019s a problem, a big problem, but not one that can\u2019t be contained. \n\nOutside of my theory, let\u2019s not pretend that the market over there purely reflects supply and demand for equity. My biggest curiosity is how long it\u2019s going to take for cracks to start showing\n\nI realize how this sounds, like I\u2019m trying to reassure myself a position that I\u2019m currently holding. The only short position I have is on Delta Airlines, I had to have some money in YANG and EDZ, but its shares. I\u2019m not playing with too much, my big move is just holding mostly cash right now. \n\nMy advice\u2026 Tomorrow is a blessing for bulls. Exit your positions. Cash out. If anything just go cash gang for at least a week or two. I mean it\u2026 This is a great community but you guys really should avoid the temptation to see this as some sort of proof that things are under control.",

This is a very bullish move, obviously, and suggests that the near-term correction is over.\n\n[VIX is nearing the bottom of its recent trend again,](https://imgur.com/MeN9zeU) and because I've never had to draw crayons when both US and China are doing repo, I'm not sure how to interpret market movement. Based on previous history, Feb is not a good month for trading-- however, the way price action moved today, it's incredibly bullish. Almanac Trader posted recently about the [history of a down/down Friday Monday,](https://jeffhirsch.tumblr.com/post/190503775588/djia-down-fridaydown-monday-inflection-point-in) saying that if losses are recovered then generally the \"correction\" is complete. In my post when the drop first occurred, [I questioned if we would go below 320 with US repo in play.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewuvf8/weekend_discussion_thread_january_31_february_2/fg4oacw/) With China repo now also in play, and just looking at crayons, in theory we should be back on a bullish path.\n\nThe most telling sign will be if we drop within this week back to the correction trendline (~323), whether we bounce back up. We may never drop back to there, but if you believe in this reversal, then if we do fall there that would be the time to buy the dip again. \n\nIf you want to be conservative, watching for PMI tomorrow and unemployment on Friday will be telling. Both of those are projected to be good. If you're not conservative and want to find ways to spend your TSLA tendies, past history suggests when there's a recovery like this we're supposed to go past ATH. The crayons say the same thing: by the time we rechallenge resistance again, the trendline is almost 334, which would indeed be ATH.\n\nGood luck to everyone and eat a tendie in honor of the Musk. He seems to have made many of you get your portfolio less red today.",
