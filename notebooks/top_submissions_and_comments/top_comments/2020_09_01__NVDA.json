        "body": "SoftBank Nears $40 Billion Deal to Sell Arm Holdings to Nvidia\n\nUnion of Arm, Nvidia would create a powerhouse in the chip industry\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank recently has been involved in a series of big asset sales after being under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. 9984 1.03% is nearing a deal to sell British chip designer Arm Holdings to Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said \u2014 assuming it isn\u2019t derailed at the last minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world\u2019s smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics\u2014and play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year\u2019s biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm\u2019s customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals. Most or all of that is already under way or completed and its shares are up more than 20% this year. Among the sales: big chunks of its holdings in China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and T-Mobile US Inc. following the wireless provider\u2019s merger with Sprint Corp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank has also purchased options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks this year. The sheer size of the bet has had an outsize effect on the overall stock market, driving prices higher, the Journal has reported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt SoftBank, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been working with a small team to negotiate the Arm deal including the chief executive of the chip company, Simon Segars, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, as well as Rajeev Misra, CEO of the firm\u2019s giant Vision Fund, and Akshay Naheta, another executive at the fund.",

It bounced off the 50 day moving average and immediately reversed.  This dip happened because of a few giant scumbags taking all their tendies off the table, leaving the entire market holding their wee-wees. NDAQ bounced last week off the 50 DMA and  stopped a couple points shy of the 120 moving average yesterday. Everyone thought it was over. Well, it dipped AGAIN. It crossed the 120 day average, which is typically a pretty damn bearish sign. NDAQ is currently sitting well below the 120 day moving average and it's like we went back in time to June levels.\n\nLet's tally all the bad things, eh?\n\n\\-VIX is looking fuck. Google Backwardation. [VIX Futures.](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VI*0/futures-prices)\n\n\\-We are sitting in a massive gamma trap. Too many calls. Not enough puts. Too little liquidity. Everyone hodling because bull market.\n\n\\-Everything is inflated out the ass. Are things like NVDA and AAPL the giant fucking companies their stocks say they are? Well, yeah. And eventually, they'll 100% grow into those evaluations. Tech obviously isn't going anywhere. But what about smaller companies like TWLO, ZS, ZM, etc? Absolutely not. Those stocks are a couple years ahead of where they should be.\n\n\\-Everyone now knows that a few whales pumped up the market over the last couple months by fucking over the options market. Nothing is behind most of these prices. It's scary as hell from an investor standpoint.  You really wanna pump money into a market that got bicycle pumped to shit by JPOW, Mango Man, and some scuffed bullshit when a pandemic is raging on, not getting any better (Brazil, India, etc) with an extremely controversial election coming up? FUCK NO.\n\n\\- Dollar looking like hot shit.\n\n\\-No stimulus that's worth a shit. Mortgage defaults are at like 4.5%. I'm 99% sure that's why RKT crashed so fucking hard. Yeah, they made an absolute killing, but MORTGAGE DEFAULTS.  RKT is a fantastic investment in a normal environment.\n\n\\-Consumer spending  and confidence are going down like hell.\n\n\\-Most of the hedgies and huge portfolios have definitely made their profits for the year and are going to be looking for a reason to exit the market while it still has legs.\n\n\\-Metals. Look at em. They're doing that 2012 and 1980's bullshit again. Getting all of the same indicators.\n\nI am going to be completely straight-faced and unsurprised if we get a hot circuit breaker tomorrow. All it's gonna take now is another few percent before that snowball gets tumbling.\n\nThis market is manic as fuck. I might be biased because I'm loaded out the ass in bear stuff for a change, but this does not look good. I would love to hear other opinions.",

The real question of their growth comes from their Foundry platform which caters toward the commercial sector. The investor day video mentioned that they are slowly decreasing the time it takes to integrate their software into a new company. This is promising because it's been said that each new application of the software into a new company is somewhat a new build in itself.\n\nI think that those who've actually worked with the software have the most credibility since they can speak to its effectiveness. I've never worked with the software, but I like the idea of being able to run a business around it. I don't think it'll ever be as ubiquitous as Microsoft Office since the price and effort to start is pretty damn high.\n\nTheir real obstacle is trying to get more companies to hop onboard. With the controversy behind the history of the company, that remains to be seen. Since Palantir is the subject of frequent controversy, the \"bad\" press could serve as catalysts for the stock. I could give a fuck what the software is used for, I just see that it works and has potential to grow.\n\nIMO, I don't think either bear or bull can predict this one.

This matters because Microsoft needs to win consumers over this November. The last generation of Xbox had poor quality exclusive games which led to Sony acquiring the lion's share of consumers for their PS4 due to their strong exclusive games. This will roll over onto the next generation this fall with Sony showing strong exclusives and backwards compatibility.

        "body": "That is when factors that Nikola can't control come into effect. Their positioning on everything I think is to prop stock price until then, which used to include the now canceled Nikola World. \n\nThings that happen in Dec.\n\n1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. \n2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.\n\nQuarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. \n\nRest is storytime:\n\nIf this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.\nSell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. \n\nSo how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the \"new management\" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. \n\nSo the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:\n\nhttps://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98\n\nOkay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.\n\nFantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.\n\nBut there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.\n\nNow we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone. \n\nI know that was long story time. But if you believe they are fraud, then think about what you would need to do if you knew it was a fraud and had millions locked up and you wanted out with out seeing the inside of a jail cell.",

And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted. I just wish he would back away from financial markets, because that is not going to be about real economy and employers and employee. Not him tinkering with printing money and buying APPL bonds.\n\nHe is not wrong though.",

Long story short, the company fucked you big time.

Lets look at what happened when Google Waymo, one of the largest companies in the world, tried to sue Uber for LIDAR patent infringement:\n\n[https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html](https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) **rejected 53 out of 56 claims in Waymo's 936 patent**...One of the reasons for the rejection is that some of the core design solutions were **previously patented by another lidar manufacturer, Velodyne**. Coincidentally, Velodyne used to sell its lidars to Waymo before the latter decided to build a product of its own from scratch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Theoretically, **Velodyne could now accuse Waymo of infringing its own 558 patent**, based on the USPTO's recent ruling.",
