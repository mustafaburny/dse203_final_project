There's Oracle app that still requires shit JAVA and shits IE. As for Walmart, I'm truly baffled what it's going to do with Tiktok Either of these companies will be best served to keep Tiktok completely independent. If they try to absorb it, they will destroy it. Besides, the global Tiktok will eat up US Tiktok in few weeks. If you are  Tiktok thot, why would you aim for a small audience compared to the global audience?",
