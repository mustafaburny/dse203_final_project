Cathy can be overpaying for growth (and I think she is in most of her picks) but in some  she must just be right and I think she knows that she doesn't need to be right in 100% of them just on a few to be wildly successful, Just like what happen with Tesla, She had a bull target price of $7000 pre split ($1400 slit adjusted) and everyone thought her crazy and now you see her base case being the most common price targets for this year and her 2017's bull case being likely more and more (and I think it was a price target for 2024 so she still has time for Tesla to reach that valuation).\n\nAlso regarding Cisco, I don't particularly remember the \"bull case\" for Cisco that \"validated\" its price during the Dot Com bubble,  but I would argue if simplified  it would look like this \"everyone will be using the internet in the future so the company that has the technology that will allow everyone to be connected to the internet will be a goldmine\". Not a bad idea or logic other than the technology got commoditized and 20 years later everyone has a router in their house like people assumed in 1999/2000 but nobody cares what brand it is and the devices that actually keep us connected to the internet in the most convenient way (smartphones) is actually designed by the most valuable company in the world and its competitor doesn't even make the hardware at all (Google with Android).\n\nWhat people didn't saw in the 2000's with their \"bull case\" for Cisco (The creation of the smartphone and how it changed internet access from home to on the go was the biggest culprit here)  is the reason why Cisco hasn't recovered in share price because people bought into growth that never materialized . I agree you can overpay for growth but you will only be certain of it after the fact when your thesis is validated or completely changes for better or worse.  You can overpay for growth and you can also miss opportunities of decades or even lifetimes, this is why you have to double check your thesis if you are investing into this type of companies that will have massive growth in the future to see if the growth is actually there or not.",

        "body": "First, what's interesting is that I come from a similar background and had the same thinking for a long time. But the more I thought about it, the more I reconsidered. \n\nWhat's interesting is that the bust cycle for tech already happened. That was Cisco. Every industry has done this. Renewables did a decade ago. Now they're fairly mature revenue generating companies (FSLR off top of my head). \n\nI think with big tech, it's had those growing pains already. MSFT AAPL especially came back from the dead after that that bust. These are no Cisco. That died basically. Or Standard Oil. Or GM (which I think is reinventing itself nicely, but that's another story). Or INTC (which is dying...). AAPL MSFT AMZN especially have huge competitive advantages across industries, own Washington and continue to curb any attempt at serious regulation, and continue to create and recreate entirely new industries. Especially with huge profit margins, sticky revenue streams, and TAM that continue to multiply as they suck in every other industry in existence (I'm not kidding:AMZN still owns the cloud, and that's not an easy yoke to throw off for clients. MSFT has bought out gaming, AAPL into cars, which may or may not be good idea, and services like banking). They are in part infrastructure companies, too. They can't fail. Or the increasingly digitized economy fails. One Google outage cost the world billions. For all of that, I'm happy to pay the multiples you put out. They're peanuts. AAPL also has enough cash on hand and the acumen to spend it wisely that the Swiss Central Bank bought millions worth during covid crash (it was huge). You're investing in with something that has the power and wealth of a freaking nation state. Dying? No problem. FB bought out Instagram. \n\nMoats upon moats, and network effects. These are all something former giants didn't have, and not something that could be said of any former businesses that went bust. No one trick ponies here. \n\nNFLX isn't worthwhile in my opinion. Nor is TSLA. The ones I named are. For all the reasons I gave.\n\nIf you're concerned about valuations, you need to consider interest rates. Both Schiller and Buffett have talked about how given persistent low interest rates in the developed world, the equity premium right now is, well, not a premium. They're the only way to generate returns. And may well remain so.\n\nHere's a guy that's been consistently correct for the past two years on valuations and overall market behavior. He's spot on about the numbers. Very good recent article by him: https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/is-the-market-at-a-top\n\nI don't disagree with you. But to compare something like AAPL to Cisco or to Standard Oil is to completely misunderstand the nature of their businesses and their staying power and what they've become. And that's why Buffett continues to hold an ungodly amount. Did he buy the former giants? I'm sure you respect him, right? \ud83d\ude09",

I realize there are people using cabs (which range from $2-3 fare), but this is about getting people to ditch their current vehicles as well.\n\nMitigating that a bit, I doubt many individuals will want to actually own their own cars vs. just using the taxi service - and I think there will be operators like Uber and Lyft (or Tesla) running most of the market with their own assets.\n\nBut the price still needs to be &lt;$1.2 per mile for the economics to work out for people to want to dump their own cars. And that\u2019s assuming the current prices of cars, which would drop in parallel with per-mile prices dropping for AVs.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s saying an $11T opportunity - that would typically be market size (i.e. revenue per year), not market cap\u2026 and autonomous trucks are a stretch to label \u201ctaxis\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a forecast that sounds a lot like what Cisco bulls were saying about networking in 1999.

Tattooed Chef\u2019s signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. Understanding consumer lifestyle and food trends, and a commitment to innovation, allows Tattooed Chef to continuously introduce new products. Tattooed Chef provides great-tasting, approachable, and innovative products not only to the growing group of consumers who seek to adopt a plant-based lifestyle, but to any of the \u201cPeople Who Give a Crop\u2122\u201d.\n\nWhy Buy?\n\n- TTCF is one of the very few participants in the plant-based consume cyclical segment. This market is only set for growth as the convergence of a number of structural trends drive global diets away from meat. It's important for TTCF bulls to be cognizant of these trends to fully assess the direction of the market Tattooed Chef aims to capture.\n\n- TTCF's management had previously guided for full-year gross margin of 20% to 25% and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $2 million to $4 million. But now, management lowered guidance for gross margin to 16%-22% and guided for an adjusted EBITDA loss of $14 million to $17 million.\n\n- TTCF Revenue is expected to grow by 41.30% on average over the next 5 years. This is a very strong growth coupled with the fact that \"emissions from plant-based foods are 10 to 50 times smaller than those from animal products. Meat and dairy also account for around 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Essentially, if the world is to meet its target of limiting global warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C, radical changes in the global diet will be critical.\" This implies that demand will only continue to increase.\n\nPrices to look for: $16.14 - $17.58\nTTCF was recently hovering around the $30 price level and is an interesting stock as it has the lowest amount of competitors in it's niche segment of plant-based food providers. What is valuable about TTCF is the extremely low float it maintains and how the smallest catalyst can send this stock soaring for double digit gains. Definitely watch TTCF closely in the coming week.",

I've sold shares off in the $5-$20k range before; nothing larger.\n\nI just started researching investing and found that if I had invested in a tech ETF last year, like VOO, I could have gotten a 30+% return instead of a \\~5% return. This is ironic because my company is one of the holdings of VOO and now I feel like a dope for not ETF'ing my shares the moment they've been vesting. \n\nThis leads to two newbie questions:\n\n* If you had six figures worth of stock to move around, would you throw it into VOO instead of one of the individual holdings?\n* If I were to do the above, for reasons of preference, I'd be selling off all of my shares of company X on one brokerage platform and buying VOO on another brokerage platform. Is there a way to accomplish this as more of a transfer than a profit-taking (for tax purposes)? The overall intent is to keep all of that money invested, not to cash out of the market. This would be by far my largest sale so I'm especially cognizant of tax impact.\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "A draft bill to legalize medical cannabis in Mississippi could be taken up a special session in the legislature this month. \n\nBy Geoff Pender, Mississippi Today\n\nThe lead Senate and House negotiators working on a Mississippi medical marijuana program to replace the one shot down by the state Supreme Court say they\u2019re close to having a draft that could prompt a special legislative session, as early as this month.\n\n\u201cI believe we have basically most of the major issues resolved,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Blackwell, R-Southaven, who\u2019s leading the Senate\u2019s medical marijuana work. \u201cWe\u2019re very, very close.\u201d\n\nRep. Lee Yancey, R-Brandon, said, \u201cI would be surprised if there were not a special session soon, but that\u2019s not my call \u2026 I think at some point soon we will be ready to say to the governor that we have something we can work with.\u201d\n\nMississippi lawmakers are trying to reach consensus on a medical marijuana program after the state Supreme Court shot down one overwhelmingly passed by voters last year with ballot Initiative 65. The state Supreme Court ruled in May that the medical marijuana initiative and the entire ballot initiative process is invalid.\n\nGov. Tate Reeves (R) has sole authority to call lawmakers into a special session. He has said he would do so for a medical marijuana bill, but not before the House and Senate have general agreement on a proposal to avoid a long, drawn out session.\n\nBlackwell and Yancey had previously estimated a session could be called by mid-August. They said that might be pushed back, but that having one before the end of the month is still doable.\n\nNeither Blackwell nor Yancey would provide specifics of agreements they\u2019ve reached on taxation, licensing and other particulars of a program.\n\n\u201cI think we owe it to other legislators to let them have a chance to view and vet what we have worked on to this point,\u201d Yancey said. \u201cEach of us will have to get consensus to get 3/5 passage in both houses. We are cognizant of how important this is, that there are those our there who need this medication, and we are trying to put together a program we can be proud of \u2014 and know that we will have to tweak it year to year \u2014 but trying to get it as good as we can on the first push.\u201d\n\nBlackwell said: \u201cThey don\u2019t have a program right now, and I think we are going to give them a program that is better than the one from Initiative 65.\u201d\n\nKen Newburger, director of the Mississippi Medical Marijuana Association, said he\u2019s been in contact with Blackwell and Yancey, and is likewise confident an agreement, and a special session, will happen soon. Newburger said he believes lawmakers have taken input from medical marijuana advocates, patients and business leaders.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s been the most refreshing and surprising part of this whole legislative process, has been the willingness of the legislators in both chambers to reach out to people who have been advocating it, and patients who have been advocating it for years,\u201d Newburger said.\n\nNewburger said his association has four main points it wants lawmakers to retain from the defunct Initiative 65:\n\nTo allow broad patient access to various forms \u2014 smokable, edibles, pills, etc. \u2014 of cannabis products with varying levels of THC, the psychoactive agent in marijuana.\nFor certification of patients to remain in the hands of doctors, not \u201csome bureaucratic system.\u201d\nFor cultivation and dispensing of cannabis to be a \u201cfree market enterprise\u201d that allows broad participation and doesn\u2019t limit businesses with exorbitant fees and license costs.\nThat the program be self-funded, that fees collected for the program fund it.\nNewburger said he is optimistic lawmakers will work to enshrine these tenets of Initiative 65 into a new law.\n\nYancey said he believes the House will work to hew as closely to the voter-passed initiative as possible.\n\nThis story was first published by Mississippi Today.",
