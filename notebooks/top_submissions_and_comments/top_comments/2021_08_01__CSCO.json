Cathy can be overpaying for growth (and I think she is in most of her picks) but in some  she must just be right and I think she knows that she doesn't need to be right in 100% of them just on a few to be wildly successful, Just like what happen with Tesla, She had a bull target price of $7000 pre split ($1400 slit adjusted) and everyone thought her crazy and now you see her base case being the most common price targets for this year and her 2017's bull case being likely more and more (and I think it was a price target for 2024 so she still has time for Tesla to reach that valuation).\n\nAlso regarding Cisco, I don't particularly remember the \"bull case\" for Cisco that \"validated\" its price during the Dot Com bubble,  but I would argue if simplified  it would look like this \"everyone will be using the internet in the future so the company that has the technology that will allow everyone to be connected to the internet will be a goldmine\". Not a bad idea or logic other than the technology got commoditized and 20 years later everyone has a router in their house like people assumed in 1999/2000 but nobody cares what brand it is and the devices that actually keep us connected to the internet in the most convenient way (smartphones) is actually designed by the most valuable company in the world and its competitor doesn't even make the hardware at all (Google with Android).\n\nWhat people didn't saw in the 2000's with their \"bull case\" for Cisco (The creation of the smartphone and how it changed internet access from home to on the go was the biggest culprit here)  is the reason why Cisco hasn't recovered in share price because people bought into growth that never materialized . I agree you can overpay for growth but you will only be certain of it after the fact when your thesis is validated or completely changes for better or worse.  You can overpay for growth and you can also miss opportunities of decades or even lifetimes, this is why you have to double check your thesis if you are investing into this type of companies that will have massive growth in the future to see if the growth is actually there or not.",

        "body": "First, what's interesting is that I come from a similar background and had the same thinking for a long time. But the more I thought about it, the more I reconsidered. \n\nWhat's interesting is that the bust cycle for tech already happened. That was Cisco. Every industry has done this. Renewables did a decade ago. Now they're fairly mature revenue generating companies (FSLR off top of my head). \n\nI think with big tech, it's had those growing pains already. MSFT AAPL especially came back from the dead after that that bust. These are no Cisco. That died basically. Or Standard Oil. Or GM (which I think is reinventing itself nicely, but that's another story). Or INTC (which is dying...). AAPL MSFT AMZN especially have huge competitive advantages across industries, own Washington and continue to curb any attempt at serious regulation, and continue to create and recreate entirely new industries. Especially with huge profit margins, sticky revenue streams, and TAM that continue to multiply as they suck in every other industry in existence (I'm not kidding:AMZN still owns the cloud, and that's not an easy yoke to throw off for clients. MSFT has bought out gaming, AAPL into cars, which may or may not be good idea, and services like banking). They are in part infrastructure companies, too. They can't fail. Or the increasingly digitized economy fails. One Google outage cost the world billions. For all of that, I'm happy to pay the multiples you put out. They're peanuts. AAPL also has enough cash on hand and the acumen to spend it wisely that the Swiss Central Bank bought millions worth during covid crash (it was huge). You're investing in with something that has the power and wealth of a freaking nation state. Dying? No problem. FB bought out Instagram. \n\nMoats upon moats, and network effects. These are all something former giants didn't have, and not something that could be said of any former businesses that went bust. No one trick ponies here. \n\nNFLX isn't worthwhile in my opinion. Nor is TSLA. The ones I named are. For all the reasons I gave.\n\nIf you're concerned about valuations, you need to consider interest rates. Both Schiller and Buffett have talked about how given persistent low interest rates in the developed world, the equity premium right now is, well, not a premium. They're the only way to generate returns. And may well remain so.\n\nHere's a guy that's been consistently correct for the past two years on valuations and overall market behavior. He's spot on about the numbers. Very good recent article by him: https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/is-the-market-at-a-top\n\nI don't disagree with you. But to compare something like AAPL to Cisco or to Standard Oil is to completely misunderstand the nature of their businesses and their staying power and what they've become. And that's why Buffett continues to hold an ungodly amount. Did he buy the former giants? I'm sure you respect him, right? \ud83d\ude09",

For example, in the doghouse of stocks I wouldn't buy from the index, Cisco (they are basically asleep at the wheel, for about 8 years, no innovation, no growth), Intel (single digit growth), Visa (Square is growing quickly, MasterCard is growing better than Visa). Just to give a few examples.\n\nAlso, because these are indexes, they tend to look at more established companies and miss the exponential growth stage.",

Or at the very least,  a slower climb moving forwards. \n\nIf this is a decent amount that you are going to be investing, I recommend that you start of with at least half in a lump sum and then periodecly re-invest the next 24 months. Or 12. Or at least 6. I think you should make the innitial more VTI heavy and aventually end it in the 70-30. \n\nOr don't. This might be overthinking it wich is not really in tune with your tech heavy bogglehead approuch. I would add in a little VOO but I still like your picks. In the end, it properbly doesn't matter.",

You could have said this same thing during the August 2015 and December 2018 crashes, because the market is somehow always in a bubble.\n\nAnd honestly, you are showing your lack of knowledge trying to compare an IT company in a less established industry at the time that had dealt with interest rates at 5.5%, versus a digital advertising company that has 91% global market share in a near-zero interest rate environment.\n\nGoogle brings in $80B in Operating Income on a $1.8T Market Cap.\n\n'00 Cisco's financials are not even remotely comparable. They had only $20B in revenue on a $550B market cap.\n\nAs for cyclicality, there are always market corrections every so often. Let me know when marketing has a 10-year decline.\n\nPlease please please actually study up on the dot com crash and Microsoft/Cisco/Dell/Intel before trying to start comparing them to FAAMG on a stock forum.",

        "body": "Thanks for the well written post.   I disagree with it but I\u2019m happy to have the discussion.  \n\nFirst of all I should clarify that I am an infrastructure engineer for an internet company.  Not one of the biggest ones, but one you\u2019ve heard of.   So\none way that I follow the advice in your username is not to put all of my eggs in one basket by also investing heavily in tech.\n\nOn valuations, that was my ballpark estimate for big Tech.  I looked the numbers up just now and feel really good about them.   Here are the forward/trailing P/E\u2019s for these companies:\n\nAMZN   59/58\nAAPL    26/29\nGOOG  30/31\nMSFT   32/36\nFB         28/26\nNFLX    50/54\n\nThis averages to 38, without even including smaller and less mature growth tech.  Much less Tesla.\n\nAnd I personally believe that those P/E\u2019s are based on optimistically flawed macro assumptions, for reasons OP touched on.  \n\nI understand that P/E isn\u2019t the only measure of value and can even be a dangerous one (clearly $ZIM\u2019s 2021 P/E of under 2 is not sustainable).\n\nBut it pretty much boils down to what you\u2019re paying for a combination of sustainable earnings and growth potential.\n\nI know these are considered the best and most revolutionary businesses ever.  But I also know that the same thing has been said about most of the biggest businesses in history.  It was definitely said of Cisco in 1999, but also of IBM and GE and GM and Standard Oil and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  I majored in the history of technology, I\u2019ve always been interested in this phenomenon.\n\nThis week I have been reading David McCullough\u2019s history of the Panama Canal.   \n\nThe French Suez and Panama Canal companies were each by far the biggest IPO\u2019s in history. The same guy, Ferdinand de Lesseps, was the CEO both times.  The Suez was a legendary success, the Panama an abject failure.  A total loss for shareholders, who were still much better off than the perhaps 20,000 employees who died of malaria and yellow fever. \n\nThe French capital raises for the Panama Canal project in the 1880\u2019s remind me a great deal of recent going\u2019s on\n\nWe especially hear how it\u2019s different this time late in each business cycle.  And we are very late in this cycle.  I believe we are in the 12th year of it, from the stock market POV, because 2020 only produced a tiny blip and it was off to the races again.\n\n$SPX has returned over 18% CAGR since the 2009 bottom.  The highest ever *rolling* 10 year nominal return is about 20%, and that was in a little higher inflation regime than we had in the 2010\u2019s, along with much higher interest rates.  Thus I would posit that overall in the last 12 years we have seen the highest 10-year equity risk premium in history.  And roughly tied for the highest ever real returns.\n\nAnd that\u2019s using $SPX.  The Nasdaq 100 has been considerably better.  Meanwhile small caps are much more overvalued than big tech, with a higher P/E ratio.  A fair number of straight up zombies litter $IWM.\n\nI could go on for hours honestly.  It seems obvious to me that the overall US stock market must mean-revert, at least in real terms.\n\nMeanwhile I expect commodities, which reached historic relative lows in early 2020, to eventually continue\nto mean-revert the other way as they have generally been doing since late 2020.\n\nI don\u2019t know when it will happen.  This bubble is nothing compared to Japan in 1990.  I try to find investments that will do well regardless, and",

        "body": "Yeah that's understandable. The good hedges in that regard is that MAXN is originally the spin-off of SPWR's international assets. So although the US market is extremely lucrative for solar, MAXN has a lot of different revenue streams outside of the US. For instance they own 20% of a very large Joint Venture with a chinese semiconductor company, and as of now most of their revenue comes from outside of the states.\n\nSecond point is that the hype (or lack thereof) won't matter much if they sustain growth and turn cash flow positive. A good example of this is Enphase, still within solar admittedly with a different core business: once they turned positive in EBITDA the valuation has absolutely soared (feel free to take a look at ENPH stock for the last few yrs).\n\nMAXN has over a billion in tangible assets and fairly limited debt, in my opinion it is a hidden gem at these valuations.",

Since you seem to be trying to program something in an algorithm to estimate the future I would say you need to look into analysts recommendations, for the purpose of estimating the future they are the ones that big business use, big fish use.  In general if a stock (Revenues or Profits) are growing faster than the market, a higher P/E will follow, as people assume that growth will continue for longer.\n\nDiscounted Cash flow will work also but you always have an issue with the Pt+1 (again, this is where Analysts Recommendations will play a role).  An interesting stock to study and you will only need to study its trajectory for two year is ENPH.  Good luck!",

Me being from the outside looking in, the business model of installing solar panels in individual homes seems inefficient. Why don't companies and state governments  prefer a central solar farm and having consumers get tax credits from buying energy from solar companies? When coal or petrol generators came out no one thought to put them in every single suburban home. I understand that people can save on bills and increase housing valuations but is that enough to try to generate power on your own?\n\nI like to think that renewable energy will be part of the future but I am hesitant to invest in a solar ETF like TAN if most businesses are organized in an unfamiliar way.

I sold 33 shares at $199 the other day (just happened to check on my watch and boom) and bought them back at $162 a week later. Pretty volatile stock with a price target around $190 and all time high around $205. Like you said, it seems to push past that target then drop in the afternoon almost like clockwork. Cool little profit for my first time ever flipping though. Might use it to pick up on your square play after I analyze it.",
