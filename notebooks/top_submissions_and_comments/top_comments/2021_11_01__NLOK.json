        "body": "Didn't see the post before it was deleted but stumbled upon this doing my weekly digging on NLOK. Wrote this up shortly after they parted ways with Symantec and came to the same conclusion if they could execute. Completely agree with with really everything you've said and that they are undervalued as well as having minimal risk. In the past year/year and a half they've acquired Avast + Avira, hit  targets/exceeded them, have shown 7 quarters or sequential customer adds, are generating strong FCF for FY 22, trade well below market multiple, cybercrime growth expected to continue to increase, all seem pretty positive. The one concerning area for me was retention, which I didn't think was a huge deal but an area that could certainly be improved. \\~75% for first year promotional customers and \\~85% on the whole. Should certainly be able to improve this but if customers adds continue, not a huge deal. Otherwise, it's just marketing to help people understand why they should have the product and helping current customers understand the value they add. \n\nI still seem to think the general public looks at NLOK as just virus/malware protection when they now offer much more. The comparisons with Windows Defender and other free/freemium offerings no longer holds weight in my opinion but I do not believe NLOK has done enough to help potential and even current customers understand that (seems like a lot of potential investors as well). Suppose that Windows could add features to Defender or roll out free versions of what NLOK offers in their various packages, but certainly don't expect it. Seems like the competition is all on the corporate side and consumer side isn't all that intense, at least for the time being. Will be interesting to see how things play out.\n\nOf the street coverage it has, it's mostly positive. Reading through reports seems like analysts are still trying to get a grip on things they returned to growth. Will be fun to watch this play out. I'm with you though, pretty strong conviction here.",

Here is a list of accounts I have found in less than an hour of looking:\n\nu/Royal_Instance_4779, u/HistoricallyMeans, u/Ok-Constant8181, u/BuenaSmaily, u/SusanaChavarin, u/ConsciousInsects, u/badgereatingchips, u/HistoricallyMeans, u/CliffWoolum, u/GrantleyCarson, u/CarliEly, u/OkPerception8936, u/Actual-Marionberry57, u/SabineCoppin, u/PetraHembree, u/PetraHembree, u/JennyMickle, u/BarTraditional6305, u/MargueriteFenton, u/AshlyVogel, u/SondraDemaio, u/KatheKnuth, u/GlindaJorgenson, u/lingerersteles53, u/MikaelaShurtleffy, u/CaroylnCarmichael, u/amphorasnotionsw1, u/JacalynBerryman, u/CandyLouie24, u/ComprehensiveShip96, u/ComprehensiveShip96, u/AkenHoma, u/FelicitaNeedham, u/TennieBaudoin, u/TennieBaudoin, u/MarkEsper, u/Agapele36124, u/scablime, u/LavonaRaybon, u/GypsyHedley, u/LegitimateFigr, u/ChuRunyon, u/akhalwhocannotride, u/Rist-Online, u/AbbieDuval, u/irokrvulsantv5, u/JillianWhipple, u/Opposite_Party_5282, u/VivianaLuther, u/GertrudKirksey, u/TessaRozier, u/Educational-Tone-953, u/Alarmed_Ad6556, u/Early-Spot378, u/BulahShipman, u/CompetitiveGuider, u/JeanneAlter2, u/CeraunHgo, u/Aggravating_Fix_2898, u/AgnusGryder, u/IncreaseNo7739, u/Cool-Statement-6959, u/ncepiloper, u/CyndiRhyne, u/passpelly, u/NarcisaYazzie, u/ElfriedeLantermany, u/Asleep_Toe6177, u/RemediosGerhardt, u/Low_Profession_4407, u/EusebiaLubbersy, u/Choice-Many-9550, u/OnoctORE, u/Few_Fox_9491, u/ncepiloper, u/Grouchy_Dimension_55, u/Low-Ear4034, u/Choice-Many-9550, u/Scared-Soup-4550, u/ChingBlue, u/ElyseAburto, u/KaronSabin, u/ClaraPaules, u/InternalVersionr, u/ProfessionalHornet54, u/InterestingsBed, u/DecentSounds, u/KeithaSteuck, u/JonDyna965, u/NoProfessionalist, u/ImaginaryAirr, u/ArtisticShallot7754, u/NobukoFaw, u/JoblessJessica, u/redbate (possibly), u/LedditBe_2025 (possibly), u/PerisBensons (possibly), u/CryptoMeat3 (possibly), u/Royal_Instance_4779 (possibly), u/Optimal_Inspector_13 (possibly), u/KiyokoCajigas (suspended), u/YelenaOneal (suspended), u/GeorgianneRossetti (suspended), u/Zuppamaz1 (suspended), u/Adjacts444 (suspended), u/NoelQuintana (this one has no pumping comments yet, but has the crossposting with the above accounts in nextfuckinglevel.  This is perhaps a dormant account waiting to be used), u/ilfredLipford (same as prior)\n\nTake any name on this list, go to their comments, and copy the name of the OP of a post they comment in.  Come back to this list, CTRL F + CTRL V that name and you will find it almost every time.\n\nIt is much more engrained in digital coins than mining.  This is a very, very large coordinated effort and hard to believe it's from only one person due to the number of accounts.  My list is not comprehensive.  It really strikes me as multiple people's full time jobs.  It's not just the investing subreddits.  They are commenting on each others' posts in all sorts of subreddits:  parenting, sports, music, relationships, defaults, presumably in an attempt to disguise the accounts as more natural.",

A lot.\n\nSo we just go along for the ride, explicit &amp; deliberate \"value\" assessment be damned.  \n\nRemember Buffett - who had forever preached \"I only invest in what I know\" leading him to famously avoid tech - was just all of a sudden \"oh hey I'm making Apple by far my largest holding\"?\n\nApple is obviously an absurd cash machine and deserves a massive valuation, but is there any real reason it should be \"worth\" 2.6T instead of, say, 1.8T?\n\nNo.  But that's where the market movers have gone, so just join the ride there or wherever and make money alongside them.\n\n[This pretty much sums my entire point in video form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbBD7VIJ4cc&amp;t=48s).",

It's related and I hope some of you can find value in it.\n\nThe people saying \"this isn't a big deal\", I think that's disingenuous.  The people saying \"panic!\", that's also disingenuous.  The fact is, we don't know.  I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XtJQzkeAaY) to be very helpful.  He summarizes the potential issues with this new 'nu' variant:\n\n1. It may be more transmissible than other variants, including delta.  That would be shocking because delta is already highly transmissible.\n2. It may be able to get around the vaccines we already have.\n3. It may result in more serious illnesses in those who are infected.  This one is not a serious concern at the moment.\n\nDo note that in this new variant there's 30 mutations to the spike protein, which is why we're concerned that there may implications for vaccine efficacy ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html)).\n\nIn terms of investing, I don't encourage anyone to sell off right now.  That's silly.  Stick to your plan.  This was not meant to be a gloom and doom post.  But at the same time, the folks saying \"this is nothing\", that's not accurate.  It might be!  There's been scares before, obviously.  But at least inform yourself a bit before making statements that not only relate to finance and investing, but also to public health.\n\nFurthermore, at least in my case I'm a little scared.  I remember the feeling of the original Covid outbreak.  At first it was some obscure story in China, then Italy, and next thing I know I was told I was going to have to be working from home and could only go out to buy groceries.  I guess I'm a little traumatized.\n\nFor people who think life is clean and perfect all the time, I'm sure this will look like fear mongering or whatever.  So be it.  But hey, I'm scared right now.  I've got a trip back to the USA to visit my parents for Christmas.  I haven't seen them in 2 years.  I'm worried about what this means for my travel plans.  It's normal.  It's human.  Pretending like there isn't a problem when there is one doesn't solve anything.  There's a reason governments are taking this seriously.\n\nAnyway, it may all blow over, I fully acknowledge that and I hope it's the case!  But just pretending like everything is fine isn't the reality of what we're seeing right now.  I imagine I can't be the only one feeling this way.\n\nSo, best of luck to everyone, stick your investing plan and take care of yourselves!\n\n\\-shorty",

We can now address them without nuking the economy. \n\nIt's up to leaders to make good decisions, which are generally sorely lacking, but they can hardly claim ignorance now.\n\nWhat we have learned is that lockdowns don't work but social distancing does. \n\nMarkets aren't stupid, there is a reason we had a V recovery in March. Most businesses are more able than ever to react to a digital first commerce strategy. There is no reason for the economy to tank.\n\nThe only real reasons behind the market crashing are growth. Is growth slowing? Well China is beginning to flash some pretty big signals and as tapering takes it's toll you'll see normal economies slow too. With slowing growth comes P/E ratios under focus. There are a lot of companies that are overvalued BUT there are also a lot of companies which are at like 50% of this years ATH... There are absolutely bubbles in EVs and such but other areas I'd say are fair valued.\n\nOverall we're just entering a time where you need to modify the way you appraise value and what sectors will be more robust against repeat waves of pandemic. It's sort of like being in a war-time market. \n\nSo, all that being said the broad sell off is a big over-correction because of the short trading day and market Thursday close. By Wednesday the headlines will read \"Markets shrug off virus concerns. Fund managers confident businesses can navigate new strains.\" \n\nThe only real areas of struggle will continue to be big events, big sports events and such. Some regions will have them, some will not. Downtown core commercial property will continue to face headwinds but rents just need to fall. This virus is with us literally forever, it will become another seasonal cold/flu/infectious disease and you'll hear about new variants each year. Pharama will start making broad spectrum covid shots that you'll get with your other myriad. Every country will do deals with pharma so they can maintain critical supply. \n\nThrough all this society will, by and large, ignore issues of health, diet, nutrition, and underlying diseases like diabetes, smoking, lack of exercise. Society will also ignore age and treat all people, including children, at the same risk level as an 85 year old. This irrationality will make people more aggressive, combative, and you'll see more political factions in every nation, especially 'freedom parties'. The only way these are neutralized are with open policies but those are by and large against government directives. Truth is they are welcoming the greater control, digital ID, travelling surveillance, contact tracing, immunization databases. These are all useful for maintaining the elites control, and so these ideas will continue.",

But he wasn't really an agent, although he obviously helped them.  He was a \"journalist\" but his job description was mostly to \"entertain\" American visitors.

Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

        "body": "Purchasing shares to cover a short position can work, but it can also work against you. It's a very capital-intensive way to cover the position in any case. I've done it before both successful and not. A more capital-efficient way of doing this is cover the short with a deep ITM long option or a ZEBRA. I prefer ZEBRAs, especially long-dated.\n\nYou are always going to get a lot of sanctimonious knee-jerk responses about selling calls from people who have no idea what they are talking about. As someone who has sold naked calls for years, it's risky and it's a lot harder to make money than by put-selling. There's also a lot of value to balanced delta in my opinion. \n\nMost of the time lately they are either challenged or at an unrealized loss, but rarely ITM, depending on your entry delta. You usually get a month or two out of the year where they are the only thing that pays. It's easy to not be stupid about it. Don't trade meme stocks and don't sell 400 naked puts on a $20K account. The last few months have been rough, because a lot of stuff is up significantly more than volatility had priced in. Vol is just way under priced right now. I have strangles on MSFT, CVS, WMT and XRT that have all blown way past my short call strike. I'm inverted on all of them. At the same time, a lot of stuff has tanked and gone way past my short put strikes.",
