But he wasn't really an agent, although he obviously helped them.  He was a \"journalist\" but his job description was mostly to \"entertain\" American visitors.  These Americans were carefully vetted before being invited to Russia and upon arrival he did things like get them drunk, make Russia look really good, and try to get them in slightly compromised situations.  Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.  That was the majority of KGB \"spy\" operations.\n\nWhen it comes to Evergrand, cui bono? China.  So whether intentionally carrying weight for China or just useful idiots victimized by CCP intel operations, NYT is carrying water for the **CCP who desperately wants to unload assets before the rest of the world catches on**.

Jobs from July on were just revised up by almost \\*700,000\\* jobs. In these earnings reports, there's some mention of inflationary troubles for some companies, but there's also significant news about how companies are starting to bring prices down to move volume, which is expected... inflation, it turns out, likely is actually transitory... just not \"transitory is like a month\" like all of the ADHD newb kids think.  \n\n\nOil's going down. At the port, shipping container backlog is down 25%. There's just a TON of great macroecon data.  \n\n\nFor retail, margins suffering in the short term doesn't result in market insolvency in the long term, and the big drag on the market was V... Visa has a ton of issues, almost none of which have to do with retail or inflation and everything to do with the fact that their business model is being disrupted by BNPL and Visa's starting to lose vendor interest.  \n\n\nIf you actually zoom out the graph, the market's actually still on a very strong upward leaning bullish streak for the month... these Bear theses need major work.",

It never comes to fruition and then they move to the next event while it all gets memory holed.  A few weeks ago it was the Wu-tang NFT. \n\nThey jerk themselves off when the stock goes up a few dollars even though a few bucks is nothing compared to how much it should go up according to their DD about the MOASS. When the stock does shit, it\u2019s either part of the plan or because market forces caused it to do so.  \n\nThey delude themselves about technologies and industries that they don\u2019t even understand themselves. They don\u2019t ever reach out to people in these  industries to verify if what they assume is correct, it just is! They make up whatever shit that sounds nice in their fantasy land.  \n\nIve worked in the games industry and the shit they say about games distribution and GameStop\u2019s future role is literally orthogonal to what actual consumers in the gaming industry want. It\u2019s so fucking insane. \n\nHonestly fucked how the mods let this post get brigaded. apes brigade the fuck out of any thread related to GMe",

Super undervalued by every metric massive margin expansion. Market has written it off as temporary due to the semi shortage. While I think that's certainly a piece of the equation, it's only a piece. They have shifted product mix away from smartphone chips (low margin) to more tablets and auto industry screens (higher margin). These are growing segments with significantly higher margins. Both segments growing significant double digits YoY while smartphone chip sales decreased single digits.\n\nThey've also secured long term supply agreements for customers (for a fee and guaranteed minimum quantities) in addition to being paid fees to procure/guarantee capacity for non-customers for certain technologies.\n\nThey are also in the VR space and make boatloads on Smart TV stuff (Smart TV industry wide is projected to grow at 16% CAGR) and touchscreen display stuff.\n\nAdditional bear case: Wu brothers don't care about shareholders blah blah blah.\n\nCounter: Historically they pay out 75% of net profit as a dividend as is incentivized in the Taiwan tax structure.\n\nAnother Bear Case: China/Taiwan relations get significantly worse (or China straight goes to shit). Himax is a Taiwanese company with a lot of their customers and suppliers in China.\n\nhttps://www.himax.com.tw/investors/\n\nAs of\u00a0today\u00a0(2021-11-05), Himax Technologies's share price is\u00a0$11.45. Himax Technologies's\u00a0EPS without NRI\u00a0for the\u00a0trailing twelve months (TTM)\u00a0ended in\u00a0Jun. 2021\u00a0was\u00a0$1.25. Therefore, Himax Technologies's\u00a0**PE Ratio** without NRI\u00a0for\u00a0**today\u00a0is\u00a09.16**.\nDuring the\u00a0past 13 years, Himax Technologies's\u00a0highest\u00a0PE Ratio without NRI\u00a0was\u00a0270.77. The\u00a0lowest\u00a0was\u00a07.04. And the\u00a0**median\u00a0was\u00a025.11**.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/himx/short-interest\n\nApril 15th, 4m shares short (1 day to cover). Grew steadily as price dropped since May to now (10/15 report date) 24m and 10 days to cover.\n\nPublic owns 81m shares  \nInsiders own 49m shares  \nInstitutions own 34m shares  \nHedge funds own 9m shares\n\nI've been in since well before then, but yeah. Good times. Read the Q3 investor deck.\n\nPositions: a lot of leaps and shares and maybe some CSPs and CCs",

In my little bubble, I\u2019m a foreigner, but restaurants refused my CC because payments are withheld for a month, and within a month, the meal you just ate might not cover the cost of the uncooked food. Add to that, ATMs costed a massive % of cash deducted. Like 10%.\n\nSo we ended up having someone wire us some cash, and the rate was something impressive, like I could make 33% gains from reselling the cash, but like the true tard that I am, got way too excited by the value trap because Western Union seemed very happy to offload their cash on me. Once the pandemic hit, I couldn\u2019t even spend it, so I\u2019m stuck with $500 worth of Argentine cash that is probably worth $180 right now IF I can find a buyer.",

        "body": "You clearly haven't been paying attention to the amount of institutional money coming into the market. BTC already had a 50% correction this year and bounced right back.\n\nOr the continued adoption worldwide of bitcoin and crypto currency. Smart money follows smart money and all the banks and funds are starting to get into crypto, hence why it's still early. With more money comes more stability, as we're starting to see. You would actually have to follow BTC metrics to understand this though. \n\nThere's going to be a massive supply shock, that's why everyone even the big players are accumulating. This will bring financial freedom to billions of people worldwide who don't have access to bank accounts, let alone appreciable assets. More countries will continue to adopt BTC as legal tender and benefit from it as well. El Salvador has already invested $13M profits into schools, and there are more people with a BTC wallet than a bank account. No longer will people in the 2nd/3rd world be held hostage by Western Union fees, or INSANE inflation rates.\n\nYou're thinking very close mindedly, I of course know it's a volatile space because of the timing but it's also the perfect time for a retail investor to take advantage. I've also been taking profits on the way up just as I would with any stock. Whether you like it or not, I've done my research on crypto, believe in it, found the value, bought low and made my way to amazing gains both realized and unrealized. How are your negative yielding bonds doing? How about gold? Tech is the future, defi will be a huge portion of the tech industry. There's trillions of dollars of negative yielding bonds in the market, that's trillions of dollars looking for the next best store of value and guess what everyone's buying.\n\nNot financial advice, I definitely wouldn't take any advice from anyone on this sub here otherwise I wouldn't have these gains.

He was a Serbian-American engineer, inventor and physicist who made scores of breakthroughs in the development, transmission and application of electric power. He is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.\nNikola invented the first motor with alternating current and developed technology for AC generation. In late 1886, He met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. Based on Nikola's new ideas for electrical equipment, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887.

A few weeks ago it was the Wu-tang NFT. \n\nThey jerk themselves off when the stock goes up a few dollars even though a few bucks is nothing compared to how much it should go up according to their DD about the MOASS.

Super undervalued by every metric massive margin expansion. Market has written it off as temporary due to the semi shortage. While I think that's certainly a piece of the equation, it's only a piece. They have shifted product mix away from smartphone chips (low margin) to more tablets and auto industry screens (higher margin). These are growing segments with significantly higher margins. Both segments growing significant double digits YoY while smartphone chip sales decreased single digits.\n\nThey've also secured long term supply agreements for customers (for a fee and guaranteed minimum quantities) in addition to being paid fees to procure/guarantee capacity for non-customers for certain technologies.\n\nThey are also in the VR space and make boatloads on Smart TV stuff (Smart TV industry wide is projected to grow at 16% CAGR) and touchscreen display stuff.\n\nAdditional bear case: Wu brothers don't care about shareholders blah blah blah.\n\nCounter: Historically they pay out 75% of net profit as a dividend as is incentivized in the Taiwan tax structure.\n\nAnother Bear Case: China/Taiwan relations get significantly worse (or China straight goes to shit). Himax is a Taiwanese company with a lot of their customers and suppliers in China.\n\nhttps://www.himax.com.tw/investors/\n\nAs of\u00a0today\u00a0(2021-11-05), Himax Technologies's share price is\u00a0$11.45. Himax Technologies's\u00a0EPS without NRI\u00a0for the\u00a0trailing twelve months (TTM)\u00a0ended in\u00a0Jun. 2021\u00a0was\u00a0$1.25. Therefore, Himax Technologies's\u00a0**PE Ratio** without NRI\u00a0for\u00a0**today\u00a0is\u00a09.16**.\nDuring the\u00a0past 13 years, Himax Technologies's\u00a0highest\u00a0PE Ratio without NRI\u00a0was\u00a0270.77. The\u00a0lowest\u00a0was\u00a07.04. And the\u00a0**median\u00a0was\u00a025.11**.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/himx/short-interest\n\nApril 15th, 4m shares short (1 day to cover). Grew steadily as price dropped since May to now (10/15 report date) 24m and 10 days to cover.\n\nPublic owns 81m shares  \nInsiders own 49m shares  \nInstitutions own 34m shares  \nHedge funds own 9m shares\n\nI've been in since well before then, but yeah.

In my little bubble, I\u2019m a foreigner, but restaurants refused my CC because payments are withheld for a month, and within a month, the meal you just ate might not cover the cost of the uncooked food. Add to that, ATMs costed a massive % of cash deducted. Like 10%.\n\nSo we ended up having someone wire us some cash, and the rate was something impressive, like I could make 33% gains from reselling the cash, but like the true tard that I am, got way too excited by the value trap because Western Union seemed very happy to offload their cash on me. Once the pandemic hit, I couldn\u2019t even spend it, so I\u2019m stuck with $500 worth of Argentine cash that is probably worth $180 right now IF I can find a buyer.",

        "body": "You clearly haven't been paying attention to the amount of institutional money coming into the market. BTC already had a 50% correction this year and bounced right back.\n\nOr the continued adoption worldwide of bitcoin and crypto currency. Smart money follows smart money and all the banks and funds are starting to get into crypto, hence why it's still early. With more money comes more stability, as we're starting to see. You would actually have to follow BTC metrics to understand this though. \n\nThere's going to be a massive supply shock, that's why everyone even the big players are accumulating. This will bring financial freedom to billions of people worldwide who don't have access to bank accounts, let alone appreciable assets. More countries will continue to adopt BTC as legal tender and benefit from it as well. El Salvador has already invested $13M profits into schools, and there are more people with a BTC wallet than a bank account. No longer will people in the 2nd/3rd world be held hostage by Western Union fees, or INSANE inflation rates.\n\nYou're thinking very close mindedly, I of course know it's a volatile space because of the timing but it's also the perfect time for a retail investor to take advantage. I've also been taking profits on the way up just as I would with any stock. Whether you like it or not, I've done my research on crypto, believe in it, found the value, bought low and made my way to amazing gains both realized and unrealized. How are your negative yielding bonds doing? How about gold? Tech is the future, defi will be a huge portion of the tech industry. There's trillions of dollars of negative yielding bonds in the market, that's trillions of dollars looking for the next best store of value and guess what everyone's buying.\n\nNot financial advice, I definitely wouldn't take any advice from anyone on this sub here otherwise I wouldn't have these gains.

He was a Serbian-American engineer, inventor and physicist who made scores of breakthroughs in the development, transmission and application of electric power. He is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.\nNikola invented the first motor with alternating current and developed technology for AC generation. In late 1886, He met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. Based on Nikola's new ideas for electrical equipment, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887.

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",
