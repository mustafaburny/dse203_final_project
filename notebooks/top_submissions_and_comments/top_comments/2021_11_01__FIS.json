They are up 120% for the year, they blew away earnings estimates on November 4th, guidance remains positive, and have had positive earnings since 2019.  \n\nIf analyst opinions matter to you, Fidelity has 18 analysts tracking DDOG, with 0 issuing a sell rating currently. Of these 7 major firms, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs have all raised price targets on DDOG within the past week to a minimum of $200, with the average price target in $220s.  Currently DDOG is at $193.\n\nThey operate as a SaaS company by providing data solutions, analytics, and monitoring.  Basically, they help companies run efficiently.  This is the age of data and so companies that host data with cloud solutions, companies that sell data, and companies that can analyze and manage it all seem like a great bet to me. I also like tech because I'm growth oriented, but I think tech that provides solutions during supply chain shortages and a tight labor market ought to outperform the market.\n\nLike I said, I'm big on tech and my portfolio is heavy on growth stocks like DDOG.

Once the government prints out a $100 bill, they generally have no idea what happens to it after it is released - not the case with a fully digital currency. \n\nMoney in it's current form can still be laundered etc, and exchanged via paper money if you wish to keep transactions secret. This facilitates tax evasion, bribery, black market trade of just about anything etc. If the government implements a currency that exists only in the digital realm and is tied to a blockchain that they engineer themselves, they could theoretically make it possible to unravel any criminal enterprise or action by simply becoming aware of a single illegal transaction. \n\nIt would make it possible for revenue Canada to much more easily flag accounts that have unreported income.\n\nFor these reasons, I would expect governments to gradually phase out currency in it's current form as the digital token gains widespread adoption. \n\nI'm not advocating for the adoption of a digital currency, in fact I have major privacy concerns. But I think it's pretty clear why governments have interest in changing monetary systems going forward.",

Unstable and unreliable app, RH became completely unusable, multiple times during the Covid March 2020 crash. When other brokers stayed operational\n\n4.) Payment for order flow. RH makes money buy selling your buy orders to high frequency trade hedge funds, who are then able to \"frontrun\" the stock, meaning they can buy the stock a milisecond before you do, thus raising the price your market orders get filled. So you're actually paying more for stocks on RH than if you used another broker.\n\n5.) Conflict of interest, RH primary customer, Citadel was caught illegally naked shorting meme stock. During the meme stock frenzy, RH users weren't allowed to buy shares of certain companies, whereas with other brokers you could.\n\n6.) RH has history of being fined by the SEC, and countless lawsuits regarding not having the best user's interest in mind.\n\n7.) Glitchy Options display. RH falsely displayed losses for a young options trader who was actually in the green. He ended up committing suicide because of it.\n\n8.) If you care about margin %, Interactive Brokers and M1 Finance both have cheaper margin %\n\n9.) Not good for buying Crypto. You don't have access to your wallet keys, and you're not allowed to transfer your crypto to anew wallet, so you're forced to liquidate it if you want to move it elsewhere, which creates a taxable event. Also questions have raised if RH really holds the crypto that you \"own\" on their app.\n\nAlso it's not 2019 anymore, it's 2021. Countless apps have clean simple UI.

They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line.

That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",

How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",

Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term.

I'd wait till Tesla settles down and the IV drops back significantly before you do. But basically at max level options trading you can sell your shares and then close your positions with the money from the shares. \n\nIf you don't have this level of trading/margin available call your broker and they will do this for you. You get the net. Invest 90% in an ETF and never touch it again since you have a gambling addiction. \n\nBut definitely wait till Tesla settles down. Even if it ramps up another 200 bucks over the month. Wait till it does it's thing where it kinda trades down/sideways for 3 months. The IV drop will probably save you 50-100k when closing that position. \n\n\n\nAnd finally, you're not retarded for selling CC.

I haven't added anything to it except reinvesting dividends.   \n\n\nWhen I left in Sept 2017 it had roughly $13k in it. Now 4 years later it is worth almost $25k... easiest $12k I've ever made!   \n\n\nAnd you know how many times I've heard people say the market was too hot over the past 4 years? How many people thought Dec 2018 was going to be a huge bear market? Then March 2019... and everyday since then? If I had sat out that whole time waiting for some other market I would have missed out on $12k in gains!   \n\n\nNow obviously that is one anecdote and past performance is not proof of future gains, but missing out on investing because some people claim to know better than everyone else is a terrible investment strategy.   \n\n\nMy only regret is not investing more when I was in my 20s!",

I just focused on saving as much as I could every month for the last 10+ years.  \n\nIn the end there are really only a few major levers:  Time, $$$ saved, and return.  You can control the first 2 and NOT the last.  Everyone spends all their time obsessed about return, but you can't control return.  You can control when you start and how much you save.",
