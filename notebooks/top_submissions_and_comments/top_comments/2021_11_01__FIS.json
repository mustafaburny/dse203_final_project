        "body": "DRS (Direct Registration System) means you call your brokerage and say, \u201cI want to register my GME shares.\u201d Your shares are then registered in your name at GameStop\u2019s transfer agent (ComputerShare). The transfer from your brokerage to ComputerShare should take a few days to a few weeks.\n\nAdvantages: 1. The shares belong to you instead of Holding Agents (DTCC and your brokerage); 2. Registered shares cannot be shorted (and if you\u2019re on a margin account, your brokerage *can* lend out your shares without your knowledge); 3. The more GME holders DRS the less shares are available to short and less \u201cliquid\u201d GME shares become - thus, shorting the same share multiple times becomes nigh impossible; 5. *If* the short position is as massive as many apes believe, DRS may eventually force the squeeze; 6. Finally, all GameStop corporate GME holders have their shares in ComputerShare - and, as an owner (a shareholder), maybe you should, too.\n\nDisadvantages: 1. The time, money, and hassle it takes to transfer - some brokerages charge a fee, or take weeks to transfer, or even refuse to transfer (the workaround is to transfer your shares to no-bullshit brokerages like Fidelity [US]or Interactive Brokers [International] *then* register; 2. ComputerShare\u2019s website isn\u2019t as flashy as brokerages\u2019; 3. Buying or Selling shares in the US is slower with ComputerShare since they do massive buy or sell orders daily, as opposed to fulfilling immediate orders for individuals; 4. Some international investors have to transfer their shares back to a brokerage to sell them, which could take days or weeks - BUT since squeezes are time-sensitive, the lack of liquidity in GME shares due to all the registered owners taking their sweet old time selling means the price *may* reach Jupiter and stay astronomical for longer.",

Once the government prints out a $100 bill, they generally have no idea what happens to it after it is released - not the case with a fully digital currency. \n\nMoney in it's current form can still be laundered etc, and exchanged via paper money if you wish to keep transactions secret. This facilitates tax evasion, bribery, black market trade of just about anything etc. If the government implements a currency that exists only in the digital realm and is tied to a blockchain that they engineer themselves, they could theoretically make it possible to unravel any criminal enterprise or action by simply becoming aware of a single illegal transaction. \n\nIt would make it possible for revenue Canada to much more easily flag accounts that have unreported income.\n\nFor these reasons, I would expect governments to gradually phase out currency in it's current form as the digital token gains widespread adoption. \n\nI'm not advocating for the adoption of a digital currency, in fact I have major privacy concerns. But I think it's pretty clear why governments have interest in changing monetary systems going forward.",

Unstable and unreliable app, RH became completely unusable, multiple times during the Covid March 2020 crash. When other brokers stayed operational\n\n4.) Payment for order flow. RH makes money buy selling your buy orders to high frequency trade hedge funds, who are then able to \"frontrun\" the stock, meaning they can buy the stock a milisecond before you do, thus raising the price your market orders get filled. So you're actually paying more for stocks on RH than if you used another broker.\n\n5.) Conflict of interest, RH primary customer, Citadel was caught illegally naked shorting meme stock. During the meme stock frenzy, RH users weren't allowed to buy shares of certain companies, whereas with other brokers you could.\n\n6.) RH has history of being fined by the SEC, and countless lawsuits regarding not having the best user's interest in mind.\n\n7.) Glitchy Options display. RH falsely displayed losses for a young options trader who was actually in the green. He ended up committing suicide because of it.\n\n8.) If you care about margin %, Interactive Brokers and M1 Finance both have cheaper margin %\n\n9.) Not good for buying Crypto. You don't have access to your wallet keys, and you're not allowed to transfer your crypto to anew wallet, so you're forced to liquidate it if you want to move it elsewhere, which creates a taxable event. Also questions have raised if RH really holds the crypto that you \"own\" on their app.\n\nAlso it's not 2019 anymore, it's 2021. Countless apps have clean simple UI.
