This trend is furthering the country's class divide. \n* Trade wars and Brexit notwithstanding, the world is more interconnected than ever. Increasing globalization shifts the power from labor to capital since capital can flow much more easily across borders than can labor. \n* \"In my view, tragic events such as those discussed in this section will likely occur at a more frequent pace.

I've been down ever since and had accepted my loss. The price of the option was steadily decreasing, .70, .50, and so on.  \nToday I checked and in my account shows a 100% gain for the same option. The ask is posted at $2.15. Obviously I put an order in trying to exit my position asap.  \nI know that just cause the ask is posted there, does not mean it's the \"real price\" until someone buys it, and the volume on the option is super low.  \nI'm waiting for my order to go through but I'm almost certain it won't. It makes no sense why I would see green in my account if I can't exit my position. I did search the internet to make sense of it but it seems too vague an issue for anyone to provide an answer for me.",
