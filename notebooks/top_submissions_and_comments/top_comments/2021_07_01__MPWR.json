Let's look at some examples:\n\n\\- So in this case, Didi's operation got suspended because \"Didi had illegally collected users' personal data.\"\n\n\\- Alibaba got fined because of monopolistic practices.\n\n\\- Ant Group's IPO got slashed because the CCP wanted to regulate Ant Group like an actual bank.\n\nTo be honest, these sound pretty reasonable to me. Facebook was in trouble for collecting data without content too. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal? But now everyone is hot for FB stocks.\n\nMicrosoft has been fined millions by the EU for monopolistic practices as well. But everyone loves Microsoft stocks nonetheless. \n\nAnd as to Ant Group, they are a massive financial service company that can offer customers credit. How come they don't get to be regulated like a bank? My point is that these actions make sense and good regulations is beneficial for investors too in the long run.",

I\u2019ve exited about 50% of my position. I still have 200 shares because I believe, it could do some long term stuff well and be a $100B company. But I can\u2019t allocate so much of my portfolio in this company vs a FB/AMZN/GOOG (where I get growth, balance sheet safety, and moat)\n\nFrom here, if you want to get in on the action. You have to believe they do a few things\u2026\n1) surprise HEAVILY on revenue growth and forward guidance\n2) grow more into their cyber security suite of tools beyond just basic stuff like their widely used DDOS prevention (a ton of websites use them for this) and firewall \n3) Content delivery network investment trend continues and profit margins aren\u2019t competed away with bigger boys entering the game (ie GOOG, MSFT, AMZN)\n4) website speeds overwhelmingly determine ranking on google and mobile searches\n\nCloudflare and Fastly are the two more popular services for websites and apps to use as they offer ease of use to speed up website access for users and support to prevent website downtime. Folks have frequently complimented on how easy cloudflare is to use.",

It was the #1 company by marketcap in 2019 and march 2020.\n\nMoreover, It has never fallen out of the top 10 list for more than 20+ years even with failure of Ballmer, tech bubble crash, Nokia, etc. Now with the new ceo, I dont see it going out of the top 10 especially since it is so far ahead from #10 spot which is Alibaba at 600 billion market cap. (Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).\n\nBack in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.\n\nMicrosoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2012",

Tesla sells under 1% all vehicles worldwide but is somehow worth *more than all the other carmakers combined* because lots of people were buying Tesla stock and not because of any financial status of Tesla. dogecoin started LITERALLY as a joke but somehow was more valuable than companies like Ford Motors only because a ton of cash flowed into Dogecoin. this is all sheer insanity by traditional stock valuation guidelines. asset bubbles are nothing new, but Burry believes it's being exacerbated by passive investing. \n\n- Burry believes this situation of prices being based on cash flows is similar to what happened in the housing bubble, when multi-zillion Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) were being priced not by a reasonable estimate of their fair value but by cash-flows. \n\n- when flows reverse and lots of people want out of index funds, it will get ugly because so many stocks are linked/benchmarked to major stock indexes *including lower volume stocks*. consider VTI: the top holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson) might have a billion shares in total and hundreds of millions of dollars trading each day. but the smallest company stocks might have only a few million shares and a few million dollars trading each day. if too many people want to sell all at the same time, it will drive prices down sharply because these stocks are so often sold as a bundle/unit. as Burry puts it: \"The theater keeps getting more crowded, but the exit door is the same as it always was\"\n\n&gt;since the guy predicted 2007-2008 crash.\n\nhe also predicted the dot-com bubble.",

The fact that it's a big ship means it's changes will take time. I'm giving Gelsinger a chance to right the ship, but it will take a long while to undo BSwan's bad moves, get the right people, develop the chips, and catch up to AMD. \n\nA plus side for everyone is that the semi-space is a growing area with electronification, digitization, and \"5G-cloudification\" of everything along with the increasing importance of AI &amp; tech in business and government. Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn't INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn't likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM &amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it's own chips. They aren't going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it's that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple's eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit.

SO derived it\u2019s monopolistic power through acquisitions of rival refineries and distributors; purely horizontal integration, followed by outright price fixing.\n\nAmazon is absolutely massive, but the growth method and diversity of markets they participate in distinguishes them from old trust oriented monopolies. I\u2019m terms of AWS, the majority of growth was organic, and would not have ran afoul of antitrust law back in its hay day, such as when US v. Aluminum Co. of America was prevailing law.\n\nAn attempt to break up Amazon by business segment would probably fail due to the shift since the 70\u2019s from Per Se Antitrust violations to the Rule of Reason. They aren\u2019t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.\n\nOnline shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.\n\nOverall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren\u2019t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",

It's market correlation is 0.02, which is an unattached, positive number...not the large negative correlation you would hope for from a hedge. It did absolutely nothing during the dot-com bubble and probably hurt most investors that held during 2020.",

        "body": "I personally invest heavily in Web3 crypto's and crypto projects that help run and keep these crypto's decentralised. \n\nWhat's a web3 crypto? These aren't to be confused with junk like Bitcoin that thinks it is a store of value or will become the new financial system, web3 crypto is literally creating the next stage in internet where you don't need to worry about your companies information / personal information / classified documents being stored on a server that is owned and managed by other companies. Web3 splits this up between 100's of validators that all talk to each other and keep this decentralised and secure from attacks. \n\nThere's also ones creating the future of finance. No longer do you need to get bent over by huge interest rates and banks fucking people over whenever they feel like it. DEFI is run by liquidity pools, people like you and I who store our money with the service and as a result get a percentage of the interest rates. These rates always remain low and competitive and go to the people rather than the big banks.\n\nThen you have oracles that power the decentralisation. Oracles gain info from many sources and feed it to the protocol to offer decentralised information. For easy laymans terms, if I wanted a weather oracle, it would gather weather data from 1000's weather stations and news outlets, work out the average forecast and feed that to my protocol. This means my protocol is giving the users the most accurate non-biased information. Just as a high-level. \n\nSo how do you make money from this? Well, let's look at Ethereum just as an example. Every single protect that runs on Ethereum has to pay \"gas\" fees on each transaction, this is paid in Ethereum. Ethereum already has 1000's of applications including VISA and MasterCard that constantly have a demand for Ethereum in order to operate and pay these gas fees. You as the investor holds the Ethereum they need and this creates supply and demand. Additionally, each time a company pays their gas fees, the gas is \"burnt\" (meaning Ethereum used to pay for the transaction is burnt) creating deflation. \n\nEthereum is just one project, and not one that I personally even invest in that much, but it's one that I'm sure most people have heard of.   \nIf you want to look at getting some crypto while it's currently on a low and has huge potentially to be the future of a new decentralised internet feel free to use my exchange code.

        "body": "I worked sales in payments for four years. A large international payments company. Direct competitor to Paysafe in all respects except we were more restrained on gambling.\n\nPaysafe make money, in large part, by charging merchants for a fee per card transaction. This is known as merchant acquiring. (Yes, the term \"acquiring\" is a little odd here, but keep following)\n\nThis fee is subject to many variables, including interchange fees charged to Paysafe by the card scheme (Visa/MC), as well as competition. Acquirers historically were subsidaries of banks - Chase Paymentech are examples of one that still is - JPM, in this case.\n\n As fees are usually taken before income is paid to the merchant (else invoiced payable within 30 days), it means bank-linked acquirers can significantly reduce their txn fee (and thus increase the topline) for merchants as an incentive they want to upsell more profitable products like loans to. I have worked in the industry and seen it time and again. One large international merchant even got free acquiring, they were that good a customer of the bank's other services. I even worked personally in combo with a bank on a deal of such a type.\n\nWhilst I appreciate that gambling companies are higher risk and some acquirers won't touch them...the barrier to entry is just the acquiring price and the willingness of a competitor to pant-drop. And they do.\n\nPlus I interviewed at Paysafe once. UK office, pre-Covid. There wasn't any buzz, any excitement. It seemes boring and uninspired. Granted, its a subsidary office.\n\nI hold no position on this stock and I am not planning to. Nor am I looking to shit all over the stock per se. Just cautious advice from personal experience.",

        "body": "I worked sales in payments for four years. A large international payments company. Direct competitor to Paysafe in all respects except we were more restrained on gambling.\n\nPaysafe make money, in large part, by charging merchants for a fee per card transaction. This is known as merchant acquiring. (Yes, the term \"acquiring\" is a little odd here, but keep following)\n\nThis fee is subject to many variables, including interchange fees charged to Paysafe by the card scheme (Visa/MC), as well as competition. Acquirers historically were subsidaries of banks - Chase Paymentech are examples of one that still is - JPM, in this case.\n\n As fees are usually taken before income is paid to the merchant (else invoiced payable within 30 days), it means bank-linked acquirers can significantly reduce their txn fee (and thus increase the topline) for merchants as an incentive they want to upsell more profitable products like loans to. I have worked in the industry and seen it time and again. One large international merchant even got free acquiring, they were that good a customer of the bank's other services. I even worked personally in combo with a bank on a deal of such a type.\n\nWhilst I appreciate that gambling companies are higher risk and some acquirers won't touch them...the barrier to entry is just the acquiring price and the willingness of a competitor to pant-drop. And they do.\n\nPlus I interviewed at Paysafe once. UK office, pre-Covid. There wasn't any buzz, any excitement. It seemes boring and uninspired. Granted, its a subsidary office.\n\nI hold no position on this stock and I am not planning to. Nor am I looking to shit all over the stock per se. Just cautious advice from personal experience.",

Don\u2019t hop into a trade unless you are guaranteed to win that trade. Cheap calls generally aren\u2019t worth it. You should also base your call on a lot more data. I only trade SPY gaps and LEAPS on some stocks. When SPY goes straight down vertically that money comes right back and it goes straight back up vertically within a few days. I buy an ITM call within a few days of the decline. 19/20 trades profited from that. \nFor LEAPS you have to understand Theta and time decay more, and go far far ITM which means the price of the call will be extremely expensive, but they are worth it in my opinion. I bought a $200 strike Visa call expiring in a year, when Visa was at $234 a share. it\u2019s now at $238 a share and the call is up 4% or so. the contract cost $4,000 but I lose a dollar (-0.01 x 100 shares) per day to time decay if the stock doesn\u2019t move, which is nothing.

Once the access to low cost leverage is gone (loan paid off) simply buying quality REITs might provide a similar level of after expense income in the same sector (unless your client places a very low value on their time).  Granted income yields are low just about everywhere.                      \n\nAs an interest rate hedge it might be worth it in the longer term to hold if a sufficient amount of leverage is still held.  Yes a spike in rates might hurt the theoretical equity position but that should, in theory at least, balance against the inflated currency.                         \n\nAnyways, if your client is purely interested in income why not put together an alternative income proposal that matches their timeline and risk profile?

But compound growth is killer if the business continues to rapidly expand year over year. It would also make up more of the S&amp;P as well though to be fair, which favors index investing in terms of optimal risk-reward). \n\n2. OP was talking about the top 10 companies by market cap which is all big tech other than Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Berkshire Hathaway. They named Microsoft, Apple, and Visa off-hand. \n\n3. I Hate this crystal ball argument, of course the future is impossible to 100% predict. That\u2019s why you pick financially healthy companies with great growth prospects and economic moats. You invest in companies that give you the highest probability of outperforming the market. It\u2019s obvious a company like Microsoft is likely going to outperform a mid-cap company such as Texas Roadhouse. Just as how I can\u2019t guarantee I won\u2019t be alive tomorrow. But I have a higher chance of living if I pay attention while driving a car vs texting while driving. \n\n4. You don\u2019t just invest in one company. You invest in a handful of individual stocks that you expect to have a high probability of beating the market (Buffet and Lynch recommend 7-15 roughly). People should only do this if they know what they are doing. The average person should stick to indexes if they are not willing to do the research of course. \n\nI\u2019m not disagreeing with index investing as much as I want to highlight that beating the market isn\u2019t this absurdly, low probability phenomenon people want to believe that it is. OP has the right premise for a high probabilistic chance to beat the market.",

People started telling him how they lost their life savings of $350,000 and didn't know how. He thought there were only two things that can happen when trading \"spreads\" but he found out about a third. That third thing was the one that cost people big bucks. Now I know why the market often takes a down turn just before the close on Fridays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImgQWZofjA\n\nThe second thing I saw was him saying don't listen to the day trading hype on a certain web site. He said only 1% of option traders make money so don't listen to the B.S. Thank you for not bull shitting me, you are OK in my book. \n\nI then thought of playing online poker where only 12% make money because of the \"rake\". \nAt least the sites publish what they take from every pot so one knows what the odds are. 12% of poker players verses 1% of options traders making money is a big difference, though both are not good odds. In poker when you sit down at the table if you don't see the sucker you are it. This video is on his front page.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMiRVQJuTj3NpZZP1tKShQ\n\nSo I watched a little of the first lesson but my enthusiasm has drained; maybe Vanguard won't approve my application to write necked puts so learning about them won't be necessary.

The plan was that on the last day of each quarter, I could buy FDC stock at a 15% discount based on the stock price on the 1st day of the quarter, or the last day of the quarter, whichever was lower.  Over several years I accumulated almost 1000 shares of FDC.  8 years after I started working there, they spun off WU stock (which I sold soon after) and a few months after that they were bought by a private equity company and taken private.",
