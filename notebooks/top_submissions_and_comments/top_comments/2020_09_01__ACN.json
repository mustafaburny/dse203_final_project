I like VOO, but if you want to diversify outside of tech you may want to consider some value stocks and buy individual stocks instead of an ETF, or buy sector ETFs.  \n\nValue stocks that I'd recommend:  ABBV, ACN, AES, CLX, DIS, IBM, JNJ, JPM, KHC, KO, KR, LOW, MA, MAR, MCD, NVS, O, PEP, PFE, PLAY, SBUX, T, TD, TGT, TROW, VZ, WBA, WMT, WSM. I think you could easily pick any three to five of these and have a nicely balanced portfolio given the amount of money you are investing.\n\nSector ETFs that I like include:\n\nICLN, TAN or PBW - Clean energy/renewable energy\n\nFHLC, XLV - Health Care\n\nIDNA, ARKG - Genomic Research and DNA technology\n\nPRNT - 3D printing\n\nARKQ, THNK, ROBO - artificial intelligence and robotics (However, this is \"tech\")\n\nVFH, FNCL, XLF, IEFN - financial sector ETFs\n\nI'm not a financial advisor and have no business giving financial advice. That said, a nice balanced portfolio might look something like this:\n\n33% tech stocks and ETFs  (This is what you already have)\n\n33% value stocks (from the list above)\n\n33% sector ETFs:  10% ICLN, 10% ARKG, 10% XLV\n\nBest of luck to you.",

So I\u2019d buy in NVDA a little bit, as it also Wall Street\u2019s favorite out of the three\n\nAccenture is a good investment, I like that quite a bit\n\nAlso can\u2019t go wrong with buying in VOO and QQQ, and for younger investor\u2019s ARKK is personally where it\u2019s at too.\n\nAmazon is a decent hedge against Lowe\u2019s too that I\u2019d think about",

        "body": "A good example is COVID-19 tracking in the UK and US. \n\nThe recent reports that people had underlying causes that contributed to increased fatality was directly attributed by using the Palantir platform because it was able to not only ingest data from multiple disparate sources (apparently the CDC had a previous system to track pandemic indicators for flu and stuff, but they didn't track all the patient data you needed.  \n\nFrom previous sales material on how Palantir ingests data from like business cards to table napkins with technical drawings.  I think the way they did it was all the hospital forms and documents, they used their Image recognition module to scan all the paper forms that were faxed over from all the hospitals.  They were also flexible in ingesting data from various database schemas. \n\nLike if you think about big data in terms of health care, nobody has the same way of storing data in a database.  Some databases are literally just f\\*cking file cabinets.  Other places have a form that has maybe 15 cells for name, dob, blood type, pre-existing conditions, are they missing limbs, that sorta thing.  Other hospitals/healthcare providers will be voracious in their patient history and note taking even down to what bed they stayed in and how many times their sheets were changed in an inpatient visit.\n\nThis is the problem w/ data and an even bigger problem w/ big data.  Trying to sift through the information that's relevant and also providing correlating links to data that \\*shoudn't\\* be relevant but ends up being relevant.  Researchers are able to do research and ask questions and get answers (in the form of data) from whatever analysis tool.  The difference is (as mentioned above) how long support requests take place.  Like when you're writing a book, you immediately do research to find out something so you can keep your creative momentum.  \n\nResearchers operate much in the same way where if it takes too long from a vendor to complete an ask, the creative momentum is crushed.\n\nI think we should be clear here, Palantir has shown it can scale within its confines and it's successful at helping people. \n\nThe actual question that we should be asking is:\n\nWith another 4.5-9 billion in additional cash, can it increase adoption?  \n\nIf the answer is a linear progression or even algebraic, it can beat out Accenture, Gartner, IBM, PWC, and etc.  I'd say continued long-term increase.  I'd liken Palantir to Tesla's Battery day.  Not right now, but 2022 look for a moonshot if you can HODL.",

They take some COTS platform and build from scratch the ontologies and tooling to go with it.  Customization takes as much billable hours in stupid meetings as possible so they can justify recruiting whole teams and keep their hiring engine positive.  Palantir saves money in the long run despite what analysts call expensive customizations because it's those gov't agencies' first foray into big data because other consulting agencies have many times been just too frickin' expensive.\n\nSee Center for Public Integrity's brief mention: [https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/secretive-data-system-shaping-pandemic-response-hhs-protect/](https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/secretive-data-system-shaping-pandemic-response-hhs-protect/)\n\nAnother place that I see Palantir make sense is that they're agile in terms of being able to make customer optimizations since they own the platform and the customer consultancy vertical.  Intimate knowledge of the customer, intimate knowledge of the platform, and belief in the customer's mission (the palantirians sound like a cult for social change). Maybe good, maybe bad, but at least it means that your vendor has your back .. that's a pretty rare thing.  I don't see Amazon having my back on the AWS side or on the Employee (think warehouse and covid19) side.\n\nIt appears to me if there're sufficiently technically savvy customers, customers can use their own analysts to make their own customizations, those deployments would likely make more money for the company as adoption increases, I think that was the cases in one of the energy industry implementations in their investor day video.\n\nTechnology, the product might not be as sophisticated as the computer on the Starship Enterprise making up Moriarti's, but they're using the sh\\*t out of it and making it work.\n\nEnter Scuderia Ferrari:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k80R6fgf2ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k80R6fgf2ME)",
