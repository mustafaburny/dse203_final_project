I like VOO, but if you want to diversify outside of tech you may want to consider some value stocks and buy individual stocks instead of an ETF, or buy sector ETFs.  \n\nValue stocks that I'd recommend:  ABBV, ACN, AES, CLX, DIS, IBM, JNJ, JPM, KHC, KO, KR, LOW, MA, MAR, MCD, NVS, O, PEP, PFE, PLAY, SBUX, T, TD, TGT, TROW, VZ, WBA, WMT, WSM. I think you could easily pick any three to five of these and have a nicely balanced portfolio given the amount of money you are investing.\n\nSector ETFs that I like include:\n\nICLN, TAN or PBW - Clean energy/renewable energy\n\nFHLC, XLV - Health Care\n\nIDNA, ARKG - Genomic Research and DNA technology\n\nPRNT - 3D printing\n\nARKQ, THNK, ROBO - artificial intelligence and robotics (However, this is \"tech\")\n\nVFH, FNCL, XLF, IEFN - financial sector ETFs\n\nI'm not a financial advisor and have no business giving financial advice. That said, a nice balanced portfolio might look something like this:\n\n33% tech stocks and ETFs  (This is what you already have)\n\n33% value stocks (from the list above)\n\n33% sector ETFs:  10% ICLN, 10% ARKG, 10% XLV\n\nBest of luck to you.",

        "body": "So what I would do with your Lowe\u2019s stock is sell out of about 5% of it per year as long as it\u2019s looking well rated, and take that money along with the dividends and buy into growth industries un-correlated with Lowe\u2019s (like heathcare, Tech etc)\n\nThis way if it\u2019s growing more than 5% a year, your principal isn\u2019t shrinking, but you are less reliant on Lowe\u2019s alone.\n\nMy opinion on the AMC/INTC/NVDA wars is they will all go up, and buy all three so you don\u2019t miss a breakout! So I\u2019d buy in NVDA a little bit, as it also Wall Street\u2019s favorite out of the three\n\nAccenture is a good investment, I like that quite a bit\n\nAlso can\u2019t go wrong with buying in VOO and QQQ, and for younger investor\u2019s ARKK is personally where it\u2019s at too.\n\nAmazon is a decent hedge against Lowe\u2019s too that I\u2019d think about",

        "body": "A good example is COVID-19 tracking in the UK and US. \n\nThe recent reports that people had underlying causes that contributed to increased fatality was directly attributed by using the Palantir platform because it was able to not only ingest data from multiple disparate sources (apparently the CDC had a previous system to track pandemic indicators for flu and stuff, but they didn't track all the patient data you needed.  \n\nFrom previous sales material on how Palantir ingests data from like business cards to table napkins with technical drawings.  I think the way they did it was all the hospital forms and documents, they used their Image recognition module to scan all the paper forms that were faxed over from all the hospitals.  They were also flexible in ingesting data from various database schemas. \n\nLike if you think about big data in terms of health care, nobody has the same way of storing data in a database.  Some databases are literally just f\\*cking file cabinets.  Other places have a form that has maybe 15 cells for name, dob, blood type, pre-existing conditions, are they missing limbs, that sorta thing.  Other hospitals/healthcare providers will be voracious in their patient history and note taking even down to what bed they stayed in and how many times their sheets were changed in an inpatient visit.\n\nThis is the problem w/ data and an even bigger problem w/ big data.  Trying to sift through the information that's relevant and also providing correlating links to data that \\*shoudn't\\* be relevant but ends up being relevant.  Researchers are able to do research and ask questions and get answers (in the form of data) from whatever analysis tool.  The difference is (as mentioned above) how long support requests take place.  Like when you're writing a book, you immediately do research to find out something so you can keep your creative momentum.  \n\nResearchers operate much in the same way where if it takes too long from a vendor to complete an ask, the creative momentum is crushed.\n\nI think we should be clear here, Palantir has shown it can scale within its confines and it's successful at helping people. \n\nThe actual question that we should be asking is:\n\nWith another 4.5-9 billion in additional cash, can it increase adoption?  \n\nIf the answer is a linear progression or even algebraic, it can beat out Accenture, Gartner, IBM, PWC, and etc.  I'd say continued long-term increase.  I'd liken Palantir to Tesla's Battery day.  Not right now, but 2022 look for a moonshot if you can HODL.",

        "body": "I think the difference is intimate knowledge of the product.  Other firms who wrangle data are usually on the consultant space like Accenture.  They take some COTS platform and build from scratch the ontologies and tooling to go with it.  Customization takes as much billable hours in stupid meetings as possible so they can justify recruiting whole teams and keep their hiring engine positive.  Palantir saves money in the long run despite what analysts call expensive customizations because it's those gov't agencies' first foray into big data because other consulting agencies have many times been just too frickin' expensive.\n\nSee Center for Public Integrity's brief mention: [https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/secretive-data-system-shaping-pandemic-response-hhs-protect/](https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/secretive-data-system-shaping-pandemic-response-hhs-protect/)\n\nAnother place that I see Palantir make sense is that they're agile in terms of being able to make customer optimizations since they own the platform and the customer consultancy vertical.  Intimate knowledge of the customer, intimate knowledge of the platform, and belief in the customer's mission (the palantirians sound like a cult for social change). Maybe good, maybe bad, but at least it means that your vendor has your back .. that's a pretty rare thing.  I don't see Amazon having my back on the AWS side or on the Employee (think warehouse and covid19) side.\n\nIt appears to me if there're sufficiently technically savvy customers, customers can use their own analysts to make their own customizations, those deployments would likely make more money for the company as adoption increases, I think that was the cases in one of the energy industry implementations in their investor day video.\n\nTechnology, the product might not be as sophisticated as the computer on the Starship Enterprise making up Moriarti's, but they're using the sh\\*t out of it and making it work.\n\nEnter Scuderia Ferrari:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k80R6fgf2ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k80R6fgf2ME)",

Response time was days vs weeks at implementing new features.\n\nLet me say that again **IMPLEMENTING NEW FEATURES**. \n\nThose that work in gov't *know how big this* is because contracts are usually set in stone and once folks like Accenture, PWC, Gartner, etc get their contracts signed, they send in interns to do the dirty work.  PTLR apparently still sends in their best guys after the initial implementation.  \n\nSo for IPO, I'm not sure how this affects them, probably not a whole lot, but long term, Palantir will either bring about a new standard within the tech consulting industry et al, or *they will be the new standard*.",

        "body": "Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people.",

Bullish call-option buying has exploded. Over the past month, traders have bought almost 15 times the number of call options expiring in November of those FAANG stocks, plus Microsoft and Tesla, than the equivalent number of put options.\n\n....\n\n\nWhen call-option buying spikes, it drives call sellers to buy underlying stock, sending shares higher. When brokers sell options contracts, they don\u2019t want to take the risk of what happens to the underlying stock. Brokers only want to earn a commission selling\u2014and trading\u2014the options. Often times, brokers buy underlying stock to hedge their book of business. That way, any gains or losses on options positions are offset by corresponding gains in the underlying stock prices.\n\nSo any explosion in call-option buying generates stock buying on the Street. That\u2019s one way to explain the 20% rise of those tech stocks since July.\n\nIt\u2019s also a way to explain the recent two day collapse. Call-option trading volume Thursday in those tech stocks was down by roughly two-thirds compared with recent highs.\u201d",

I did, high 300's, just before COVID, hoping to rebuy it lower, like under $300.  Missed my chance so I had to rebuy in the $400's, current exit target of $600.

        "body": "Well I've had lots of such analysis in my coverage universe, but I should just tell you often it ends up not being investable information.  \n\nEverything above about Netflix was knowable a year ago, but if you saw it and decided not to buy Netflix, you'd have missed gains.  \n\nSometimes it works out beautifully.  I recently knew of a pharma situation where one company had exclusive patent and proven therapy for peanut allergies, approvals rolling in worldwide, patients being quietly and successfully treated.  The company was backstopped by a big multinational, so the risk of BK was non-existent.  It was easy to imagine parents would certainly pay handsomely to protect their affected children against this common problem.  The stock was being heavily shorted down during pandemic but it always seemed like someday it would emerge from that or get bought.  It did, and AIMT ripped +175% on the buy-out.  But as I say, it doesn't usually work like that.  I've had similar situations where the buy-out happens closer to the shorted down cap, so having the correct thesis and taking the risk doesn't even pay off.  \n\nI guess the most macro view is more of wishful thinking: that democrat victory will then lead to a realistic infrastructure stimulus and we'll see a huge rotation out of ultra high P/E tech and into some things that have been moribund for years.  I'm already starting to swap things like Adobe and Semis for materials and oil and banks.",
