Look at the recent yoy growth of BRK vs SPY. Technology is the new paradigm and while airlines and oil are relics in the near future. Why go for a business trip/meeting when they can just use Zoom or Facebook? Not making the shift is foolish, even a blind man can see better than this oracle. What's more BRK is backed by Buffet, if he croaks, so does the stock, he is the face of the stock, regardless of whether he acknowledges it or not. What's more, he doesn't bother about learning technology because he doesn't need to anymore, in 10 to 20 years he wouldn't even participate in the stock market anymore. But the landscape would be vastly different from before, already we see tech giants ruling the market now, I wonder what will happen in the future?",

Boeing, Tyson Foods, GE, IBM, Oracle, all the commodities companies are going to be seeing double digit percentage decreases in their sales and revenues.  I feel like Boeing has to go bankrupt, and so many of their suppliers will too.\n\nThe market for many products, e.g. commercial real estate, airplanes, oil drilling equipment, has literally disappeared, and the stock market has not priced that in yet.\n\nThe Fed has propped up an enormous bubble with their actions, but the economy doesn't reflect what they have created.  \n\nAt some point the central banks will have to let SOME investors get wiped out, and that is going to be a very unhappy day on the stock markets.\n\nFord and GM are in staggeringly bad financial shape, nobody is saying anything about it.  Every major airline is going to be going through a bankruptcy cycle, Disney is likely to lose 75% of their revenue for the year.  How the hell can the indexes be at these levels?",

So why buy Berkshire instead of an index?

Their banners are more and more lowering quality of search and overall search use is dropping due to apps and closed websites. They are big but a niche. Their model works for specific products only.\n\nFacebook is a developing world family and friendship automation. A lot of room to grow in places like Bangladesh. But technology which delivers value to customers is actually simple and they can easily be replaced. They are based on soft value not tech. \n\nAmazon us big in USA. It is a big country which used mail order catalogs way before internet. You can not have a store everywhere in America. Rest of the world isn't like that. They have been adding value to their offering because they want to offer the most for least like all retail but eventually someone will take this over. Just that their competitor can not be in USA or Europe. Europe is too small.\n\nData means nothing to customers. Customers want value for money. Data maybe can help speed up selection within millions of products but this doesn't really work as good as they promise. Ads and e-commerce recommendations are very much off once shoppers are not super easy predictable. Data and AI are a hype.\n\nMicrosoft also is a business software company with some diversification. In business it succeeds just like SAP and Oracle etc. It enters and it is hard to get it out. Not many players there as well as CIOs don't take much risk. But it's success is not because of them but simply because of digitalisation and globalisation. Microsoft itself hasn't created any relevant competitive value. They are just a big political entity in the right time and place. If something changes for them it will also change for SAP Oracle IBM etc. But they appear to be different because of hardware and games (more consumer) and Bill Gates always spent a lot on his PR.",

That's like those tards that bought up all the TP at walmart and then were caught trying to return it in two weeks because nobody was buying. Yea sure some people didn't have enough in the bathroom (savings) and maybe ran low until they implemented purchase limits (unemployment being raised by $600 a WEEK), but fucking again, what TP factories blew up? people aren't shitting more except traders figuratively, so you wait for the next shipment or two that was coming anyway and now you got your TP. Like seriously? They just dumped like 2-3 Tah-rilllllion dollars and most of it to companies to pay people, and to go directly to the one's no longer at companies. So most people have the cash they would normally expect because most people don't make shit. You know how much of that was to pay Buffett what he normally expects? Anybody over 100,000 didn't get what they usually make and if anything they probably sold part of their holdings in the crash. Instead, you have people wondering whether they should get their cash from unemployment or from their employer, worried that they'll get hired back too soon and lose some of it. Yes, hoard cash when the government is pumping out trillions and sell when the market is at a 40% discount. Oracle. Genius.",
