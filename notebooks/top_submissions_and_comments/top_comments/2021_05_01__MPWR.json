One of the biggest social media apps in the last 5 years is TikTok, which just is a super-powered Vine. Then they bought Periscope, which had a really interesting version of mobile-live streaming. They never figured out how to integrate that very well into their own platform and didn't know what to do with it, so they killed that too. TikTok also now has a live streaming feature that works exactly the same way.   \n\n\nNow Twitter has created Spaces as their new innovation, which is just a copycat of what the new social media website Clubhouse does, audio chatrooms.   \n\n\nJack Dorsey also owns Square and Cashapp and both of those services have expanded to meet the needs of consumers on multiple fronts to make themselves useful time and time again, but for some reason he always just views Twitter as this \"free speech haven\" and never leaned in creatively to expand it into a service that does more than blast someone's thoughts to everyone else. He could have had his own TikTok years before that app was invented.",

Because it is deflationary and people think that is a good thing.  But, it actually isn't.  Deflationary currency is actually worse than inflationary.  Because if you invest in something like Lumber and you pay for that lumber with 4 btc.  Because BTC is deflationary a month from now you could buy that lumber for 3 btc.  Because the value of BTC has appreciated in comparison to the lumber.  But, for the person who invest in the lumber you just lost 1 btc.  So, at that point there is no longer a valid reason to invest in anything but btc.  Any form of commerce stops being valid or viable.\n\nSo, it might be a good \"Store of wealth\".  But, it is a bad currency.  \n\nInflationary currency.  Assuming it only inflates a little. It actually good for commerce.  Because it means if you invest in lumber and you hold it for awhile just on the grounds of inflation that lumber is now worth more in comparison to the currency.  So, it makes Commerce more lucrative.\n\nIdeally though Currency should just be a straight line.  With little to no inflation or deflation.\n\nThat doesn't mean BTC isn't a good way to make money.

        "body": "Good time to mention all the quantitive easing the world has done (especially the US)? I mean, y\u2019all printed like, 40% of the dollars in existence in the last 12 months which obviously isn\u2019t good for managing future inflation. However, wouldn\u2019t that also mean that extreme valuations aren\u2019t really that high because the dollar is quickly becoming worth less and less? \n\nI mean, if Apple is worth $2T and that seems high to you, could it not just be that it now takes $2T to be worth c.$1.5T pre-pandemic? From overseas is kinda seems like it\u2019s priced in. \n\nI suppose the counter argument could be that a LOT of the stimulus went into the market and is tied up. But that would also mean taking profits and crashing the market while also leading to greater cash in circulation, worsening inflation of day-to-day goods, or having inflated valuations and not seeing hyperinflation in the real world \n\nI don\u2019t know how this shit works, I\u2019m retarded. \ud83e\udd14",

        "body": "And they enrich shareholders too. \n\nThink of a company with 3 friends as owners. Two have 40% interest, the other 20%. The business is successful and grows, and all are happy. Then after many years, the minority owner wants to cash out. The other two can buy out his shares, but maybe even have to take out a loan to do so, but they believe in the business and can achieve larger growth than the interest on that loan. They buy him out, and now they both own 50% of the business, albeit with a bit more debt (perhaps they even could do this from cashflow though, and it would make even more sense). \n\nSo tell me how that decision above was an incorrect one?  It\u2019s the same as buybacks on a larger scale. Yes, some companies overdo it and make a poor decision, but companies make poor decisions on hiring/products/pricing/environmental issues etc all the time. This is just one more thing to judge their execution ability on. \n\nSometimes I feel people come to investing subs just to trash investing.",

        "body": "You are absolutely correct from a Car Manufacturing stand point. Tesla may have been the company to YOLO into it, and that may have been the push needed to get the other manufacturers on board. \n\nWhere Tesla can be worth more is in their diversity into Green Energy generation and storage. While they are not the only players in the game there, they are setting the bar for consumer products in the field and it may take a decade for other companies to develop to the level of Tesla\u2019s products and brand recognition. \n\nI do think that Tesla is over valued right now and that Elon Musk is someone to wary of when following for the purpose of investing. He has no shame in pumping securities and crypto to unsustainable levels and Tesla I believe is no different. I could be wrong at the end of the day, but I just have a feeling that reality will eventually hit for TSLA and I\u2019m not going to be interested in buying in until that happens. That said, if he would like to pump any of my stocks up, I\u2019d be all for it for a nice payday. \ud83e\udd11",

Look at the way the working day has changed from 9-5 to 8-6 and with no real increase in wages. It used to be possible for one person in the household to earn enough to support a family. A minimum wage job was still a job worth working, now its a joke. Its not just the states either, anywhere that has adopted  similar economic systems is suffering the same fate. The UK, Germany, France, Spain and more are all struggling to keep a lid on this issue",

There is a huge market for them, and considering we'll have the single-use plastic ban in the near future, I think it's a great company to invest in this year.\n\nBut hey, I'm just a common guy trying to invest in sustainable ideas and getting wealthier in the process.

The value of the dollar is assigned by humans just like the value of gold was assigned by humans. Saying based on nothing makes it sound like the value of gold was based on something and your reasons suck. There\u2019s plenty of conductive, easily malleable metals that are not nearly as expensive. Your argument maybe could\u2019ve been used in the early days of fiat currency, but at some point tying currency to the value of gold was going to get difficult to uphold if everyone wanted the gold at the same time. Technically a dollar is valuable because it\u2019s scare but not too scarce. A paper dollar doesn\u2019t corrode too quickly, it can be kept in a smaller space than gold, unfortunately it\u2019s not conductive but you can literally light it on fire and of course, it\u2019s accepted pretty much everywhere in the U.S. try to go to a gas station and buy something with gold.",
