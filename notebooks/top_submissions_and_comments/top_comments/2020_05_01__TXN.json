Texas instruments is the leading producer of bms and bms ics along with being a leader in analog devices. Hell txn has twice the analog marketshare of the next biggest a company named literally analog devices. Thats how good they are at what they do. All musk did was con a bunch of investors and rubes, package everyone else's new technology up into a pretty package and hype it to hell and back. The only thing that makes musk unique is his ego.  Only thing he does outstandingly well is marketing and self promotion. Should note that I am an electrical engineer that spent about 5 years in  battery management systems, power electronics, and electric motor control. Also during my briefish stint in a startup from all the entrepreneur gatherings, conferences, incubator shit, and the meet and greet shut I can confidently tell you that I noticed a very obvious trend. The best indicator of funding raised was nowhere close to idea/business practicality or fundamentals of the underlying technology. It was always how well the CEO could sell people bullshit and their was a troubling correlation also with high functioning sociopathic traits.",

Layer 2 would be things like lightning network, where smart contracts are used with time lock verify functions. A btc transaction is used to deposit funds on lightning protocol and then those funds can be used for whatever amount of time they are locked in via contract. It then has another transaction to settle it back on the bitcoin blockchain. Lightning development is still very much in its infancy, but it\u2019s made a lot of development last few months and some people are using it regularly, even though it\u2019s in beta. It\u2019s hard to tell if it is going to be able to do what the overall goal is for scalability, but there\u2019s hopes of 10k-100k the amount of txn currently able on btc blockchain. It\u2019s definitely hard to know what also will be built on things like lightning as well, which could lead to a 3rd layer, and more. The Internet has a lot of layers to it in order to function as it currently does, so the belief is that btc will follow a similar trajectory and it will be built out in layer protocols over time to solve issues that exist.",

Everyone in the world knows this, losing short term production in china is much more preferable than letting America secure their place at the top for the next century at least. 5 or so years to move production or a 100 of playing catch-up is the choice here.

I\u2019ve started with an initial \u00a31,000 but I\u2019m unsure of how to split it at the moment. I see most people on this sub seem to advise beginners to look into ETF\u2019s as a start. I looked into the Vanguard FTSE 250 however I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a good move in the current market or not. Also it\u2019s probably good to mention I\u2019ve already invested in a few tech companies such as RTX, NVDA (again not sure if that was smart) I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get loads of stick from more experienced traders but i guess I gotta start somewhere :).\n\nAny advice would be incredible",
