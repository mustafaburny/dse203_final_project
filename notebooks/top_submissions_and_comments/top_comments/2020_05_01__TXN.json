Texas instruments is the leading producer of bms and bms ics along with being a leader in analog devices. Hell txn has twice the analog marketshare of the next biggest a company named literally analog devices. Thats how good they are at what they do. All musk did was con a bunch of investors and rubes, package everyone else's new technology up into a pretty package and hype it to hell and back. The only thing that makes musk unique is his ego.  Only thing he does outstandingly well is marketing and self promotion. Should note that I am an electrical engineer that spent about 5 years in  battery management systems, power electronics, and electric motor control. Also during my briefish stint in a startup from all the entrepreneur gatherings, conferences, incubator shit, and the meet and greet shut I can confidently tell you that I noticed a very obvious trend. The best indicator of funding raised was nowhere close to idea/business practicality or fundamentals of the underlying technology. It was always how well the CEO could sell people bullshit and their was a troubling correlation also with high functioning sociopathic traits.",

        "body": "I agree with all your points. In terms of business similarity (not at all investing prospect similarities) I think of tech companies as:\n\n- chip/components/data center hardware: NVDA, AMD, INTC, QCOM, TXN\n- fabrication: TSM (I don't follow anything else sorry)\n- PaaS: MSFT, AMZN, IBM/RedHat, GOOG (trying aggressively)\n- SaaS/Software: MSFT, GOOG, ORCL, IBM/RedHat, ADEB, FB, AMZN\n- Consumer Electronics: AAPL\n- Ads: GOOG, FB\n\nobviously there are many other companies that I don't follow, and the categorization isn't 100% clean either. AAPL's services (music, icloud, etc) are forms of SaaS. FB is technically ads, but they are also a complete marketing SaaS especially globally where many businesses rely 100% on FB for their entire online presence. Ads also depends on your reach. Both GOOG and MSFT have consumer electronics, but I don't use that to drive investment. I won't be surprised if GOOG or MSFT cancel a major line of their hardware any time.\n\nThere are many other consumer electronics companies but nothing as fully integrated as AAPL in that area, including MSFT and GOOG.\n\nRedHat is active in the datacenter space and probably why IBM acquired them. IBM is more of a global tech projects coordinator, and manages a lot of banks infrastructures, but are feeling the pressure from other PaaS providers. I don't have any investments in it though. \n\nTech companies always have their toes in many businesses because of the nature of software. I can't think of one with more toes than MSFT (maybe GOOG second), which could be unfocused waste depending on their management. It certainly feel like it was for MSFT for most of the 2000s.\n\nTo answer OP's question though, I think any of these companies are probably fine with equal chances, though you will introduce yourself to company specific short term volatility. Who knows when a random bad news for AAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, etc might hit affecting the stock price in the short term. Balancing (depending on the amount) or using an etf like others mentioned is a good idea, though I don't think any of your picks will be bad in the long run either.",

Layer 2 would be things like lightning network, where smart contracts are used with time lock verify functions. A btc transaction is used to deposit funds on lightning protocol and then those funds can be used for whatever amount of time they are locked in via contract. It then has another transaction to settle it back on the bitcoin blockchain. Lightning development is still very much in its infancy, but it\u2019s made a lot of development last few months and some people are using it regularly, even though it\u2019s in beta. It\u2019s hard to tell if it is going to be able to do what the overall goal is for scalability, but there\u2019s hopes of 10k-100k the amount of txn currently able on btc blockchain. It\u2019s definitely hard to know what also will be built on things like lightning as well, which could lead to a 3rd layer, and more. The Internet has a lot of layers to it in order to function as it currently does, so the belief is that btc will follow a similar trajectory and it will be built out in layer protocols over time to solve issues that exist.",

        "body": "There is a lot of bad advice out there right now about dividends. The best advice I can give you is stop chasing yield. Find good solid companies that are also paying a dividend. Growing EPS, low P/FCF and reasonable P/E and P/B ratios, a history of dividend growth.\n\n[Consider this](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2002&amp;firstMonth=12&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=1&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=true&amp;reinvestDividends=false&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=T&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=mcd&amp;allocation2_2=100). Look at the portfolio income at the bottom of the page. In 2003, the same investment in MCD and T would produce twice the yield return in T. But which would you rather be holding now? Which do you want in 20 years, 1.75% of 40K, 3.5% of 20k or 7% of 10k? I'm not saying buy MCD now. Maybe, but do your DD.\n\nWhat you are doing now is investing for income as if you are a retired person. Investments with high yield usually have no prospects for growth or are unstable. Preferred stock will not grow. Income CEFs do not grow. At 28 you have the luxury of time.\n\n[A few suggestions to think about.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1989&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=true&amp;reinvestDividends=false&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=KO&amp;allocation1_1=5&amp;symbol2=LMT&amp;allocation2_1=5&amp;symbol3=JNJ&amp;allocation3_1=5&amp;symbol4=MCD&amp;allocation4_1=5&amp;symbol5=LOW&amp;allocation5_1=5&amp;symbol6=TXN&amp;allocation6_1=5&amp;symbol7=ADP&amp;allocation7_1=5&amp;symbol8=GWW&amp;allocation8_1=5&amp;symbol9=AOS&amp;allocation9_1=5&amp;symbol10=HD&amp;allocation10_1=5&amp;symbol11=INTC&amp;allocation11_1=5&amp;symbol12=HON&amp;allocation12_1=5&amp;symbol13=NOC&amp;allocation13_1=5&amp;symbol14=RTX&amp;allocation14_1=5&amp;symbol15=NSC&amp;allocation15_1=5&amp;symbol16=ANTM&amp;allocation16_1=5&amp;symbol17=TD&amp;allocation17_1=5&amp;symbol18=UNH&amp;allocation18_1=5&amp;symbol19=HSY&amp;allocation19_1=5&amp;symbol20=LIN&amp;allocation20_1=5&amp;symbol22=T&amp;allocation22_2=16.66&amp;symbol23=JPM&amp;allocation23_2=16.70&amp;symbol24=PDT&amp;allocation24_2=16.66&amp;symbol25=HPF&amp;allocation25_2=16.66&amp;symbol26=HPI&amp;allocation26_2=16.66&amp;symbol27=ET&amp;allocation27_2=16.66)",

In 1985 the government of Taiwan hired Chinese-born Texas Instruments' vice-president Morris Chang to run the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Chang promoted the outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing by USA companies to Taiwanese companies, and in 1987 he personally founded the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). Taiwanese companies were able to slash costs, mainly because of cheap labor. This led to the establishment in Silicon Valley of \"fab-less\" semiconductor companies, i.e. hardware companies that did not own a factory but instead used TSMC for the actual manufacturing process.",

Im not exaggerating when I'm saying that losing American chip designers will stagnate any countries tech for atleast a decade. Our chip designers are decades ahead of any other country. If countries have to forfeit American chips due to siding with china it will secure America's dominance forever, no one will be able to catch up. Everyone in the world knows this, losing short term production in china is much more preferable than letting America secure their place at the top for the next century at least. 5 or so years to move production or a 100 of playing catch-up is the choice here. And by top I mean the very top, it'll be the difference in military tech equivalent to us having guns in a fight against archers. China will not make that choice",
