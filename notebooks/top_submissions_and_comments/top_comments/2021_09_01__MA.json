I look at FinTechs more so as partners with V/MA and not competitors. Unless one of these companies wanted to start their own payment network directly. \n\nBNPL (like Affirm) could take some of the credit card business but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some companies could start letting you even make installment payments via CC instead of direct ACH. I\u2019m sure people even use their debit cards, which are V/MA branded\n\nMy biggest concern is more regulation around payment networks and potential allowance of smaller networks to gain a piece of the pie. I read an article the other day how Australia may mandate low-cost debit card system for payments, which would allow banks to potentially utilize cheaper payment networks as opposed to V/MA (which are more expensive). I\u2019m still not overly concerned with this yet to make me back off my stance that both V/MA are great long term holds, but something to watch. \n\nOnce international travel comes back some post COVID, V/MA will shoot up as this is their bread and butter. That segment has still not really recovered yet from COVID and will be one of the last things that does.",

This model of payment is popular in India &amp; China l, but in US most people prefer credit cards as it offers insurance, fraud protection and many other benefits.\n\nSo if they start providing credit, they will have tons of customer debt on their balance sheet, much like a bank.\n\nSo IMHO V &amp; MA are much better plays than the rest of above mentioned Fintech ones.\n\n\n\nAs to why they are down right now, a large part of revenue comes from foreign transactions (Tourism) and that is being hit even more by covid mutants.",

The franchisee (like your local savings and loan, or chase or capital one, etc) uses the visa name and network, but they own the loan.  That's the whole business.  Hometown Bank Ltd pays Visa so they can have a Hometown Visa card, and they hope that all the cardholder debt earns them profit that exceeds what they have to pay Visa.  \n\nSo in the BNPL model, the debt is structured differently.  The hope is to make money on the \"pay later\" aspect, with fees or charges or interest.  It's sort of competitive to Visa/MasterCard's way of lending.",

        "body": "First of emergency funds are called are not suppose to have risk associated with it that's why they are emergency funds. But if insist on protecting the money against inflation then you are looking at the wrong asset class. You should be looking at bonds which have a safer risk specifically TIPS(treasury inflation protected securities). \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with bonds here is a quick break down. Bonds pay coupon payments a percentage of the par or principle value of the bond. E.g a bond sells for 1000$ and has a coupon rate of 3%. You get 30$ every year until the maturity of the bond. They are usually semi-annual so you get paid 15 every 6 months.  Yield to maturity is the estimated yield you would get if the bond is held to maturity. At maturity you collect the face value of the bond. Say you held the bond had a maturity of 2 years then you get your 1000 back plus 60 from your coupon payments.\n\nBonds have 2 major components of risk principal and interest risk. This can get complicated but all you need to know is if interest rates go up bond price go down and vice verse.(if you want me to explain I can, just let me know) There are ma y different types of bonds and not all have the same risk.\n\nHow does TIPS solve your problem? \nWell as the name suggest TIPS moves with inflation. If inflation rises by 3%. Then the principle value increases by 3% as well as your coupon payments. If there deflation the principle value decrease as well as coupon payments. E.g from the previous example your bond will be worth 1030$ and coupon payments would be 30.9$ annually.",

I\u2019m sure people even use their debit cards, which are V/MA branded\n\nMy biggest concern is more regulation around payment networks and potential allowance of smaller networks to gain a piece of the pie.

The franchisees pay for the privilege of operating a visa franchise.  The franchisee (like your local savings and loan, or chase or capital one, etc) uses the visa name and network, but they own the loan.  That's the whole business.  Hometown Bank Ltd pays Visa so they can have a Hometown Visa card, and they hope that all the cardholder debt earns them profit that exceeds what they have to pay Visa.  \n\nSo in the BNPL model, the debt is structured differently.  The hope is to make money on the \"pay later\" aspect, with fees or charges or interest.  It's sort of competitive to Visa/MasterCard's way of lending.",

        "body": "First of emergency funds are called are not suppose to have risk associated with it that's why they are emergency funds. But if insist on protecting the money against inflation then you are looking at the wrong asset class. You should be looking at bonds which have a safer risk specifically TIPS(treasury inflation protected securities). \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with bonds here is a quick break down. Bonds pay coupon payments a percentage of the par or principle value of the bond. E.g a bond sells for 1000$ and has a coupon rate of 3%. You get 30$ every year until the maturity of the bond. They are usually semi-annual so you get paid 15 every 6 months.  Yield to maturity is the estimated yield you would get if the bond is held to maturity. At maturity you collect the face value of the bond. Say you held the bond had a maturity of 2 years then you get your 1000 back plus 60 from your coupon payments.\n\nBonds have 2 major components of risk principal and interest risk. This can get complicated but all you need to know is if interest rates go up bond price go down and vice verse.(if you want me to explain I can, just let me know) There are ma y different types of bonds and not all have the same risk.\n\nHow does TIPS solve your problem? \nWell as the name suggest TIPS moves with inflation. If inflation rises by 3%. Then the principle value increases by 3% as well as your coupon payments. If there deflation the principle value decrease as well as coupon payments. E.g from the previous example your bond will be worth 1030$ and coupon payments would be 30.9$ annually.",

My #1 reason for selling was because I see personal traveling slowly returning while business traveling is impaired for the long-term after lessons from the pandemic with Zoom. V claims they rely more on personal travel, but never quantified it and it was just a red flag for me.\n\nOverall solid stock, but there are better opportunities out there.",

Deeply entrenched company\u2019s like visa and MasterCard have a huge leg up on any competitor and are in a position to either build or acquire capabilities they\u2019re missing. I would not bet against either, just wanted to offer a bear case based on a perspective I have seen, which is more reluctance to accept card payments when other digital payment alternatives are offered. But you make a great counter pointing out that visa and MasterCard are more than the credit cards but the processing networks beneath them which can always be repurposed and built upon",
