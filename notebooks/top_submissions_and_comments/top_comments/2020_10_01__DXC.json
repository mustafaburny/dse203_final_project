On paper Intel should be valued way higher than Nvidia but more people buy nvidia for reasons other than value. Nvidia might have a good future, and companies like DXC don't, what you buy depends on how long you plan to hold.",

        "body": "Imagine basing this months price action on TA when everything is going to be driven by the news cycles around 2 events. I'm waiting for AMD moon this month because their 2 significant product launches are not sufficiently priced in.\n\nWhy do I say that? Look at any \"investing\" comments section on AMD and all they will talk about is how AMD is overpriced because their P/E is 160 lol or AMD is just another overvalued tech company like Tesla. Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like &gt;2X and &gt;3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that. Last weeks action was all about the 5800X AotS benchmark leaks - without knowing when future leaks are coming I don't see how we can predict any specific movements.\n\nMarch 21 95C, 100Cs",

This is not an overnight play.  \n\nThey are a solid company with a huge war-chest and heavy R&amp;D budget.  Their competitors continue to slowly chip away at their market share but cannot outspend them. Intel needs to make some solid progress and reinvigorate itself.... and it has all the means to do so.  They will need a catalyst event before the market gives them another day in the sun.  I bought a good piece at $47-ish when they were very oversold but don\u2019t expect to see any significant return inside of 5 years.  Happy to hold and wait patiently.",

This right here sums up your whole fucking post.\n\n&gt;I don't know what they're doing with data trafficking and I frankly don't care.\n\nNo shit you don't care, you don't understand anything about this industry and this is why all you did was quote a bunch of garbage finance crap without saying anything regarding Intel's core business model. You sound almost as full of shit as Bob Swan himself.\n\nThey are currently 4-5 years behind in their core business and not competitive in their other segments. They have a ton of cash and they will keep using it to try and spend themselves out of this mess while they suffer delay after delay. By the time they even have EUV basics figured out TSMC will likely be producing 3nm chips.\n\nWhat does this mean? Dramatically lower power consumption (\\~ 25%) especially in the mobile sector. With the advent of 5G applications, better power/performance ratio is everything for mobile which AMD will then take from intel too.\n\n[https://www.howtogeek.com/394267/what-do-7nm-and-10nm-mean-and-why-do-they-matter/](https://www.howtogeek.com/394267/what-do-7nm-and-10nm-mean-and-why-do-they-matter/)\n\nLearn about how these things are actually made and how this shit works and you will see clear as day, they have made EVERY wrong move. 4 years of stagnation and failure is not an accident. They are going in the shitter and their core business is on life support. They are fucked.",

        "body": "well exactly my reason for posting. to hear what other people think. here are some of my thoughts on the entire situation...\n\n1. the semiconductor impact\nbecause this is such a huge player in the markets at the moment between AMD, NVDA, INTC et al, could effect the entire Tech sector. It all pivots on TMC in Taiwan which makes it tricky.\n2. 3500 US companies are suing Trump for blocking China trade access. which implies US companies want to go to China not stay locked into US.\n3. DCEP Chinese digital currency, not mentioned but could challenge the global dollar in time.\n4. Democrats are going to be more aggressive than Trump towards China. They called him \"Uncle Donald\" at one point. friendly-ish, they likely respect his financial approach even if he is brash. I dont think US will be friendly if Dems get in, and the vibe towards China will get a lot colder and nastier. that is not good if they are losing the global cold trade war, then US will start to play dirty tricks. Hilary would have had us all in a war by now imo. psychopathic woman. maybe she is still pulling strings somewhere. I truly hope not.\n5. Propaganda machine that has been driving Anti-Chinese sentiment for months is working very well and that is a big worry as once China feel even more cornered, they will likely react more aggressively. US are the cause of this whole fiasco, not the Chinese, but we are being sold differently on that narrative because US are dirty war players. history upholds that truth.\n6. China gaining more economic power and US losing it globally would totally change the face of world economy and markets fundamentally to the point it is almost impossible to imagine what that future would look like and one big question - how far would US Government be willing to go to stop that happening? that is scary because historically US Govmt have no limits that they have not been willing to go to before, including killing their own in extremely large numbers.\n\nAnyway, how all that effects trade, we will only really know after the election. I was hoping other peeps might share their wisdom/thoughts here which was my reason for posting.",

This guys cannot handle tough questions from his shareholders and her is terrible for investor confidence when they grill him (and they do).   \n   \nRead this ass wipe.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there's higher demand or because you're trying to offset the seven-nanometer delay? **Because it's hitting the margins big time, which doesn't really tie in my head to, like, yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So how do I think about the drivers of that seven-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven -- or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven-nanometer delay given what it's doing to the margins?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yeah. Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year 'cause it's clearly -- it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And we're -- part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and, I would say, on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we had forecasted for the year. So it's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that, again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer products.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**But wait a minute. If I look at your annual guidance now versus where it was in the beginning of the year, it's higher, but it's actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied in -- when you first gave the annual guidance six months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were now given you've actually lowered the second half?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue, Stacy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Well, I think I'll start with our full-year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. So that's --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Yeah. But you're just making it sound like where you can typically get to, is there --**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let me just finish, Stacy. I think it's a good question, but maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sorry.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Full-year demand for the company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer we've kind of set are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first six months, and we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, that the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And as we accelerate 10 faster, because customers are banding it more, the implications are that our margins, all else equal, will be lower. George kind of highlighted those were the primary drivers of the one-point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster, and our 5G comms business and the data center group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think, is a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If it's more of our growth than we had anticipated, all else equal, margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume, all else equal, will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year. Thank you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Operator**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/23/intel-intc-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/23/intel-intc-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx)\n\nI bolded her questions.

Needless to say he has an AMD chip in his computer and hes going to be buying their graphics card for it.  He also told me hes seen a huge trend in his industry with companies kicking out Intel chips for their servers and replacing it with, you guessed it, AMD.  Intell struggling to get them 10 nanometer chips and AMD bout to have 5 nanos by the end of 2022.  Less nanos is good for you retards.

Don't read this so I can tell you I told you so.  \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44 \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD is hotter then Mugatu right now and with the latest news i'm sure a bunch of you fucks were also wondering what might happen if this buyout occurs. I have studied in the hyperbolic time chamber and return with wisdom of ages. Behold.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAMD cash on hand for the quarter ending June 30, 2020: $1.775B (1)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nXLNX has a market cap of ~25B (2)  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nClearly, AMD does not have anywhere near the amount of cash on hand for the acquisition and will have to resort to doing it with shares. Generally speaking, acquisitions like this seem to add a premium onto the shares to make it compelling for the company being bought out to take their offer. As XLNX has a market cap of 25B, seeing something like 29-30B in shares offered isn't unreasonable.\n&amp;nbsp;\nHere's what looks like will happen if the offering is 30B in shares when AMD is trading @ 90 to make math easy. AMD will issue something like 333,333,333 new shares, you read that right, and exchange them for all of XLNX's shares. As of right now, that's over a quarter of how many shares are currently outstanding. If the market seems certain the buyout will happen, XLNX will fucking moon and trade near 2x what AMD trades at theoretically until the buyout happens as shareholders of XLNX will receive multiples of AMD if i'm not mistaken. Do your own DD.\nSources:  \n\n\n(1) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/cash-on-hand  \n\n(2) https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XLNX/xilinx/market-cap\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPS: I'm only posting it in this thread and not it's seperate post so I can be a greedy little fucking gremlin and keep the mad gains to myself whilst simultaneously being able to say \"Technically I told you so\".\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",

        "body": "so let this be a lesson. To answer the basic 'why', AMD acquired Xilinx. Some people are likeining this to their acquisition of ATI which catapulted them into fighting bankruptcy. Basically, there are questions on how well AMD can integrate Xilinx into their products. And if they can't , then their overall growth which wallstreet wants to be like 20% YOY is going to be quite reduced by a much smaller growth company in Xilinx.\n\nall that said here is my sage wisdom:\n\nno DD in the world would've prepared you for AMD. AMD's earnings alone were worth a strong shoot up to 90, on top of that their GPU unveiling is extremely promising for a good NVDA competition, assuming they didn't cherry pick too much for their benchmarking.\n\n but guess what, we all knew xilinx was a possibility, but i don't think too many people expected it this week, esp not during ER.\n\nIn the end, ER is always a gamble there is almost no DD you can do to help your chances with ER. \n\nAMD: good revenue, good profit, good growth in key areas, beat on metrics across the board, improved next q outlook, no major personnel change, **acquisition which wallstreet is apprehensive of.** All that leads to a drop.\n\nMSFT: Smashed through metrics, great growth in key areas. Post ER fall.\n\nunless you can both figure out how well they are going to do, which is hard enough on its own, determine overall market sentiment towards them, and figure out if it is priced in or not, you're probably always going to at best getting a 50/50 chance on ER.\n\nMoral of the story, if you're playing ER, play with money that you can lose, and avoid IV crush be doing spreads instead of naked long calls.",

Nokia keeps getting all these contracts they're going to the Moon literally and they're doing something else with the military and pentagon. I just don't understand what it takes to push that stock up over $5. But makes matters worse I bought AMD. Of course I did the coin flip and was considering buying xylinks and still putting everything in AMD. I should have gone 50/50 as xilinx and the other 50 and AMD. But did I? Nope.
