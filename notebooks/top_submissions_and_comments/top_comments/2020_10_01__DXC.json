Nvidia has a market cap of 400 BN and a revenue of 11 BN. Intel is in the same area and has a market cap of 270 BN and revenue of 70bn. On paper Intel should be valued way higher than Nvidia but more people buy nvidia for reasons other than value. Nvidia might have a good future, and companies like DXC don't, what you buy depends on how long you plan to hold.",

Rowe Price &amp; Wellington Associates) owning about 28% of the **entire** SPAC. That's why the share price has been suppressed, to allow them to create their longs.   \n\n\nI think retail investors are miserably wrong about this company. Annual revenue and EBITDA growth of 8-9% and 13%, respectively, are nothing to scoff at.   \n\n\nChurchill management team has also said they're not actually taking a cut until there's a minimum 25% ROI **after** the first year of trading as MultiPlan. So yeah they're not just here to pump it and run away. Their lock-up period is 18 months, and the PIPE lockup period is 6 months in the shortest instance I believe.   \n\n\nAlso if you look at the people they're bringing on board, one used to run enterprise payments for Citigroup, and the other is a former COO from HPE (HP Enterprise), with an additional 2 decades at Microsoft. They're planning on beefing up the payment processing and software aspect, which will increase their already ridiculous margins and increase LFCF.   \n\n\nThis company is undervalued by at least 50%. Just because Nikola &amp; Shell mooned doesn't mean every SPAC will end up at $50 pre-merger, but people are going to regret passing on this when it's trading at $30 within a couple of years\\* and is paying out dividends to shareholders.   \n\n\nDisclosure: Long CCXX/MultiPlan (full DD coming soon!)  \n\n\n^(\\*Barring a market melt-down prior to 2023, when interest rate hikes are projected to kick in)",
