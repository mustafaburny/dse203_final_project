However, it seems CDNS is falling off compared to SNPS in the last month, possibly due to these disparate earnings stories. CDNS got hit hard this year after a monster Q1, while SNPS has had a positive trend through volatility. That could signal an industry preference for one over the other. I can't figure out anything they're doing differently -- they both run FinFET, same full-suite offerings on the website. One is undervalued, the other slightly over. I'm curious as to why, but the two are telling different stories on the charts.",

        "body": "To be honest I can't say they talk about that and show how they have beaten the market in downturns and all that but again I dont know what they are leaving out. Looking at their history though they do seem to have picked a lot of huge winners so I imagine that is how their numbers work out. I remember their thing being if you purchased a 1000 dollars worth of every stock they recommend they show long term periods and what you would have made, this is counting the duds and everything and they compare that to the s&amp;p. I'd have to look to see what I can dig up but I haven't really cared to much as I spent 50 bucks on it a year back and its been worth that just having access to their website as someone new to investing outside of my 401k. The thing is if you don't buy all their stocks and just pick and choose you might not end up with the great numbers they are presenting.\n\nIdk I don't want to sound like I'm trying to sell anyone on it but I can maybe go look into some of that while I still have the service. Haven't decided yet if I want to get it again because I don't actually buy all they recommend and I think that defeats the purpose because I'm essentially just licking stocks myself with a little bit of a nudge so I'm not sure if I can ever commit fully to just go with their licks but what I can say is I would have done even better had I done it. A couple months back I decided I would for the rest of the year I have left and see how it goes. The ones I ended up getting from their picks this year is, CRWD (31%), ATVI(32%), ZNGA(45%),IDXX(25%) HUBS(100%). I bought some late except CRWD. A couple of their licks that I sold out of early that are WORK, SNPS, DXCM. They pushed Zoom heavily but I never got any because it seemed not that great a product to me, they pushed tesla a lot pretty early on but I don't really count it because I already was buying some regardless, nvta was another and I think that was before everyone was talking about them mainly because of ARK. These are off the top of my head. But I do remember them recomending lucking coffee as well and that was a pretty big failure.",
