Morris Chang actually learnt everything at TI and went back to Taiwan and started it all, kind of a godfather if you will to the whole industry taking off there. TSMC is a stable stock will never go down in value, but we also know the upside unlike say Amazon which keeps finding and gobbling up business anywhere, value unknown could worth $3500 or whatever it is today or it could co down to $15 dollars like it did in 2008. The chip shortage hype will die in a week and TSMC reached its own peak in the last 12 months I think it was $125 to $130, will drop down after the momentum junkies find other hype stocks to play.",

ASML bought Cymer...  \n\nThe real trick would be if ASML found a means to help with implementation of the tools. Intel held back using EUV b/c they didn't want to take the risk. ASML would have done better if Intel was more confident in the roadmap. \n\nAt the same time, single-digit process nodes may not be the only answer. \n\nThe need for analog-to-digital chips only increases: ADI and TXN would be the primary beneficiaries here. \n\n Specialists will also benefit: eg, those haptic chips in the Sony PlayStation Controller will be in more and more devices in the future too. \n\nNetworking tends to be a bottleneck ... whoever solves latency problems (Tesla?!) at scale might do very well also\n\nSK is splitting in half ... not sure that's the angle since I believe the dram biz will be part of a larger VC-type business going after themes like the metaverse",
