I use Oracle Cloud for my hobby projects simply due to its affordability and making many of their services compatible with or flat out running on FOSS projects (odd that Oracle would make something like this considering its history as a company run like a mafia). \n\nOnce they add a CDN I will have zero reason to use AWS except for work since AWS pricing is just too high considering the competition it is facing.\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform has some room to grow, but it has embraced a multi-cloud type of strategy and is making tools to facilitate that so I can see their market share increasing long term... maybe. I can't speak to them as I haven't used GCP before.\n\nAzure seems like the slightly cheaper knockoff AWS without signed cookies in its CDN which even GCP has. Not sure about this since I don't use Azure.\n\nIBM cloud is... ew... and Alibaba/Yandex clouds... we don't talk about those. But maybe some companies will use IBM if that company gets its shit together like Oracle did. For now the only reason to use IBM is if you use DB2 or something. IBM cloud is way overpriced.\n\nTl;dr AWS will lose market share in the long term",

You need grey neck beards to make their stuff work.  \n\nI like that Larry was involved in the America's cup, but he cheated.  Technically, pumping was allowed in the rules that he wrote but that's not sailing, it's paddling.   He's a douche canoe, and his database sucks ass.\n\nIBM was doing cloud computing 30 years ago, which is kind of ironic that their stuff wasn't used for it.   It's also ironic that as the world moves away from or hide the POSIX model, everything is looking more like an AS400.     IBM kind of missed out on this hypertext fad, and that was their death knell.   Maybe Watson can save them, but it might be a gimmick.    \n\nCisco did a nice job of getting all the \"I want a lucrative career in IT\" pups trained in on their stuff, essentially locking themselves in as the de-facto standard.
