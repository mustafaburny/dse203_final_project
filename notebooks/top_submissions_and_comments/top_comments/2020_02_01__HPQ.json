        "body": "The first thing is to not compare yourself and your situation to others.  \"Comparison is the thief of joy\" as the saying goes....\n\nNext, adopt a minimalism lifestyle (watch the netflix show on Minimalism).  Sell the shit that is cluttering up your life.  Anytime you think about buying some new shiny thing, ask yourself these two questions:  1. How have I gotten along without this in the past?  2. Why do I need it now?\n\nPut a sign on your bedroom wall that says \"Look around... All of this stuff used to be Money\"  You won't buy half the stuff you currently think you need.  \n\nNow that you have your money going into your pocket instead of toward some meaningless stuff, learn how to read and interpret a balance sheet and income statement.  Next, fund an account with whatever you can afford.  Start small and buy shares in companies that you understand.  What is their business model?  How do they make money?  For example, Hewlett Packard will give away the printer to sell you the ink.  Gillette (before being bought out) gave away the razor to sell you the blades.  Apple used to be a gadget maker and they banked on the product replacement cycle (you gotta buy the new model because it does so much extra for you and is better)....  PKG sells packaging...  Timken sells bearings...  Do you know anything about those businesses?  If not, then don't buy it.  Buy the companies that you know and understand how they work and how they make money.  If they pay a dividend, great.  At least you get paid to wait.  \n\nThe alternative is to YOLO your paycheck into binary option plays that might not payoff.  Think about this....  A stock will move one of three ways - up, down, or sideways.  If you buy a call option, the only way you can win is if the stock moves up.  You can lose if the stock moves down or sideways.  So you lose in 2 out of 3 scenarios, win in only 1 of the 3 scenarios.   You don't have to be an expert in Black-Scholes option pricing methodologies or even understand all the Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, theta, etc).  \n\nGood luck.  We've all been where you are, and it's hard to see these other people have so much success when you're hardly making ends meet.  You'll get there....  But it takes time.",
