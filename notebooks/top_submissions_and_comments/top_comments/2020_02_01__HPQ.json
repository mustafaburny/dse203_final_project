        "body": "The first thing is to not compare yourself and your situation to others.  \"Comparison is the thief of joy\" as the saying goes....\n\nNext, adopt a minimalism lifestyle (watch the netflix show on Minimalism).  Sell the shit that is cluttering up your life.  Anytime you think about buying some new shiny thing, ask yourself these two questions:  1. How have I gotten along without this in the past?  2. Why do I need it now?\n\nPut a sign on your bedroom wall that says \"Look around... All of this stuff used to be Money\"  You won't buy half the stuff you currently think you need.  \n\nNow that you have your money going into your pocket instead of toward some meaningless stuff, learn how to read and interpret a balance sheet and income statement.  Next, fund an account with whatever you can afford.  Start small and buy shares in companies that you understand.  What is their business model?  How do they make money?  For example, Hewlett Packard will give away the printer to sell you the ink.  Gillette (before being bought out) gave away the razor to sell you the blades.  Apple used to be a gadget maker and they banked on the product replacement cycle (you gotta buy the new model because it does so much extra for you and is better)....  PKG sells packaging...  Timken sells bearings...  Do you know anything about those businesses?  If not, then don't buy it.  Buy the companies that you know and understand how they work and how they make money.  If they pay a dividend, great.  At least you get paid to wait.  \n\nThe alternative is to YOLO your paycheck into binary option plays that might not payoff.  Think about this....  A stock will move one of three ways - up, down, or sideways.  If you buy a call option, the only way you can win is if the stock moves up.  You can lose if the stock moves down or sideways.  So you lose in 2 out of 3 scenarios, win in only 1 of the 3 scenarios.   You don't have to be an expert in Black-Scholes option pricing methodologies or even understand all the Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, theta, etc).  \n\nGood luck.  We've all been where you are, and it's hard to see these other people have so much success when you're hardly making ends meet.  You'll get there....  But it takes time.",

I needed braces a few years ago.\n\nThen, a company started to sell 50% half the price of the braces I got. This is an example of destructive changes due to capitalism.

        "body": "\n&gt;I really appreciate you taking the time .....I totally see it now with my MA example. \n\nSure thing, glad you got it. I hate to see people losing money that they shouldn't have to, especially if I can help prevent it by simply helping them work out the numbers! \n\n\n&gt;I could sell the feb 7 $277.5 put and collect Friday\u2019s bid of .85 that would be premium of $850 on 1000 shares. \n\nYup, that's correct (keeping in mind that at Monday's open the prices are likely gonna be different; but you got the idea).\n\nAlso, again, I'd recommend not hitting the bid, but rather trying first at mid price or maybe even a bit better. Eg, I see a 0.85 x 0.90 market on those puts (from Friday). I'd try to sell that put for maybe 0.88 first, and then lower my price penny by penny til I get my fill. I also would lower it all the way to the bid, as I would consider I'm being completely ripped off of I have to go all the way there (unless I had a very strong need to do it, like to close a position to prevent massive losses; but not to open a new one).\n\n\n&gt;And the way to protect myself from a loss would be to close the position early before Im down \n$850 and use my premium to prevent loss ?\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure is clear - and, again, because of Put-Call parity, it applies to both a short put and a covered call trades - is that this premium you receive is not really \"a cushion\", not really a way to protect you from losses.\n\nLooking at the short put trade may actually help to see this thing I'm gonna talk about more clearly, but remember the exact same thing applies to CC, just maybe a bit harder to see as things are a bit less explicit.\n\nOnce you sell that put, you don't \"make 850 USD\". You are making a transaction in which 850 USD are exchanged for something worth 850 USD. You have 0 profits of losses initially. So there isn't really an 850 USD cushion.\n\nYou're effectively getting 850 USD now to assume a liability valued by the market at 850 USD now. \n\nIf AAPL goes down, or if IV increases, the premium of that put is going to increase, meaning that you'll be at a loss: you'll have 850 USD cash, and a liability of more than 850 USD market value. \n\nSay AAPL moves in such a way that the put is now worth 1.00. You're at a loss of 0.15 per share, or 150 USD. You can close everything and take that 150 USD loss. More explicitly, you initially received 850 USD to assume a liability, and then you paid 1000 USD to rid yourself from that liability: a 150 USD loss. Notice that the 150 USD loss doesn't even require you to close your trade: you're at a loss simply because you have 850 USD cash and a liability worth 1000 USD cash. It's an \"unrealized loss\", which doesn't mean \"unreal loss\", it's very real! \n\nIf the position is going against you, you can close it at any time, and take (or realize) the loss. A common threshold people use in short put trades is to not let the loss become bigger than the max profit you were looking at. So in this case, this rule of thumb would lead people to close the short put by buying it back for 1.70, if it starts going that way. People usually talk about this by saying stuff like \"close for a loss at 2x the premium received\". \n\nSo this way of \"protection\" is really just getting out of the position - at a loss! - in order to prevent the losses from possibly getting bigger, much bigger. Sometimes people resist it thinking that they may want to hold longer \"to see if it comes back\": problem is, it may also go further! \n\nThere are many other ways to protect yourself, too.\n\nFor example, you could buy a put at a lower strike. It reduces your profitability, since you'll be spending part of the premium you got to acquire this protection. But it effectively limits the max you can lose. Eg if you buy the 270 put, you'll be paying around 0.62 (mid of 0.60 x 0.64 that I see here), but if AAPL tanks to, say, 250, you'll be forced to buy it for 277.5 (your short put) but you have the right to sell it for 270 (yourong put). The trade off is that now, on 10 contracts, the max profit you're looking at is 230 USD (850 USD from selling the 277.5 usd, 620 USD from buying the 270 put). **This is exactly a vertical spread.**\n\nAlternatively, you could short a bit of stock: this reduces the effect of the put increasing in value (this increasing your losses) as the stock price goes down: the profit on the short balances put some of the losses on the short put. People usually think about doing this kind of stuff when the delta of their short put gets too big and scary. Disadvantage is that if the stock moves up, you lose on the short stock position, and this loss can eventually even get bigger than the profits from shorting the put... so it has to be managed actively. **This is usually referred to as managing or hedging delta (and can be done in other ways, too, like reducing the size of the short put position, or selling OTM calls basically transforming it into a strangle, etc).**\n\nSo many possibilities...\n\nIf you want to explore more about this, check whether your trading platform has some good support for risk analysis for options. You didn't mention what it is, so I'm gonna comment on a few popular ones around here. \n\nToS has an OK tool in the Analyze tab: it works well for simple positions, it's pretty easy to use, but it simply cannot handle a more complex position with many legs without slowing down to the point where it becomes unresponsive for 10s of seconds.\n\nIB has absolutely amazing support for analyzing options portfolios in the Risk Navigator tool: it can handle whatever book of option you throw at it with fantastic performance, and IMO it has an incredibly superior model to ToS's, both in terms of its default settings as well as in terms of offering incredibly powerful ways to tweak it if you want (you probably don't, at least not initially).\n\nRobinhood has nothing. Well, it calculates your \"break even\" for single legs... But frankly, I wouldn't trust even that number without verifying it myself every time as RH is just... well, it's RH. \n\nTastyworks is something I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think this aspect would've changed much, since all I see is they trying to push a \"novel\" risk analysis approach: it sucks in this area. (it emphasizes too much this notion of \"probability of profit\", which is really absurd IMO as it isn't anywhere close to reflecting risk, especially in non-trivial positions). \n\nI'll share a couple of screenshot from IB later when I get to my competition so you can get a sense of what it looks like, and how you can explore ways to possibly protect yourself from big losses.",

It's a loss. \n\n&gt;So on 1000 shares thats $1840 in my pocket for 5 trading days assuming MA stays above $285. \n\nNo, at 1000 shares and 10 calls, your account will be worth $1840 less than it is worth today, in the best case scenario.\n\nIf you do what you described, you'll lose 1840 USD with absolute certainty. Maybe more, if MA tanks more than 10% in the coming week. \n\nI'd suggest that you read the calculations again on my previous comment. \n\n\n&gt;So far I have been successful because of the bull market and being conservative with ITM calls. \n\nUnderstanding that your success comes from the bull market is very good (some people would think it comes from ... ? some sort of natural or inherent edge of the strategy?) \n\n\n&gt;I am set up to sell naked or cash secured puts , I just don\u2019t feel comfortable yet doing so. \n\nTake some time to really think about this.\n\nThe trades you said you've been doing (buy shares AND sell ITM calls) and the alternative I mentioned (just selling an OTM put, same strike as the call you'd consider in a CC) are ***exactly the same***. You just feel uncomfortable with selling the puts because you don't see it yet that it's exactly what you're doing (but with 1 less step, so less overall costs).\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable with the risk profile of selling puts, you probably should review your understanding of CC, as you're probably not fully understanding your risks on CC trades. \n\nThis is actually a common theme here, by the way - you're definitely not alone in this fear. At least once a week (usually more) there are posts about people comfortable with selling a CC but uncomfortable selling a put (even if \"cash-secured\") at the same strike and expiration, even though it's absolutely the same position.",

        "body": "Thank you for sharing! I was hoping you could answer a few questions (please excuse me in advance if these questions sound trivial as I have no experience in real estate/home renovation/development/etc.)\n\n1.) I believe someone else has asked why the property manager who works for you has been so loyal this whole time? From an outsiders perspective it would seem that someone who is able to handle the responsibility of managing all your properties in addition to being able to turn what you basically write are eyesores into quaint turnkey rentals on a tight budget, wouldn\u2019t this employee/subcontractor constantly be approached by headhunters from larger real estate/commercial firms with more lucrative offers of employment? \n\n2.) I live in MA and ever since \u201808 have seen those highway billboards which advertise \u201cwe buy ugly homes\u201d. Now I don\u2019t know whether or not you are familiar with what I\u2019m referring to, but wouldn\u2019t these types of large companies be after exactly the type of properties you are interesting in buying up and renovating? Do you ever face competition from these bigger companies? \n\n3.) Ive seen a lot of people writing that they marvel at the market in MO where you\u2019re able to scoop up properties in the 10k range. Living in MA, which is an extremely expensive state to both buy and rent, I too am astonished that even the most dilapidated home could cost such a small amount of money. \nI remember many years ago when I worked on Cape Cod for the summer, my boss at the time asked if I\u2019d be interested in purchasing his \u201cstarter home\u201d for only 5k. I was a kid back then, with maybe a couple grand in savings, but out of curiosity went to go check out what 5k could buy in Falmouth, MA. When I got there, I wasn\u2019t much surprised to see it was inside of a trailer home community. However, the home (if you could call it one), was horrific. It was actually built on foundation, so it stood apart from the trailer homes surrounding the property, however, it was literally a studio apartment built as a home. The linoleum floor was peeling away everywhere you looked exposing wet moldy wood which stunk to high hell. It was a dump, no one would even consider buying as it was completely unlivable and would surely cost less to demolish and build one of those tiny homes that weren\u2019t in style or known about back then in its place.\nThis is a long winded way of asking what exactly does the phrase \u201cgood bones\u201d mean when looking at homes? Is it mold/rot/insulation problems/pipe issues/sewer plumbing/etc? Or is it mostly referring to the foundation upon which the house rests and the wood/stone which holds it together? \nThanks in advance for any insight you could provide!",

        "body": "Now it's much easier, knowing the exact contract!\n\n\n&gt;My profit would be 315.94-314.10 = $1.84\n\nThat's backwards. Profits are calculated as Sale minus Purchase. \n\nYou're gonna have to buy stock for 315.94. The short 285 call means you're gonna sell stock for 285 (if assigned). You get 29.10 premium for hitting the bid, so you could consider that your sale price is increased by that amount to 314.10 - however, I'd recommend you keep that separate in your calculations, it's easier. \n\nSo you'd calculate your profits as: 314.10 - 315.94 = -1.84. A loss. \n\nHere's how I'd calculate it, which will lead to the same result, but I prefer it more explicitly. Think of cash flows. You disburse 315.94 to acquire shares and receive 29.10 to sell the calls. Under the assumption that the Stock stays above the 285 strike price, you'll then receive 285 when you sell the stock as a result of assignment. Cash flows into your account increase your cash balance, and out of your account decrease it: so money you receive is positive, money you pay is negative. \n\nWith all the cash flows explicit, you'd calculate your profits as: -315.94 + 29.10 + 285 = -1.84. Same value (as expected), just a tad more explicit. \n\nSo your trade generates a guaranteed loss, in the best case scenario, of 1.84 per share. It's worse if MA goes below 285.\n\nWhy's that? \n\nBecause hitting the bid is a really, really bad idea.\n\nMarket orders (or marketable limit orders, ie, the ones that cross the bid-ask spread for an immediate fill) are in general a really bad idea in options, because bid-ask spreads can be extremely wide. This is especially the case for deep ITM options - and 10% ITM for MA (around 23%-ish IV) at 1 week to expiration is super deep ITM. \n\nIn the very least, you should sell that Call for 31.07. \n\n(this is based on the 315.94 MA price you mentioned, and on the bid-ask prices on the options chain for MA that I'm looking at right now, which are stale since this is the weekend; but let's go with it for a moment, for the sake of the explanation). \n\nHere's how I got that number: if MA is at 315.94, a 285 call has 30.94 premium just in intrinsic value. It must have some extrinsic value, too, since there's time until expiration.\n\nLooking at the 285 put, same expiration, I see a 0.13 x 0.27 market. Selling a covered call at strike 285 is the same as just selling a put at that same strike: this means you have at least 0.13 in extrinsic value. Add that to the intrinsic value, you get 31.07 premium that I mentioned. I also said \"in the very least\" because this was calculated based on the bid. But like I mentioned before, you it's a bad idea to trade options crossing the bid-ask spread, so you should look for more than that. \n\nThis idea of looking at the price of the put is due to what's known as Put-Call Parity. Essentially, it's the fact that `Stock = Call - Put (same strikes and expiration)`. Technically, for American options this may not hold due to potential early assignment, but in general you just assume it holds since early exercise is rarely optimal. \n\nFinally, notice that, once again due to Put-Call parity, selling the 285 covered call is exactly the same as selling the 285 put. In other words, you can achieve the very same risk profile by either having +100x MA -1x C285, or by having just -1x P285 (both on the Feb 7 expiration). \n\nSo if you don't have stock yet, and are looking to establish that position, you can instead simply sell the 285 put - better on commissions, better on less bid-ask spreads to deal with.\n\nHowever, if you already have the stock and want that position, you just sell the call (after finding out what price you should get!).\n\nAs a final note, I'm not exactly sure what your reasons for such a trade are, and while they may be valid, it's something that I'd definitely not do. If MA was part of any long term holdings, selling the 285 call is an almost guaranteed way to end up without MA in the portfolio, and there's super low reward in that (between 0.13 to 0.27). If I didn't have MA and was looking for a short term play (in which case I'd definitely do it by selling the 285 put, rather than buying stock AND selling a call), this would be one of those plays in which the reward is so meaningless, and the potential losses - even if unlikely - can be so insanely devastating comparatively, that it's definitely not worth it for me.",

If the effect is long-term, they will not just sit around and wait on China.\n\nNetflix and Adobe. Really, no effect.\n\nAmerican Express, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal. Not much.\n\nHealthcare, energy, communications, and industrials are mainy domestic.\n\nDefense contractors don't work for China.\n\nThe virus mainly affects China's economy. We do not follow the Shanghai market. As somebody mentioned in another post, look at the 5 year chart of S&amp;P and Shanghai and see that there is no correlation. The virus scare was designed to have retailers drop their shares after companies posted record earnings. Market makers wanted to get in cheaper, so they exaggerated the effects the virus would have on the economy.\n\nPolitics, threats of war, and virus scares are temporary effects to the market.",
