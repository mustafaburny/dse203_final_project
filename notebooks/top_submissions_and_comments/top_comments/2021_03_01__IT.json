So, we could assume the same was happening with other brokers. At the same time, I know that at least TDA isn't allowing short selling of GME at all (was on the phone with them the other day, and the guy told me they haven't allowed it since the end of January).\n\nStill, the price has not only held, but risen pretty significantly today. I'm having a hard time seeing the downside to continuing to hold, I just don't think it's a wise thing to sell at this point. The gamma squeeze seems like it'll happen, the short squeeze is likely too. And even if it's not, the company is pivoting and may become a big player in the years to come. All those things are why I will keep holding.\n\nAt the same time, if you haven't covered your initial investment, please do so. I sold off enough at the end of January to pay off almost $50k of CC debt and to have a bit leftover to provide for me and my kids. Now I'm playing with house money, so it's easier for me to weather the dips.\n\nI'm holding 307 shares @ \\~$70 per share. I also have a 17 calls for different dates.",

The best time to buy GME was 2 months ago, the second best time is NOW.\n3. Buy shares, not options. Invest only the money you can afford to lose.\n4. Don't fall for FUD. Any account can be a shill/bot, even the ones created before January. They are PAYING users to spread fear and enroll you to post negative comments/posts.\n5. GME has been and will always be the only play. Anything else is a distraction to limit the impact GME can have. (Yes, even RKT). Never will the planets align this perfectly again to trigger the biggest short squeeze of your lifetime.\n6. The most important point : Don't sell. Supply and demand : you have something they want, we all do. So YOU set the price you want. And the price can actually go up to infinity. This is going to be the biggest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen, don't ruin it being a paper hand and selling low.\n7. Hold. Hold. Hold. Selling at 1k is trolling. They want you to sell at 1k, that's why they keep spamming comments saying they put stop limits at 1k. 1k is lowball. 1k could just be a gamma squeeze. 10k is lowball.\n8. As stated by u/Polihanna, the squeeze will last multiple days. Don't be afraid that it lasts a few seconds and you'll miss it. You won't. \n9. Don't day-trade GME. It's extremely volatile, and you actually help them by selling shares that they can buy for cheap. You delay the squeeze and reduce its impact if you day-trade.\n10. THIS IS NOT A GAME OF GREED.

I have REEMF + REZZF + ALYI + TLOFF + ILHMF + SXOOF + UAMY + FCSMF + MLLOF + HNCKF + COCBF + MNGG + BMIX\n\nhttps://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/\n\nPennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .\n\nOtcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,\u00a0 up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. \n\nUnbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.\n\nFinviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .\n\nMy stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .\n\nYou can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.\n\nTD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.\u00a0 RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. \n\nI trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .\n\nThe general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. \n\nWe all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . \n\nI don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. \n\nI go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.\u00a0 Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,\u00a0 operating income,\u00a0 EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. \n\nBillions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .\n\nBefore a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.\u00a0 Also good info from posters that know about the company.\u00a0 Volume too is important.\u00a0 Should be much higher than usual.\n\nI also go to Stocktwits for the same .\n\nSomeone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. \n\nBut these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.\u00a0 So read through the lines.\n\nFinally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.\u00a0 I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. \n\nIf you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .\nOn NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG \n\nhttps://www.allpennystocks.com/hotpennystocks/nsd.aspx",

We constantly make clear that you  should not build a portfolio based on what we do because we're  smooth-brained, crayon-eating fucking apes who don't even have an exit  strategy. We do that for a reason. Nobody lost money because of DFV. If  anyone who isn't a hedgie or an astroturf alias of one lost money, it's  because they followed self-described morons when they were openly  talking about how unsound their financial strategy was.\n\nI'll  tell you who does cause investors to lose money: the fucking hedges.  They find an easy target to fucking destroy, then they use strategies  like naked shorting, shit that should be illegal, to manipulate the  market and artificially inflate their short position, then destroy their  easy targets using lies and criminal behavior. They dredge up literal  fake news stories, feed it to the press, and those dumbasses somehow eat  the shit up, then broadcast that bullshit it to the whole country and  world. The hedgies literally manipulate the market, What causes these  bubbles and market manipulation is these shorting practices which any  ape in ECON102 would tell you is fucking dangerous. If we can  \"manipulate\" the market by just holding shares and not fucking doing  anything with them, then just make memes about it, the architects of  that market are probably fucking troglodytes.\n\nI  can't believe these dumbasses are investigating a YouTuber / Redditor, not people who actually hold the necessary power to engage in  financial practices that caused a panic to be possible. They're  interrogating everyday schmucks who engage in literally just having  shares, and those responsible are laughing their asses all the way to  the fucking bank. If the morons in MA are actually dumb enough to blame  us, this is only the first bet of many. The media will move on, but  we'll still be here making bets that stick it to the fucking rich pricks  and powerful morons standing between us and crispy motherfucking  chicken tendies.",

The main reason was because I was too busy with work and family to spend time investing. It grew a lot because I was in some very good names.  I got more involved because I had rolled over a 401k to an IRA and needed to re-deploy.  There were too many good companies available really cheap so after I had invested the IRA I moved on to my Roth.  But since then I have invested into a more diversified but still very tech heavy portfolio.  I sold the Panasonic &amp; TSM first, then the QQQ, finally sold my last MSFT a couple months ago.  \n\nLately, I have been going with a much more active strategy holding usually 6-18 months.  I still have the first position I got into from Panasonic proceeds, $TEAM (I got in at $52.87/share).  \n\nMy advice would be don't get emotional about selling a position you have held for a really long time if you find a better opportunity.  I also think that the walking away for a long time was a good move for me because being this active takes a lot of time doing research and tracking the news.  It would have detracted from my career path and family to do it between 2018-2016 and my portfolio size wasn't large enough to make the extra returns worthwhile.",

Their valuation was $25B, and you need to pay a premium in order to acquire a company.  And the play wasn't a result of trying to get Slack's revenue or profit.  Microsoft has been pushing Dynamics *hard* as part of the O365 licensing model.  That's a direct competitor to SFDC.  And MSFT's message that their sales org is pushing is \"We hit all of your software needs with one license.\"  The biggest driver of upsales on O365 are Dynamics and Teams.  Bundling CRM and UCaaS is a gamechanger, and has been wildly successful for them.\n\nSFDC needed to be able to compete with that bundling.  So they bought the biggest competitor to Teams.  And they'll bundle it with SFDC licenses.\n\nTableau is a similar purchase.  BI is a huge play right now, and *also* a feature that MSFT is bundling with O365.  Adding Tableau into the fold allows SFDC to directly compete with MSFT on that front, too.\n\nThese aren't cookie jar acquisitions, they're competitive expansion via acquisition.",

        "body": "TLDR : Stop losses cut the trade. Many times, after hitting the stop loss, the stock will move back in the correct direction. No matter what position is taken (short or long) it is very difficult to accurately enter a trade, hit the target before hitting stop loss. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI day trade - not very successful - just enough success to cover my losses :P \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe problem with doing the \"opposite\", with the strategy I use, is this : \n1. The stocks I pick for day trading are large caps - e.g. - Apple, MSFT etc.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2. If you consider an up trending day, then the obvious position to take is a long position for the day.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3. On a typical day, a stock price is range bound - for example between $100-$101. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4. Typically, I would start building a long position when the price is near $100.2 and set a stop loss at $99.6 and target at $101. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n5. Probabilistically, the long position on a large cap on a up trending day, is correct.  The problem really occurs when the price momentarily  (spike) drops to 99.6 and hits the stop loss (kills the trade).\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n6. Later in the day, of course the stock moves back to the target price. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n7. It takes a long time to enter trades correctly and avoid stop loss. The basics of trading really do work over time - e.g. - always take positions with the trend (of the stock and the index). Always enter high probability trades (as per whatever trade indicators you use).  \n&amp;nbsp;",

This was surprising to me as he's always been super wary of investments other than real estate (has no retirement account other than this but this is a discussion for another time). He says \"whatever you think\" to any question I ask him so he's a bit unhelpful. I'd like to invest in solid (as solid as they can be) accounts that might not show growth in the next year or so, but that can be fruitful in 5+ years. I was thinking:\n\nAAPL, DIS, MSFT, etc... or should I put most in something like AMZN? Also thinking of SPY or ETFs (open to suggestions).\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated!",

        "body": "As of now, this is a \"special dividend\" which is a one time occurrence.  Not many companies do this, as a comparison Microsoft did this as well in 2004.  Had you been accumulating Microsoft over the years since 2004, you'd be doing pretty well today.  I think the special dividend is meant to show that they value the shareholders and payback that growth.  They want to be considered a fintech company though (a growth company) and not a value stock, so I would imagine they will resist issuing more dividends in the near term.  That doesn't mean 10 years from now they wont.  This is the kind of stock you hold on to (IMO) and don't worry about \"thinking it will dump\".  As I've described the price will take at least a 5% loss (probably more) after March 9th when people sell after the div payment.  What they don't realize is by doing that they are actually losing money. Yes they got the dividend but they also took the share price decrease and the additional decrease from the other sellers, which in the example above, would be more than the $1,100 you get issued (i.e. a net negative investment). You can short term play it if you like but your profits are only going to be in what the stock price rises between now and the div payment.  If you plan to sell directly after March 9, just know you are probably losing money.  You would need to hold after the 9th until the stock price rises a bit (hopefully).  OR you can just continue to hold a great stock, which to me is the better move.",

I personally can't see this happening, as the Fed has shown itself to be extremely dovish and is trying to recover the real economy first (jobs ans solvency issues). \n\nThere is also the huge debt problem they now have from all the money printing they've done, the easiest way for them to solve that is to inflate it away as quickly as possible, so long term high inflation seems like something they would try for.

That end of year statement was a bit of a \"Guh\" moment since everything I had earned plus some basically had evaporated.   But, wasn't like I was going to touch that money then.  I did nothing to change the strategy I had picked for investing and instead doubled up on my 401k contributions.\n\nBest decision I ever made in regards to my retirement investments -- I came out way ahead because I was able to buy more while everything was recovering.\n\nMy biggest regret over the last year is when COVID hit I was too focused on the disaster itself and neglected to make any real changes to how I was investing to take better advantage of it.  If this continues and goes deeper - don't look at it as a loss if your investing for the long term.  Look at as an opportunity to get more potential long term value out of the money you put in now. \n\nAs a current example - I bought NVIDIA because I believed they have a potential for real growth through the autonomous vehicle industry.  But, yeah stocks down since I invested in it.  Bought more this morning - why?  I **STILL** believe it's going to grow in the next 5-years because of the rise of autonomous vehicles tech.  *It's just on sale now.*",

        "body": "March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.\n\nAfter the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.\n\nProspects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a \"very strong\" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.\n\nThe Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.\n\n\"This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,\" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.\n\nA slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.\n\nTech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.\n\nThe divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\n\"The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,\" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. \"The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,\" he said.\n\nBy 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.\n\nBanks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.\n\nWalt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.\n\nGameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash in New York, Karen Pierog in Chicago and Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Lisa Shumaker)",

Probably the best CEO in the space as well. \n\nI also like Qualcomm a lot for similar reasons, but also because they\u2019re positioned to win big in 5G and will probably do well in the IoT space as well.

The newest Ryzen chips are incredible, in terms of price to performance, and their newest set of graphics cards, while suffering from the same shortage as their only real competition, nVidia, have on par performance specs for 25% less. I've been an Intel/nVidia user since I built my first PC years ago, but in the last few generations of chips and cards, I've always recommended AMD products to my friends looking to build PCs. In fact, if you look on the logicalincrements website, which is a very popular resource for speccing out a new PC, each and every recommended CPU is AMD. They were small, and overlooked in the past, but they are dominating as of late.\n\nLooking at the prices of the stocks, AMD is still less than 1/3 the market cap of NVDA, despite the fact that NVDA only makes GPUs, while AMD makes both CPUs and GPUs. If you look at Intel, they have 2.5x the market cap of AMD, and they only make CPUs.\n\nWith the way AMD's chips have been performing, and the fact that they are outperforming on both isles of the PC gaming industry, I think they'll end up doing very well. A stock price of $250+ is not out of the question imo.",

I bought $10 worth of every stock listed above so I could keep tabs on them. All of them have followed the same negative trajectory the last month or so.

HOWEVER, the reason why I\u2019m so bullish on Fubo and why this recent dip is a massive buying opportunity is that Dish + DraftKing merger is not even a big threat. Dish is LOSING 100,000+ subscribers quarterly. Why? Because unlike Fubo, it requires satellite (not the future). Also, Verizon has a 7%+ stake in Fubo which gives it a lot of potential partners. Fubo\u2019s financials are getting hit because they\u2019re focusing on spending NOW to grow their customer base as fast as possible during the pandemic.

Better tech than Intel but cheaper than NVIDIA, no fabrication operations because they were losing money on it a few years ago so sold it off to focus on design, which I think gives them more flexibility to adapt to capitalize on any investments that could be coming from the public sector, and they probably aren\u2019t bleeding money from production constraints like the others. Probably the best CEO in the space as well. \n\nI also like Qualcomm a lot for similar reasons, but also because they\u2019re positioned to win big in 5G and will probably do well in the IoT space as well.

This is a very thorough list and has companies such as many major banks, Cummins (CMI), Qualcomm (QCOM), World Fuel Services (INT) to name a few (there are many more).
