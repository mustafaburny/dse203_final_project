        "body": "You buy a bond from the government with a guarantee that at the end of x number of years, you will be returned your money plus a fixed interest rate.  Bonds really do only go up, but their interest rates aren't that great.  If stocks were a one night stand with a prostitute, bonds are like having an arranged marriage with an Amish girl; the sex will be guaranteed but you may have to do it through a hole in a sheet and it will be the exact same for the next 10 to 20 years.  It's the governments job to make bond interest rates attractive enough that you'll choose their stability over stocks, but not so attractive that they lose a ton of money if the market crashes.  They have to continue putting out even if the world is on fire.  The government banks on the fact that in the short term, they can put your money to good enough use that in the long term they have more than enough to pay you back.\n\nStocks are attractive because they offer us the opportunity for faster gains but there's a chance they handcuff you to a bed and steal your wallet.  Bonds are kind of plain looking and boring but they'll stand by you through thick and thin.\n\nA retirement account will generally start with more stocks and less bonds in the beginning because you want higher rate of return, but will change to mostly bonds near retirement because they have a lot less risk.  You wouldn't want a market crash to wipe out your retirement fund when you are close to retirement.  So your retirement account should party hard and get its dick wet however it can when it's young but should settle down with something more stable in its old age.\n\nOptions are like visiting a gloryhole in a seedy truck stop.  It could be Alexandra Daddario sucking you off on the other side of that bathroom stall, but it's more than likely a methhead with herpes that wandered in there to pick up used cigarette butts.",

This will most likely not be the case. The hedge funds are smarter and will have learned their mistakes from the previous squeeze last month. Instead, they will elongate the squeeze and hope that we eventually lose interest.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThe squeeze is currently happening. As long as certain checkpoints are hit each week, the squeeze will continue to squeeze.\n\nWe saw this last week as we broke certain price thresholds. These thresholds had a ton of options ITM that results in shares that need to be bought. These bought shares pushed the stock price to its current level. Passing through thresholds each week means that the stock price will \"Level Up\" until the shorts are out.\n\nWhat are the thresholds this weeks?\n\n[As you can see here](http://puu.sh/HlNeJ/3780f377f8.png) , there are thousands of options contracts between 115 and 150. \n\nIf we hit $145 EOW, 9930 contracts equaling 993,000 must be bought. If we hit $150, an additional 567,000 shares must be bought. If we hit 200, 681,000 more shares must be bought.\n\nFor this stock to \"Level Up\", GME needs to hit at least $145 EOW. If it hits 150 or 200, it will only accelerate the process.\n\nEvery week, the hedge funds will do whatever they can to stop the stock from hitting these thresholds. If Gamestop misses a threshold, the squeeze will be delayed. If it misses enough thresholds, the squeeze is done.\n\nPlease dissect and tell me what's wrong with my logic.",

For example, if they sell a contract with a delta of 0.5, they will buy 50 shares. That way, if the share price goes up a dollar, they will break even (-$50 on the call and +$50 on the shares). And vice versa if the price drops a dollar.\n\nHowever, you also have to take gamma into affect. Delta does not remain constant as the price fluctuates. Take the same example and assume gamma is 0.1. Let's say the price raises a dollar. The MM comes out even as explained. But because of the gamma, delta is now 0.6 and the MM is no longer delta neutral. They must buy another 10 shares. OK, fine, so they do that and they are neutral again. HOWEVER, if they have to do so in such a large volume that it actually raises the share price, it can have a compounding effect: buying shares to delta hedge raises the price, which raises the number of shares they need to hedge. This is a gamma squeeze.",
