Unlike most commodities, an increased price does not lead to increased supply, so your Econ 101 supply curve is flat.\n\nThe recent bull run has instead been driven by increased demand, with four primary factors:\n\n* Institutional demand is the biggest story. When 150+ year old insurance company MassMutual buys in with a cool $250m, you know institutional acceptance is finally happening. Institutions hold just 15% of all Bitcoin and we should expect to see that increase dramatically this year.\n* New retail exposure. New demographics of retail buyers now have crypto exposure through easy, established channels like PayPal and Cashapp.\n* Payments use case. PornHub going crypto-only is a big deal IMO. Many people globally don\u2019t have credit cards and cryptocurrency holds the promise of actually increasing the reach of ecommerce. The internet revolutionized content delivery but has always been missing the same level of revolution in payments to complete the cycle. Porn has always been an innovation leader on the Internet, and if the PornHub experiment is successful, it could open the door for others.\n* Gold replacement. Investment banks have issued statements saying their clients are shifting their gold allocation to Bitcoin. Also, a survey of Millenials found that they prefer Bitcoin to gold. As fiat currencies devalue globally, Bitcoin gains.\n\nWe are just getting started and this bull run has a long way to go. I\u2019ve been in crypto professionally since 2013 and IMO we are nowhere close to the next top.",

I am looking into buying some ICLN as I believe it has potential to do well under the upcoming Biden administration. \n\nSo I guess my portfolio isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call diverse, but I\u2019m gonna start buying into some other sectors than tech, although I guess I have fairly high risk tolerance anyways.",

Such a quality company though, and still feel kinda bummed going there knowing I don't have a piece of it anymore, IMO it's the highest quality traditional retail name there is.
