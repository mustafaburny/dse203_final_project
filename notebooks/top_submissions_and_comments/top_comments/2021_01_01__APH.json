The Canadian business model is not doing great in that, the majority of recreational and medical users up there prefer street weed (flower) or to just grow their own.  There is no reason to pay the high prices for store bought weed and no enforced penalties when they roll their own.  For edibles and oils, concentrates, et al, they still go to the stores, but those trips are few and far between.  Many US states that decriminalized cannabis seem to have recriminalized it in a different fashion, to direct people to the licensed distributors.  It is my personal belief, not supported by any evidence that I\u2019ve seen, that at some point, States or the Feds are going to start slapping Tax Evasion charges on the unlicensed growers and sellers to bring them into compliance.  For those reasons, GTBIF, CRLBF, CURLF, TCNNF, and similar are the best long term holds.  I am also long on a lot of the penny stocks that crashed last year and have stayed below a dollar.",
