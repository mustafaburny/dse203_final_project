If you are willing to look past American names, LVMH, BABA are exposed to some pretty good (very) long term tailwinds. \n\nI have personally owned FISV and BRK.B for years. Both don't pay a dividend, but both compound capital internally so well I actually want them to not pay me a dividend. You will have to sell shares to generate your own dividends for them.\n\nMy worry with AT&amp;T is they are dipping their fingers into too many pies, I'm not sure if they want to be a telco, a streaming company, or a movie studio in 10 years. I find it hard to invest long term in a business that I can't figure out what their long term vision is.",

I worked for a community bank up until recently that used Fiserv as it's core system provider and it was apparent that a lot of it's products were just stiched on. Not the greatest from a user's perspective, but great for them from the perspective of being able to offer a wide range of ancillary products. That makes their customer base really sticky because it's very costly to switch providers. They are a leading provider for small to midsized banks. \n\nI didn't really look into them from an investing perspective until after I left the bank, but it's had a steady increase over the last several years. I have a small position in Fiserv now and I plan to hold them along with Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square, and Fidelity to round up my fintech investments.",

One key thing I learnt is the amount of time and effort you put into research is not positively correlated with your returns. It comes down to patience, and temperament. In fact when I realized that I would not have the time to look at companies all day, I asked myself a simple question, who are the absolute best CEOs and which are the absolutely most fantastic businesses there is out there, and the idea is to buy a couple of these and (fingers crossed) never look back. Most of the time I feel like I have to pay a fair, or even slightly expensive price for some of these businesses, but I've accepted that. You know sometimes $100 pair of shoes is really that much better than a $50 pair that is discounted to $30.\n\nOn a week to week basis, the volatility of something like this is substantial, and I won't recommend it to those who don't want to be exposed this way.\n\nSome names I identified in each camp (this is my opinion, many of you will probably disagree):\n\nMy logic is pretty straightforward, I'm not that smart, so if I give my capital to some of the wisest and smartest people out there, who run some amazing business, its a far better move than doing it myself (Great CEOs). So instead of trying to be super cheap which is very time consuming, I convince myself to buy quality and be patient.\n\nGreat CEOs: Berkshire, Daily Journal (technically not CEO but it's Munger) Constellation Software, Mastercard, Disney, LVMH, Amazon, Apple, Fiserv\n\nGreat Businesses: Google, Visa, Microsoft",
