However, with the world's available 8-inch fab capacity already falling short of demand, fabless firms are striving for support from foundries, the sources said.\n\nNevertheless, TSMC in its annual report for 2019 already disclosed that several customers have early IP verification in 28HV technology. In 2020, TSMC continued, the foundry plans to enhance the performance for OLED TDDI applications on 28HV and 8V transistors on WoW stacking.\n\nTSMC's 28nm process manufacturing has also attracted orders for Sony's CMOS image sensors, according to industry sources. The foundry has also assigned production lines at Fab 14B dedicated to fulfilling the orders for Sony's high-end CIS, the sources said.\n\nBesides, TSMC is contracted by NXP to fabricate automotive MCUs using 28nm eFlash process, the sources noted.\n\nTSMC with its mature 90nm, 180nm, 150nm and 130nm BCD process technologies has also grabbed significant orders for power management ICs from Qualcomm, the sources said.",

        "body": "I started down this road a week or two ago.  There are several issues between very long lead times, capacity constraints, varying wafer formats/sizes, limited equipment, and one limited commodity (that I couldn't find a way to play).  After this I moved my portfolio to be about 30% semi mfg equipment (LRCX, TER, AMAT, KLA) and 15% in some of the bigger chip players like AMD &amp; NVDA.  I couldn't go into INTC because after my DD, I think it will take several years to turn the INTC boat - it takes years to design chips and tooling before even trying to get them fabricated which has a 26 week lead time.  There was one automotive chip supplier (NXPI) that appeared to be ahead of the demand curve so I bought a little of that too.  I still need to do more DD but would strongly recommend doing the DD yourself as every corner I turned made me believe there will be great growth here for the next several years.",

        "body": "&gt;Is there much room to grow for TSM\n\nI think it's a good time to be selling shovels (chip fabrication) instead of mining for gold (chip designers).\n\nThe problem with TSMC right now is that they're supply-constrained because of a lack of certain materials (mainly Ajinomoto build-up film, or \"ABF\"). At the same time there's intense demand from traditional high-performance compute and mobile chipmakers (AMD, Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, anyone-that-isn't-Intel). TSMC is literally operating at 100% capacity at all of their fabs: 5nm for Apple and Qualcomm (who missed hard on earnings due to lack of supply), 7nm for AMD's CPUs/GPUs/console APUs and Nvidia's datacenter GPUs, with 3nm coming online for Apple in 2022, and a shiny new 5nm fab scheduled to open in 2024 in Arizona.\n\nThe demand is so intense that even Nvidia with their unlimited amount of money can't get their 30-series GPUs manufactured at TSMC because there's simply no more capacity. The rumor that was floating around a while ago was that Leather Jacket Man supposedly wanted a discount for all Ampere products and TSMC said no, hence consumer GPUs having to being made on Samsung's 8nm node (where yields are very low, one of the reasons for the Great GPU Shortage of 2020-21). Nvidia recently doubled down by signing a new agreement with Samsung to increase production of dies for 30-series cards, but who knows when that'll resolve itself. It also doesn't help that AMD is allocating 80% of their capacity for consoles and 20% for their own products at TSMC on 7nm.\n\nI dont know why governments around the world are blaming* TSMC for the automotive semiconductor shortages, when less advanced semiconductor companies (like NXPI, IFFNY, STM, etc.) are the ones to blame, along with the automakers themselves. When COVID-19 hit, automakers decided to scale back on purchasing less advanced semiconductors (we're talking larger chips for stuff like power steering, not infotainment systems) from these smaller companies because they thought they wouldn't sell any cars last year. Instead they saw increased demand to the point where even Ford shut down the plant where they build F-150s, their most profitable vehicle. Automotive semiconductors literally make up only ~3% of TSMC's sales - compare that to 48% for mobile and 33% for HPC.\n\nPositions: heavily long on TSM, AMD, NVDA, MU, AVGO, might pick up some more QCOM if they dip further. If I could somehow invest in Samsung's fab business or just the chipmaking side of Apple instead of the entire companies, I would.\n\n**tl;dr**: I like the stock.\n\n\\* \"help us by making products you don't usually make or else we won't sell you weapons or help you defend yourselves if the mainland decides to invade\"",

        "body": "IMO AMD is a great long term buy and hold stock. I say this as a techie that works in the tech industry. When building a PC about twenty years ago I had the choice of a more affordable AMD processor or an Intel processor that would do the same thing for more money. Back then I chose AMD to make my very first gaming rig. Fast forward twenty years and now Intel is no longer competing with AMD in the personal PC space. Intel is switching it's focus to making chips for servers not personal PC's. \n\nIntel was the big competition for AMD but now they have engineering challenges in manufacturing that they are having a hard time fixing. \n\nIf you forget all the numbers and look at this basic info I say that AMD is an excellent long term hold. Here are the industry basics on the competition:\n\nFor competition in the chip manufacturing industry this is what we're looking at... From the list on [Owler.com](https://Owler.com) \n\nAMD- Currently in the top spot in the market\n\nIntel- a non-competitor any longer due to its focus switch to servers\n\nNvidia- doesn't make CPU's. They make GPU's. This is not a direct competitor due to that yet\n\nQualcomm- They also don't make CPU's for personal pc's. \n\nARM- Are about to be bought out by Nvidia in 2021 or 2022 according to CNet. They design system on a chip, but they didn't design Apple's new M1 chip\n\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/introducing-the-arm-processor-again-what-you-should-know-about-it-now/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/introducing-the-arm-processor-again-what-you-should-know-about-it-now/)\n\nNXP- Is busy making processors for autos not PC's\n\nAnalogue Devices- Makes processors for general purpose for people to program their own CPU or very specific purposes. \n\nTLDL: AMD has no direct competition for personal PC's that use Windows. This leaves a huge market for these processors to find new homes every year. With no competition and a few billion in funding I see this stock as a great long term buy and hold. Windows has 76.4% of market share for all personal PC's [(source)](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide). Now imagine how many systems will be built with AMD processors in them now that they are better than Intel's?",

        "body": "I actually disagree with most of your points I have been hardware designer for the past 10 years and I see a very strong demand for general board hence why the shortages happen. The  significant increase production only started in mid November to late December. Suppliers don't hold a lot of spare stock and there was a slowdown in the early stages of the pandemic. I have just tried ordering a couple of prototypes which now will take 1 month instead of 2 weeks.\n\nThe way a company will lock you in is simply by making you use their product. It's not easy finding like for like replacements and if you look historically very few semiconductor companies offered paid for tool-chains and most of them have been free for the past 10 years (Freescale, NXP, ST, TI just to name a few). Also once you use one of their part they offer you other components you might use on the board hence why there has been a significant M&amp;A in this space (ADI, Microchip for example)\n\nI do think that these shortages are going to affect sales as ideally they would like to deliver as much as it's needed and on time but will just move profits by a quarter or two.\n\nOn the fab-less side there is actually a shift to companies like TSM. For example TI by having their guarantee that as long as you need the part they will produce it they have very old technology manufacturing lines where they are actually loosing money. ( namely most of the old audio Burr-Brown parts which have a cult like following)\n\nCorsair  is a very small player in the DRAM market and they don't to the chips themselves and I doubt PC gaming requirements are going to go down significantly as gamers will still upgrade their PC's whether there is a pandemic going on.\n\n( I am long CRSR and ADI)",

They also supply chips for 5G base stations. \n\nSo, EVs, PVs, and 5G... what\u2019s not to love???

It will be used for many countries that can't get the vaccine or if the vaccine is not 100% effective so expect a long runway.  But also the point with this company is that their patented technology is not just a covid play - they help the body absorb drugs intraveneous or oral.  And they have emerging platforms to help companies develop drugs as well with their other acquired products.  There's upside to their results tomorrow but definitely in 2021 since the presentation is from Oct 31 and there have been some developments since then that would lead to higher revenues.  You can see they are working with every major drug company in the world - Merck, Novartis, new GSX partnership, Pfizer, etc. etc.  I don't like pharma plays typically but this is a picks and shovels type of idea with predictable recurring revenue, low risk investments, patented technology and a diversified business.  Its basically the Qualcomm of pharma.",
