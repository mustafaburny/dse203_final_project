The rest, I would spread over the safest, most fucking boring ass ETFs I could, some well-established stocks, a few index funds, and me? I\u2019d \u201cgamble\u201d with maybe 5% on good potential up-and-coming companies in industries that show a strong promise of growth and expansion.\n\nYou have to have an emergency fund. There\u2019s simply no telling what can happen day to day, and risking your livelihood just isn\u2019t an option nowadays. I just got hit by a car 6 weeks ago and am unable to work. Luckily, I had an emergency fund to cover my bills or I would be colossally FUCKED.  $15-20k in cash is not going to make you rich invested over decades. Why risk it? It\u2019s worth more if it\u2019s kept close to insulate you in case of unforeseen circumstances. It simply doesn\u2019t make sense not to. \n\nFidelity, Vanguard, &amp; TD all offer their own (as well as assess to) any and all small return/low risk ishares type shit to park good money in. They\u2019re a great option to have as far as \u201csafe\u201d plays that will mostly keep pace with the markets and still not over leverage you as far as risk. \n\nThe well-established individual stocks will always be a good play so long as you don\u2019t get caught up in every little detail of day-to-day pricing. Anything in the top 20 of the S&amp;P will keep you right on pace with the greater economy, and give you some security and reassurance that you\u2019re getting the most out of your money. \n\nThe \u201cgambling\u201d is what will keep you interested, educated, and give you potentially the most bang for your buck. I\u2019m not talking about YOLO\u2019s into some Foreign penny stock. I\u2019m talking about common-sense plays that\u2019s anyone who doesn\u2019t have their head in the sand. Electric cars. 3D printing. Green Energy. Shit like that. These are budding industries that are obviously going to grow and expand over the next decade. Which companies will rise to the top? Who the fuck knows, but it\u2019s sure as the weather that there\u2019s a garage out there with the next Jobs, Bezos, or Musk out there right now. Why not try to catch it, and learn a little in the process?",

Within a few years, this patent will expire and other companies' mutual funds may elect to use the same technique. Vanguard charges a $20 annual fee if the account balance is below $10k.\n\nFidelity, on the other hand, has no annual account fees, no matter the balance, and charges no fees to purchase stocks, ETF, or mutual funds. However, their mutual funds *will* distribute *some* taxable income once a year, due to dividends and realized capital trading gains. Because index funds do very little buying and selling of underlying stocks, though, this taxable income is usually a small amount.\n\nIf you invest your money into a conventional or Roth IRA, however, you need not concern yourself with the taxable income that may result from any investment, as dividends and capital gains are not taxed within these account types. You can contribute $6k per year ($7k/year for those over 50 years old) into either type of IRA per year, so you should be able to place about 2/3 of the amount you say you want to invest into an IRA account within three months.",

Damn there\u2019s a line wrapping around that MCD and SBUX drive thru, the food is unhealthy but well business is still booming I guess. \nGetting back into my home, I suddenly remember tomorrow is Oct 1st. I have T, VZ, NFLX bills to pay. \nDamn, I observed a lot from my lazy day today. I wonder what my life would be without all of the conveniences I saw today. \nI log into my Fidelity account and buy 4 more VOO shares. \nFeeling good.",

Where I sell a contract for 0.07 it says I got a 0.09 premium but when it expires it reverts back to 0.07 which leads me to believe they really sold the 9 but told me it was 7 and kept 2 for themself. Weird math sometimes).\n\nAnd then there is Fidelity (aka Fido, aka the dog) who locks your account when you buy 4.5 million shares of a 0.0001 pink to \u201cprotect you\u201d from yourself and tell you that you can only sell from now on, not buy.  Then when you sell that $450 worth of stock for $15,000 they get mad and refuse to let you take out your money for a year.  Next February I should be able to make a withdrawal.  They call it \u201cclearing\u201d but I call it \u201csuckling my teet for interest on 15k for a full year\u201d.  They still won\u2019t let me buy stocks.  Dicks.\n\nRH followed Fido\u2019s example with the GME stupidity.  They didn\u2019t invent that tactic.  They were just too small to get away with it.",

The premise for this is predicated by capitalism, of course. The ordinary folk are expected to spend every penny they earn or can borrow so that the companies the wealthy are invested in can rake in massive profits. \n\nThe tide is slowly turning, and more and more people, particularly the younger folk, have begun to learn the ropes of investing. And are happy to do it by themselves using low cost funds rather than through an intermediary (aka financial advisor) and high cost mutual funds. If you visited Fidelity Canada's website just 10 years ago you would have noticed that it was pitched toward investment advisors - and how they can help their clients. Not so any more - and it's the same with other companies like Vanguard as well. \n\nThe new investors stepped into the market in March last year because they had learned to recognize value. Stocks, in spite of the risks of Covid, were ridiculously cheap. They stepped in and set the floor on a market that traders would have happily shorted until it went even lower. \n\nSo yes, the shoe shine boys are now becoming savvy investors. What would be interesting to see is how such a democratization of investing would impact corporate bottom lines in 15 - 20 years. After all, Zeus help us all if the people who are supposed to borrow and spend suddenly start saving and investing.",

        "body": "\"people that really have no business speculating on stocks\"\n\nFor far too long investing in the stock market has been the domain of the wealthy elite. The premise for this is predicated by capitalism, of course. The ordinary folk are expected to spend every penny they earn or can borrow so that the companies the wealthy are invested in can rake in massive profits. \n\nThe tide is slowly turning, and more and more people, particularly the younger folk, have begun to learn the ropes of investing. And are happy to do it by themselves using low cost funds rather than through an intermediary (aka financial advisor) and high cost mutual funds. If you visited Fidelity Canada's website just 10 years ago you would have noticed that it was pitched toward investment advisors - and how they can help their clients. Not so any more - and it's the same with other companies like Vanguard as well. \n\nThe new investors stepped into the market in March last year because they had learned to recognize value. Stocks, in spite of the risks of Covid, were ridiculously cheap. They stepped in and set the floor on a market that traders would have happily shorted until it went even lower. \n\nSo yes, the shoe shine boys are now becoming savvy investors. What would be interesting to see is how such a democratization of investing would impact corporate bottom lines in 15 - 20 years. After all, Zeus help us all if the people who are supposed to borrow and spend suddenly start saving and investing.",

Fidelity has a introductory article on the subject which is helpful as well. *: A keyword you might want to look up is \"holding period\". Selling contracts on stock affects the holding periods.    \n  \nThe two big things I'd note is that:   \n1. Collecting premium is a taxable event.   \n2. Selling \"unqualified\" options contracts can create taxable events as well. Generally, selling in the money covered calls is effectively selling the stock (since it's likely to be executed) so the IRS treats it as selling the stock. This means that the capital gains rate is whatever it would be for the stock the day you open the contract. \n  \nThe devil is in the details of course, but essentially, be aware that selling in the money calls on stock you've owned less than a year is likely to be taxed as short term capital gains. \n  \nOut of the money contracts and stock you've held longer than a year pretty much avoids these issues though.",

This is good!  give yourself a pat on the back.\n\nI didn't note any mention of an emergency fund.  This should be cash that can be used to cover your living expenses fully for 3-6 months if something really goes wrong.  if you don't have that, start prioritizing cash flow to build that up.\n\nAnd yes, maximize your retirement benefit plans.  On the 403b, make sure you are getting the maximum match.  I can't tell for sure from the way you have described it, but if you are missing any % on the match, that is free money that you should prioritize getting (some employers match the first x% of your salary... if that is 10% in this case you should increase your contribution to 10%).  On a cash flow basis if you have to pick between getting the maximum match in 403b over maxing out Roth IRA, get the 403b match first, then try to max the Roth.  Prioritize those two goals above money you put into taxable investing.\n\nIMO, Fidelity was the right choice of the two providers you mentioned, as you can build a wider relationship with them over time and they have a lot of other financial options.  Set up your brokerage account with them if you haven't already.  You did mention VTSAX so maybe you already have a set up with Vanguard.\n\nregarding funds: at your age capital appreciation is the best goal.  keep it simple and manageable.  I would pick the Fid 500 as large cap is the right strategy at this stage of the bull market and at your age and investment horizon.  The other fund is target age fund (typically a fund that holds other Fidelity funds and changes allocation over time along with your expected retirement age).  This will be better during a down market for sure than the other, but I don't see one of those for a while.  So pay attention and plan to change allocation when a bear market comes along.\n\nKeeping it simple makes things easier to manage, while you grow your understanding of investing.  Best wishes!",

This means you are short this call your counterparty can exercise the call which forces you to sell this counterparty 100 shares (per call) at the designated strike price.\n\nWhat it sounds like you are describing is Covered Calls and Naked Calls. Covered simply means you already own 100 shares, so you sell what you already own. Naked means when assigned you have to go onto the open market, buy 100 shares at the current price, and sell them to your counterparty at the strike price.\n\nWhat this means functionally is if you are not covered you are subject to theoretically infinite loss because there is no ceiling to what price a stock could get to.\n\nA basic example: You sell a call at a strike of 10 but do not own the stock. If the option is exercised and the stock price is 100? You must go out and buy 100 shares at 100/sh and sell them at 10/sh, incurring a loss of 90/sh.\n\nBeing \"Covered\" is represented differently on different brokers. I use Fidelity and they also do not explicitly say whether my covered calls are covered or not.\n\nAnother notable difference is you should not be able to open naked calls if you are not approved for the proper level of options (level 4). Same with covered calls but they require a looser level (level 1).\n\nedit: [Here's](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-difference-between-covered-call-and-regular-call.asp#:~:text=An%20investor%20in%20a%20naked,generates%20income%20for%20the%20investor) a good source that probably describes this better :)",

        "body": "&gt; Would it be a correct statement that if my overall portfolio consistently shows higher gains than the S&amp;P and/or VTI, then I\u2019m \u201cbeating the market\u201d? . . . And, conversely, if my portfolio consistently has lower gains than those indexes, I\u2019m better off just putting everything into the index instead?\n\nNo, because of the point you recognized with your next example:\n\n&gt;A more specific example: let\u2019s say (hypothetically) my portfolio is like 70% tech stocks, should I be comparing my performance to QQQ? It makes sense in my mind, just want to make sure my logic is correct.\n\nThat is probably a closer analogue, yes. \n\nThe reason QQQ is the better benchmark (and why beating the S&amp;P with such a profile wouldn't necessarily be \"beating the market\") is you've bought a riskier portfolio, so *should* see greater returns as a result. \"Beating the market\" tends to be discussed in terms of *risk-adjusted* returns. \n\nIf you have a portfolio that is much riskier than the S&amp;P and outperform it by 1%, you haven't \"beaten\" the S&amp;P, you haven't generated any [alpha](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp) as an investor, you've just added risk. As with your QQQ example, if you just want that added risk, you could just buy QQQ instead of S&amp;P to get that added risk without your stockpicking.\n\n&gt;I use Fidelity, and the performance page says (I think) that my personal return over the last 3 months is 36% higher than the return of S&amp;P, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m reading it right or if that metric is useful at all.\n\nThe other thing to remember is that short-term overperformance is no guarantee of *long-term* overperformance. Looking to the 2017 year-end SPIVA \"scorecard\", roughly 40% of US fund managers [managed to beat their benchmark index over one year](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-very-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-financial-professionals-cant-do-it/) (after fees). Heck, a *majority* of mid- and small-cap fund managers did. But, over the *long* haul (3, 5, 10, 15 years) that edge quickly vanished, and the vast majority underperformed their benchmark index.",

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

Most of these companies will start using third party companies, akin to how PC manufacturers used Windows from Microsoft instead of creating their own OS. Initially some will try their hand at the market with their own bespoke solution(like the wild west days of 80's when we had commodores and sinclair spectrums).

They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.  \nTesla is boasting about FSD(which is between a very good cruise and a poor self driver).

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

Most of these companies will start using third party companies, akin to how PC manufacturers used Windows from Microsoft instead of creating their own OS. Initially some will try their hand at the market with their own bespoke solution(like the wild west days of 80's when we had commodores and sinclair spectrums). However after some time their will be a standardization(IBM PC). \n\nAt best I can see Tesla becoming like the Macintoshes:  \nTesla: Proprietary full self driving system:: Macintoshes : Proprietary OSes\n\n\\&gt;If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.  \nTesla is boasting about FSD(which is between a very good cruise and a poor self driver). The key difference between waymo and tesla is that tesla is heavily reliant on an AI based system, whereas waymo(which does use AI) is heavily dependent on Geolocation and real time data.\n\n\\]&gt;The thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up.

Only tech I hold now is Nvidia. \n\nBut you can do very well with 2 stocks, but if you just want 2 stocks to own and not watch, I'd go spy and then something else very safe, like alphabet.",

Someone wanted to invest in Intel last week and I spelled out why not.  Originally my thesis was around 2016 when I bought AMD and Intel had Brian K was head of Intel.  This is no go and it may turn around a bit on buybacks, financial engineering they have a ton of money but it's not on the back of technology.  \n\nAny non boomer working in cloud computing/semi field can tell you INTC is not where you want to put your money.  I believe Pat is more tech inclined but it's a long road and in the mean time you can invest in AMD, TSM, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, APPL etc if you want exposure to semi or cloud computing.  \n\n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/panf65/intel_is_50_bucks_just_saying/ha79m4v/",

        "body": "So I'm actually going to do some market analysis on the direction of the market, and I'd like thoughts and a discussion if possible. Think Socratic discussion. \n\nIn the U.S. I think that the markets are going to soon start a rotation to value, and you can sort of see it starting to occur as bond yields have started to rise, meaning that growth stocks will start to become less attractive relative to value stocks. You've been seeing supply chain and logistics companies like Matson, Maersk, Zim, and other assorted shipping stocks boom during this time period. Commodities stocks in the aluminum sector are poised to outperform, because Guyana just had a coup, and it's a huge exporter of aluminum... Especially to China. With that said, steel and iron ore are the same with exports to China from Australia of iron ore outperforming despite negative relations between these two nations. Both of these types of stocks have outperformed year-to-date, and will continue to do so for the next month or two as forward looking investors look at commentary stating that supply chain, and commodity prices will be elevated well into next week. Finally, home builders have outperformed, and are poised to continue their outperformance due to a massive shortage of homes that will take years to a decade to fix.\n\nI believe in the latter months, in 2022, and heading into 2023 financials will outperform as yields for the 10 year T note rise. First, domestic debit and credit card transaction volume will rise (which bank CEO's , and Visa's CEO, have noted has already started to happen), and this will be followed by international travel spend (Which is very lucrative). This will primarily help Visa, and Mastercard as they have been essentially flat year to date and on a yearly basis. It will also help American Express, and Discover Financial to a lesser extent. Then, credit card balances will grow and forward looking investors will start looking at interest rate hikes by the FED in late 2022-2023, which is the one-two punch that bank stocks will need to see outsize profitability. The strong M&amp;A activity, even in the face of anti-trust scrutiny, is also helping banks. Third, ADP and other benefit provider/payroll companies will do well as payrolls continue to increase, and unemployment continues to go down. The runway is still clear there. Then, there are the mortgage companies where there currently has been a pricing war which should cool sometime in early 2022, allowing for Gain on Sale margins to normalize to roughly 115-185BPS, while the value of their Mortgage servicing rights should increase alongside the yield for the 10YR T notes. Open banking should continue its outperformance, with strong markets in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin and South America, and growing adoption in North America. Companies like Paysafe, PAG, Razer, etcetera should do well in this environment. Finally, the moratorium on school loan payments should cease very soon allowing companies like Navient and Sofi to regain momentum.\n\nI also believe that airlines will start to outperform starting in Q1-Q2 2022, as flight restrictions start falling away, and business travel starts to resume at a more normal tempo. Personally, Delta Airlines and the budget airlines are my preferred ones. Then, there are homebuilders who will continue their outperformance as they have significantly deleveraged and still have long runways for price to earnings growth. I'd expect dividend increases in the latter half of 2022 to reflect this. Third is General Electric under Larry Culp, who's turnaround efforts haven't recently been noticed, but who's conducted strong execution. From their wind turbines, to their jet engines, to their medical division, there is strong growth to be had and I believe we'll see a spurt in the share price to reflect the reality of 2022 and Culp's momentous turn around. I also believe chip fabricators (and chip designers) will outperform. TSM has been relatively flat in the last 3 months, save for a one week burst of over 5% to reflect the fact that they're increasing prices across the board from 10 to 20%. Intel, meanwhile, is building a chip fabrication plant in Ireland which will be entirely dedicated to vehicle chip manufacturing, which I think will be a success. Finally, I believe the used car (autonation), and new car companies such as Ford and GM as well as Volkswagen will outperform in 2022 due to the scarcity of vehicles, compounded by Hurricane Ida's destruction of numerous vehicles (And the risk that other natural disasters destroy even more vehicles).\n\nThe China rally, meanwhile, is unsustainable in the light of the regulatory tempo on the free market principle that China ever so briefly embraced. In light of all these actions, it is my firm belief that  China is, or will, embrace capitalism \"with chinese characteristics.\" The crackdowns are far from over, and I believe the state will go further in the realm of entertainment and video streaming, such as suspending screen time for minors on video streaming platforms (something they already do) to a level consistent to where they've placed video gaming limits to combat the myopia epidemic as well as fan culture. They are also likely to crackdown on drinking establishments, and liquor companies to crack down on the excessive drinking in China, in an attempt to stave off chronic health conditions that could accrue, as well as crack down on companies trying to profiteer off a rapidly aging China. These are just a few sectors where I see potential intervention, but there are likely others. The fact that systematic debt has reached such dizzying levels in China is also worrying, and presents a structural issue. A house of cards, if you will. The fact that JD bought an insignificant sum of shares, means that there is a rally in tech stock shares today is foolish, especially since it's broad based and not tailored means there's no solid shoring. Furthermore, the debt to equity levels for some companies, such as Iqiyi, Evergrande, and other stocks is extremely worrying.\n\nI believe emerging market stocks in Brazil, Mexico, India, the Middle East, and Turkey present better opportunities.",
