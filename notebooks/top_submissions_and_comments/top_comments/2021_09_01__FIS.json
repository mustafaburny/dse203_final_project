The rest, I would spread over the safest, most fucking boring ass ETFs I could, some well-established stocks, a few index funds, and me? I\u2019d \u201cgamble\u201d with maybe 5% on good potential up-and-coming companies in industries that show a strong promise of growth and expansion.\n\nYou have to have an emergency fund. There\u2019s simply no telling what can happen day to day, and risking your livelihood just isn\u2019t an option nowadays. I just got hit by a car 6 weeks ago and am unable to work. Luckily, I had an emergency fund to cover my bills or I would be colossally FUCKED.  $15-20k in cash is not going to make you rich invested over decades. Why risk it? It\u2019s worth more if it\u2019s kept close to insulate you in case of unforeseen circumstances. It simply doesn\u2019t make sense not to. \n\nFidelity, Vanguard, &amp; TD all offer their own (as well as assess to) any and all small return/low risk ishares type shit to park good money in. They\u2019re a great option to have as far as \u201csafe\u201d plays that will mostly keep pace with the markets and still not over leverage you as far as risk. \n\nThe well-established individual stocks will always be a good play so long as you don\u2019t get caught up in every little detail of day-to-day pricing. Anything in the top 20 of the S&amp;P will keep you right on pace with the greater economy, and give you some security and reassurance that you\u2019re getting the most out of your money. \n\nThe \u201cgambling\u201d is what will keep you interested, educated, and give you potentially the most bang for your buck. I\u2019m not talking about YOLO\u2019s into some Foreign penny stock. I\u2019m talking about common-sense plays that\u2019s anyone who doesn\u2019t have their head in the sand. Electric cars. 3D printing. Green Energy. Shit like that. These are budding industries that are obviously going to grow and expand over the next decade. Which companies will rise to the top? Who the fuck knows, but it\u2019s sure as the weather that there\u2019s a garage out there with the next Jobs, Bezos, or Musk out there right now. Why not try to catch it, and learn a little in the process?",

Because I only have options level 3, meaning I can't sell naked options, I assumed fidelity would exercise my otm call to make sure I had collateral for my itm call.\n\nI was dead wrong. Instead, fidelity gave me a massive 5,700 BB short position which completely dwarfs my account, giving me $0 buying power. Thankfully I was able to close the short this morning during premarket for a super tiny gain. Honestly it may be a loss due to fees. Any amount of gain wasn't worth the loss of sleep of being completely wiped out of my entire life savings come Monday. \n\nLearn from me lads, never assume. Close your spreads early.",

If you hold them in a taxable account you'll pay slightly more tax.\n\nPutting aside all the mechanical details of how it actually works, ETFs are considered tax efficient because they have fewer capital gains distributions than (non-Vanguard) mutual funds. So for a rough idea of how much more tax you'll have to pay, I think we can just look at a (non-Vanguard) mutual fund and see what their capital gains distributions look like:\n\nI arbitrarily picked the Fidelity 500 index fund. In the past year its total capital gains distributions were $0, so I guess an analogous ETF would have had zero increased tax liability if this newly proposed legislation had been in effect. On the other hand in 2019 it distributed about $0.12 per $100 invested, so if you had $1 million invested and were in the 37% percent tax bracket then for an analogous ETF in 2019 I believe this legislation would have resulted in paying an extra $450 or so of taxes on your $1,000,000 investment.",

Within a few years, this patent will expire and other companies' mutual funds may elect to use the same technique. Vanguard charges a $20 annual fee if the account balance is below $10k.\n\nFidelity, on the other hand, has no annual account fees, no matter the balance, and charges no fees to purchase stocks, ETF, or mutual funds. However, their mutual funds *will* distribute *some* taxable income once a year, due to dividends and realized capital trading gains. Because index funds do very little buying and selling of underlying stocks, though, this taxable income is usually a small amount.\n\nIf you invest your money into a conventional or Roth IRA, however, you need not concern yourself with the taxable income that may result from any investment, as dividends and capital gains are not taxed within these account types. You can contribute $6k per year ($7k/year for those over 50 years old) into either type of IRA per year, so you should be able to place about 2/3 of the amount you say you want to invest into an IRA account within three months.",

        "body": "1) Fidelity gives a high level overview of buy versus sell orders that were executed each day. How these orders were routed is not shown so it's possible some or all went through dark pools. But more importantly if retail investors were sending 80% buy orders on fidelity then its reasonable to assume other Brokers like Robinhood had a lot of buy orders who we know route orders via dark pool.\n\n2) Volume means that trades were actually executed. Given that retail had 80% buy orders the selling side would have to be either institutions or most likely market makers like Citadel. Based on Citadel's track record for mismarking short sales as long, being kicked out of China for 'manipulative short selling practices', and the recent Robinhood communication leaks about collusion in January to defend their short positions, it would appear that Citadel has been 'providing liquidity' by short selling millions of shares they don't own and have little chance of being able to borrow.\n\nBut Dark Pools don't just need to be used to route buy orders. Institutions can generate synthetic shares between counterparties using options tricks and even side step the SECs Reg SHO rules by shifting dodgy trades and their inevitable failures to deliver ex-clearing. \n\nSettling trades between broker dealers outside of the DTCC is a well known problem and is exacerbated as more and more trades are made through dark pools. In the early 2000s these funds argued that Reg SHO need not apply to ex-clearing settlements as only a small percentage of trades happened off of the lit exchanges. Now we are seeing 70% of volume bubbling in these dark pools.",

I have opened level 2 quotes and if I try to bid on something using Fidelity I can see my bid go into the market. If I place a limit on robinhood it doesn't show up in level 2 quotes, because Robinhood is actually bidding less and if that fills they turn around and give it to me for the higher price that I set my limit to.

Sitting at the restaurant\u2019s outdoor patio, I enjoy my brunch with a glass of wine, my eyes start wandering around. What a beautiful day, the birds, the air, the people. Maybe it\u2019s enough wine for the day, I go in to grab a soft drink. 8 out of 10 drinks on the fountain machine are KO products. Lots people around me are working on their AAPL and MSFT laptops. They are so thin yet very powerful. As a tech geek I know they are powered by INTC and AMD CPUs, and the heavy stuffs are done with NVIDIA GPUs. Gosh people are so productive nowadays!

Shit, I\u2019m almost out of gas, pulling into a CVX gas station, tap my BAC MA card because I\u2019ll get 3% cash back on Gas. Damn there\u2019s a line wrapping around that MCD and SBUX drive thru, the food is unhealthy but well business is still booming I guess. \nGetting back into my home, I suddenly remember tomorrow is Oct 1st. I have T, VZ, NFLX bills to pay. \nDamn, I observed a lot from my lazy day today. I wonder what my life would be without all of the conveniences I saw today. \nI log into my Fidelity account and buy 4 more VOO shares. \nFeeling good.",

Prolly the best year of my life to get to the next level and not be paycheck to paycheck anymore. You guys rock. Couldn't have done it without you! I'm out gotta go grade all those exams.  Also, insuring the new home with KIN. ;D",

Perhaps they forgot their passwords, and got locked out of their accounts, but didn\u2019t bother resetting them.\n\nIt makes intuitive sense that accounts where investors do little trading would do better than accounts that are more active.\n\nConclusion - buy and forget about this for several years.

To date, I've been completely pleased with their service.\n\nI don't have any difficulty with E\\*Trade's web site, though I admit I've never used S/F/V so I cannot compare.  The most common criticism I see here against E\\*Trade is that you cannot purchase fractional shares... but I've never wanted or needed to do that, so it's a moot point to me.  So unless you think you absolutely *must* purchase fractional shares, I'd say E\\*Trade is just as good as the big three.\n\n$.02",

Everyone\u2019s a genius in a bull market anyway so I\u2019m sure a monkey could\u2019ve performed similarly anyway - but you asked so I\u2019ll share. \n\n1) only invest in companies you use and enjoy\n2) only invest in companies who have forward thinking leaders with proven track records\n3) only invest in companies who are building products/services for the future and don\u2019t base your investment on historical performance \n4) don\u2019t buy meme stocks and no one on the internet has the answers I learned this the hard way and am bag holding stocks below. \n\nI did not lose money on any meme stock. I made a lot off the video game store - this is probably part of the reason I got over confident and started breaking my own principles. \n\nI lost money on picks made by people on the internet ($FUBO, $CRLBF, $APPN, $FLGT) \n\nA good example of this would be SQ. I bought SQ back in 2017 when I first started investing. I\u2019ve used their product at the barber, at the coffee shop up the road, at a farmer market. I thought to myself. \u201cWow, a mobile phone credit card reader for any small business, I only use card so this just made my life a whole lot easier - who made this?!?\u201d \n\nJack Dorsey obviously created twitter, and scaled one of the most popular social networks to billions of people and billions of dollars. I believed in him, and he\u2019s a very\u2026. \u201cpassionate\u201d individual about the future. \n\nWith the rise in SMB\u2019s (I work for a tech company that serves SMB\u2019s and realized how easy it is to start a biz now a days, I realized that this little mobile credit card processing company was only just getting started, and I bought a couple dozen shares of $SQ (wish I had more money back then). It\u2019s my 2\u2019d best performer behind $PENN (who fits this mold as well). \n\nAgain, I know this is flawed, not-proven, and there are much better ways to go about investing. The 2020 bull run helped make me a ton of money and I\u2019m very lucky in that sense that i invested in companies like $APPL, $SQ, $MSFT, $TSLA using these principles. Confirmation bias? 100%. But I\u2019m gonna stick to it and hope it keeps working and gets me out of the hole I dug by taking the internet\u2019s advice. \n\nA few stocks I\u2019m currently interested in:\n$CRM, $MSP, $S, $FTNT",

        "body": "There are lots of exceptions. Amazon and Walmart have been kind of duds this year as high P/E stocks, while GM and Goldman Sachs have been low P/E All-Stars.\n\nStock | Price increase past year | P/E ratio\n:--|--:|--:\nAmazon | +2.8% | 60.4\nGoldman Sachs | +99.7% | 7.6\nWalmart | +2.8% | 41.9\nGM | +66.0% | 5.7\n\nP/E cannot be relied upon in isolation to pick good/bad buys. GM is a good example of the complication of P/E. Almost all of GM's business is internal combustion engine cars, so its P/E is using its legacy business as a base in the calculation, but all of the optimism around GM is about everything else they are doing besides internal combustion engine cars. GM itself thinks their legacy business will disappear in 10-15 years, so its P/E is nonsensical when looking forward. Their \"true\" future P/E is going to be based on earnings from non-internal combustion engine cars, and those earnings are essentially zero right now. In other words, their true forward looking P/E is much higher than 5.7. They are a future high P/E stock disguised as a current low P/E stock, but the future high P/E is going to be driven by earnings declines.\n\nIn terms of finding value, there is usually a story why a company's P/E is low. You have to find the story and see if you are okay with it. Maybe it's something like Intel where consumer sentiment is so negative due to their rivals' recent tech advantages, but the deeper you look, the more you see competitive advantages that Intel will be able to maintain and leverage going forward to build its stock price back up. Or maybe it's a low P/E like Altria because no one wants to own tobacco stocks.",

While there were talks a few months ago in regards to Intel acquiring them, a lot of electronics that don\u2019t require high end semi conductors(7nm TSMC, 8nm Samsung, 10nm Intel) are made using cheap, larger nodes that are less efficient. Global foundries failed to develop high end chips after they abandoned their rnd, but they hold a 15% market share(at last check) in markets which use lower grade nodes. Best part is, that they are supposedly going public in 2022. I personally think that this is a wise investment, though a rather obvious one, as any company which is trusted by the US government and hold a market share in a sector worth billions is a simple stock to buy",

Gaming company invented the GPU, Gaming company invented A/I, ray tracing and augmented reality!  Platform is best in class command a premium. \nNot many companies out their using their BILLIONS of free cash flow for R&amp;D which unlike Intel continues to make things we never dreamed about a reality today! \nOh yeah, 350 automobile companies are signed up for their driving platform and when Tesla is forced to use it . This stock will be out of reach because it\u2019s going to be worth the most of any company today! This new Metavese thingy is at a minimum double what the impact of the game changing internet did\u2026 whaaat, I\u2019m barely proficient now!

This is no go and it may turn around a bit on buybacks, financial engineering they have a ton of money but it's not on the back of technology.  \n\nAny non boomer working in cloud computing/semi field can tell you INTC is not where you want to put your money.
