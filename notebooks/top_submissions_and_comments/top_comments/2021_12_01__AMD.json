They can fill a gap in the GPU market for lower cost GPUs. \n\nI have a sizeable position in Intel and I have a smaller one in AMD. I will be looking at Intel's and AMD's server CPU and discrete GPU offerings next year to determine which position I will be expanding. Both look promising but Intel looks like it will offer a lot more value long term. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC you might want to open positions with all of them. Betting that the 4 of them will do well is probably a pretty safe bet. I would also look at MU, that's another position that I like right now.

The idea that Intel makes better/faster processors is very much a pre-Ryzen series sentiment. There are very few instances where I think I\u2019d prefer an intel CPU, almost all of which would be low end computers using Intel\u2019s integrated graphics. Intel\u2019s dedicated gpu division is almost nonexistent, though that\u2019s not to say AMDs is much better. Getting your hands on a good AMD gpu was difficult even before the shortages. NVidia has always been better at marketing and moving GPUs in the gaming market. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say Intel won\u2019t take the lead back at some point, or that even while working at a disadvantage to AMD, Intel won\u2019t be profitable. Intel has a lot of capital and their processors are still in tons of products. Even if kids that want the latest and greatest gaming hardware are going AMD, that doesn\u2019t mean joe blow who needs a computer for wanking and emails will as well. Intel has better brand recognition, especially with older crowds, and I think it\u2019s easy to over estimate the gaming market in computers. The vast majority of computers are still bulk ordered pcs for corporate use.",

You've wrongly assumed they're the same company and deserve the same valuation.\n\n2013 - $4130\n\n2014 - $4681 (13% growth)\n\n2015 - $5010 (7% growth)\n\n2016 - $6910 (38% growth)\n\n2017 - $9714 (40% growth)\n\n2018 - $11716 (20% growth)\n\n2019 - $10918 (-7% growth)\n\n2020 - $16675 (53% growth)\n\n2021 - $26671 (60% growth)\n\nAs you can see they used to be a low-mid growth company with the exception of the crypto boom years which was considered a one-off benefit.\n\nHowever they've transformed into a super high growth company. \n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 13% deserve?\n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 50% deserve?\n\nTo answer that, look at how different growth rates affect a company after 5 years\n\nCompany @ 50% growth after 5 years = 7.6x revenue\n\nCompany @ 13% growth after 5 years = 1.84x revenue\n\nIf NVDA actually achieves 50% for 5 years, which I think is too high, their profits would be over 60bn which is what MSFT earns now, and they're a 2.5T company.\n\nEven at 35% growth for 5 years, they become more profitable than FB is today.\n\nInvestors seem to have trouble on assessing growth valuation. That's why the investors who just throw money at growth stocks without evaluating financials do well, because they don't shoot themselves in the leg.\n\nIf you think NVDA will grow at less than 30% avg. then you have a point. However, the consensus is closer to 40% growth.",

        "body": "I posted this comment on a couple of other Disney related threads over the last week so I'll post it here again too. You've touched on a lot of problems, but for me Bob Chapek is a walking disaster that seems to fuck up everything he touches.\n\nNote that he took control at the end of last year if I remember correctly, and I don't think it's any coincidence that they're down 18% since then.\n\nHe's actively pissing off his creators (including Kevin Feige, the golden goose of Disney right now) and Bob Iger which are the people that made the brand what it is today. He's reported by insiders to be nickel and diming every single issue, which shows when you look at what happened with the ScarJo situation. There was no need for that to be as public as it was and it was handled disastrously. It's simply a situation that wouldn't have happened under Iger. He's actively taking away the control of the likes of Alan Horne and Feige and giving it to middle managers who don't know the industry because their experience is in banking, not entertainment. This has led to stupid decisions regarding Dinsey+ Premier access movies which have harmed industry relations as well.\n\nMore on the PR side, he was supposed to turn up at D23 (an event that was booked months in advance), however he bailed at the last minute because of \"scheduling conflicts\". What scheduling conflict comes up at the last minutes that prevents you from attending what is one of the most important dates in the Disney diary? Well, according to insiders, he was afraid of being booed off stage, because of how deeply unpopular he is.\n\nThen there's slightly more minor things which are indicative of the type of leader he is compared to Chapek. Such as the fact that he hasn't turned up to a single movie Premier since he has been CEO. Chapek went to every single one because he led from the front and wanted to support his creators. You can find pictures of him beaming with smiles along with them at practically every Premier. Chapek? He has \"scheduling conflicts\".\n\nWith regards to Shang Chi, when asked about the movie, all he said was \"it's an interesting experiment\" because of the fact they were releasing it with the 45 day theatrical window. That's literally all he had to say about the single biggest event film that had come out that year so far. One that had the potential to be another Black Panther level success (both commercially and culturally) if it weren't for COVID.\n\nThere's a whole host of other things I could go into (like why on Earth they continue to employ Kathleen Kennedy as Head of Star Wars), however it's easier if you just look at how the Disney Parks fans view the guy (seriously look it up). He managed the parks for years and those guys absolutely *loathe* him, and for good reason apparently.\n\nFull disclosure as well btw, I was fully bullish on Disney earlier this year. I liked the direction the company was heading in and felt confident it was going to stick around. Everything above made me pull out in Summer.",

Sports medicine has also developed new techniques and dramatically reduced recovery time for injuries that used to leave people crippled. Analytics has been dragged forward by sports teams and companies looking for that edge.\n\nWhat about having a single supplier vs multiple suppliers of a critical part as we are learning now with semiconductors?\n\nThe competition between the amd and nvda and other semiconductors to surpass Intel right now is transforming the way that we can use computers to solve problems.\n\nCompetition is what causes humans to take the information in those research papers and bring them to the masses in an affordable fashion.\n\nLack of competition is how we end up with complacency and apathy in our end products(again see Intel and their being left behind)",

You make a few grand in a couple of days by putting only a few hundred in and then you think you are Warren Buffet.  So you then go and \"reinvest\" that money into more options but you think you are smart and can capitalize on weekly swings instead of you know parking that profit in actual physical shares and one bad day on the market and half your portfolio is down.  You then think well that was just bad luck and take the rest of what's left over and buy more contracts.  The market moves against you again so now you've reached the end game of well fuck it I'm just gonna buy the scratch off equivalent of options and hope they land with the couple hundred bucks ive got left.\n\nI've done this cycle twice before I learned my lesson.  At least take half of what you make in profit and stick it in shares yeah it's not sexy to only make 2% in a day when you can get a 10 bagger if you look right but there's also a reason 90% of people who fuck with options end up broke.  Also you'll thank yourself for not being a degenerate crackhead looking at a tickers price every 5 second.",
