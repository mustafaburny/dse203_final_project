Instead it broke my thesis and shot up to its present $155.\n\nBut it was correctly in a channel before the momentum swing and there's a swing trader named Kristian Qullamaggie who executes exactly that type of trade. I bet you he was in on AMD.\n\nThe thesis is a channel for 2-8 weeks = a possible momentum swing. \n\nAfter blowing up his account several times he is on record of turning $9,000 into $80,000,000 in 5 years.\n\nYes that's true.\n\nThat being said, AMD and the broader market noise.\n\nAMD, regarding momentum and one-time-framing are often pretty correlated.\n\nIt isn't guaranteed there will be a half back.\n\nBut the momentum stalled and confirmed in the last week. Well before the noise.\n\nSo basing on the psychological reasons of the half back...the general reason it exists is smart traders do 2 things. \n\n1) tight stops.\n2) identify a point of control.\n\nDumb traders do 2 things.\n\n1) no stops.\n2) FOMO.\n\nThe super smart traders short this pattern.\n\nSo what ends up happening is the trade stalls, the stops are put on. Then a catalyst (today's sell off let's say) triggers stops.\n\nShorts smell blood and pile on the shorts which adds selling pressure.\n\nDumb traders watch their gains evaporate.\n\nFOMO buyers watch their hopes and dreams turn to shjt in their mouth.\n\nSo bottom line is the whole stage is set for a rebalancing around the point of control. Where people who sat out the first run see opportunity. \n\nSo you can see that in general the psychology makes a lot of sense. \n\nToday's market issues are largely irrelevant. \n\nIf it wasn't this, it will have been something else.\n\nBecause the pattern emerges over a weekly time frame. \n\nWhat this suggests is the people with the most money are trading AMD weekly...slowly (relatively).\n\nThey see it stall and they wait. They have their stops tight and they are cautious to see what happens next.\n\nSince they are slow...the stock lingers. Pushes out a couple weeks.\n\nIf it pushes longer it could mean there's actually good support. New customers (buyers) willing to come in and buy at the new price.\n\nThe sharp down week and we are midweek, suggests to me we have a good chance it's going to half back.\n\nIt'll trigger stops. Panic sells. And Shorters described above.\n\nThat's why if the market is up tomorrow you definitely want to pay attention to what AMD does. It basically has to trade in tandem with the market.\n\nAnything weaker. And next week might be the drop.",

        "body": "Nope. A lot of people shjt on me for putting too low of a target on AMD because I wanted it at say $95 and it never hit $95. Instead it broke my thesis and shot up to its present $155.\n\nBut it was correctly in a channel before the momentum swing and there's a swing trader named Kristian Qullamaggie who executes exactly that type of trade. I bet you he was in on AMD.\n\nThe thesis is a channel for 2-8 weeks = a possible momentum swing. \n\nAfter blowing up his account several times he is on record of turning $9,000 into $80,000,000 in 5 years.\n\nYes that's true.\n\nThat being said, AMD and the broader market noise.\n\nAMD, regarding momentum and one-time-framing are often pretty correlated.\n\nIt isn't guaranteed there will be a half back.\n\nBut the momentum stalled and confirmed in the last week. Well before the noise.\n\nSo basing on the psychological reasons of the half back...the general reason it exists is smart traders do 2 things. \n\n1) tight stops.\n2) identify a point of control.\n\nDumb traders do 2 things.\n\n1) no stops.\n2) FOMO.\n\nThe super smart traders short this pattern.\n\nSo what ends up happening is the trade stalls, the stops are put on. Then a catalyst (today's sell off let's say) triggers stops.\n\nShorts smell blood and pile on the shorts which adds selling pressure.\n\nDumb traders watch their gains evaporate.\n\nFOMO buyers watch their hopes and dreams turn to shjt in their mouth.\n\nSo bottom line is the whole stage is set for a rebalancing around the point of control. Where people who sat out the first run see opportunity. \n\nSo you can see that in general the psychology makes a lot of sense. \n\nToday's market issues are largely irrelevant. \n\nIf it wasn't this, it will have been something else.\n\nBecause the pattern emerges over a weekly time frame. \n\nWhat this suggests is the people with the most money are trading AMD weekly...slowly (relatively).\n\nThey see it stall and they wait. They have their stops tight and they are cautious to see what happens next.\n\nSince they are slow...the stock lingers. Pushes out a couple weeks.\n\nIf it pushes longer it could mean there's actually good support. New customers (buyers) willing to come in and buy at the new price.\n\nThe sharp down week and we are midweek, suggests to me we have a good chance it's going to half back.\n\nIt'll trigger stops. Panic sells. And Shorters described above.\n\nThat's why if the market is up tomorrow you definitely want to pay attention to what AMD does. It basically has to trade in tandem with the market.\n\nAnything weaker. And next week might be the drop.",
