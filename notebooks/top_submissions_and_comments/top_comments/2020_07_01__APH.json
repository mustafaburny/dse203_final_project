        "body": "As others have pointed out, there are some huge flaws and unfound assumptions in your investing premise:\n\n1. Federal legalization, especially as outlined by Biden, certainly does not mean open border cannabis trade with Canada, even it was for just medical. One of the primary foundations of the US cannabis industry is the wealth of jobs and tax revenue it creates here locally... why would Biden/Trump or any state legislature create a federal legalization framework that would hand over the market to Canadian imports??\n2. Given (1), the primary methods LPs will then enter the US market is buying out licenses or partnering with existing operators (as we have seen CGC attempt to do already). CGC/CRON and maybe APH are the only ones with enough capital to make a significant entry and they will be paying top dollar to do so as license valuations will shoot through the roof upon federal legalization. The majority of LPs are just attempting to stay afloat at this point given cash burn rates... not sure how you envision them buying out US operators with far better financials.\n3. The idea that hemp operations will be an avenue to future THC licensing is also unproven at this point. It could, but no states have allowed this to-date so investing based on that thesis would be quite the gamble.\n\nAs such, the idea of investing in LPs on the potential that they might pay top dollar for future US licenses seems extremely inefficient, especially considering the wealth of new capital that would enter the market at the same time. Owning well-run US operators who would be attractive buy-out targets seems like a far better method of capitalizing on US legalization. The OTC/CSE critique is nonsense imo- under the scenario you outline, those US operators would be allowed to uplist to the higher exchanges anyway. Not to mention, the top MSO CSE stocks have been outperforming LPs on larger exchanges for some time now.",

I don't think you will lose holding Aphria, but I don't think this is a 5 bagger/10 bagger like I used to think. \nA few provinces fucked up the roll out so Aphria has not reached it'a full potential yet, so for that reason I don't worry about selling at loss since it's one of the best managed mj companies (sigh). But weed as a cap just like booze has one.  +/- 40 million habitants in Canada, not everyone consumes cannabis. I remember all theses posts about how millenials give up alcohol for cannabis and this is truly not true. People that like to drink and hang out will keep drinking, doesn't matter if they are millenials or not, people that want to chill will keep smoking. Legalization Didn't contribute in creating many more users, all the people that smoked are still smoking and I don't know that many people that dropped booze for weed, yes there are a few but not as much people think. The only difference is instead of buying weed from Little joe or buymyweedonline people go to retail shops. So this said, Aphria IMO as more room to grow, but do I think this is a 10b company in the future? Look at what is happening in the world, by the time Europe and LATAM fully legalizes Aph will have the operations overseas shut down to focus on cost control here in Canada IMO.

The top 5 Canadian companies raised an insane amount of capital a few years ago that is just light years beyond what the Us companies did. Add up CGC, CRON, ACB, APH, TLRY...it\u2019s a ton. After that there is a pretty big drop off. But agree their revenues don\u2019t compare. \n\nThe Us, you still have some top ones. But the spread between CURA, TRuL, GTi from a capital raising perspective isn\u2019t as huge compared to MMEN, Cresco, Harvest, IaN, etc. though Cura does seem to be in a different class from a dollars raised view. \n\nSo all that being said, US companies overall are far behind CDN even a few years ago dollars raised (CDN companies haven\u2019t raise nearly as much last year and half as they did before). But when you take out CDN outliers (especially CGC/CRON), I think you\u2019re right as far as where they are positioned.",

Yes, they have lots of services, they are all kind of mediocre, hence being like GM.\n\nS3 STILL has a consistency model that sometimes means you cannot read your own writes, which bites developers, especially the new ones that AWS tries to position themselves as being great for, in the ass.\n\nDynamoDB requires so much effort to utilize for anything except trivial key-values, that they have to employ people full time to evangelize and explain to their customers why it's their fault it's not performing well and how they need to go through some pretty esoteric practices to numb the pain.\n\nSome services have no SLA.  How long might a message sit in SQS before your application can see it? Undefined.\n\nAzure's serverless play is better in every regard than AWS'.  It's not that Azure is the best, it's that GCP, Azure, even Oracle Cloud all have technology that leave everything AWS has in the dust.\n\nRDS?  Yeah, it's 2020 and you want to spin up a couple MySQL servers but you aren't an \"old school corp\".  Compare that with Cosmos DB (or Spanner, or Oracle's autonomous db)\n\nKinesis? You will pay $3000/mo for what you could get out of $30 in servers if you ran Kafka yourself.\n\nThe hype could keep AWS alive for a long time, I know, but it's not because they have the superior products. Major players end up falling back and just treating AWS like hardware rental because their services are clunky and expensive.",

I appreciate that the technical reality has little bearing on how high the stock will go, but saying AMZN is a safe place to park your money is kind of like saying IBM is as well because \"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM\".  Like that phrase rested on it's laurels for a long ass time, and AWS' time will come too.\n\nAlmost every new feature they release is delayed, comes out with bugs, the amount of effort they actually ask their customers to put in to developing working solutions that integrate their services together in to something valuable is high.\n\nThe total cost of ownership angle, once you get past the strippers and steaks pitch to your management, is far less compelling than they would like you to believe.  In some cases Amazon will charge you what an FTE salary would be for something that could be accomplished with a pair of $15 servers and still leaves you with half the operations concerns - then tell you gee aren't you glad it's semi-managed? AWS likes to bring up the Dynamo paper as if that's not like Al Bundy's four touchdowns in one game.\n\nAzure, Oracle Cloud or Google Cloud have (Spanner, CosmosDB, and so on) offerings that beat the pants off of RDS.\n\nOn the frontier, AWS' serverless approach is woefully inadequate and only really offsets a portion of the devops overhead and only integrates 'loosely' with a lot of their services.  Okay, I've already typed way more than you care about, but my point is while I would never say short AMZN because who knows how long they'll run for, and with COVID, it will be interesting to see what impact a lack of re:Invent will have once their fans stop getting treated to outlandish parties, I'd be cautious about treating it like some safe haven. They are also notoriously high-stress, high-turnover, and I think that negatively impacts their ability to attract the talent needed to elevate their platform or keep it in league.",
