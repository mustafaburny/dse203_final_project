Aphria would be buying Aurora at pretty much a discount, hence why APH would own 51% and ACB would be worth 49%, despite ACB being worth MORE than APH.\n\nThis reeks of desperation coming out of the Aurora camp. First rumors of shopping itself to Tilray, now Aphria, it's obvious no one wants to run Aurora. Personally, when companies are this desperate to sell themselves, I'd stay far far far away. Furthermore, given no CEO, this makes sense. Companies looking to sell themselves are in no rush of filling a CEO role. Even in the prelim terms that came out, stating that it woudl essentially be APH brass that's kept and ACB brass canned. \n\nThe only plus for Aphria is the discount.

        "body": "As others have pointed out, there are some huge flaws and unfound assumptions in your investing premise:\n\n1. Federal legalization, especially as outlined by Biden, certainly does not mean open border cannabis trade with Canada, even it was for just medical. One of the primary foundations of the US cannabis industry is the wealth of jobs and tax revenue it creates here locally... why would Biden/Trump or any state legislature create a federal legalization framework that would hand over the market to Canadian imports??\n2. Given (1), the primary methods LPs will then enter the US market is buying out licenses or partnering with existing operators (as we have seen CGC attempt to do already). CGC/CRON and maybe APH are the only ones with enough capital to make a significant entry and they will be paying top dollar to do so as license valuations will shoot through the roof upon federal legalization. The majority of LPs are just attempting to stay afloat at this point given cash burn rates... not sure how you envision them buying out US operators with far better financials.\n3. The idea that hemp operations will be an avenue to future THC licensing is also unproven at this point. It could, but no states have allowed this to-date so investing based on that thesis would be quite the gamble.\n\nAs such, the idea of investing in LPs on the potential that they might pay top dollar for future US licenses seems extremely inefficient, especially considering the wealth of new capital that would enter the market at the same time. Owning well-run US operators who would be attractive buy-out targets seems like a far better method of capitalizing on US legalization. The OTC/CSE critique is nonsense imo- under the scenario you outline, those US operators would be allowed to uplist to the higher exchanges anyway. Not to mention, the top MSO CSE stocks have been outperforming LPs on larger exchanges for some time now.",

        "body": "FYI I like APH but \"profitable\" is a term used very loosely in this sector and $6M in adjusted ebidta doesn't exactly translate to profitability. No doubt the cash position is solid and market share gains have been impressive, but the positive net income last Q comes from a non-cash adjustment on derivative liabilities and an inventory build adjustment, while actual operational cash flow losses were fairly large still. Looking at the financials: https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Aphria-Inc_Q3-2020_Consolidated-Financial-Statements.pdf\n\nGross profit before fair value adjustments= $35.69M CAD\n\nOperating Expenses= $50.86M\n\nCash used in operating activities: -$53.14M!\n\nOne could argue that the inventory build will serve future sales which is an explanation for the OCF losses, but inventory now stands at $225.83M as of Q3. In a Canadian market with consistent inventory write-downs and impairments, that is quite a larger number. Trulieve is a better example of what an actually profitable company looks like - OCF positive, FCF positive, $66.47M CAD in ebidta compared to $6M CAD adjusted ebdita from aph. Still much better than their LP peers (acb, cgc, tilray for example) but \"profitable\" is a generous characterization",

Annual run-rate would be at 35x current sales and 219x EBIDTA, not exactly cheap even in a growth industry. Aph is certainly doing better than other LPs, but the market has already factored in tremendous future growth already into the price. I agree they have positioned themselves well to survive the long game more given a sounds balance sheet and relatively minimal cash burn, so I agree it would likely be a slow and steady rise into a higher valuation vs rapid jumps.",

        "body": "So declining market share, a mountain of inventory that puts Aphria's in the shade, behind Aph in AB and ON, not to mention sector leading SGA and goodwill/intangibles but now your opinion has improved?\n\nJesus Christ this place is nuts.  Do I think Aph is sitting on a ticking timebomb?  I sure do.  Do I think they are stalling and playing games with numbers to stay onside with debt covenants?  I assume so.  Do I trust any timeline they give me? Not a fucking chance.\n\nBut for fuck's sake some shit you can't overlook - like marketshare, rec growth, exposure to Germany (the country closest to delivering meaningful revenues.  Compare that with Canopy whose year end results showed YOY decline in Canadian cannabis revenues.  Think about that.  \n\nFrom last financials press release:\n\n&gt;revenue in Q4 2020 decreased 13% versus Q3 2020 driven primarily by lower Canadian recreational revenue.\u00a0\n\nA 13% decline?  And so far it ain't getting better.\n\nAnd the thing is I totally acknowledge Aph's warts.  I've complained about most of them but to hold them out as the villainous poster child when peers have bigger issues in EVERYTHING that Aph is accused of really boggles my mind.  Especially when Aph was much more conservative and/or transparent in how they applied FVI.\n\nBut whatever, just another Aph pumper right?",

I don't think you will lose holding Aphria, but I don't think this is a 5 bagger/10 bagger like I used to think. \nA few provinces fucked up the roll out so Aphria has not reached it'a full potential yet, so for that reason I don't worry about selling at loss since it's one of the best managed mj companies (sigh). But weed as a cap just like booze has one.  +/- 40 million habitants in Canada, not everyone consumes cannabis. I remember all theses posts about how millenials give up alcohol for cannabis and this is truly not true. People that like to drink and hang out will keep drinking, doesn't matter if they are millenials or not, people that want to chill will keep smoking. Legalization Didn't contribute in creating many more users, all the people that smoked are still smoking and I don't know that many people that dropped booze for weed, yes there are a few but not as much people think. The only difference is instead of buying weed from Little joe or buymyweedonline people go to retail shops. So this said, Aphria IMO as more room to grow, but do I think this is a 10b company in the future? Look at what is happening in the world, by the time Europe and LATAM fully legalizes Aph will have the operations overseas shut down to focus on cost control here in Canada IMO.

I agree with lots of the positives- experienced management team, Germany exposure, increasing market Canadian market share, and solid cash/debt position (although it seems you left out $300M+ in convertible debt they have), but it seems like you glossed over the negatives:\n\n1) You place way too much emphasis on net income, a metric that is extremely clouded and doesn't provide an accurate depiction of operational success. You can see the positive net income is almost entirely from a non-cash change in derivative liabilities and inventory adjustment. A dive into operational cash flow and free cash flow (both of which are well into the negative) would be welcome and far more indicative of current operating performance. \n\n2) You have zero discussion of inventory levels in a Canadian market flooded with inventory and facing write-downs/impairments across the board. We have seen Aph's inventory balloon from $112M as of Q1, $152M as of Q2, and jumped to $225M as of Q3. We have seen OGI face write-downs with less than $115M in inventory, ACB had write-downs with $250M in inventory.  \n\n3) The idea that a broad, multi-country footprint is a positive is an extremely dated viewpoint. While getting a foothold in emerging cannabis markets is important, the rapid decline of LPs and their atrocious financials were a direct result of expanding too far too fast. Outside Germany, Italy, and perhaps Australia, a broad footprint has only lead to excess cash burn and future layoffs/facility closures as we have already seen amongst LPs..\n\nI still like the company compared to other LPs, but I think you should be realistic about some of the challenges they face.",

The entire province of PQ has 40ish stores. The black market still has 2/3rds of every dollar made.  Aph doesn't even have a full set of SKUs and only recently started offering  quarters, and even more recently, ounces.  That's a segment that alone represents 20ish%.  \n\nIf anything Aph's financials show that there is still a lot of money to be made.  Especially considering they have grown rec revenues 125ish points (via organic growth) over the last 3 quarters.  Show another weed company that comes close.  Maybe Trul - not positive since I don't follow FL much anymore since dumping LHS - but it would be a tiny fucking list.  Or show me which companies have a higher gross margin for cannabis operations. \n\nThere are a lot of warts but taking #1 in ON and AB while not having edibles or large value offerings is glossed over by too many people.  Any other company and that would be celebrated around here.\n\nMy guess is that the usual suspects are going to retire the free cash flow barbs and just concentrate on inventory.  Because growing stockpiles of inventory are totally not a sector issue.",
