The reported Exynos chips made in house by samsung for their next gen smartphones have made insane amount of improvement/progress since their last gen and thats mainly due to their semi conductors. In the end they can both moon but semi-conductors can be pretty fickle\n\n\nAlso, samsung makes all the chips for NVDA as well as (used to) for apple.

        "body": "well exactly my reason for posting. to hear what other people think. here are some of my thoughts on the entire situation...\n\n1. the semiconductor impact\nbecause this is such a huge player in the markets at the moment between AMD, NVDA, INTC et al, could effect the entire Tech sector. It all pivots on TMC in Taiwan which makes it tricky.\n2. 3500 US companies are suing Trump for blocking China trade access. which implies US companies want to go to China not stay locked into US.\n3. DCEP Chinese digital currency, not mentioned but could challenge the global dollar in time.\n4. Democrats are going to be more aggressive than Trump towards China. They called him \"Uncle Donald\" at one point. friendly-ish, they likely respect his financial approach even if he is brash. I dont think US will be friendly if Dems get in, and the vibe towards China will get a lot colder and nastier. that is not good if they are losing the global cold trade war, then US will start to play dirty tricks. Hilary would have had us all in a war by now imo. psychopathic woman. maybe she is still pulling strings somewhere. I truly hope not.\n5. Propaganda machine that has been driving Anti-Chinese sentiment for months is working very well and that is a big worry as once China feel even more cornered, they will likely react more aggressively. US are the cause of this whole fiasco, not the Chinese, but we are being sold differently on that narrative because US are dirty war players. history upholds that truth.\n6. China gaining more economic power and US losing it globally would totally change the face of world economy and markets fundamentally to the point it is almost impossible to imagine what that future would look like and one big question - how far would US Government be willing to go to stop that happening? that is scary because historically US Govmt have no limits that they have not been willing to go to before, including killing their own in extremely large numbers.\n\nAnyway, how all that effects trade, we will only really know after the election. I was hoping other peeps might share their wisdom/thoughts here which was my reason for posting.",

Simply, she\u2019ll go full strap-on and arms deep into Intel and possibly will steal from Nvidia. Unlike NVidia, AMD continued on TSMC so, chips can be 7nm. Also, it looks like mofos in AMD are doing their best to squeeze every single bit of performance from that new GPU since Cousin Jensen brought some big guns onto table. Without supply but still the idea has been planted. She needs to destroy it too. Also, looking at the die size compared to previous gen, some serious shit will go on.",

They are heavily working on making things sustainable.\n\nMy theory is, AMD will lowball Nvidia on Price for same or maybe slightly better performance. They didn\u2019t have to redesign a GPU PCB (3000 series GPUs have weird PCB shape). Making shit that tight is also another cost. They showed a decent 3 fan cooler, just like non-reference cards. So, cost of manufacturing would be way less than Nvidia. So, they can actually sell cheaper.\n\nThen adding the experience they got with 7NM, less voltage and more clock speed (on boost) is a possibility now. Considering twice the size of the die; it gives me threadripper vibes. I think she delayed the announcement just because Jensen did some cheeky play. She wants to hit harder and right now, only way of doing that would be;\n\n1) going for software with drivers (which I think what they\u2019re doing right now)\n2) making some crazy shit like x2 cards they did back in the day. That\u2019d be a shocker for sure. But I don\u2019t think they can do it so quickly.\n\nOverall, AMD Long...",
