        "body": "I see a lot of mentions of AMD, and a bunch of Nvidia, but almost nothing about ARM. Sure, AMD is competitive with Intel for x86 and Nvidia is getting a lot of attention for GPU-powered machine learning, but don't sleep on ARM. We're probably on the precipice of a huge shift to ARM in the datacentre that's being driven by public cloud providers.\n\nConsider AWS which have been rolling out ARM \"Graviton2\" virtual machines all year:\n\n1. Compared to their x86 counterparts, the Graviton2 are faster for many workloads, are more thermally efficient, and cost less for both Amazon _and_ their customers. AWS instances are billed by the second and usually autoscaled, meaning customers will launch and destroy dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of VMs every day. Servers are not hand-configured one at a time and named after Star Wars characters -- you can't launch a thousand servers a day that way -- instead they're built through automation. This isn't just for speed, it's for repeatability so that when you boot up a server, you don't have to second-guess that it's going to be precisely configured already. So, if you already have the automation in place, and only needed to adjust one variable to start launching ARM machines instead of x86 for less money and more performance, why wouldn't you?\n\n2. \"That's not fair -- the software all has to be re-compiled or even rewritten to work on ARM!\" That's true! I'll get to that in a moment. Here's a type of server you can use right now without rewriting _any_ software: managed database instances. One of the hardest things to do well in a tech org is to run \"stateful\" workloads like databases, which is why all the major cloud providers offer fully-managed database services of many flavours of SQL, caching, and NoSQL databases. Click a few buttons and get MySQL, with patching, backups, and auto-failover managed by the cloud provider. Postgres already runs on ARM, and the data stored by Postgres doesn't care whether the CPU architecture that stored it was ARM or x86 or PowerPC. Replace your managed database instances powered by x86 with the ARM version and start getting that better (and cheaper) performance without having to rewrite anything, _and_ keep all your data. No migration, just shut it down, and turn it back on again with new CPUs. The public cloud providers are going to make a killing on this and they know it.\n\n3. Ok, so what _about_ the apps the tech org writes to power the business? The things that have to be recompiled and maybe even heavily rewritten? Pipelines rebuilt? And the servers underneath them, won't the management software also need to support ARM? Yeah, that's going to take some time and effort, but maybe less than you think. Workload management is becoming increasingly commodified. Orgs that have existing IT assets and tooling will have to make investments in converting their pipeline if they think it's worthwhile (and it may not be in the short term). New startups or new working groups within existing organizations though have no such baggage. They probably won't even run their own servers. Fully-managed containerization platforms or partially-managed platforms powered by something like Kubernetes (think GKE, EKS, AKS) mean that the cloud provider deals with running the servers, and you just ship them the workload. Are you in a golang shop? Target ARM and push.\n\nA tailwind to all this is Apple's shift to ARM, and while it may not have an outsized effect on the datacentre, it doesn't hurt.\n\nLong story short: AMD and Nvidia will make things interesting for Intel in the coming years, but if you want to know where the industry is going, look to ARM.\n\nEDIT: Lot of comments pointing out Nvidia's ownership of ARM. Yep, I get it, this is an investing sub and readers are going to be looking at this at a business perspective. ARM is a major _architectural_ change in technology though, which is typically a hard sell, but is being made not only possible but desirable due to the commodification of the datacentre. If you want to buy the winner then buy the winner, but no one is asking why ARM is all of a sudden positioned to succeed in the datacentre now when the chips have been around for decades.",

He was kinda like cool but I dunno and didn't mess with it. His friend dumped 2k+ a month for years into it.\n\nThey get together a few years later at his friends giant mansion on the Potomac river just outside of dc. He's like Jesus fuck, how much did you make? \"I can't tell you it would make you sick, more money than you could ever spend.\" My mentor estimated upwards of 100mil based on continual investment and holding through multiple splits.\n\nSirius XM comes out, hasn't even launched any satellites yet and mentor is like naw I'm not missing out this time. Tells me to take his advice and dump anything I can. It's at like $0.25 a share. Sadly he passed so I never learned his gains, and didn't put money into it. While he or I wouldn't have MCI money, he would also never have to worry about money again.\n\nWhen I was poor as shit, but involved in tech, I told everyone I knew to do the same to amd at $3. And Nvidia at $22. I was living in the negative and just couldn't.\n\nRIP. I've got $13.85 in my bank account.",

We saw where that went. \n\nCheck out Moore\u2019s Law is Dead on YouTube. Far and away the most grounded tech tuber to cover the AMD, NVDA, INTC drama that has made us all so much money. \n\nSo, for starters, the leaks are looking really good in terms of performance parity, but that\u2019s not the driver here - it\u2019s inventory. AMD let NVDA get to market first, quietly stockpiling cards for the holiday rush while Nvidia battled with their own reputation. \n\nSo, similar to zen 2 and intel a year or so back, AMD really doesn\u2019t need to be better on a pound for pound, spec for spec basis... they just need to be comparable, affordable and available. \n\nAll signs point to at least 2 of those qualities being characteristic of their new line up. \n\nEvent is at 9am pacific time.
