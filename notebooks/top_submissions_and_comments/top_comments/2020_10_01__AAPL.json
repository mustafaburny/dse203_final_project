It\u2019s also the fact that they hold the keys to the App Store and have an ever growing network of services they monetize.\n\nApple is overvalued. How overvalued I don\u2019t know. Not as overvalued as they seem at first glance.\n\nI thought it was cool when they hit 1t. Bonkers when they hit 2t. But nobody cares about my opinion.\n\nIt\u2019s not that surprising that a US company has the marketcap of the top 100 UK firms. It\u2019s not 1820. There is no East India company. The UK has less people, less capital, and hasn\u2019t benefited from the pro capitalist policies of the US for the last however many years. \n\nTLDR: typing \u201cMurica\u201d on my iPhone",

Not in a boring way; she's always up for adventure. But she doesn't expect it. So every little surprise you spring on her feels like a big deal. \"Well, I'll start saving for that.\"\n\nShe sighs, \"No, I know we need to save our money.\" She's right, and the alkaline taste of guilt fills your mouth. In a single day, you blew two Hawaii trips on far OTM AAPL calls. You gambled away what could have been a gift for your princess: your quiet, grateful, undemanding princess.\n\nShe turns to you, \"But I hope I get to go before I die.\"",

Keep in mind how many industries are essentially being gatekept or entirely replaced by them.\n\nMedia, telecom alone are multi billion dollar industries and those are just two small things that Apple devices essentially inserted themselves into.  Two of many things.  They also aren't doing this in one country or region: they are doing it globally.\n\nNow keep in mind their products can also be reprogrammed to tap into other industries via software updates at any time.  That's crazy powerful.\n\nYour oven breaks, you'll replace it in the near future. Your phone breaks, odds are unless it's the middle of the night you're canceling your plans to go replace it right away.\n\nSo the future value of AAPL is pretty insane when you really think about it.  They are gatekeeping a huge and growing portion of the worlds economy.  I don't see that trend changing anytime soon.",

        "body": "Which part specifically? How companies manage cash deposits, the way revenue is taxed depending on where profit is booked, or the actual purchase of Mojang?\n\nEdit: happy to answer any of the points as much as I'm possible to.\n\n**Cash management:**\n\nCash is held by companies in the countries in which they book profit. We'll cover that in more detail later. To move cash is hard, and expensive. If you move cash from country A to country B you open yourself up to be taxed on that new arrival of cash in country B, either as income, or additional wealth. If country B has unfavourable tax rates then that can be a problem. How and why do they accumulate cash in a variety of countries...\n\n**Transfer Pricing:**\n\nLet's say you make a product in country A, it costs $1 to make. Country A has a tax rate on corporate income of 50%. That's bad. Country B has a tax rate of corporate income of 10%. That's good. If you make $10 profit in both countries, you keep $5 in A, and $9 in B. So, it is advantageous to make as much profit in country B as possible, and make less profit in country A. How do you make profit in country B for a product made and sold in country A? Transfer pricing.\n\nSetup a company (CA) in country A making your product. Setup another company (CB) in country B. Company CA makes a product for $1, sells it to Company CB for $2, and company CB sells it to the consumer for $10. What you've just done is transfer the profit of the sale to country B instead of country A.\n\n* Country A had a product made for $1, sold for $2. Profit before tax: $1, tax paid $0.50, net profit $0.50\n\n* Country B bought a product for $2, sold for $10. Profit before tax: $8, tax paid $0.80, net profit $7.20\n\n* Total cash in: $7.70\n\nIf you had made it in country A, and sold it in country A with no transfer price you would have come off worse.\n\n* Made for $1, sold for $10. Profit before tax: $9, tax paid $4.50, total cash in: $4.50\n\nOn a single product you generated $3.20 more in cash by moving the cash to country B.\n\nThere are all sorts of legal restrictions on what transfer pricing is fair, depending on the country and governments. It is why tax havens exist, and lots of companies have shell companies in those tax havens. Companies have been taken to task by implementing huge tax-avoiding strategies through this method. One good example is Starbucks, who ship the beans around the world but through complex chains of companies retain the profit in the lowest tax regions. Amazon does the same, Google too, Microsoft, Apple, you name it.\n\nIf you're into corporate finance, which probably 0.000000000000% (rounded up) of you are, the site [tpcases.com](https://tpcases.com/) is an interesting read. It has loads of news and articles on this kind of tax minimisation strategy.\n\n**Mojang Purchase**\n\nSo, you've accumulated a ton of money in a tax favourable country or countries, how do you spend it back in country A with high taxes? You either declare the income in country A, and move the money, then pay an awful lot of tax. Or, alternatively, you keep the cash offshore, and use it for things with lower tax rates than moving it back to country A.\n\nMicrosoft's policy for some time, at least the mid 2010s has been to use their offshore reserves to purchase companies outside of the reach of American taxes, and other higher tax countries.\n\nAround the time they bought Mojang they were doing the same to a lot of other companies. It's a good use of your huge cash deposits, effectively saving the difference between purchase price and the tax you would have paid. It is effectively a discount on the price of whatever asset you're buying. By spending the cash you have strategically, you can minimise the costs associated with that spending, and companies generally would like to reduce to a sustainable level the amount of cash they keep on hand. Sitting on cash does not generate income like investing it, in products, assets, anything that generates revenue above terrible interest rates or secure investments in markets which are generally very risk averse for companies and so have little potential upside.\n\nFor this reason companies keep cash in a variety of places, ready to be used (or transferred elsewhere) for things like this. In a perfect world they would bring it all back in to e.g. America (or other HQ country) but this would bring with a need to declare it, have it audited and taxed, and companies try to minimise that as much as possible.\n\nAny more questions I'm happy to try and help, depending on when I read it.",

Losing money sucks so bad, especially because I seem to paper hand positions once they are down and yet when look back at my contract if I just held it, it would have been profitable. I had NKLA $30p and sold the Friday before Milton quit and the stock tanked. I had DQ before it mooned 30%. I had GME calls that I took the advice of \"leave while you have profit!\" So I left at 20% up and missed out on like 280% more growth. \n\n  Then when I decided that wasn't working now I diamond hand and so far that isn't always working either. I held SSSS calls yesterday, thinking \"alright don't panic sell...\" only for the underlying stock to tank 10% more today. \n\nAt this point I'm just chasing losses. The only positions that have done well for me are leaps on blue chips (holding aapl 1/15/22  $110c, $115c, and $120c)\n\n https://imgur.com/5aEeEvy.jpg",

So I will be around so long there are investors willing to keep the company running.\n\nAs for the eV controversial giant, this is not quite finished. Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money. Seagate was dismissed in 1997, sue again and paid [$45 M to R+ as late as 2000](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/seagate-to-pay-rodime-45m-to-settle-suit-2000-01/).   R+ only exists as a shell company and its share price soared on news of the patent settlement.  I think **NKLA** can remain as a shell company with its patent portfolio covering designs that covers most vehicles built electric or not. [It sue Tsla earlier](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/04/20/teslas-effort-to-short-circuit-nikola-lawsuit-fizzles-as-patent-office-denies-door-argument/?sh=44dc21a45d78).

IBM was a computer company.\n\nThe brilliance of MSFT was in - and this seems weird today - realizing that a company could make money just selling software. A ton of money. More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",

And the first question people ask when they find out what I did in college is about the economy and stocks. And it\u2019s a dumb question and they don\u2019t even realize it. Like I spent years learning about scarcity and a bunch of basically applied calculus and statistics. \n\nUnless I work directly for a brokerage I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to make an informed decision any one way or the other, and even then it would only be a best estimate and one with enough of a likely chance to not be correct that it would be pretty irresponsible to give an opinion on it. \n\nI can fully do the math behind it sure, but the stock market has proven time and time again that it\u2019s irrational and not really predictable with any algorithm. There is a reason that economic theory even says throwing a dart at a chart of stocks and picking where it lands is just as likely to be accurate than if you picked it based on extensive amounts of DD and research. \n\nBut I just point people towards index\u2019s, tell them if they aren\u2019t retiring in the next 5 years don\u2019t be afraid or worried that the stock market drops every now and then etc etc. \n\ntl;dr Economists don\u2019t study the economy they study scarcity. I\u2019d be extremely skeptical of any economist claiming to know what the market will do or that they have figured out the stock market. We exist to do small scale data analysis, or to advise large scale economic moves aka monetary/fiscal policy, we aren\u2019t adept at guessing small movements within certain markets.

        "body": "&gt; IMO it really validates the risks related with EM investments and the risks that are attributed to investments in Chinese markets\n\nActually if you read the piece the exact opposite conclusion is reached: that with this move China actually **derisked** its economy and therefore arguably made it safer for investors. It was not a \"move on a whim by Xi because he got his sensitive feelings hurt by Jack Ma\" like so many Western publications argued. Like the piece says:\n\n&gt; [Regulators think that] there are many deficiencies of the current Chinese financial system, but that does not mean \u201cBigTech\u201d gets to do what it wants, even if we can acknowledge their contributions to society.  TL;DR: we like innovation, but let\u2019s not overhype the magic of \u201cbig data,\u201d and anyway, you\u2019re still operating in financial services, and so that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be regulated, like it or not.  That\u2019s because if we the regulators don\u2019t step in, and something goes wrong, who will pay the price?  Society will, the citizens will. Don\u2019t you guys remember the Great Financial Crisis of 2008?  A few parties won, yes, but all the rest of us? We lost.  We were all set back.  That\u2019s not happening again, not on our watch!\n\nWhen regulators think like that, I think that's a system worth investing into IMHO, because they think long-term and they think greater-good which ultimately leads to a stronger economy, not something to be scared by...\n\nThe only argument that can be made, I think, is that they acted too last-minute and that is scary in itself but it is also actually somewhat reassuring because they're not afraid to stop something as iconic as the world's largest IPO when they believe it can ultimately be detrimental to society. They didn't mind losing face and that is a positive sign for China.",

Essentially he offloaded a shit ton of liability from ANT's (like paypal/venmo in china) loans onto the chinese government aka the chinese people.

They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

        "body": "To add on: selling covered calls is a pretty easy way to make some extra money on non-meme stocks.\n\nBasically, you're selling your shares at strike+premium, e.g. if you sell a $10 call for 1.5, you're basically selling your shares for $11.50 each. You're solidly in the green as long as the share price stays below strike+premium. If it looks like it is going to blow past your strike, and you want to hold the shares, you can usually roll to a higher strike for a net credit by adding some time. Collecting the premium also gives you some downside protection if the stock starts to drop.\n\nA basic strategy that is very popular among wealthier people is to own shares and sell monthly/quarterly strangles. E.g. own 10k $MSFT shares and sell 100 calls at +15% and 100 puts at -15% each month. Basically, getting paid to buy the dip and renting out your shares for cash.\n\nYou can easily get 10-20% monthly returns holding shares on stable companies this way, but you'll sometimes miss out on the massive rallies, so it's not suited for anyone in this sub. You'll also get screwed in the event of a covid-type crash if you've done this on margin, but if you're holding shares, you'd be screwed short-term anyway.",

        "body": "What kind of price-to-sales multiple will GME have in the next 2 years? Currently at 0.13\n\nIf GME successfully grows their e-commerce business to \\~50% with same day delivery (currently being rolled out now), the products they sell could reasonably provide a 1x sales multiple. (Compare other e-commerce P/S - OSTK 1.2   CHWY 4.2)\n\n4 new revenue streams for GME will include: Monetization of customer data, digital downstream revenue from MSFT Xbox platform, online advertising revenue, and PC hardware sales. All 4 offer good margins.\n\nAll of these new revenue streams and e-commerce growth represents a very big change (almost 'tech' like) than that of the former business model of purely B&amp;M with mostly just gaming product inventory. The real big money to influence a major share price rise is in the customer data. If leveraged properly, GME has a true 'tech' side to their business model.\n\nGME looks to grow revenue YoY, estimating 6-7bn for 2021, and 8bn+ in 2022 with a P/S of 1, we are looking at a 8bn market cap in 2022. Share price of $120+\n\nYou could compare with BestBuy, which has a P/S of 0.8. Give GME the 0.8 P/S and they reach a market cap of 6.4bn (assuming 8bn yearly revenue in 2022). That's $99/share and an 800% increase from current market value.\n\nMost investors are not aware of what the company has to offer, hence why the reference Blockbuster so much. There is a reason we have seen larger stakes being taken by bigger players. Just last week we saw some more big boys jumping in. Wells Fargo, Jefferies, Hussman all taking positions. When GME shorts flip to longs (will happen eventually) they will drive up the share price.\n\nIn the next 2 years, if the street decides to view GME as a e-commerce/digital data business within the gaming/PC industry, valuations can run high and P/S multiples could run even higher.",

Why nobody mentions this is beyond me, arguably one of the most important high margin revenue streams GME can benefit from.\n\n**E-Commerce omnichannel business model** that offers same day delivery and is continually improving. This is the \"beat AMZN' part of the business model.\n\n**PC hardware sales** ($40bn/yr and growing TAM)\n\n**Online ad revenue.** From website + App\n\n**E-sports experiences**. Currently partnering with gaming pros and streaming on twitch. Will **build brand recognition**.\n\nMassive **reduction in SG&amp;A.**\n\n**SKU optimization**. Better inventory and inventory turnover.\n\n'Digital everything' is not as strong of a bear thesis as it was 2 years ago. Especially considering GME has the MSFT partnership to share digital revenue.\n\nGaming industry TAM is growing YoY.\n\nCompetent management team. Finally.\n\nBigger firms/institutions are taking a position in GME. So far as of end of Q3 we have had new or increased stakes from: Senvent, State Street, Russell, Wells Fargo, Hussman and finally Jefferies taking an sizeable position in Call options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not a $700MM company. This is not the old GME where you simply buy and trade in videogames. It is very undervalued at current market price of $11\n\nI think GME has potential to be valued at $2-3bn valuation within 12 months ($32-47)\n\nWhen it finally appreciates in value after a few good quarterly earnings then there should be a slow squeeze. You have to be patient with this play. It will most likely take 6+ months until we see good Q4 and Q1 earnings to convince shorts to capitulate.",

Facebook (the site) itself has been viewed quite negatively by the younger generation, and it might go the way of MySpace, if there\u2019s a newer and cooler social media platform in town. Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest is a success and can be big for them, but the VR market is still very niche. \n\nAmazon has a ton of upsides, especially during and even after COVID, where everything will move towards online, everyone already knew. Despite how big Amazon is, eCommerce is still only 16% of retail sale, so there\u2019s still room. Cloud is booming, and AWS is still king.\n\nI am the most bullish on MSFT. They have a good mix of the old stuff that have been steadily making them money for decades and are still here to stay (Windows, Office/365, .NET, SQL, Xbox) and the cool new stuff that has a lot of growth potential (Azure/Cloud, Surface, GamePass, Teams). On top of that, their recent acquisitions have been doing a lot better than the failed ones in the past. I think MSFT is very solid, and they are one killer product away from taking over Apple as the #1 company in term of market cap, again.",

Normally this would be their worst earnings of the console cycle, but the last one had forced store closures.  I'm thinking we see better numbers this quarter. And better than worst will be a surprise.\n\nThat said, I've been saying for months that I expect the stock to drop on EPS posting for Decembers ER, but I expect a huge rally during the call.  They will absolutely talk about console presales and interest.  That itself is pretty bullish.  They're sold out of preorders and will continue to be even after the next batch drops.\n\nThis will also be a great time to talk about other activities.  Is Cohen taking an active roll in the turnaround?  He is still invested, so this is still very feasible, and an official announcement that he is actively involved would be good for at least +2-3 bucks tacked onto the stock price.\n\nTalking about continued increase in website sales and how people are responding to the massive improvements is also a likely topic.  If they don't bring up the MSFT deal, there will absolutely be questions from investors about it.  If they start forward guidance again, we could see crazy movement on that as well.\n\n\nFinally, and rather amusingly, a lack of console supply is actually bullish for GME.  People start selling used consoles to gamestop starting the day they release.  Why?  I can't fathom a legitimate reason for this, but it happens.  Super demand and no supply means people will pay new console prices for used consoles.  There will be a massive profit margin on these for gamestop, and even better, when the console is an XBox, that console starts generating passive revenue for them as well.",
