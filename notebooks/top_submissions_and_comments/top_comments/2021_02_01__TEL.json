These are counterfeit shares. It doesn\u2019t actually impact the stock price. It\u2019ll go back up. The stock is shorted over 100%.\n\n Neither the ITM calls from Friday nor the shorted stocks have even started to cover. Selling during a ladder attack is what they want. The only way GME actually goes down is from idiots selling during an artificial stock drop. \n\nDo whatever you want. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s illegal for people to tel you what to do.
