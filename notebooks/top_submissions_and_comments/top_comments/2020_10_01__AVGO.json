The company is expected to guide for Q1 revenues of $100.4 bln (-9.4% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q1 gross margins of 37.8% vs. 38.4% last year.       \n* The company has not missed EPS or revenues in the last several quarters. Apple performed well across its bevy of offerings in Q3. iPhone revenues +1.5% yr/yr to $26.4 bln vs $22.0 bln estimates; Services revenues +14.8% yr/yr to $13.2 bln vs $13 bln ests; iPad +22% yr/yr to $7.08 bln; Mac revs +31% yr/yr to $6.6 bln; Wearables +16% yr/yr to $6.6 bln. Apple is benefitting from the shift to at-home work/school, which has pushed people to buy new products, apps and services. The economic stimulus measures and the lifting of          stay-at-home restrictions were tailwinds in May and June.       \n* AAPL has a $1.94 trillion valuation and currently trades at 34 times FY20 earnings.       \n* Based on the weekly AAPL Weekly Oct30 $113 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of \\~5% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).       \n* Suppliers to keep on note include: **SWKS**, **CRUS**, **AVGO**, **QRVO**, **TSM**, and **QCOM**, among others (SMH); **SSNLF**, **LPL** (for displays) and **LITE**, FNSR and **IIVI** (for FaceID).",

        "body": "I have multiple brokerage accounts and I do have on for just investing in ETFs.  Keeping it simple is a pretty solid approach.  However, I'm not thrilled with your choices.  **VOO** and **QQQ** will have a lot of overlap, so you aren't diversifying as much as you might think. **QQQ** is a great ETF, but the underlying index it uses as a benchmark contains 100 stocks.  (The NASDAQ 100).  **VOO** uses the S&amp;P 500, so it obviously contains 500 stocks. Many of the top holdings are going to be the same in both of those ETFs: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. There are, of course, differences, as well.\n\nI also don't like your choice of **VYM** because of its poor return. It has a 10 year return on investment of just 115%, while VOO is double that and **QQQ** has a return of more than 4 times that of **VYM**. **VYM** will also hold many of the companies you are already investing in with **VOO**.\n\n**QQQ** has one of the highest returns of any ETF, but it is Tech-heavy, so there may be a bit more risk than **VOO**.  \n\nYou don't tell us your age, your financial goals and how averse you are to risk, but assuming you are reasonably young (more than 20 years away from retirement) and don't mind some risk, I might suggest a strategy more along the lines of:\n\n**QQQ**: 25%\n\n**VOO**: 25%   (with the understanding that there is some overlap. The blue chip stocks in VOO will help your portfolio to be a little less volatile than putting 50% into QQQ.)\n\n**SOXX:**  10% - iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF - this is a sector ETF that invests in companies that produce semi-conductors (and related companies). The top holdings of this ETF include Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Taiwan Semiconductor, Analog Devices and NXP Semiconductors.  The might be a little overlap with this one and QQQ, but there shouldn't be much.\n\n**ICLN:**  20% - ICLN is an ETF that invests in green/renewable energy. It is a passively managed index fund that uses the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index as its benchmark. Many of its holdings are outside the US.  (If you prefer a more US focused ETF that invests in renewable energy, consider QCLN instead, but be aware that its top holding is NIO, an electric vehicle maker based in China). \n\n**ARKK:**  10% - The ARK funds are actively managed and they invest in \"disruptive,\" innovative companies, many of which are in the tech sector.  Tesla is the top holding of this fund.\n\n**VXUS**: 10% - This is an investment that tracks the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the US. The fund tracks the FTSE all Cap ex US Index fund. Top holdings include Alibaba, Tencent Holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor (a little overlap with SOXX) Nestle, Roche Holding, SAP SE, Novartis, Toyota and ASML.  While the long term track record of this fund isn't great, the recent addition of Alibaba, Tencent and other companies signal a likely more profitable future.\n\nI think an approach like this will give you the additional diversity you are looking for and a more aggressive return than the choices you've made in your post. \n\n*I'm not a professional Financial advisor and I didn't sleep in a Holiday Inn Express last night. I do own shares in many of the funds I've listed above.*",

(27 years old, resident of Latvia, started investing into US stocks with Interactive Brokers)\n\nMy strategy was also pretty similar: part of portfolio in ETF (S&amp;P 500 ETF=VUSA) + blue chips from different sectors with few dividends, like you said  \"my own little \"ETF '. I like your picks, I started with few of them: MSFT, AAPL, NKE + many others like Google, Visa, Mastercard, Johnson&amp;Johnson, Activision Blizzard, Sony, and United Health.\n\nAfter 2 years I have pretty diversified by sectors (mostly Tech tho) portfolio of 23 stocks (75%) +  ETF VUSA (25%). Learned a lot of about stock market through this period of time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I'm still undecided on Intel, Broadcom, Brookfield Renewables, Bank of America, Next Era Energy, Duke, Southern, Welltower, Toronto Dominion and Caterpillar. \n\nI really like INTC (bought after the dip) currently my biggest position, also similar stock is Cisco (also good % of my portfolio) if you like some kind of undervalued stock. \n\nBroadcom might be good buy too. \n\nBrookfield Renewables - I have no idea, but I hold Renewable Energy Group (REGI) stock as my pick for that sector. \n\nBank of America - I like it, even tho I have bought JPMorgan instead but I believe they are pretty similar fundamentally +similar price graphic. \n\nNext Era Energy - was considered to buy, but price was always too high for me lol\n\nDuke, Southern, Welltower, Toronto Dominion - Have no idea.\n\nCaterpillar - was considered to buy year ago, but not anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;my strategy about 20% tech 20% real estate 15% consumer 10% Finance 10% healthcare 5% telecom, 10% utilities and 10% Industrials. \n\nThat's pretty solid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I also plan on buying some Polish dividend stocks since its my original currency :D \n\nLet me guess,  CDR is one of them? )) \n\n\\--------\n\nOne of the things I changed in my strategy after 2 years are dividend stocks. I used to super like them but after few researches/reads and comparing historical returns of VYM (dividend stocks index) vs S&amp;P500 returns I see lower profitability for the price of constant income (dividends) which I will reinvest back to the market. If you're 55+ years old then ofc you would prefer it vs growth.",

The market typically prices some additional variance into options for events like that, then the variance deflates when the event passes.
