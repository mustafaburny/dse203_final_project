Their market cap is less than this years revenue, and their last quarter was profitable. Share price of 6 something when it should be at least double. It\u2019s uplisting to the TSE is set for February 17th and I would recommend hopping onboard this choo choo train before it hits double digits. Institutional ownership sits at a mere 3.8%. Insiders have bought ~950K shares in the past 12 months and own ~12.3%. They haven\u2019t sold a single share and the biggest holder is the CEO at 8.13%. The company has made something like 17 acquisitions in North America since October 2017 and have plans to expand into Europe in the future. If you need any more convincing, go look at the list of their platinum sponsors for next weeks #ConvergeConnect21 conference.. You might recognize some of the companies: IBM, Redhat, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Dell, VMware, AWS, PureStorage, Cisco, and Snowflake. Lenovo and PaloAlto are two of the gold sponsors. Hewlett-Packard and Intel are two of the silver sponsors. This is a Constellation Software-like company in the making- MASSIVE. Their latest bought financing closed today fully subscribed for a mere 80+ million dollars. Guess what they plan to do with it that money- M&amp;A. Did I forget to mention that they are very likely to break a billion in revenue this year? Oh yeah and they\u2019re still on the venture exchange! \n\nTLDR: CTS.V - strong buy before Q4 earnings (don\u2019t know when they are), or at least before uplisting to TSE in mid Feb. Thank you.",

Basically it'a a binary stock - if they can figure out how to scale their solution and it works, the stock will 10x or 100x.  If they fail, then the stock goes to zero. They have been in R&amp;D for a while, it's an interesting speculative bet - I prefer PYR for safety since they are the technology company with the expertise that is doing the work for HPQ but also have many other patents and billion dollar industries they are going after so don't even need the battery technology to work out, one of their other opportunities can make them a multi bagger - plus they have revenue and profitability unlike HPQ Silicon.

The business had a run up then popped (looking at DDD and SSYS long term charts) since they couldn't scale it up enough to be consistently profitable. To date, many companies are developing industrial 3D printers, including HP Inc. the business overall is not yet cashflow positive. So if you are looking for pure plays then you should expect volatility.\n\nIn short, DDD, SSYS and HPQ are the ones that I can remember. Good luck.",

Market cap is very small, 1.5-2x sales, where most weed companies range between 5-10x sales. \n\nJust launched a new higher end craft brand \u2018Citizen Stash\u2019 online people have been giving it quite strong reviews. Head over to r/theOCS to check for yourself. Early stages and are very close to showing profit, but management is very solid, and their set up allows them to grow at a much quicker base than most growers, as they use licensed satellite growers almost on contract to grow their genetics. \n\nI could easily see this one 5-10x in the following year or two.\n\nHPQ/URAGF - HPQ Silicon Resources Inc.\n\nThis is one I\u2019m interested in opening a position on, but just dig into this weekend. They have a small facility where they have been testing a new extraction procedure for high quality silicon used in EV batteries and Solar panels. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, most other techniques are very expensive and difficult, where their new process is a single step and appears to be at a much cheaper rate. They\u2019re currently attempting to scale the process to a much larger production, and will be completing contracts for an unnamed EV company (I\u2019ve seen this posted as possibly being Renault/Nissan/Mitsubishi). Either way seems like a solid long term option that is producing something lots of these new Green Energy companies will need. I don\u2019t see this one flying off the shelf anytime very soon, but in the long run I\u2019m going to be looking to hold some.",

Had to get 20 stitches at my ER.\n\nSooo I remembered I had this shit called \"accident insurance\", an employee benefit i signed up for, which covers accidents outside of work. It's like $50 for the year. I had a surfing \"accident\" so I filed a claim. Ended up getting 2 and a half grand for it. Open laceration itself paid out 2 grand.\n\nThen  I get a check in the mail for 3 grand from my insurance company to pay my ER bill.\n\nBut I work at the hospital so I don't get billed for that shit. It's all free cause I'm an employee.\n\nSo breaking my nose was one of the best things to happen to me.",

For example you might pull a phone off someone in Iraq at a checkpoint, upload the data, find it has the phone number in the contact list for another phone that was used in a bombing.\n\nStuff like that. It's very useful and the government has tried to replace it _multiple times_ but their attempts are usually not as good and then their funding gets cut after paying hundreds of millions to government contractors.

From what I can guess, this $800 is a substantial portion of your income which makes investing more inherently risky, since you\u2019re putting a lot of your money into something that can lose value quite easily. If it\u2019s part of your retirement, it\u2019s still important to protect your nest egg but at least you know going in that any of the ups and downs of the market won\u2019t matter as much since you can\u2019t take any of it out u til you\u2019re 65+.",

Lot of them were in the millions and held lot of typical boomer stocks/bonds but there was this one particular account that caught our eye because he only had two holdings with one being AMZN. He held  1200~ or some shares with like a $1~ average per cost. When we checked his history man legit opened the account a month or two before the IPO and bought 100 shares and diamond handed(or forgot??). I don't work there anymore but I always wonder on random days if the guy ever checked his account or is even alive. Probably will give it to his son with a step up rule if I was him",
