This is absolutely an area of future growth that gamestop (/ ebgames) has ignored.\n\nhttps://www.mightyape.co.nz/computers/gaming-rigs-gear/gaming-pc/gaming-pcs?q=stock~instock\n\nStocking parts and selling retail isn't a direction I'd want the company to head in, those who build pc's piece by piece don't usually buy their parts from brick and mortar retailers, they research online, then purchase online.

        "body": "Converge Technology Solutions ($CTS.V) is not a penny stock but it might as well be. I have no clue what they do but their trading multiples make absolutely zero sense. Their market cap is less than this years revenue, and their last quarter was profitable. Share price of 6 something when it should be at least double. It\u2019s uplisting to the TSE is set for February 17th and I would recommend hopping onboard this choo choo train before it hits double digits. Institutional ownership sits at a mere 3.8%. Insiders have bought ~950K shares in the past 12 months and own ~12.3%. They haven\u2019t sold a single share and the biggest holder is the CEO at 8.13%. The company has made something like 17 acquisitions in North America since October 2017 and have plans to expand into Europe in the future. If you need any more convincing, go look at the list of their platinum sponsors for next weeks #ConvergeConnect21 conference.. You might recognize some of the companies: IBM, Redhat, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Dell, VMware, AWS, PureStorage, Cisco, and Snowflake. Lenovo and PaloAlto are two of the gold sponsors. Hewlett-Packard and Intel are two of the silver sponsors. This is a Constellation Software-like company in the making- MASSIVE. Their latest bought financing closed today fully subscribed for a mere 80+ million dollars. Guess what they plan to do with it that money- M&amp;A. Did I forget to mention that they are very likely to break a billion in revenue this year? Oh yeah and they\u2019re still on the venture exchange! \n\nTLDR: CTS.V - strong buy before Q4 earnings (don\u2019t know when they are), or at least before uplisting to TSE in mid Feb. Thank you.",

They disclosed they were paid to send samples to a major automotive company and they have at least 2 others that are under NDA.  Basically it'a a binary stock - if they can figure out how to scale their solution and it works, the stock will 10x or 100x.  If they fail, then the stock goes to zero. They have been in R&amp;D for a while, it's an interesting speculative bet - I prefer PYR for safety since they are the technology company with the expertise that is doing the work for HPQ but also have many other patents and billion dollar industries they are going after so don't even need the battery technology to work out, one of their other opportunities can make them a multi bagger - plus they have revenue and profitability unlike HPQ Silicon.

There are 3D printers that focus on personal design and consumption and there are ones for massive industry productions. I think you are talking about the industrial side which some reports cited 17 trillion TAM. \n\nIn the earlier years, the 3D printers focused on the personal side. The business had a run up then popped (looking at DDD and SSYS long term charts) since they couldn't scale it up enough to be consistently profitable. To date, many companies are developing industrial 3D printers, including HP Inc. the business overall is not yet cashflow positive. So if you are looking for pure plays then you should expect volatility.\n\nIn short, DDD, SSYS and HPQ are the ones that I can remember. Good luck.",

Couple I\u2019m holding are the following with my quick take;\n\nPTE - PolarityTE \n\nThese guys have a skin regeneration product/process where they take a small sample of the patients skin (unlike large skin grafts) create a product from it, which is then applied to the wound/burn which regrows the skin tissue. Tests have been very positive and success rate is very high. Will be looking to hold this one for a longer term with potential to 5x or more over the next year (I think it has a reasonably low risk of significant drops).\n\nEXP/EXPFF - Experion Holdings\n\nWeed stock that hasn\u2019t seen massive lifts yet. Market cap is very small, 1.5-2x sales, where most weed companies range between 5-10x sales. \n\nJust launched a new higher end craft brand \u2018Citizen Stash\u2019 online people have been giving it quite strong reviews. Head over to r/theOCS to check for yourself. Early stages and are very close to showing profit, but management is very solid, and their set up allows them to grow at a much quicker base than most growers, as they use licensed satellite growers almost on contract to grow their genetics. \n\nI could easily see this one 5-10x in the following year or two.\n\nHPQ/URAGF - HPQ Silicon Resources Inc.\n\nThis is one I\u2019m interested in opening a position on, but just dig into this weekend. They have a small facility where they have been testing a new extraction procedure for high quality silicon used in EV batteries and Solar panels. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, most other techniques are very expensive and difficult, where their new process is a single step and appears to be at a much cheaper rate. They\u2019re currently attempting to scale the process to a much larger production, and will be completing contracts for an unnamed EV company (I\u2019ve seen this posted as possibly being Renault/Nissan/Mitsubishi). Either way seems like a solid long term option that is producing something lots of these new Green Energy companies will need. I don\u2019t see this one flying off the shelf anytime very soon, but in the long run I\u2019m going to be looking to hold some.",

MSFT is pretty diverse and doesn't rely on personal data for the bulk of their income. HPE/HPQ seem to have been ignored compared to other hardware companies.

        "body": "For sure, there are tons with potential out there, but these are some i have or will be investing in. No major red flags from any that have stopped me so far. \n\nAs far as my positions to be transparent I bought into EXP at $.09 CAD, sold some on a quick run up to $.22 then rebought a larger position with some of my profit at $.16 CAD. Right now I think it\u2019s back around .17-.18. The US ticker is EXPFF\n\nPTE I FOMO\u2019d and bought in high, 1000 shares at $1.60 then we saw a fairly significant dump back down to $1.08 right now. This is one I have no issue holding, and am considering buying more to average down my cost a bit, but do really think it has major potential. I can\u2019t remember where and have no idea of the truth behind it so take this with a very small grain of salt, but I do remember reading somewhere that they were also looking at/working on regeneration of both muscle and bone as well (which would be a game changer if correct). Anyone can feel free to confirm or deny this, or if they\u2019re familiar with where I may have seen it please share the link. \n\nNo position in HPQ yet, but hoping to grab some on the TSX here in Canada since it\u2019s open. Only thing holding me back is keeping the cash for a YOLO quick \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 play, LoL. So far I\u2019ve had solid runs with CHEK (more than doubled - sold the majority of my position and kept a small amount long term). EXP where I just more than doubled, but have no increased my position. Then just this week with SENS which I have also sold 75% at double what I bought it at and kept 25% for long term.",
