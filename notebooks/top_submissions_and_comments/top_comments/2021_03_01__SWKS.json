I think we should expect some days of consolidation but expect now the bottom was in and, while not firmly over the 50 day, support around the 20SMA at circa 13100 or 13000 intraday on down day should hold.  I doubt we are going straight to brand news highs with a few weeks of bouncing around, albeit in a higher range.  I still don't know if end of quarter rebalancing is being done or will come later in the month.  That still could see some rotation and a little pull back but correction appears over, which is what is important.  \nOver the past year, the market has always seemed to tank when the fed talks, so I would watch the FOMC results.  Things are looking good technically.  I am really only in IBM, QCOM, SWKS and FB for teck, with the rest of my portfolio in energy and cyclical reopening's.",

        "body": "well, the Nasdaq closed just below the 100 SMA and that adds another negative to the bearish technicals. Doing this it broke throgh last thursdays low and made a complete engulfing reversal of Friday's gains.\n\nSo, charts would say watch out but I have some gut feelings: Although we did close lower than thursdays low, we are just below the 100 SMA and there is still a possibility that the index can demonstrate that this was a short term bottom, if it holds and bounces off somewhat.  \n\nOptimists would say yesterday could be establishing a second ST bottom test, even though we went through thursday's close but we did spend almost the entire day above.  I think we need to see a jump above thursdays close and hold or, at most, retest yesterdays close intraday, to get past this week.  \n\nWe did reach a full 10% correction on close but we actually touched 13% on Mondays low of 12397 and we bounced strongly off that. If I look at the intraday low monday and tuesday, they improved, inspite of the close.  \n\nIts amazing to see the Nasdaq crumble when the rest of the maket flies. I think this is the largest correction on record while the rest of the market has stabilized and gone higher.  A little pay back for outpacing the rest of the market last year. Still, growth is becoming realtively well priced to value and that rotation trade can easily rotate back in a moment. If you are a stock picker, I think you can begin to average in names that previously got away, like Qcom or SWKS or AAPL. They will look cheap based on next reported earnings and guidance which, finally, should become very optomistic based on the reopening. \n\nConclusion: Inconclusive, we need to see the index close above last thursdays low as a first step to recovery and not go back to the intraday lows of monday and yesterday before we get risk on.    13000 and 13200 now look like resistence so, if the index has put in a bottom, look for volatility to remain.  Wildcard remains rates stabilizing.  The index has probably absorebed rates of 1.5-1.6 but, if we get to 1.65 or 1.7 quickly, all bets are off. \n\nI am actually long the ndx at a loss, so I am in the wishful thinking camp that we have bottomed but, if I was not long, I would only trade it on an intraday basis until we get back quarter end or some of the technicals strengthen.  Bonds are oversold so a short term rally there would translate well for the Nasdaq.\n\nSo much depends on AAPL, GOOG, FB, AMZN.   Many Semi stocks and some fangs have seen 20% corrections\nWe are overdue for a few days relief rally before going back to test the bottom again.",

        "body": "Agree.   It's messy but many tech names now look like value plays did 3 months ago. Economic growth is good for Ford but it's going to be good for QCOM as well and SWKS and those companies have monster margins. And that is not considering the still coming 5G cycle and Semi chips going into everything.  The shortage is good for semi companies margins where they have a production pipeline.   \n\nExample: SWKS earned 3.36 last quarter.  With semi shortage and seeing as they are the only company that produces their own chips, they are selling out at prices set by them.  If, if SKWS maintains that earnings momentum and pulls out 12-14$ in 2021, the stock is selling for 12-15 earnings.  That does not look bad with their growth numbers in a supercycle economic boom compared to Banks at 12x earnings  \n\nSWKS is just an example but you get the picture.  If value keeps outpacing Tech, we will be looking at value fully valued and tech, with still higher growth, undervalued. \n\nFirst quarter earnings report could bring suprises and, finally, good guidance.  If things get cheaper or even bottom here, that sets up for a major rally post earnings, sometime in April.  \n\nStrat your shopping list now and average in, that my couch potato advice. \n\ndisclosure: I am long SWKS, QCOM and IBM and Apple Calls in TEch.",

Otherwise, with a 2-year time horizon, you don't time the market, you just get in and hold. I changed all my shares for leaps on Monday afternoon, so my timing worked out nicely. One of them is NXPI, which just got added to the S&amp;P since then. Lots of luck involved, but at the same time, when I bought the leaps, the premiums were ~25% of the share price, meaning I needed large and growing chipmakers to grow by 25% in 22 months to cover my premium. With the right timing (a gamble-y qualifier), that can be a serious no-brainer. \n\nNXPI: 20 Jan 2023 170c at 42.40 premium, and it hit 195 in AH following the S&amp;P announcement. \n\nMRVL: 20 Jan 2023 40c at 10.47 premium, and it's already back up over 47. \n\nSimilar, but not quite as awesome numbers for AMD, QRVO, SOXX, SWKS. My timing was good/lucky, but using the \"be greedy when others are fearful\" approach, with Monday's bloodbath following an already-brutal two weeks for tech, converting shares to leaps felt like the way to go, and it's going to pay off much more handsomely than had I just held.",

Short term: \nThey are sitting just above the 100 SMA and probably will follow the momentum in the rest of the market short term-could go either way!  Just to diversify, i would consider spreading out your investment between them and the Semi ETF-SMH, which has TSM along with others in it and consider QCOM or SWKS  \nLike  33% TSM or 50, 33% SMH and 33% Qcom or SWKS \n\nofcourse I like SWKS.

The basics of that game is the exact same as the stock market. Buy low, sell high, fuck the loan shark. Difference - you will lose real money, you might get arrested, and you could probably get mugged? \n\nI was always scared to jump in to the big leagues but after the first GME squeeze I decided why not throw fun money into stocks instead of busch light and other useless crap. So I started throwing money into stocks and busch light.\n\nJokes aside, I did quit drinking every night. Started working out. Got a damn haircut. Almost bought a bidet... but I'm an american who needs to see my waste on paper. I'm one line of stripper salt and a convertible Pontiac fiero away from doing this full time. Because of this great community.\n\nI've learned a lot over the last month or two. Not from the GME experts and emoji people, but from the OG's who have been to battle. GME will not last forever but that does not mean the money will dry up. Soak the useful info in. This is the difference between dying alone in your recliner while watching 'the office' reruns or dying at the ripe age of 85 in a horrific, power grid altering accident that involves your diamond encrusted lambo wrapped around a telephone pole. \n\nI fucking love you people. To Valhalla!\n\nTLDR: read first 6 paragraphs and then skip to the last line.",

Basically the most fabs have been out of game for advanced technology nodes. For example, TXN has some fabs, but they are old technology (still a descent market especially for analog chips). MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC. Samsung is still in the game and SMIC is trying to catch up. But basically TSM takes the majority of the market. \n\nDisclosure: I have been holding TSM for a couple of years. I personally prefer fab+fabless and I am a little bearish on US-based fab. But I am not an expert in the field.",
