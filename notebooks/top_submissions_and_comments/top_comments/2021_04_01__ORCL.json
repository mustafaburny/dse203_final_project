They've already won a couple of contracts with NHS trusts and the Department of Health and Social Care, and this is just an addition to 'Back Office Software' framework with 31 other companies like SAP, SopraSteria, Kainos, Oracle, Atos, Civica and Capita.  \n  \nMy understanding of the actual Palantir product is limited and I've not bought shares yet. Something around how very few people can actively articulate what the product does and how it's measurably better than anything else beyond looking nice worries me.

        "body": "To add what many have said, MSFT is probably one of the better priced tech stocks. That said, the tech sector is in a bubble and if they fall, they will all fall. Keep that in mind.\n\nOn a fundamental level, MSFT has some headwind. The shift to cloud applications is actually not good for MSFT which thrives on enterprise computing and windows software. A cloud based setup is a lot like the old mainframe and dummy terminal approach of old days and in this case, the mainframe is worldwide access. This inherently means that you can do without Windows Servers in a lot of use cases. What used to be a staple (domain controller + active directory etc) is no longer required and as applications move to the internet.\n\nInternet servers and services (cloud) are easier and cheaper to manage. This is the main threat to MSFT. I know plenty of companies that simply use Google applications instead of rolling out Office. I know some companies who no longer bother providing a PC for everyone. That was unheard of not that long ago. Though I dont think thats a major threat due to office's legacy dominance, it is an example of how a cloud based app can replace MSFT software. There used to be a time when Outlook was a staple, now I am not even sure who uses it any more.\n\nYes MSFT itself is a cloud player, but Google and Amazon ate a ton of market share and other companies are trying to muscle in especially overseas where they have sentiment from their governments.\n\nAll in all, I like MSFT. I think they will be fine and I am sure they will keep buying stuff to stay relevant. But its not all roses and they made bad decisions in the past and are almost always a little behind the pack on innovations (though not as bad as IBM or Oracle). Beware of sector valuations.",

Oracle was late to cloud (I think they may have barely just made it) and are infamous for their army of lawyers and salespeople to lock clients into contracts. \n\nI think long term the CSPs with low cost database options are going to make life difficult for Oracle and it\u2019s strategy of onerous contracts with fat margins will not work out. It will take a while to play out but it will happen this decade.\n\nTake this with a grain of salt though, sometimes working in the industry can be a detrimental bias.

However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.\n\nAh, ok, you're one of those technical analysis guys who thinks you can get rich quick off of reading charts / relying on what you think other market participants are going to do (rather than company / industry risk and cashflow fundamentals.....)\n\nBut your argument is (a) buy KHC because it's at ATH (buy high / sell low, I guess...) and (b) it's going to go up further because there are two material holders that are fairly well known to the mainstream (The Oracle and that guy from the Margot Robbie movie that taught you everything you needed to know about finance)? \n\nNot a super sound investment thesis IMO, when you consider the above + the national ketchup shortage that's dominating all major media outlets right now.\n\n\n&gt;I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me. If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up. If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up. Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.\n\nSo...first off, what article? Second of all, you're predicting KHC will continue to rise (which we've already established is at ATH) regardless of what the broader market does - so essentially a risk-free, perpetually appreciating asset, no matter what. \n\nGotcha - guess I better lever the fuck up on long dated ketchup futures in the meantime.",

Apple is famous for fraudulently pretending their software magically and suddenly doesn't work anymore.  And for allowing App Store vendors to kill off (aka steal) previously purchased software.  \n\nI'll give examples, but in exchange for the research work I want to be compensated in the form of replacement Apple hardware/software for each example.  It won't be cheap.\n\n\n&gt; For the rest most average customers don\u2019t care about repairing their phone or even notice the CPU slowdown.\n\nUh, everyone noticed it.  Apple had to do a big fake \"battery swap\" charade program to get around actually admitting and fixing it.\n\n&gt; I agree with your sentiment for the lost part but there\u2019s also the fact to be considered that Apple has the biggest moat of any company \n\n\"biggest moat of any company\"?

Before the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBC's chair essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBC's chief executive served as the deputy.

Even in the crypto sub reddits when btc hit $25k loads of people were screaming to get out - its gonna pop and go back to 10k.. and looks where that got them.\n\nOf course it'll end (i've been through 3 of them already in crypto).
