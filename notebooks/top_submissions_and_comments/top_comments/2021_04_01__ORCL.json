Oracle Cloud is a good ERP for large companies (I don\u2019t think it has as much market saturation though). It\u2019s database offerings, in addition, are essentially the only real alternatives to SQL Server. P/E is ~17. I bought that when they announced a dividend increase.\n\nI have some others I\u2019m less confident about. OI has a lot of debt that it seems to have managed (which in 2020 was not easy). LH and KT are both ones I have positions in. I think KT might turn into a long term play if it turns out to dominate the Korean market.",

        "body": "I agree the marketplace is a huge selling point. Here's a fast bear case.\n\n2020 was an election year, and by all rights probably the biggest ad spend in history for online campaign money. The tailwind in earnings Facebook picked up from that cannot be understated. Assuming $10/share earnings is \"the low end\" for Facebook is the only way they end up at a 30 P/E, which is an implied 3% return, unless they grow significantly into the future.\n\nI'm not convinced their meteoric rise in earnings is going to continue the next decade. Myspace was thought to be unstoppable at it's time in the limelight too, until it got face-checked into the history books. Maybe it's different this time, but these sorts of companies has a fragile side cheerleaders don't like to see. When they get unpopular, or something better comes along, the exodus can be very hard and fast.\n\nFacebook has been surviving by buying out all challengers. If they can keep that up, great. Microsoft (sort of) did over the years, but they got hit with Antitrust all the same and some competitors found holes and ate their lunch too (Amazon Cloud, Oracle Database Lawyers (tm), Zoom, etc. etc.)\n\nA lot of professionals I know won't touch Facebook (or Twitter, etc) simply because it's a bad career move. One mistake, unpopular opinion, bad remark after one too many cocktails, etc. can sink a career. It's just not worthwhile.\n\nSome past monopolies (Bell/AT&amp;T, Standard Oil are good examples) pulled a Terminator and re-morphed after being split up, because they had oligarchic qualities where each of the \"babies\" could sort of carve up a region and not compete with each other seriously. They waited it out and eventually just merged back into an oligarchy.\n\nFacebook is the AT&amp;T model, minus the regulation. Every user adds additional value to the system. Maybe it can be chopped up and survive, but it seems far-fetched to me. That's a very real risk.\n\nAs much hate as Microsoft got in the 90's, I would argue the disdain for monopoly is much more pronounced and organized today.\n\nAs for timing, Facebook is trading at all-time highs. I'm not sure \"deeply undervalued\" has a strong case, unless you are banking on $30/share earnings in 5-10 years from now.",

BGFV is one of these for me (OI, KT, VIAC are a few others). It\u2019s probably got 10-15% upside in the next few months based on my research, and some probably have a bit of a longer period of upward momentum. But the plan is to sell once they hit a specific price (usually that margin is a minimum of 20% upside of the purchase). \n\nAny disciplined approach needs to have a goal for the specific position, aside from MPT (which is just garbage anyway) so long term holds need to be understood within the context of evaluating the investments future periodically. This is essentially the same thing someone who trades on price trends will tell you, it\u2019s just that they work on must shorter time frames.\n\nThere are certainly alternative strategies, but I suspect people like Cathie Wood who buy on future promises will be as forgotten as the investors of the past who ignored things profitability and debt.",
