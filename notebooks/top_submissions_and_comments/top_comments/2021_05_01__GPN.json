It makes sense for them to use a pay.ent processor rather than dealing with each credit card company directly as they can both use their size to negotiate the best deal possible. \n\nIf AmEx isn't charging more than other cards anymore, then I'd guess that when the next contract comes up they might start seeing more acceptance from retailers, including Loblaws.",

Tesla is a growth company. A disruptive one at that. It is disrupting industries with an enormous total addressable market (several times that of Apple's TAM, for example).
