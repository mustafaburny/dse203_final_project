Apple engineers just designed a REALLY good chip using ARM license. They've been designing their own chips for a long time now so they have talent.\n\nARM by itself didn't provide some magical performance improvement. Look at Qualcomm and Samsung for a good example. Both use ARM to design their chips and they can barely compete with Apple's design.\n\nAMD also uses x86 and has designed chips that can compete with Apple's designs and beat some of Intel's chips too.

        "body": "I work with a lot of satellite signal equipment.\nThe biggest issue with trying to get lots of \"bandwidth\" within satellite services is water, we call it \"rain fade\". Basically, you can get better and more robust signal at lower frequencies, but have a less medium to work with when sending data through.\nAt higher frequencies, water (rain/clouds) tend to interfere with the signal, but you can push more data through. But it's not as reliable. If you're using Ka band, and it starts raining, you're SOL.\nSo it's generally a give and take. Usually the answer is a better modem, what basically translates your signal to usable data. Certain equipment allows for more efficient symbol translation (Qualcomm has a good handle on this). As well as finding the best band for the mission/task. Better transceivers and receivers help too ofc. But it's hard to package solid sat lock into a phone, I'm curious on how they got around it.\n\nAnyways, here's a good article: https://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/Satellite_frequency_bands\n\nYou can't get \"5G' from satellite, you can't even get half a mile with 5G telecommunication. \n\nBut there you go, a break down of satellite service providers.",

Both perform a quasi-utility function in their respective industries.\n\nCars will always be insurance totaled and salvaged for parts. Copart (and IAA to a lesser extent) have such a large moat of auction and salvage yards that few others can successfully penetrate the insurance-contracted businesses.\n\nEveryone, from Apple to Broadcom to Texas Instruments to Nvidia to Qualcomm making the chips that go into your fridge and car and [supercomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500), uses Cadence software for their chip business. Every layout and circuit guy is weaned by Cadence and will support their high margins for the rest of their work lives. SOXL is testament to Mr. Market's growing love for our technology-integrated future, running off their chips. With Cadence, you aren't picking a winner. Whoever wins, you win.",

Nvidia and AMD are decently positioned with their GPU technologies.  Intel is not in a great position.  Their present day bread and butter is x86 CPUs used in laptops, desktops, and servers.  \n\nHousehold purchase of desktop and laptop computers has declined precipitously in the last 10 years.  People are largely doing home computing on tablets and phones now.  Thats a huge chunk of lost Intel sales.  Additionally Apple is now producing laptops with ARM based CPUs further eroding Intel laptop sales in the remaining business market.\n\nIntel's final solid ground was the server market.  Except AMD is now eating their lunch with their Epyc CPUs at the high end, and now at the low end ARM based CPUs are entering the server market.  Cloud provider AWS introduced the ARM based Graviton CPU for value cloud computing.  MS cloud provider is using Qualcomm ARM CPUs as a new product for low end computing on Azure.\n\nSo all of Intel's cash cows are under heavy attack without a clear answer from Intel about where their future revenue is going to come from.",

        "body": "Yeah, FB is a great stock. I bought some back when it dipped to $257 per share, and it's a damn shame that I got out of it in the 280's and went into something else, because it's had a really nice run into the 350's. I would have been better off just holding FB the entire time.\n\nFB is certainly a wonderful stock to own, assuming you don't classify it almost as a \"sin\" stock like Phillip Morris or something. (Due to their heavy handed censorship and crowd psychology experiments)\n\nI find their censorship tactics annoying, and they do lots of shady things, but it's the business world, so what do you expect? Altruism? lol. So, I'm not too bothered.\n\nI want to get back into FB at some point, but I'm waiting on some sort of overall market correction. It's ran so much in the last couple of months, that I feel like I'd be buying back in at it's 2021 peak. Maybe around $320 ish, I could ease back in.\n\nRegarding whether Facebook is fashionable or not, I'm actually not making any personal judgement calls on that. It's not that I think it's unfashionable. I actually don't have much of a personal opinion on it. I barely use the service, but it's not for that reason. However, I have lots of friends and associates that were heavy users of the platform, and they have since departed the platform. (not talking about Trump supporters either)  Of course, that's just anecdotal evidence, but when you see enough of it, it does ring some alarm bells.\n\nAlso, anybody that buys a Quest 2 is required to sign up for a Facebook account. There are tons and tons of complaints from Quest 2 owners that would prefer not to be \"forced\" to sign up with a social media platform just to use a headset. However, for Facebook, it's a great strategy, because when your user numbers are starting to chip off, you can add a whole bunch of new users that are only signing up because they're forced to with an Oculus 2 headset.\n\nEven though many of these users will never use Facebook proper, it doesn't matter, because their numbers help make the ecosystem look healthier than it really is.\n\nI'm not trying to say Facebook is the next MySpace or anything like that. I'm just trying to point out, that there are plenty of thorns on this rose as well. We can't just totally ignore them.\n\nHowever, I'd like to get back to the original discussion on profiting in the VR and AR space. Those of us that know that VR and AR are going to be absolutely huge in the future, want to take advantage of this inside knowledge now, and invest in VR and AR companies that could really take off, when the general public at large is fully aware of all of this.\n\nSo, getting back to the idea of \"pure\" plays, are you aware of anything else that somebody should keep their eye on? I've done a fair amount of research on this topic, but there isn't a lot of obvious answers. There's a number of private companies that could become more interesting if they go public, but we can't really worry about them until that actually happens. If we want to stick with publicly traded companies, the ones that best fit the profile are Kopin Corporation, Microvision, Vuzix Corporation, eMagin Corporation, HTC, Snapchat.\n\nPersonally, I'd avoid HTC as their management is absolutely awful. I'm not very bullish on Snapchat either, but had to mention them, because they have longterm AR ambitions. I just think they'll be squashed by the true power players. Other stocks to consider that will benefit off a VR/AR revolution potentially is NVDA, AMD, QCOM, TSM (supposedly making some chips for Apple's upcoming VR HMD), Samsung, SONY.\n\nI'm always looking for some other stocks in this segment that I'm not currently aware of.",

I have not done any proper DD, but my next research will be about Qualcomm probably, Also, I recently bought Alibaba.",

If you exit, you may be buying share at a higher price. \n\nYou also need to have an exit strategy to control your downside risk.  I never understood averaging down (catching a falling knife).  If a stock goes down by 15%, I sell and watch.  I ask myself what did I miss?  If it starts behaving as my earlier analyses expected, I may buy back in.

Not long ago, AAPL was sub $100 pre split and everyone thought the iphone was done. That was another trade I made a ton of money on. I made money on QCOM, HLF, NCLH, VIAC, and so many others.
