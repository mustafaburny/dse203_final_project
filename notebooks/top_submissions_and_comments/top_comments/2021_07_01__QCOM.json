Apple engineers just designed a REALLY good chip using ARM license. They've been designing their own chips for a long time now so they have talent.\n\nARM by itself didn't provide some magical performance improvement. Look at Qualcomm and Samsung for a good example. Both use ARM to design their chips and they can barely compete with Apple's design.\n\nAMD also uses x86 and has designed chips that can compete with Apple's designs and beat some of Intel's chips too.

        "body": "I work with a lot of satellite signal equipment.\nThe biggest issue with trying to get lots of \"bandwidth\" within satellite services is water, we call it \"rain fade\". Basically, you can get better and more robust signal at lower frequencies, but have a less medium to work with when sending data through.\nAt higher frequencies, water (rain/clouds) tend to interfere with the signal, but you can push more data through. But it's not as reliable. If you're using Ka band, and it starts raining, you're SOL.\nSo it's generally a give and take. Usually the answer is a better modem, what basically translates your signal to usable data. Certain equipment allows for more efficient symbol translation (Qualcomm has a good handle on this). As well as finding the best band for the mission/task. Better transceivers and receivers help too ofc. But it's hard to package solid sat lock into a phone, I'm curious on how they got around it.\n\nAnyways, here's a good article: https://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/Satellite_frequency_bands\n\nYou can't get \"5G' from satellite, you can't even get half a mile with 5G telecommunication. \n\nBut there you go, a break down of satellite service providers.",

Nvidia GPUs are already the de-facto standard for datacenter machine learning applications, and if Nvidia were to own ARM, they could more tightly integrate both ARM CPUs and Nvidia GPUs, or combine the two on a high performance SoC, for much better performance.",

Nvidia and AMD are decently positioned with their GPU technologies.  Intel is not in a great position.  Their present day bread and butter is x86 CPUs used in laptops, desktops, and servers.  \n\nHousehold purchase of desktop and laptop computers has declined precipitously in the last 10 years.  People are largely doing home computing on tablets and phones now.  Thats a huge chunk of lost Intel sales.  Additionally Apple is now producing laptops with ARM based CPUs further eroding Intel laptop sales in the remaining business market.\n\nIntel's final solid ground was the server market.  Except AMD is now eating their lunch with their Epyc CPUs at the high end, and now at the low end ARM based CPUs are entering the server market.  Cloud provider AWS introduced the ARM based Graviton CPU for value cloud computing.  MS cloud provider is using Qualcomm ARM CPUs as a new product for low end computing on Azure.\n\nSo all of Intel's cash cows are under heavy attack without a clear answer from Intel about where their future revenue is going to come from.",

        "body": "Yeah, FB is a great stock. I bought some back when it dipped to $257 per share, and it's a damn shame that I got out of it in the 280's and went into something else, because it's had a really nice run into the 350's. I would have been better off just holding FB the entire time.\n\nFB is certainly a wonderful stock to own, assuming you don't classify it almost as a \"sin\" stock like Phillip Morris or something. (Due to their heavy handed censorship and crowd psychology experiments)\n\nI find their censorship tactics annoying, and they do lots of shady things, but it's the business world, so what do you expect? Altruism? lol. So, I'm not too bothered.\n\nI want to get back into FB at some point, but I'm waiting on some sort of overall market correction. It's ran so much in the last couple of months, that I feel like I'd be buying back in at it's 2021 peak. Maybe around $320 ish, I could ease back in.\n\nRegarding whether Facebook is fashionable or not, I'm actually not making any personal judgement calls on that. It's not that I think it's unfashionable. I actually don't have much of a personal opinion on it. I barely use the service, but it's not for that reason. However, I have lots of friends and associates that were heavy users of the platform, and they have since departed the platform. (not talking about Trump supporters either)  Of course, that's just anecdotal evidence, but when you see enough of it, it does ring some alarm bells.\n\nAlso, anybody that buys a Quest 2 is required to sign up for a Facebook account. There are tons and tons of complaints from Quest 2 owners that would prefer not to be \"forced\" to sign up with a social media platform just to use a headset. However, for Facebook, it's a great strategy, because when your user numbers are starting to chip off, you can add a whole bunch of new users that are only signing up because they're forced to with an Oculus 2 headset.\n\nEven though many of these users will never use Facebook proper, it doesn't matter, because their numbers help make the ecosystem look healthier than it really is.\n\nI'm not trying to say Facebook is the next MySpace or anything like that. I'm just trying to point out, that there are plenty of thorns on this rose as well. We can't just totally ignore them.\n\nHowever, I'd like to get back to the original discussion on profiting in the VR and AR space. Those of us that know that VR and AR are going to be absolutely huge in the future, want to take advantage of this inside knowledge now, and invest in VR and AR companies that could really take off, when the general public at large is fully aware of all of this.\n\nSo, getting back to the idea of \"pure\" plays, are you aware of anything else that somebody should keep their eye on? I've done a fair amount of research on this topic, but there isn't a lot of obvious answers. There's a number of private companies that could become more interesting if they go public, but we can't really worry about them until that actually happens. If we want to stick with publicly traded companies, the ones that best fit the profile are Kopin Corporation, Microvision, Vuzix Corporation, eMagin Corporation, HTC, Snapchat.\n\nPersonally, I'd avoid HTC as their management is absolutely awful. I'm not very bullish on Snapchat either, but had to mention them, because they have longterm AR ambitions. I just think they'll be squashed by the true power players. Other stocks to consider that will benefit off a VR/AR revolution potentially is NVDA, AMD, QCOM, TSM (supposedly making some chips for Apple's upcoming VR HMD), Samsung, SONY.\n\nI'm always looking for some other stocks in this segment that I'm not currently aware of.",

        "body": "I totally recommend leaps options.\n\nFirstly, I made most of my money from leaps.\nShare price rises by 25%, my options will have at least 50% profit margin.\n\nSecondly, my holding timeline for stocks is usually 6-12 months. So leaps is great for me \nFor my kids, I will buy stocks as I am leaving it for them for the next 15-20 years.\n\nLastly, don't think u can use margin on options so it prevents me from over leveraging.\n\nPS. I usually sell my options once it get 50% profit margin and move on. Reason is that for me to get 100% profit on options, I will need the stock to rise at least 40-50% which is not really realistic, especially when I have time decay playing against me.\n\nI also buy leaps options on solid companies like Google, amazon, xlnx, baba, jd, Shopify, ttd, crm......etc\nI try not to play with meme stocks or companies that do not show at least 4 quarters of profitability.\n\nBest of luck!",

These companies tend to rise slowly and steadily with time, so your longer expiration will give it time to play the senerio out \n\nA 10% rise in stock price will usually translate to a 20% options gain for u. And a 30% stick price increase will translate to a 50% gain for u.\n\nTry to avoid meme stocks and new spac companies and volatile companies as their sudden movement downwards will mean much greater depreciation for your options also. Example, a 30% drop in share price will translate to a 50% drop in your options price.\n\nEvery leaps options I have bought till now will be profitable some point in time. U just need to prevent greed and exit accordingly.\nSuggestion is to exit around the 50% profit mark or when the option is near the half way mark. Reason is that there is time decay associated with call options, so keeping it to expiry or keeping it too long is disadvantageous to you.\n\nBest of luck!",
