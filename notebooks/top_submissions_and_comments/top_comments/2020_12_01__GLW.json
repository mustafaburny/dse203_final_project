That money was all largely wasted. Now they can just sit at home and do the same thing. \n\nDoes your local Coffee shop failing matter? No, it wasn't the economy, and if you lose 10% of this completely arbitrary notion of value, where nothing is made better by it (unlike building a faster microchip) it is irrelevant especially if that money is then spent on a company that down the line is funding novel R+D, which the likes of all the big tech companies are. \n\nA $5 for Amazon, Apple, Google, is doing far more work in the economy over the long term than $5 to to Starbucks. Whether the populace of the country ever see the monetary gains of the FAANG $5 is a different question, but they at least will see the technological progress. \n\nThe reality is your local family own store is inefficient and its failure assuming the same products are available (i.e. any online retailer) is just economic efficiency.",

        "body": "ASML sells a very important piece of equipment to the semiconductor manufacturers, but definitely not the only piece of the puzzle.  They are a monopoly in leading edge lithography (especially EUV), but lithography is only 10% of the manufacturing process (but 20% of the costs because of that monopoly bit)\n\nThe process for manufacturing a microchip at the leading edge is mind boggling.  I remember seeing an old Intel process flow and there was about 600 process steps spanning across likely 100 different tools.  I haven't seen a flow for the latest nodes, these are fiercely guarded secrets that could have geopolitical ramifications, but I would assume there are well over a thousand steps now.  A leading edge fab will have thousands of tools all integrated into the most efficient manufacturing process in the world.\n\nI am not an expert, but I believe the foundry model works like this. \n\n1) foundry such as TSMC or Samsung build R&amp;D line to develop N+1 node (such as 3nm). The equipment likely costs a couple billion.  Thousands of engineers work to develop a process flow that meets customer expected specs and yield. This step happens ~3 years before commercial release.  Usually developed in close collaboration with key customers such as apple or qualcomm.\n\n2) pilot line created to ensure that process flow can enter into HVM (high volume manufacturing). I believe this is the step where the foundries work on the layout and efficiencies.  This is also a couple billion in equipment, but will utilize some equipment from step 1.\n\n3) HVM line is built to meet demand.  For TSMC and Samsung, this means $10B+ in equipment alone.  Then you need the thousands of trained engineers to run the fabs.  \n\nFor this model to work, TSMC will then need to have a long tail of customers that will use these nodes after the leading edge customers such as Apple move on.",

Thinking that profitability would prop up companies in the event of a crash.  I also wanted to get into the new-fangled flat panel display market because I figured that they were going to be the next big thing.  Bought a canadian company called Genesis Microchip (GNSS) that met all of my criteria.\n\nEverything played out exactly how I expected it.  Market crashed, genesis didn\u2019t go down as much, flat panels took off.  But didnt really make any money on that trade.  If I had just bought the obvious winners I would probably have millions.  Hundreds of thousands at least.  Lesson learned: don\u2019t overthink it.  Don\u2019t try to chase P/E ratios and value in tech.  Look 10 years forward with the companies you buy.",

        "body": "Exactly!!! \n\nAlso the virus cannot survive in low temperatures. Not only that, no one is paying attention,  we're already close to herd immunization. Yes \"cases\" are skyrocketing which is a sign of herd immunization in combination with the lowest death tolls since the pandemic began. The virus has already killed as many baby boomers (the last remaining Great Depressioners have a far HIGHER rate of survivability than their successors the Baby Boomers!), morbidly obese and individuals with underlying health issues (not being mean...its just facts...survival of the fittest), also a greater portion of our population seems to either be immune or Asymptomatic, so the super spreaders did what both nature and immunization intended for them to do. \n\nYes the fear of the yearly \"flu\" is a concern for everyone...but if you take the time to actually look at the virus this last strain evolution is so similar to the flu virus itself but on a far higher level and it seems to not allow any other virus to infect a person unless it was already there, so the flu shouldn't really be concern. \n\nIf 1/2 the nation is hit with a snow front, shutting down airlines and travel impaction rendering the majority of citizens to remain home for 4 days or more....we effectively reduce this virus in the US Nation to low double digits to even  possibly single digits. \n\nI'm all for the vaccine in terms of gaining me a stupid amount of money and potentially making me rich and to allow us to return to some form of normality....but honestly they waited too long and I believe there is some shady in the shadows type of stuff that's not being addressed with the production of the vaccine and I'm not talking about the microchip conspiracy theories. \nNot really any trial runs, testings, etc...and then boom massive productions. \n\nCoronavirus is a new strain of the Sars virus.  It's a Sars virus that took on a new viral evolutionary path, but still holds Sars DNA. \nWhen china had that massive Sars outbreak years ago and it traveled to the US and affected many, many produced an immunity from being infected and others created another form of immunity (Asymptomatic), which would explain why so many hold those categories for this \"brand new virus\". \nSo we already had things to combat Sars after that very first introduction to it and we even incorporated it into the flu shot (just read what's in your yearly flu shot....it has the Sars vaccine in it...)\nI've never trusted Big Pharma since Obama sold us out to them and let them become a massive greedy overlord. We have 3 virus warehouses in the US, one of them right in here in my state of VA....they've already had a \"cure\" or rather vaccination for it, they knew that the virus would take out the weaker of the populace (population control), stifle the economy for a stronger reset, distract everyone from the issues that are happening over in the Middle East/Saudia Arabia (oil fields, we secured so many by answering the call of the King/prince of Saudia Arabia and defending his oil fields, giving us a massive amount as thanks and by demanding that he will ONLY trade in USD for his oil) as well as other things that not just our country has been doing but other countries sealing positions of power. \n\nWhy did Gyms of all places close down!? The place you go to get into shape? Getting in shape...shit just working out consistently improves your immune system. Not a single case of the virus has been reported from a gym....\n\nBut Liquor stores and convenience stores were allowed to remain open. \nSchools closed down...but...day cares were allowed open? \nGrocery stores were allowed open, which stimulated the retail market in profits of never before seen potential due to panic buying. \n\nThis was all a major reset, eventually leading to a change in power structure and allowing \"new\" money (potentially you, me, wsb) to enter the fray and potentially become new millionaires &amp; multimillionaires and putting \"old\" money at a cautious gaze. Baby boomers removed a massive portion of not ALL of their monies from the banking systems and from the Market!!! Allowing us to enter in and take hold of what they covetted (creation of new gods to challenge the old gods, sorry was watching 'American Gods'). \n\nAnd when everything is starting to settle...now we have a vaccine! Lol \nEvery vaccine has a small portion of the virus it protects against, I honestly feel that any baby boomer or anyone with a compromised immune system that takes the virus will probably die from it..not immediately but possibly 5yrs (again I can be horribly wrong), this vaccine is probably going to become mandatory nationwide. Seeing as it will put jobs at a dilemma with an employee that refuses to take it and other employees are afraid of becoming infected (even though they took the vaccine...smh), which would allow them to terminate that employee without any lawful action to be taken against them...\n\nThere's so many plays that are happening and will continue to happen. Part of me is actually seeing this as an opening for my/younger generations and a force out of older generations. An exchange of power and a reconstruction of our economic system and the flow of both finances and cash. \nThe housing market changed rapidly with rates so excessively low, mimicking the 2008 market crash as well as the 2000 dot.com bubble crash. \nBut look who is infiltrating and starting to control these businesses? \n\nTldr; Too many variables, too many possibilities....the virus is dying out by itself. Its ran its course and it starting to get really cold and its own survivability rate is dropping rapidly.",
