It will continue to gap up, might dip a little but will definitely move on up.  I sold Thursday because I was over 100% profit, (8,379 shares in @.179 sold @ .36)and figured it would drop when people realised it was old news.  I will be buying back in.",

        "body": "The news catalyst wasn't game breaking. It was a mere splash in the water. ZOM has been working with QRVO for years. The technology and platform they're using has been in the pipeline since 2018.\n\n&gt;ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\u00a0[Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BNoKmDqBUI458HpCUH4bxzhaWhwbD7MXispL1rbkS724nmPs8ySLIVPxicMmv7sDwJhvfIvFza6OcvxJmZH3vxG9dH9p4GTBHw9PQYhUHdw=)\u00a0(NYSE  American: ZOM) (TSX-V: ZOM), a veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical  company,\u00a0today announced it has entered into a development and supply  agreement with Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC (Qorvo), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Qorvo, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRVO) focused on bringing its  piezo-electric Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) sensor to the veterinary health  sector. Under the terms of this agreement, Zomedica has exclusive,  global rights to develop and market Qorvo's investigational  point-of-care diagnostic platform for veterinary use.\n\nReading their current press release didn't offer much. It sounds like they completed and verified their first assay of 5 which they intended to conduct. I'm not sure what they need to do to have the assay validated or approved (FDA?) but that's still in the works. They note those works are HINDERED due to the current environment.\n\n&gt;Upon completion of verification testing, the Company expects to  commence the validation of each assay and to initiate a parallel pilot  program focused on optimizing the customer experience. Assuming  successful completion of this verification and development work,  Zomedica intends to commence commercialization of all five initial  assays in select strategic markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As previously reported by the Company, the novel coronavirus, or  COVID-19, pandemic has impacted the Company\u2019s expected timing for the  completion of the development and the initiation of the  commercialization of the TRUFORMA\u2122 platform and the five initial assays.  Once our development partner, validation participants and potential  customers are able to return to normal operating procedures, we will  assess the impact of the pandemic and update our expected timing  accordingly.\n\nI dont remember what the financials showed and the news catalyst leading to an increase was reasonable, but pretending it should have pushed any farther had people not been traumatized is hilarious. The stock was overvalued all things considered, hence the correction. I liked ZOM but my own DD turned me away which sucks, looks like it could have been good for 30-40% conservatively. Hopefully everyone made some money and learned their lesson ;) Which now extends to UAVS/MVIS/ZOM. Ha\n\n&gt;**The Covid 19 Form 8-K provides disclosure of the impact of  the pandemic on the expected timing, and indicates that we will not be  able to achieve the timeframes we had previously anticipated. The Covid  19 Form 8-K also supplements the risk factors disclosed in the Annual  Report, to add three new risk factors related to the pandemic.** Reference is made to the Covid 19 Form 8-K for additional information.The Company also today announce that, as disclosed in its Current  Report on Form 8-K filed with the\u00a0SECon\u00a0April 13, 2020\u00a0(the \u201cNYSEA Form  8-K\u201d), it has received formal notice from the NYSE American it is not in  compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standard set forth  in section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide because its  common shares have been selling for a substantial period of time at a  low price per share. As disclosed in the NYSEA Form 8-K, the Company  intends to regain compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing  standards by undertaking a measure or measures that are for the best  interests of the Company and its shareholders.",
