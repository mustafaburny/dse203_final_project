And now they are receiving unemployment which will prop them up for a few months.\n\nI'd say a plurality, not an overwhelming majority. [Did you look at the per-sector numbers in the ADP report](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/adp-private-payrolls-april-2020-drop-by-record-20point2-million.html)? The hospitality sector wasn't even half of the 20.2 million job losses.\n\n&gt; Trade, transportation and utilities was the next hardest-hit sector, losing 3.44 million, while construction dropped 2.48 million. **Other big losses came in manufacturing (1.67 million)**, the other services category (1.3 million), and **professional and business services (1.17 million)**. Health care and social assistance plunged by 999,000, **information services fell by 309,000** and **financial services had 216,000 layoffs.**\n\nRecord-breaking losses in industries that are not low-wage. \n\nFurthermore, that isn't the whole story. My cushy 6 figure job that lets me furnish every one of my downtown penthouse apartments with matching $4k exercise bikes for my wife and I is paid for by low-wage workers buying the crap my employer sells them. Low wage workers are getting shit on now though, so I'm going to hold off on buying bikes for my wife's boyfriend. My spending is through the floor right now and I don't care how open shit gets, it's not going up until I'm confident my employer is in the clear.",

And I wasn't going by total workforce (including those available for work) since the ADP private payrolls number isn't talking about total unemployment, but a reduction of payrolls. Since CES is a survey of businesses regarding payrolls, it's a better apples to apples comparison than using the CPS, which is surveying households and how they measure the unemployment rate.

        "body": "I think you're right that unemployment payments are going to be a much bigger gap-filler than most people believe. That $600/week is a massive stimulus. If we'd had that in 2008 the recovery might not have been so lethargic, and so slow to benefit the middle and lower class. If the proposed $2k/week to everyone were to pass (it won't) I'd become the biggest, Chaddiest bull this sub had ever seen.\n\nHowever, you're very wrong that \"jobs that actually matter are hardly affected.\" [Did you look at the per-sector numbers in the ADP report](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/adp-private-payrolls-april-2020-drop-by-record-20point2-million.html)? The hospitality sector wasn't even half of the 20.2 million job losses.\n\n&gt; Trade, transportation and utilities was the next hardest-hit sector, losing 3.44 million, while construction dropped 2.48 million. **Other big losses came in manufacturing (1.67 million)**, the other services category (1.3 million), and **professional and business services (1.17 million)**. Health care and social assistance plunged by 999,000, **information services fell by 309,000** and **financial services had 216,000 layoffs.**\n\nTo put that in context the manufacturing job losses *alone* are double the largest month of total job losses in history (834k in 2009). Many of those other sectors are white collar office worker jobs, and they are also crushing the total job loss number record.\n\n&gt; The people that are unemployed right now are people who could just as easily be replaced with a machine or a monkey. People who stand at a register and scan items. They are the lifeblood of a dead and bloated retail world and the coronavirus is the bullet to the brain to put this beast out of its misery. The market goes up when the dead weight companies go under\n\nLayoffs aren't limited to retail as evidenced by the ADP reports. And this administration and the Fed's printers aren't going to let dead companies go under no matter how much they deserve to. \n\nNow, the effect any form of economic armageddon has on the market is anyone's guess. They're loosely correlated at best and the Fed is doing its best to destroy any sort of price discovery.",
