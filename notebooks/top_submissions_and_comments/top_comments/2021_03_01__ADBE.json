They\u2019re not crashing or going out of business.\n\nThis is large institutions rearranging portfolios and hesitating what to do with the bond yields increasing. \n\nWhich, by the way are so fucking low it shouldn\u2019t even register on the stock market. \n\nThis is the dip that people tell you to buy. \n\nThis is when you clench your anus and buy MSFT and ADBE and uninstall your app for the rest of the year. \n\nEV? Well, that was so highly valued that a correction was needed. I\u2019d be more careful there, it big tech just went on sale again.\n\nEdit: Yes I am old as fuck at 44.

The recent uplift in price, although the market as a whole went up, leaves not much room. Nonetheless, the pe\u2019s of adobe have always been high and they were always able to reach the expected earnings growth. Revenue growth is consistent and forecasted to be in the 15-25% yoy range. Creative Cloud has now 22m users growth of 85% in 3y time. \n\nFurthermore, the retention and stickyness of adobe is high. Its products are preferred by many of its users due to its great integration reflecting in higher price premia. However, I do believe they already monetize their current products at a maximum and don\u2019t see other products in the pipe that significantly would contribute to revenue. They can do M&amp;A and grow their portfolio or keep their product offering in line with client expectations. However, this will not move the needle in terms of revenue and is not a value play. \n\nFrom my perspective, what would be interesting is to deep dive on the competitive landscape and pricing, growth markets (Asia, S-Am, Africa), industry (market potential) and M&amp;A history and succes rate. The moat of Adobe has been there for many years and shift to Creative Cloud/Product packaging has succesfully been implemented. \n\nHere future value/price is driven by revenye growth. Risk is that focussing on existing products in a stagnant market with new international competitors slowly entering might be value destroyer. Main question for a leadership player is: Will its market grow (focus is on US/Europe now) and can it diversify at similar margins (other business segments)?\n\nAs a growth stock I find the rating fitting, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a mispriced stock.",

Their support was horrible before they went SaaS and their model for supporting people didn't change at all, they just hired more people and it is obvious. \n\nSaaS companies that start off as SaaS usually focus on their support and grow their product because you cannot bee good support and that is really what you are paying for in a subscription. It is the only immediately realized consumer value to a subscription. SaaS companies that moved to SaaS and did very poorly in that transition (Adobe for example) saw dollar signs and tried to make it all about the software. They have many confusing log on portals, their licensing is needlessly complicated (Looking at you too Microsoft), their software plug ins to get you to \"migrate to Adobe Creative Cloud\" for their old permanent licenses are crooked and questionably legal as you can accidentally break your creative suite and support will give you the run around for hours before grudgingly sending you to the link that has the fix for it (they know about it and have a download that automates the fix), their software was broken for over 9 months after the update to Catalina killed the 32 bit platform and both Apple and Adobe just pointed fingers at eachother while everyone's shit was broken before Adobe grudgingly fixed it taking its sweet time while designers lost millions in downtime, their doftware package deployment and simple processes like downloading the software were unreliable for months, you still can't deploy Adobe Software with Mac management software on iMac labs, Adobe will sell you licenses that are EOL in a month and won't tell you that you now need to convert them so when you go to deploy and it fails you must spend the customary 2 hours on hold before talking to support to get the answer you need which is...\"oh yeah those are no longer valid but you can convert them\".\n\nI am sorry, I just don't see anything about Adobe being a good company.

So i think if they really kill it and take over with their software, which is possible with their huge moat and advanced software, I like to think they could be worth that big. So a 10 bagger. Bad comparison but I'm waiting 10 years to find out.",

If there was an actual offline mode, where we didn't have to upload our image to their servers, it would drastically cut their costs. That's supposedly what this is all about.
