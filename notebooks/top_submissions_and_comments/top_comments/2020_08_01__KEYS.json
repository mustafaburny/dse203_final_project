The public key is a string of letters and numbers you use in sending BTC units to the wallet, the one that's OK to share in public like an email address (though anyone can look up that address and see how much BTC is in it).  The private key is composed of the 'seed words' and should be hidden, as it grants access to the BTC in the wallet.  From what I understand, the more seed words involved makes the encryption harder to crack.  And people come up with creative ways to hide the private keys, like engraving or splitting up the list, or even memorizing it.",

Jump into the new stuff don\u2019t even think about it just learn as you go. IMO there\u2019s more opportunity in Cryptocurrency than Stocks and I personally think it\u2019s more fun and a 24 hour market and can be done entirely on your phone if you want and buying in is so cheap right now, like pennies to invest in good tokens. If you don\u2019t believe me check out AERGO, a Token that has more impressive partnerships than hundreds of thousands of companies in the stock market. I don\u2019t think that dropping money into an index fund is a BAD idea, but IMO it\u2019s more of an 80s-2010s idea that isn\u2019t going to be as successful when the market is so disconnected from the realities facing America at the moment. I would HIGHLY recommend \u201cHow to Make Money in Stocks\u201d by William ONeil; the founder of Investor Business Daily. His strategies helped me make money in crypto this month in particular.

        "body": "This will inevitably get downvoted but I don't care. My dad and I run a little family hedge fund of sorts. I can't make as much as him because I simply don't have the same amount, but I'm up 13% this year and it's my first year investing. (I had shit mutual funds until I woke up this year, after realizing that the work I was doing with my dad could be done with my own money too.)\n\nMy dad, however, has turned $170,000 into nearly half a million since this past September, using short options strategies. The idiots on WSB can't accept the truth of the matter, but it's the people selling options that are making all the money. Along with my help, he's developed a strategy of shorting options right ATM, usually covered calls and usually on earnings. HE collects fat premiums, and either gets assigned or doesn't. If not assigned, he just keeps selling calls and might even run the price up a bit for a swing trade esque profit.\n\nThat's in addition to his long accounts that he doesn't touch, in which he's up over 10x since 2010. u/SugarAdamAli has a pretty good list, but I'd add AMD, Facebook, NVDA, and V. AMD especially is going to the moon. Lisa Su is a straight up generational genius and is poised to start eating market share that's incredibly valuable and highly up for grabs. Overall, I think Amazon is the best stock in the world right now though.\n\nWhat I don't agree with u/SugarAdamAli on is that the key is the price. Wrong. There are many keys, and the price is just one of them. If it was all about the price then any company with a high P/E and at an ATH wouldn't be worth buying. AMD has both, and I think is still undervalued. (AMD will be at 500 before 2030, and I think that's conservative.) If there's any 'key,' it's buying good companies and doing it with concentrated amounts.\n\nAlso, diversification is a term that's been beaten to death and people don't understand it anymore. You don't get rich by buying 500 companies which includes Macy's for Christ's sakes. Depending on how much money you have, you buy 10-20 all star companies and keep tabs on their progress.\n\nThe options strategy is another ballgame. There are many ways of approaching it. The best way to sum it up in a few words (even though I could write a book on it, because most people clearly don't understand how and when to use it) is that you never write on companies you wouldn't mind owning. That's a lot different than going straight up long, since going long you only want the companies you have conviction in, the ones you think are going to the moon. With options, I'd write, say, a short ATM put against SBUX, because they're a great company with a solid stock and on an earnings week the premiums will be solid. Oh, and also, you write weeklies. People writing anything longer dated can't do math, and apparently that's most people.",

        "body": "Because for everything that resulted in a 1,000% gain there are so many that result in losses. No one had any idea $TSLA was going to octuple in like three years. It was absurd to think it at the time, and it's absurd now. Sustainable, repeatable, consistent gains are the only way to become wealthy.\n\nThe thing about the Bitcoin hard drive sucks. That is a huge problem with cryptocurrency. I read somewhere that 1/5 of all BTC is completely unusable due to lost keys and hard drives. Nevertheless I recognize that feeling of loss.\n\nThe important thing is you learn from \"mistakes\" and you can't let FOHMO (fear of having missed out) cause you take on undue risk in future trades. There was some guy on r/wallstreetbets that got his account from $10,000 to $700,000 and then lost it all.\n\nYou'll get there - it's hard to feel that way. It happens to all of us. \"I was looking at that stock, I should've bought it instead of what I bought\" or \"I should've put some money into $TSLA calls, it was going up, everyone said it was going to the moon.\" But you can't kick yourself over that stuff. Because remember, for every buyer there is a seller. And the guy who paid $2,000+ for $TSLA today because he had the same dollar signs in his eyes, he's got a shot of that stock going either way. Only time will tell how sustainable this rally is and just how much of these new gains the stock is going to be able to consolidate.",

The vault was probably the oldest part of the building and had these storage \u201clockers\u201d which we didn\u2019t have the keys for.  One day we received notice that some guy had wanted to reclaim a 672 oz stash of silver held in one of the lockers.  He provided paperwork from the early 80\u2019s and once we confirmed ownership, we called in a locksmith to drill the lock.  It was a huge \u201cloaf\u201d of silver, all one piece and very rough from the smelting process.  It had tarnish all over it from sitting in a vault for 30 or so years and had the weight stamped in it.

        "body": "Decentralization is the state of having as little of an oversight as possible. The core of the fiscal centralization in this case is very low but the algorithm itself is a form of centralization; to produce a bitcoin however you do need some kind of centralizing algorithm otherwise mining wouldn't work, you couldn't buy or sell anything with it, and it would effectively be an infinite resource. \n\nBasically it works like this: In order to play any game with another person you need some form of central rule. Yes, the rules can be extremely tight (Chess) or extremely lax (Your common MMO build variety including horrible ideas and combinations), but the rules must be there. Bitcoin is as decentralized as it likely can get, albeit if you further the onlook, a mining farm, BTC exchanges, etc. are all forms of centralization. \n\nThe decentralization however does indeed force it into a fiat state. It's an ironic bid; if you and I agree that a BTC is worth *N* then that's one thing but if you and I can exchange it, publicly, with a great portion of the world agreeing that BTC is worth *N* then it has to have some form of intermediary to work that out and generate a consensus. The intrinsic value of a BTC would be, theoretically, whatever electricity it required, in a purely decentralized state without farms, exchanges, or other production and distribution elements. \n\n&gt;BTC is a scarce, fixed supply asset. Only 21M will ever come into existence; this will not/cannot change. Supply cannot be inflated; it\u2019s a non correlated, deflationary store of value.\n\nSo this is not correct. The fact that it is scare (artificially) should not be mistaken for it being *valuable*. First, let's look at some facts:\n\n1. We've decided, arbitrarily, that BTC is a currency. This doesn't make any core sense relative to *actual scarcity*. If I told you that I made a really cool program that spat out random coins (i.e. other cryptocurrencies, ICOs, etc.) and to get to the coin all you had to do was play a little game (solve puzzle x) would you accept this as a currency? Because, it turns out, most artifacts at Antique Roadshow are exactly the same; they are indeed completely able to be reproduced (you can make other coins instead of bitcoin, there's no intrinsic reason why BTC is the standard, and so we have) but we present a value on the original for arbitrary reasons. This is important. The fact that a teacup set from 1700 is worth anything more than a teacup set from Target today is *completely arbitrary*.\n\n2. BTC can be lost. That's one of the major problems with it; if you lose the private key the cash goes bye-bye *but the price doesn't reflect the lost keys* and so the scarcity is based entirely on what's been produced *not* what actually is in circulation. This is another reason why it doesn't make sense and is completely fiat; if I made the same coins and offered you the game above but then you lost some of it and couldn't get it back does that impact the value of the rest? Or rather, how would it? This immunity is not a good thing; supply actually can be inflated and deflated by just counting the pennies that aren't in play anymore due to either being stolen or lost. In practiced expectation eventually all of BTC will be lost; if you lost even .001% of the private keys a year this is an eventuality which drives down supply and up demand by inflation so if you purposefully dumped keys (much like how diamonds trade today) you could manipulate the price.\n\nNow my point isn't to argue with you, per se, I am not that vested in the idea but more to express that it isn't this clear-cut superhero method of practice. Any type of communal value requires some form of centralization to form and so, de facto, BTC isn't completely decentralized and likely won't stay decentralized and just p2p because if that's the case the exchanges have to disband and farms have to disappear.",
