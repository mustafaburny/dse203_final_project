This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.\n\nRecent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts. \n\nPaysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn\u2019t include planned inorganic M&amp;A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).",

        "body": "&gt;Paysafe is a fintech company with tons of promise, especially if you believe in the future of iGaming\n\nNot quite. Paysafe is a merchant services provider. The industry often mistaken for Fintech, but in reality it's more of a commodity banking product (electronic payment processing) driven by price. Paysafe's direct competitors include companies like FIS/Worldpay, FISERV, and Global Payments (the big 3). 15 years of race to the bottom have severally compressed profit margins and increased attrition YOY. This is why you're seeing so much M&amp;A in the space. Once iGaming is legalized, Paysafe will be competing for this business against the Big 3. They'll surely win some accounts, but chances are the Big 3 will dominate the space because they can offer better pricing and technology. \n\n\n\n&gt;Paysafe stock fell 13% after an underwhelming Q1 earnings report driven by an EPS miss of $0.02, only a 5% growth in revenue, and a loss of nearly $50M\n\nThat loss is substantial. And it's due to the fact that they board \"high risk\" merchant accounts\". Think of them as a subprime lender.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s clear that the company is currently being bogged down by their latest conservative growth numbers so for this stock to break out, it will need a catalyst. That catalyst will be the legalization of online gambling that will almost certainly sweep through the U.S. Paysafe is currently live in 15 states leaving 35 more states to go. With the promise of those sweet sweet tax dollars, I believe most states will eventually cave in and Paysafe will be there to offer them the picks and shovels required to make it a reality\n\nThis won't be the boon you're thinking because once it's legal, all of their competitors will be boarding these types of accounts and have pockets deep enough to \"buy the market\" with low processing rates, rates that Paysafe can't afford to match.",

Some of these sectors, like cars, who were expecting decreased consumer demand instead witnesses unusually high demand, and they were unable to regain their slots. \n\nAlso building a chip plant takes at bare minimum five years and that is assuming the wait list for chip manufacturing equipment isn't already years (which, spoilers: it is). Intel's biggest asset is that they're a US company, and there's national security interest in on-shoring. So I expect the USG to bail them out by funding a major US chip production facility within the USA for mostly USG/DoD consumption. In the meantime AMD/TSM will continue to eat Intel's lunch, and their market share (which is a lagging indicator) will continue to shrink.   \n\nWhile I'm bullish on Intel over tens of years for the reason above, I'm bearish right now as I don't believe we've hit the bottom. P/E may actually get worse if earnings sink as Intel tries to compete with AMD's superior products in the enterprise/data-center space (i.e. deep discounts).    \n\nSo I may buy Intel but not at $57, maybe at $45~.",

The process didn't really get too complicated, the low-tier designers Intel hired were tasked for 10nm and made some overly engineered design which made the 10nm process a mess to get consistently good results per wafer. While the more experienced designers were dedicated to fixing issues on 14nm and are now working on 5/7nm. \n\nAbove all Intel needs to actually get the right employees and pay that talent to come here, not just get some big name like Jim Keller and act like he alone can save the company. The company is ripe with nepotism and entrenched management. Most engineers within the company if given the opportunity would leave for something better (according to the management survey Intel gave a month ago) which doesn't sound great for a turnaround success.",

One thing we didn't have was a large stock quite as overpriced as Tesla.  Tesla is a $50-$100 company trading at $600.  Cisco only had a PE of 110, not 600 like Tesla.

They try to shrink the node by a lot and increase transistor density by a lot at the same time. Compared by density intel 10nm is comparable to TSMC 1st gen 7nm.\n\nNow with that said, intel has fucked up on 14nm by jumping too hard into transistor density, same with 10nm. Furthermore, they were warned that 10nm is not an optimal size for a transistor. Reason has to do something with electron migration, I'm not sure on the details.\n\nNow you stack fancy shit on that like EUV, different gate tech, 3d stacking and all hell is gonna break loose.",

It they screw up only half as much on 7NM while doubling down on their own fabs they might be doomed. \n\nThey may also manage to turn it around. Anyway TSMC has the money to stay at the very least competitive with Intel amd this takes away Intels competitive advantage it enjoyed for so long a thing of the past. Bidens American Billion subsidies can't help intel. The problem of Intel has never been financial. They had enough money to buy back stock like crazy and they still have a shit-ton of money.\n\nAMD has been underlromising and overdelivering. I would expect this to continue.

        "body": "You are failing to realize a few key bear considerations for AMD: \n\n-Every major software company is starting to look at bringing chip design in house in the same way that apple launched the M1 and left intel left to out to dry. Amazon\u2019s AWS for example doesn\u2019t want to pay AMD a heavy margin for their slightly modified general purpose ARM design that Amazon could do better/cheaper for their instances. It\u2019s public knowledge that they are building their own chips to use for AWS services. Microsoft doesn\u2019t want to use the power hungry and inefficient chips of yore either on Azure or the devices they are selling- you could even imagine them eventually bundling windows and windows chips to OEMs for a discount. \n\n-The Tesla deal is garbage. AMD sells more chips from Xbox sales in a day than they will sell in a year on premium Tesla models (S+X).\n\n-The real winners (other than big tech SW companies) are ASML (semi manufacturing devices used by intel, and TSMC among others) and NVDA (I believe that the ARM deal will go through). If the ARM deal goes through, every major player in the tech space will need to pay out licensing fees to NVDA if they are not using NVDA chips. That combined with SW development ecosystem NVDA offers makes it pretty compelling IMO.",

I don't make a whole lot of money so it's a perfect set up for me. I max it out, buy some solid names at good prices and try to hold them.\n\nThe plan is obviously retirement. But if anything comes up before then, I can take out money with no penalties and do what I need to do, maybe a down payment on a house one day.\n\nIf there's one thing I wish I did more, was take some risks for high returns. But I don't think now is the time for that. I hate holding a stock with no dividend and just watching it bounce around so I go with dividend payers. \n\nMy positions are: SWKS, LMT, AAPL, CSCO, QCOM, KLIC, INTC, KMI. A bit tech heavy but I know they will be relevant for years to come.\n\nI also have a problem buying a stock \"early\" and selling it before it really takes off. Broadcom and Align technologies are the two that come to mind.",

There's always an opportunity for a good entry, and you have a couple days to get in.\n\nMind you the split has been approved and is coming in July.  This should make options more affordable, thank God.  I like the 90 day contract on NVDA because sometimes it trades sideways, or you buy at the wrong time, but it always recovers.\n\nJust be patient and wait for the next sell off.  And then right before you buy, wait another 48 hours.  Watch the MACD chart.\n\nTarget?  Who the fuck knows.  Monday could be end of days, or the market could shrug shit off.
