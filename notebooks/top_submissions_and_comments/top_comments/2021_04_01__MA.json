RH won't find any friends in the MA Attorney General's office or for that matter in the Federal agencies on site there.  In other words, Vlad may wanna stay the hell out of the jurisdictional reach of MA for the next 7-10 years, else some Deputy Atty Gen there who is the great grandson of some serious \"old money\" decides to rake him over the coals.  Don't shoot the messenger.  I worked for a time for some of that Old Money.  The MA legislature will make what RH does, a crime and that will be that.  Good luck Vlad.

Right now, based on current futures, the 9 day MA is $8 below and the 50d MA is $21 below.

The comparison between later August and this month's volume and price action is nearly identical.\n\nThe reason why I'm comparing this specifically to the early Sept crash is because no news triggered that crash, indicators were just severally alarming and we had been in HEAVILY overbought territory for  7 days. Then a couple firms liquidated their heavily profited tech positions and caused the algos to trigger a crash. Tomorrow marks the first day of our heavily overbought territory.",

Not only do I not agree with you, but you didnt really write anything to justify your \"analysis,\" and (I felt) instead just leaned on your \"economics degree\" to lend you credibility?\n\nCould you explain what you disagree about exactly?\n\nNo, my economics degree doesn't lend me credibility.  That's why I left a few disclaimers saying to take this all with a grain of salt.  But I did feel like it was worth mentioning because inevitably people would say, as you did, that \"he's only been investing for 2 months\".  My degree is certainly nothing major (no pun intended), but hey, it's something.  If I didn't feel like it gave me any insight I wouldn't have mentioned it.\n\n&gt; I've seen you elsewhere claiming that you wrote this to \"help noobs\" but what's helpful is clarity, transparency, and depth. /My2cents\n\nNo.  I encourage you to dig deeper into that exchange.  At the end of the day I wrote this for my own enjoyment.  That was the only end goal.  There was no altruistic motive here.  That said, I do think what I posted was insightful for, say, some 18 year old kid who bought GME last month and has no clue what a stock is.  Those people are around here; I've interacted with a few of them.\n\nBut no, this was not meant to be game changing or super insightful or anything.  I just felt like sharing and felt that a disclaimer was a good idea because I'm *aware* that it's not very detailed or anything.  If you'd like to argue with any of my points, I'm all ears.",

My first recommendation is if you\u2019re not married to the idea of individual stock picks, go boring and pick a broad market etf. \n\nIf you really want to pick individual stocks, i personally employ a strategy that looks for quality companies with strong balance sheets, strong FCF generation or the prospects of doing so, and have excellent management and/or are market leaders in their segments. \n\nI take a barbell approach where I have traditional \u201cvalue\u201d picks on one side and \u201cgrowth\u201d on the other, but they all fit the criteria I have above. I think value and growth are stupid labels because you always want to buy when it\u2019s good value relative to prospects and you don\u2019t want to buy companies that aren\u2019t growing in some way. I like some pharma names like MRK and VRTX; I have a good position in PYPL, V to capitalize on secular trends in payments.

Old. Successful but *old*. Really good numbers but Paysafe already has all the companies kids will be using.

Pennystock so small pump and dump , plus large fees to buy on FRA, so lost a little bit. Didn't fall to intial levels, so I believe in the stock, will increase position and average down. \n\n\\- *The stock of which we do not speak*:  learned to regulate emotions, hold, and get profit by buying and selling on the good moments.

Will keep a permanent 30% cash aside for buying dips and rotating portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis month's profit: 4.47% (bought every week so on average it is 2.5 weeks?)\n\nSold with profit: Sony, Apple, AMC, GME, might repurchase Sony. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stocks I am looking into purchasing too:**\n\n    FRA:Nintendo    NTO \n    TPI composites\tTPIC\twind \n    OMK:Vestas wind\tVWS\twind \n    OMK:Orsted A/S\tORSTED\twind \n    Sunrun\t        RUN\tsolar china \n    DAQO new energy\tDAQO\tsolar residential \n    Quanta services\tPWR\tpipelines, transmission building \n    XET:Verbio\tVBK\tbiofuel \n    XET:Volkswagen\tVOW3 \n    FRA:\tVolvo\tVOL1    believe in Polestar\n    EAM:PostNL\tPNL\tEU parcel service \n    XET:Adidas\tADS\tprobably replace Nike with this \n    XET:Astrazeneca\tZEG\t? \n    EBR:Ackermans &amp; van haaren ACKB hedgefund \n    EAM:Boskalis    BOKA\tdredging, wind, ports\n\n  \nI feel green energy is currently below value after the hype, so will purchase some before they get back to true value level.

Also heavy in EU markets invested in case this makes the US market crash, EU will follow but I'll have time to get out without so much losses.

(Is a company undervalued or are they just presenting themselves like this or are some HF profiting from making the company look that way in the news? )   \nI only buy companies I know, mostly intuitively: is the public perception good (or brand loyalty) are they innovating or expanding, or will they be needed more in the future?\n\n  \nIt's based on Warren Buffet's: \"*I bought Dunkin Donuts because I liked their coffee.\"*  \nWhich might make me a complete idiot, so feel free to completely tear this all apart.",

        "body": "I'm focusing on all of tech, but primarily companies I know. Even if Powell raises federal interest rates early and we have another setback, which he has said over and over he won't so I believe him, interest rates are going to be very low for a few years. \n\nFirst let me summarized why I believed the cycle was already on the verge of turning back to tech, posted earlier in the week in an Ark thread.\n\nDisclaimer, assume I have a position on every stock in this topic, even the retails.\n\nApple and Amazon started falling from their ATH quite awhile ago actually, before the rest of the tech correction. They bottomed out around 118 and 3000, both dipping below those marks even but not for long. Then they started to show resistance and basically trade sideways around 120 and 3050 while the rest of tech continued to sink, and finally early this week they were even rising and beating the market. This all showed a bottom out to me.\n\nDisney was my reopening stock, crushing it and breaking ATH. The news and this sub was all about DIS and other reopenings/retail/cyclicals. But then they started to fall back on positive earnings. They got a one hour bump from positive park news, the next time they got zero bump from positive park news, and they fell a good 10% from their ATH.\n\nBy the time Roku hit 300, Etsy below 200, SQ at 200, it was time to put all money possible in. Even if they keep going down, at that point I don't believe they can go too much farther, as they were at their prices from last Fall, much like Apple and Amazon had bottomed out there. These stocks are going to fall to summer prices while TGT soars indefinitely past its ATH high?  Fine I'll keep buying down, but I don't think so. Now we have lulu being shorted as soon as they beat earnings and there's nothing but positive news, the same thing that was happening to the companies like Apple a couple months ago.\n\nThe bond yields should climb some more and stabilize closer to 2, maybe even in the near future, so there might be some more choppiness ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even that bad and we already got most of that priced in though.\n\nFAANG of course is recommended, although I did think it was interesting Biden called out Amazon twice in the infrastructure speech and there may be bipartisan agreement against some of these companies. It's not like I see any major problems here, but I think their cash reserves will matter more in a year or so, so they're just buy as you can per usual.\n\nMy favorites are the household names or dependable tech stocks that are still way below their ATHs. I'm deep and long on Roku, just search the sub for the excellent DD about Roku if you don't really know what they're about. Their industry is mid-game, so room to grow, but also at a point where Roku has spent the money to secure their position, with an agreement with every major streaming service, pretty much every non-first or discount tier smart TV brand, and now their own advertisement company which is where their money flow will come, as they both help the streaming services make money while getting a cut. They crushed earnings and gave a better than expected outlook but fell $180, all I could post was to buy at point. They are not a gimmick, they are over 70% institutionally owned.\n\nSquare, PayPal, Zoom, Tesla, Etsy, Pinterest, pick your poison, there's more than I can think off the top of my head. I'm picking as many of these household tech stocks that have been around for years and will be around for years to come. I don't see a reason to get safer investments while these stocks are 50-75% from ATHs if you can ride it out long enough for them to climb again. I'll even throw out an Uber mention despite their bump in UK, because this is a household name product.  I hate apps, but I'm not deleting by Uber app anytime soon. Longevity and % of dip is what I'm focused on when it comes to taking on perceived risk.\n\nThen you can look at stocks I don't even like such as LMND and FSLY. Fastly is still almost 50% from its ATH, sure I'll take a small position there. A short time of rising with the rest of the market and one positive news story and they'll be back to at least $85 or $90, surely.\n\nPeople are over the semiconductor shortage by now after MU yesterday, right? Surely semiconductors, ev charging, clean energy, uranium, etc has room to climb even if they can't boom as fast as they did previously? \n\nSoftware companies? Sure. HPE was unaffected lately.check that chart. I guess it's because they pay dividends, all I know is they're working on every futuristic cloud and software idea. I won't even talk someone out of PLTR, we know it's going to continue being pumped daily on Reddit lol, but it's also by far the lowest Institutionally owned stock in this post I'm sure. MDB should be a good one again although it already got 8.5% since Thursday opening,it's 75% from its ATH and the company is going to be around for awhile.\n\nI don't know your companies, and I like to focus on what I know, but I will look into them too. I don't think this tech storm lasts too much longer, and regardless of how long it lasts I'm riding it out if I believe the company will be a well known name five years down the road.\n\nHappy day off everyone, hopefully the next quarter is good to you all. Just get SPY or something if you want to safely grow your money, I think that route will be very good to you this year and beyond as well.",

Set the groundwork for a solid, long-term position that can grow with you and your family rather than a moonshot.\n\nThis isn't financial advice, but you could do a lot worse than buying a good AAPL, MSFT, or PYPL (the last one being the most risky but likely also most upside potential). If you want something with a more dividend bent, you could look at EXG (more growth holdings with a dividend) or GDV (more value holdings with a dividend).",
