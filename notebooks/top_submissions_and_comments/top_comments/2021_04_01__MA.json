Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes. You\u2019ve been warned (Voltswagen, er Volkswagen did a good job of preparing you for that as well).",

S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat. That\u2019s as of 0630.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes.

In fact these are the types of posts that I hope get on the top of r/options (I gave you an award - hopefully it pushes it up). Your post is a great post for people who are actually looking to learn more about options than just buying calls/puts. Half of the time I see posts that are just like \u201cyolo into calls on stock xyz\u201d or \u201cshould I get out of my position now or wait it out\u201d etc. get to the top, which is sort of disappointing to me. I don\u2019t have any issues with those posts, but they don\u2019t offer the insight your post offers. \n\nWhat you described is a rough sketch of dispersion trading. You probably won\u2019t be able to find much about it online but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a few articles and research papers that you can find on Google (just type dispersion trading into Google). There\u2019s also this on YouTube that gives you a brief intro: https://youtube.com/watch?v=32bVTQw7XDg. It\u2019s a *true options* strategy and much more sophisticated than the ones you generally see here on Reddit of just buying calls or puts. I would guess it\u2019s one of the core strategies almost all option trading firms make to generate profit. It\u2019s almost impossible to do as a retail trader (your set-up you described in your post will be very costly and almost impossible to manage), but if you have like some complex system of algorithms + a bunch of quants helping you out, there is a way to pull off this trade so that you can *have a positive profit no matter how the stock market moves*. \n\nThink about it this way with a super simplistic example in SPY. SPY is a function of its 500 stocks. So there must be a relationship between these 500 stocks (or sector of stocks) and SPY. If this relationship gets off in either direction, you can take advantage. If Stock X and Stock Y have IVs of a and b, then the basket that is some weighted combination of Stock X and Y *must* have an IV of f(a, b) where it\u2019s a *solvable function*. This means anytime it gets off, no matter how Stocks X and Y move, you can make money. \n\nAnyways that didn\u2019t really answer your question in your post directly, but I\u2019m giving some basic insight on the type of thinking you described in your post. As I said, I don\u2019t think most people have the resources to pull it off, but given you can even think of this idea, that\u2019s pretty impressive! And as I said, it\u2019s a great post for people to learn more about more advanced option strategies than just buying calls/puts.",

As we draw closer to the delivery days, the number of open interest contracts should almost always fall as most players in the COMEX are speculators and do not have the silver nor have the interest to demand delivery so they would rather just close off and roll their contracts over to future months.\n\nThose contacts that remains are more likely serious participants who want delivery and are not just speculating. So if that total number of open interest contracts remains high when we hit the delivery day, that means more likely for more silver will be demanded from the COMEX and as it stands now, the COMEX stock is only at 24,000 contracts. If more than 24000 contracts demands delivery, they'll be out of stock.\n\nThe COMEX may have ways to increase their stock in the meantime.

I adore all the degenerates here. I like the positions or ban requirement. Wsb was my intro to options. It told me about the jpow brrrr and the v-shaped recovery last year. I learned that TA is the best way to sound smart but be actually retarded. Wsb showed me that dividends and boomer stocks was for nerds. And it taught me how to lose money really fast and that I should always inverse myself. But in The last 3 months I\u2019ve literally learned 5x what I knew from the past 3 years. Gme is the most interesting story of the year. This megathread was going to eventually and naturally be replaced as apes learn new plays and the gme story unfolds. It doesn\u2019t make sense to make an executive unilateral decision to kill the thread and it just makes mods look sus af. Killing the thread only feeds the conspiracy/cultish mindset. Just like all the CNBC/motley fool/S3/etc... FUD proved to me that gme was a real threat. MODS: get a grip and use this growth as an opportunity to integrate a lot of beautiful minds so that we can collectively share the best ideas and the best gains and losses. Why shoot yourselves in the foot?",
