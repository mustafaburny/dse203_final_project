        "body": "Sorry if I wasn't clear, there are other companies that provide different tools that are seemingly similarly dominant in their industry (not data analysis).\n\nA really good example would be Autodesk (ADSK). They make the AutoCad family, REVIT and other tools, all for construction design. They are very dominant in this field and it would be very difficult for competitors to break in for a variety of reasons. ADSK trades at a 52 P/E ratio and about 20 P/R ratio. I think they are a bit overvalued and Yahoo seems to agree with me. I wouldn't stay they are a bad buy though. This company is only valued at ~2 times PLTR but looks way better. Another example would be ANSYS (ANSS) that makes FEA software. \n\nPLTR provides what one would hope is a dominant data analysis suite/tools. That's great but I am just not sure that they will find enough customers that sit in the 'goldilocks zone' of having enough data to analyze and not having the resources to create the tools themselves. I am also not entirely certain that companies that run systems like CRM services can't provide similar tools with other items. Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft all advertise data analytics. How would a customer know if the Palantir tools are better or worse than those produced by other larger companies that the customer may already have a relationship with (CRM, Microsoft suite, G-suite, etc.)?",

        "body": "&gt;If you know any asphalt manufactures that may be a better play as repairing roads involves relaying sections of asphalt and filling in pot holes.\n\nSo... Cemex? OP did say they also manufactured asphalt.\n\n[https://www.cemex.com/products-services/products/related-products](https://www.cemex.com/products-services/products/related-products)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Good luck to you, however as a civil engineer I can tell you we don't use concrete to repair bridges and roads.\n\nI disagree with this statement. I'm also a civil engineer :) Concrete roads (which do exist, not all roads are asphalt) will need to be repaired with concrete. Many bridges are also constructed out of concrete (i.e. for the decks, piers, etc). Many bridges at the very least need repair to spalling concrete to mitigate potential issues from exposed rebar.\n\n[https://kingcounty.gov/depts/local-services/roads/patton-bridge.aspx](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/local-services/roads/patton-bridge.aspx)\n\n[https://mountainx.com/blogwire/bridge-repair-requires-i-40-to-i-240-ramp-closure/](https://mountainx.com/blogwire/bridge-repair-requires-i-40-to-i-240-ramp-closure/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions...*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Concrete is a huge producer of carbon dioxide emissions during manufacturing so that would be pretty ironic...\n\nYour statement about CO2 emissions isn't wrong. However, Cemex has historically received funds from the United States for sustainability goals. So that quote on funding for greenhouse gas emissions research makes me even more bullish on Cemex.\n\n[https://cementamericas.com/2020/11/16/cemex-awarded-doe-grant-for-carbon-capture-tech/](https://cementamericas.com/2020/11/16/cemex-awarded-doe-grant-for-carbon-capture-tech/)\n\n[https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/BP-Cemex-to-partner-on-decarbonizing-cement-16173944.php](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/BP-Cemex-to-partner-on-decarbonizing-cement-16173944.php)\n\n[https://www.cemex.com/sustainability/climate-action/vertua-net-zero-carbon-concrete](https://www.cemex.com/sustainability/climate-action/vertua-net-zero-carbon-concrete)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If you want to try to make money off this then look at companies who do contract work for Highway Departments i.e civil engineering companies/contractors and companies engaged in the production and distribution of construction equipment and materials like asphalt, gravel, stone, sand, cranes, trucks, etc.\n\nI agree. I'm also invested in some engineering firms (Arcadis, Jacobs, etc) and some engineering software (PTC, Autodesk, etc). But I am most overweight in Cemex. And so can you.",
