I\u2019m holding that medium term. There is of course msft, Apple, mastercard some of the usual high ROE suspects. Then I have my side projects like KBAL an office furniture company (I know talk about bad growth ops) but that I believe is being unfairly penalized in the market and I believe they\u2019re a good value play right now. Also they have a good debt situation and plenty of cash relative to their size. In addition I invested in NMIH at the bottom which deals with private mortgage insurances. That play has doubled and I\u2019m confident that it will continue to go up. There\u2019s a bunch of others these are just what I came up with top of head.

And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted. I just wish he would back away from financial markets, because that is not going to be about real economy and employers and employee.
