When a VISA swipes, you know that it travels on VISA\u2019s network to the customer\u2019s bank and asks for approval of the purchase. \n\nBut how do you as a popcorn seller actually get a credit card swipe onto VISA\u2019s network and not accidentally onto AMEX\u2019s network? And once the purchase is approved, how do you actually get your money? I mean, who actually pays you, every single bank that every customer uses? What if the customer does a chargeback or disputes the charge? How will you handle refunds?\n\nThat\u2019s what a merchant card processor is for. They build the hardware to read the cards. They write the software behind that hardware to handle the card swipe, the software that talks to VISA, MasterCard, Discover, and AMEX\u2019s networks. They handle chargebacks. Their software handles recurring payments. Most importantly, at the end of each month they write you a check for all the charges you made (these days it\u2019s just a bank deposit, but you get the drift)\n\nSquare built their own hardware, the first big company to make card swipes accessible on every smart phone so any merchant could easily charge credit cards. They wrote smartphone software. They gave millions of free Square hardware out so everyone would use them. But what about the rest of the things a \u201cmerchant acquirer\u201d needs to do? Did they want to try and write software to connect to all the various card networks? Did they want to have to handle all the money and talk to every bank on the planet? There was no time to build all that massive infrastructure, so for backend banking portion of things they made a deal with Chase\n\nEdit - the other comment someone made, explaining how Square aggregates small companies and makes it worth it for a big bank like Chase to work with a million tiny 1-person companies is 100% spot-on",

That\u2019s called \u201cCard Services\u201d, and they work with consumers to issue them cards. When they get a request from a card network to approve a charge made on a Chase issued credit card, they look at your account and then do so.\n\nA **completely separate **division at Chase handles merchant services. One of the products they offer to merchants is as a credit card processor. Many, many, many companies use that division at Chase to handle their credit card swipes. This is for ALL cards, no matter the issuing bank. This software does not shortcut the MC/VISA/Discover/AmEX networks even if it\u2019s a Chase issued-card. They treat those cards the same as any other and pass the information on to the proper card network.\n\nSquare made a deal with Chase to white label their merchant card services. They provide a \u201cSquare\u201d branded product, but it uses Chase\u2019s merchant services credit card processing system on the backend. Because they\u2019re doing a LOT more swipes than normal companies, they get an amazing bulk deal. So they pay less to Chase Merchant Services per credit card swipe than normal companies do, and keep the difference",

        "body": "Thanks for your reply. I was worried since am new to trading. I too send an email to Robinhood customer support and I have got immediate response as below.\n\n\nThank you for reaching out today!\n\nI'm happy to address your concerns regarding account safety and security. \n\nWe understand that keeping your money safe is a top priority, which is why your brokerage account has measures to protect your debit card and your cash. Visit our Help Center to learn more about account security best practices and additional ways to keep your account safe.\n \nEnabling Two-Factor Authentication\n \nWe encourage you to enable Two-Factor Authentication, which adds another layer of security to your account. It requires two sources of verification (your password and your phone), and it makes it much harder for hackers to get access to your account. \n \nSpend Alerts\n \nOnce enabled, we\u2019ll send you a push notification every time your card is used. We\u2019ll let you know the merchant as well as the purchase amount--if you don\u2019t recognize the purchase, you can lock your card and report it stolen immediately in the app. \n \nLocation Protection\n \nOnce enabled, Location Protection helps protect you from suspicious, in-person transactions that happen far away from your actual location. We determine your location based on the location of your mobile phone. Location Protection is completely optional, and it only works if you\u2019re sharing your location with Robinhood.\n \nFraud Monitoring\n\nEvery transaction that you make is run through several different fraud checks. If we think that a purchase is fraudulent, we\u2019ll decline the transaction and send you a notification, if notifications are enabled. If this transaction was incorrectly flagged, you\u2019ll be able to acknowledge the transaction and try again.\n \nMastercard Zero Liability Protection\n \nYour Robinhood debit card comes with Mastercard\u2019s Zero Liability Protection. This protection applies to purchases that you make in person, online, or via mobile device. You won\u2019t be responsible for unauthorized transactions as long as you\u2019ve used reasonable care in protecting your card from loss or theft.\n \nSincerely,\nTom",

I believe the P/E reflects CSIQ's slow growth being a slightly more mature company (founded in 2001) whilst its competitors came around 5 years later. Also, if you look into these renewable ETFs like TAN, they favour SEDG (10.98%), ENPH (9.61%) and FSLR (7.70%) more against CSIQ (3.71%). It's the same story if you look into ICLN.\n\nThat's a just few areas of concern for me as a current investor in CSIQ.",

They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

If you look at Big Commerce's or Lemonade's financials, they aren't great.  And some of the SPAC mergers are pretty suspect especially when compared to how much they run up around merger time.  \n\nI agree that there was more vaporware back in the late 90s, BUT, the fervor, the blind investing into companies without knowing anything about their financials, the double or triple digit gains within a single year.... remind you of any recent times?",

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

This year it hasn't that much. People are timid, but I largely think that is overplayed. Many companies reported great numbers for Q3. Whether the election is contested, biden wins, or trump wins, it doesn't really matter. The private sector is marching on. Microsoft doesn't give a hoot if people riot. Stimulus will pass whether its biden or trump. Even so, we know we have until next year to sort it all out. Im keeping some cash for buying opportunities, but I'm largely bullish.

Got to 196.25 for a moment, but still closed @ 202. Flirted with it lately, but now long 195 again on Friday. Most confident trade I made last week.

So, if your purchase price for MSFT shows your actual strike price of the put (207.50), then that $300 premium just went into your account (as cash proceeds) but not counted as a P&amp;L because it's not tied to the underlying performance.\n\nmake sense? basically, if you now sell MSFT at 204.50, you've broken even (if you include proceeds from the premium). what you *should* do is now sell a CC a couple strikes above where MSFT is.\n\ngood luck have fun",

If you wait until the news cycle starts reminding us, then you've already missed a bigger bounce than you can reasonably expect from this year's biggest tech winners over the next few weeks.",
