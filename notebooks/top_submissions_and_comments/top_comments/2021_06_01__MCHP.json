        "body": "There needs to be a strong differentiation between cost push inflation and monetary driven inflation.  You're seeing prices in very specific parts of the economy spike due to cost constraints - almost all of it tied to microchip shortages which will definitely subside.\n\nThis is where many commenters are missing the mark, the Fed conducts monetary policy based on the dollars in circulation being appropriate for the transactions of an economy - what that means is they'd tighten if they felt like there was broad inflation due to an over supply of dollars.  There's not, there's actually pretty muted inflation in most of the economy - if you back out used cars and account for base effects then inflation is actually still on a sustained sub 2% trend.  \n\nSo while you're correct that psychological impacts of price shifts can manifest in additional price shifts the actuality of the situation is that there simply isn't any real shift in prices across the board.  There's some very localized spiking in certain materials, which we're already seeing fall, and there's used cars throwing a massive wrench in to the CPI report, but outside of that the rolling 3 month average of almost every other part of the economy is well under target.  The YOY figures are only heightened due to the prior year's base effects.  \n\nBasically - when you see someone going on about inflation being an issue that's mostly just a sign that they didn't dive in to the CPI report beyond the headline figure.",

However, Oshkosh will only make 10% of the vehicles electric that are made for the contract which is against what the directives for the contract should have been and now that's being called into question, as well as USPS is trying to add additional contracts to electrify. So, panic, overreaction, and some good-ish news. Production hasn't been impressive, but they're picking up, they got hit by the microchip device shortage and being a small-ish company it was a bit hard, but that's picking back up too. So, I think the drop was probably an overreaction, that's when  I bought, I like overreaction plays, they tend to be more consistent, but looking at the volume and percentage of the float shorted...

And while the contract might not be overturned, there's talk of increasing USPS funding to add more electric. The challenge was covered a week ago by the Cleveland OH news, it's got a paywall on the article. But the hype, sell the news. And again, I think that it's important to mention that nobody really discussed the problem with manufacturing EV's during the microchip device shortage, that was a big point of attack, they have other contracts, but to not address it seems foolhardy to me. Auto manufacturers really struggled to meet demand, so we saw some interesting goings-on in the auto manufacturing sector, with bigger repercussions for EV makers. So, now that we're kind of getting around to sorting that bit out, using manufacturing data from this quarter to project future growth would be incorrect.",
