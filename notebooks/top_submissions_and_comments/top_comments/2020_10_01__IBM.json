It just seemed like a recipe for massive losses that I didn't think the market was properly pricing. So I sold and went into silver. My rationale was fiscal stimulus + quantitive easing +supply chain disruptions from shutdowns will create stagflation concerns once the immediate liquidity fears are gone. Historically silver performed well in similar conditions(GFC and 80's stagflation, and silver was at historical lows, so it seemed like a low risk high reward bet. So I sold REITs and went silver.\n\nInitially took a large capital loss, but the silver I bought more than doubled in value before I sold, so I ended up making a ton of money such that my portfolio has a 54% ROI YTD.\n\nNow I'm slowly building up a new dividend portfolio. Still a bit early to tell how I'm doing, but generally I've been doing pretty good at timing the market on individual stocks. Bought in IBM at the right time, sold right on the news of spinoff boosting its price before it dropped back down. The difference is I'm buying stocks that seem to be valued low in terms of P/E and price/book value, but also are in a position to perform well during the pandemic or survive okay. So avoiding stocks like XOM, but buying stocks like LUMN, T, etc",

        "body": "My portfolio is mostly dividend stocks, except for TSLA shares I picked up a year and a half ago (TSLA is what got me into buying stocks). Excluding TSLA from my numbers, my dividend portfolio is a mixed bag. Overall I'm up 9.79% with dividends since I first started investing in mid to late 2019, I'm not sure what I was up pre-COVID, but I've added a lot of money to my portfolio during 2020.\n\nMy biggest losers are:\n\n* WFC - This is the biggest disaster of my investing career. I bought into it literally right before COVID, I'm down 49.79% with dividends. Fortunately I didn't put much money into this so it barely moves the numbers. I might cut my losses in this stock before the end of the year.\n\n* DIS - The dividend got cut, but because I bought more shares during the peek of the COVID drop (before their dividend cut) I'm up 5% right now counting the dividend I received in the past. I'll probably keep holding this for a number of years even if they don't reinstate the dividend.\n\n* IBM - Like WFC I bought into this right before COVID, so I'm down like 10.57% right now. I don't have much money invested into this. This is a turnaround play for me with their shift to cloud. I may buy a little bit more before the end of the year, but this will never be a large position for me.\n\n* T - I made the mistake as a new investor of getting into this when they were in the high $30's. Still, I think it's worth the risk as a dividend investment. I've been slowly DCAing into it more to reduce my cost basis and up my dividend income. I'm currently down 14.49% with dividends on this.\n\nThose 3 are the only ones I'm net down on right now.\n\nMy biggest dividend winners on the other hand are:\n\n* ALB - Picked up during the peak of the COVID drop, up 65%. I really wish I had bought more back then given how many months I had waited for it to reach that price target. The EV/TSLA hype has pushed this stock up to absurd highs in my opinion. Unfortunately this is one of my smaller positions.\n\n* MCD - I consistently added to this before and during COVID while it was under $200. I'm up 27.68%, and they just raised the dividend a week ago. This is my 3rd biggest dividend investment.\n\n* JNJ - My largest dividend holding by far. Overall I'm up by only 10.32% with dividends, but that's because I've been DCAing into it a lot the last few months which lowered my overall ROI. My pre-COVID shares are up much more then that. Their dividend raise during COVID was a nice boost to my dividend income.\n\n* DUK - I picked this one up during COVID. All the acquisition talks involving them &amp; NEE has pushed me up to a 16.79% ROI. This is one of my larger holdings.\n\n* MSFT - Up 18.88% currently. I started buying in during COVID. I've been slowly DCAing into them each month so I can eventually turn this into a bigger position.\n\nI also have some that haven't really gone much of anywhere from start to now of COVID (though I did add more to portfolio during their COVID drops), including PEP, VZ, MMM, HON.",

        "body": "Usually as in more than 50% of the time? Sure.\n\nBut the remaining times you would be better off selling your shares right away.\n\nLet's take an example. Imagine you own 100 shares of IBM. You can sell the shares now for $115.76 each.\n\nOr, you can sell an ITM call (let's say you sell the $110 call expiring on 11/20 for $6.75). Here are the possible scenarios with the call:\n\n1. **IBM is at or above $110 on 11/20:** you sell your shares for $110, and you keep $6.75 of premium. Which means you effectively sold your shares at $116.75 ($0.99 more than just selling your shares right away).\n2. **IBM closes between $110 and $109.01 on 11/20:** You keep your shares (which you can sell them right then at $109.01-$110) And you keep your $6.75 premium, which means you can make $0.00-$0.99 more per share than just selling the shares out right today.\n3. **IBM closes below $109:** You keep the shares and the premium. But now when you sell the shares at $109 or below, you lost money. For example, if IBM closes at $105, then you sell your shares at $105 and you kept the $6.75 premium which means you effectively sold your shares at $111.75 (instead of selling them at $115.75 today).\n\nYou can see that in case 3 the shares can drop dramatically. The question is what are the chances of each of these cases? Here are what the Black-Scholes model gives:\n\n1. Probability of IBM closing above $110 is 78%.\n2. Probability that IBM closes between $109 and $110 is around 3%.\n3. Probability that IBM closes below $109 is around 19%.\n\nThere is a 9% probability that IBM closes at $105 or below. This is a large enough probability to make you doubt taking that risk and locking up $11576 for 30 days just to make an extra $99 of potential extra gain. Like I said, there is no guaranteed profit. Options are priced pretty fairly such that every profit comes with a comparable risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS, the reason I chose IBM is they're a large enough company that already had their earnings out, so the options prices would reflect regular pricing and not include any earnings inflated IV.",

They have over 3 times the money they need to service their existing debt which would allow them to sustain the net few years of operations without issue. They have a superior product to Microsoft and portfolio of services that appeal more to the user. Microsoft is only a serious threat because they can afford to provide Teams for free and subsidize that cost through their other revenue streams. Slack's current P/S ratio is under 23 and P/B ratio is under 21. They have a revenue retention rate of over 125% and target smaller businesses with greater appeal than Microsoft while still having a wide customer base among the large corporations including Shopify, IBM, Lyft, BBC, Intuit, Splunk, Fastly, RBC, Newscorp, Hubspot, TD Ameritrade, Vodafone, Target, Jet, Hello Fresh, NASA, Liberty Mutual, NBC, Buzzfeed, Turner, Nasdaq, Walmart, Nike, McKinsey, T-Mobile, Comcast, Airbnb, NY Times and many more. Ark Invest is bullish on this company and it is the 7th largest holding in their Inovation ETF and the 6th largest holding in their Next Generation Internet ETF. People may not like to root for the underdog when it comes to the stock market and monopolistic behemoth tech companies like Microsoft, but I like the idea of rooting for the smaller players with superior products and services that are trying to provide in a new market segment.

        "body": "Let\u2019s say you start a brick-and-mortar company, selling... popcorn. You want your customers to be able to use credit cards to pay you. When a VISA swipes, you know that it travels on VISA\u2019s network to the customer\u2019s bank and asks for approval of the purchase. \n\nBut how do you as a popcorn seller actually get a credit card swipe onto VISA\u2019s network and not accidentally onto AMEX\u2019s network? And once the purchase is approved, how do you actually get your money? I mean, who actually pays you, every single bank that every customer uses? What if the customer does a chargeback or disputes the charge? How will you handle refunds?\n\nThat\u2019s what a merchant card processor is for. They build the hardware to read the cards. They write the software behind that hardware to handle the card swipe, the software that talks to VISA, MasterCard, Discover, and AMEX\u2019s networks. They handle chargebacks. Their software handles recurring payments. Most importantly, at the end of each month they write you a check for all the charges you made (these days it\u2019s just a bank deposit, but you get the drift)\n\nSquare built their own hardware, the first big company to make card swipes accessible on every smart phone so any merchant could easily charge credit cards. They wrote smartphone software. They gave millions of free Square hardware out so everyone would use them. But what about the rest of the things a \u201cmerchant acquirer\u201d needs to do? Did they want to try and write software to connect to all the various card networks? Did they want to have to handle all the money and talk to every bank on the planet? There was no time to build all that massive infrastructure, so for backend banking portion of things they made a deal with Chase\n\nEdit - the other comment someone made, explaining how Square aggregates small companies and makes it worth it for a big bank like Chase to work with a million tiny 1-person companies is 100% spot-on",

That\u2019s called \u201cCard Services\u201d, and they work with consumers to issue them cards. When they get a request from a card network to approve a charge made on a Chase issued credit card, they look at your account and then do so.\n\nA **completely separate **division at Chase handles merchant services. One of the products they offer to merchants is as a credit card processor. Many, many, many companies use that division at Chase to handle their credit card swipes. This is for ALL cards, no matter the issuing bank. This software does not shortcut the MC/VISA/Discover/AmEX networks even if it\u2019s a Chase issued-card. They treat those cards the same as any other and pass the information on to the proper card network.\n\nSquare made a deal with Chase to white label their merchant card services. They provide a \u201cSquare\u201d branded product, but it uses Chase\u2019s merchant services credit card processing system on the backend. Because they\u2019re doing a LOT more swipes than normal companies, they get an amazing bulk deal. So they pay less to Chase Merchant Services per credit card swipe than normal companies do, and keep the difference",

        "body": "Facts! This is from one of my brokers lol\n\n**S&amp;P 500 Daily Chart \u2013 Rising Wedge Break Hints at Further Downside**\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the S&amp;P 500 index appears to be at risk of extending its retreat from the record high set on September 3 (3588.49) after breaking to the downside of a bearish Rising Wedge pattern.\n\nHowever, with price pushing back above the trend-defining 50-day moving average (3390) and the RSI steaming towards overbought territory, a surge to test the psychologically imposing 3500 mark is hardly out of the question.\n\nA daily close above resistance at 3420 would probably validate bullish potential and could generate a more extensive rebound towards 3500, with a breach of psychological resistance bringing the record high (3588.49) into focus and potentially signalling the resumption of the primary uptrend.\n\nConversely, a pullback to the monthly low (3311.22) could unfold if sellers breach confluent support at the 20-DMA and 38.2% Fibonacci (3339.39), with a daily close below 3300 likely intensifying selling pressure and opening the door for a retest the of the September low (3209.6).\n\n**S&amp;P 500 Index 4-Hour Chart \u2013 Ascending Channel Resistance May Cap Upside**\n\nZooming into a 4-hour chart hints at an impending reversal lower as price runs into Ascending Channel resistance and the 3420 level.\n\nSignificant bearish RSI divergence and a notable plateauing of the MACD histogram suggests that the path of least resistance is lower.\n\nInability to break above the October 7 high (3431.4) could encourage would-be sellers and result in a pullback towards the 200-MA (3391), with a breach of Ascending Channel support needed to open the door for more extensive losses.\n\nOn the other hand, a push to psychological resistance at 3500 could be in the offing, if price bursts to fresh monthly highs and remains constructively perched above the 3420 mark.",

        "body": "Thanks for your reply. I was worried since am new to trading. I too send an email to Robinhood customer support and I have got immediate response as below.\n\n\nThank you for reaching out today!\n\nI'm happy to address your concerns regarding account safety and security. \n\nWe understand that keeping your money safe is a top priority, which is why your brokerage account has measures to protect your debit card and your cash. Visit our Help Center to learn more about account security best practices and additional ways to keep your account safe.\n \nEnabling Two-Factor Authentication\n \nWe encourage you to enable Two-Factor Authentication, which adds another layer of security to your account. It requires two sources of verification (your password and your phone), and it makes it much harder for hackers to get access to your account. \n \nSpend Alerts\n \nOnce enabled, we\u2019ll send you a push notification every time your card is used. We\u2019ll let you know the merchant as well as the purchase amount--if you don\u2019t recognize the purchase, you can lock your card and report it stolen immediately in the app. \n \nLocation Protection\n \nOnce enabled, Location Protection helps protect you from suspicious, in-person transactions that happen far away from your actual location. We determine your location based on the location of your mobile phone. Location Protection is completely optional, and it only works if you\u2019re sharing your location with Robinhood.\n \nFraud Monitoring\n\nEvery transaction that you make is run through several different fraud checks. If we think that a purchase is fraudulent, we\u2019ll decline the transaction and send you a notification, if notifications are enabled. If this transaction was incorrectly flagged, you\u2019ll be able to acknowledge the transaction and try again.\n \nMastercard Zero Liability Protection\n \nYour Robinhood debit card comes with Mastercard\u2019s Zero Liability Protection. This protection applies to purchases that you make in person, online, or via mobile device. You won\u2019t be responsible for unauthorized transactions as long as you\u2019ve used reasonable care in protecting your card from loss or theft.\n \nSincerely,\nTom",
