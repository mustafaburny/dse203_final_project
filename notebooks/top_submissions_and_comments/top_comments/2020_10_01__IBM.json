It just seemed like a recipe for massive losses that I didn't think the market was properly pricing. So I sold and went into silver. My rationale was fiscal stimulus + quantitive easing +supply chain disruptions from shutdowns will create stagflation concerns once the immediate liquidity fears are gone. Historically silver performed well in similar conditions(GFC and 80's stagflation, and silver was at historical lows, so it seemed like a low risk high reward bet. So I sold REITs and went silver.\n\nInitially took a large capital loss, but the silver I bought more than doubled in value before I sold, so I ended up making a ton of money such that my portfolio has a 54% ROI YTD.\n\nNow I'm slowly building up a new dividend portfolio. Still a bit early to tell how I'm doing, but generally I've been doing pretty good at timing the market on individual stocks. Bought in IBM at the right time, sold right on the news of spinoff boosting its price before it dropped back down.

        "body": "My portfolio is mostly dividend stocks, except for TSLA shares I picked up a year and a half ago (TSLA is what got me into buying stocks). Excluding TSLA from my numbers, my dividend portfolio is a mixed bag. Overall I'm up 9.79% with dividends since I first started investing in mid to late 2019, I'm not sure what I was up pre-COVID, but I've added a lot of money to my portfolio during 2020.\n\nMy biggest losers are:\n\n* WFC - This is the biggest disaster of my investing career. I bought into it literally right before COVID, I'm down 49.79% with dividends. Fortunately I didn't put much money into this so it barely moves the numbers. I might cut my losses in this stock before the end of the year.\n\n* DIS - The dividend got cut, but because I bought more shares during the peek of the COVID drop (before their dividend cut) I'm up 5% right now counting the dividend I received in the past. I'll probably keep holding this for a number of years even if they don't reinstate the dividend.\n\n* IBM - Like WFC I bought into this right before COVID, so I'm down like 10.57% right now. I don't have much money invested into this. This is a turnaround play for me with their shift to cloud. I may buy a little bit more before the end of the year, but this will never be a large position for me.\n\n* T - I made the mistake as a new investor of getting into this when they were in the high $30's. Still, I think it's worth the risk as a dividend investment. I've been slowly DCAing into it more to reduce my cost basis and up my dividend income. I'm currently down 14.49% with dividends on this.\n\nThose 3 are the only ones I'm net down on right now.\n\nMy biggest dividend winners on the other hand are:\n\n* ALB - Picked up during the peak of the COVID drop, up 65%. I really wish I had bought more back then given how many months I had waited for it to reach that price target. The EV/TSLA hype has pushed this stock up to absurd highs in my opinion. Unfortunately this is one of my smaller positions.\n\n* MCD - I consistently added to this before and during COVID while it was under $200. I'm up 27.68%, and they just raised the dividend a week ago. This is my 3rd biggest dividend investment.\n\n* JNJ - My largest dividend holding by far. Overall I'm up by only 10.32% with dividends, but that's because I've been DCAing into it a lot the last few months which lowered my overall ROI. My pre-COVID shares are up much more then that. Their dividend raise during COVID was a nice boost to my dividend income.\n\n* DUK - I picked this one up during COVID. All the acquisition talks involving them &amp; NEE has pushed me up to a 16.79% ROI. This is one of my larger holdings.\n\n* MSFT - Up 18.88% currently. I started buying in during COVID. I've been slowly DCAing into them each month so I can eventually turn this into a bigger position.\n\nI also have some that haven't really gone much of anywhere from start to now of COVID (though I did add more to portfolio during their COVID drops), including PEP, VZ, MMM, HON.",

        "body": "Usually as in more than 50% of the time? Sure.\n\nBut the remaining times you would be better off selling your shares right away.\n\nLet's take an example. Imagine you own 100 shares of IBM. You can sell the shares now for $115.76 each.\n\nOr, you can sell an ITM call (let's say you sell the $110 call expiring on 11/20 for $6.75). Here are the possible scenarios with the call:\n\n1. **IBM is at or above $110 on 11/20:** you sell your shares for $110, and you keep $6.75 of premium. Which means you effectively sold your shares at $116.75 ($0.99 more than just selling your shares right away).\n2. **IBM closes between $110 and $109.01 on 11/20:** You keep your shares (which you can sell them right then at $109.01-$110) And you keep your $6.75 premium, which means you can make $0.00-$0.99 more per share than just selling the shares out right today.\n3. **IBM closes below $109:** You keep the shares and the premium. But now when you sell the shares at $109 or below, you lost money. For example, if IBM closes at $105, then you sell your shares at $105 and you kept the $6.75 premium which means you effectively sold your shares at $111.75 (instead of selling them at $115.75 today).\n\nYou can see that in case 3 the shares can drop dramatically. The question is what are the chances of each of these cases? Here are what the Black-Scholes model gives:\n\n1. Probability of IBM closing above $110 is 78%.\n2. Probability that IBM closes between $109 and $110 is around 3%.\n3. Probability that IBM closes below $109 is around 19%.\n\nThere is a 9% probability that IBM closes at $105 or below. This is a large enough probability to make you doubt taking that risk and locking up $11576 for 30 days just to make an extra $99 of potential extra gain. Like I said, there is no guaranteed profit. Options are priced pretty fairly such that every profit comes with a comparable risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS, the reason I chose IBM is they're a large enough company that already had their earnings out, so the options prices would reflect regular pricing and not include any earnings inflated IV.",

They have over 3 times the money they need to service their existing debt which would allow them to sustain the net few years of operations without issue.

Microsoft is only a serious threat because they can afford to provide Teams for free and subsidize that cost through their other revenue streams. Slack's current P/S ratio is under 23 and P/B ratio is under 21. They have a revenue retention rate of over 125% and target smaller businesses with greater appeal than Microsoft while still having a wide customer base among the large corporations including Shopify, IBM, Lyft, BBC, Intuit, Splunk, Fastly, RBC, Newscorp, Hubspot, TD Ameritrade, Vodafone, Target, Jet, Hello Fresh, NASA, Liberty Mutual, NBC, Buzzfeed, Turner, Nasdaq, Walmart, Nike, McKinsey, T-Mobile, Comcast, Airbnb, NY Times and many more. Ark Invest is bullish on this company and it is the 7th largest holding in their Inovation ETF and the 6th largest holding in their Next Generation Internet ETF. People may not like to root for the underdog when it comes to the stock market and monopolistic behemoth tech companies like Microsoft, but I like the idea of rooting for the smaller players with superior products and services that are trying to provide in a new market segment.

        "body": "Imagine basing this months price action on TA when everything is going to be driven by the news cycles around 2 events. I'm waiting for AMD moon this month because their 2 significant product launches are not sufficiently priced in.\n\nWhy do I say that? Look at any \"investing\" comments section on AMD and all they will talk about is how AMD is overpriced because their P/E is 160 lol or AMD is just another overvalued tech company like Tesla. Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like &gt;2X and &gt;3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that. Last weeks action was all about the 5800X AotS benchmark leaks - without knowing when future leaks are coming I don't see how we can predict any specific movements.\n\nMarch 21 95C, 100Cs",

That doesn't seem to be coming to an end anytime soon either given all the delays they've had. Last they said, they won't have 7nm chips out until 2022! At that point, AMD will be rolling out 5nm chips.      \n   \nThen you can talk about the multiple security vulnerabilities they've had with in their chips, with their only solution being \"Turn off hyper treading, that will fix it\". Eventually they released some fixes, but this also hurt CPU performance. \n\nI'm not going to say INTC is a sinking ship or anything, I just don't really see them as being that undervalued.",

You sound almost as full of shit as Bob Swan himself.\n\nThey are currently 4-5 years behind in their core business and not competitive in their other segments. They have a ton of cash and they will keep using it to try and spend themselves out of this mess while they suffer delay after delay. By the time they even have EUV basics figured out TSMC will likely be producing 3nm chips.\n\nWhat does this mean? Dramatically lower power consumption (\\~ 25%) especially in the mobile sector.

It all pivots on TMC in Taiwan which makes it tricky.\n2. 3500 US companies are suing Trump for blocking China trade access. which implies US companies want to go to China not stay locked into US.\n3. DCEP Chinese digital currency, not mentioned but could challenge the global dollar in time.\n4. Democrats are going to be more aggressive than Trump towards China. They called him \"Uncle Donald\" at one point. friendly-ish, they likely respect his financial approach even if he is brash. I dont think US will be friendly if Dems get in, and the vibe towards China will get a lot colder and nastier. that is not good if they are losing the global cold trade war, then US will start to play dirty tricks. Hilary would have had us all in a war by now imo. psychopathic woman. maybe she is still pulling strings somewhere. I truly hope not.\n5. Propaganda machine that has been driving Anti-Chinese sentiment for months is working very well and that is a big worry as once China feel even more cornered, they will likely react more aggressively. US are the cause of this whole fiasco, not the Chinese, but we are being sold differently on that narrative because US are dirty war players. history upholds that truth.\n6. China gaining more economic power and US losing it globally would totally change the face of world economy and markets fundamentally to the point it is almost impossible to imagine what that future would look like and one big question - how far would US Government be willing to go to stop that happening? that is scary because historically US Govmt have no limits that they have not been willing to go to before, including killing their own in extremely large numbers.\n\nAnyway, how all that effects trade, we will only really know after the election. I was hoping other peeps might share their wisdom/thoughts here which was my reason for posting.",

This guys cannot handle tough questions from his shareholders and her is terrible for investor confidence when they grill him (and they do).   \n   \nRead this ass wipe.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there's higher demand or because you're trying to offset the seven-nanometer delay? **Because it's hitting the margins big time, which doesn't really tie in my head to, like, yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So how do I think about the drivers of that seven-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven -- or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven-nanometer delay given what it's doing to the margins?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yeah. Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year 'cause it's clearly -- it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And we're -- part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and, I would say, on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we had forecasted for the year. So it's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that, again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer products.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**But wait a minute. If I look at your annual guidance now versus where it was in the beginning of the year, it's higher, but it's actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied in -- when you first gave the annual guidance six months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were now given you've actually lowered the second half?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue, Stacy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Well, I think I'll start with our full-year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. So that's --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Yeah. But you're just making it sound like where you can typically get to, is there --**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let me just finish, Stacy. I think it's a good question, but maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sorry.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Full-year demand for the company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer we've kind of set are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first six months, and we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, that the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And as we accelerate 10 faster, because customers are banding it more, the implications are that our margins, all else equal, will be lower. George kind of highlighted those were the primary drivers of the one-point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster, and our 5G comms business and the data center group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think, is a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If it's more of our growth than we had anticipated, all else equal, margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume, all else equal, will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year. Thank you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Operator**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/23/intel-intc-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/23/intel-intc-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx)\n\nI bolded her questions.

Then he just bobble headed through with a response that has nothing to do with what she asked. He is covering up.\n\nIntel IS going to have another shit quarter full of delays and missed deals they couldn't fulfill. There will be another terrible conference call like that and the stock will tank because Bob Swan is a fucktard.  \n\n\nI'm not only shorting Intel, I'm shorting Bob Swan himself.",

        "body": "Imagine basing this months price action on TA when everything is going to be driven by the news cycles around 2 events. I'm waiting for AMD moon this month because their 2 significant product launches are not sufficiently priced in.\n\nWhy do I say that? Look at any \"investing\" comments section on AMD and all they will talk about is how AMD is overpriced because their P/E is 160 lol or AMD is just another overvalued tech company like Tesla. Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like &gt;2X and &gt;3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that. Last weeks action was all about the 5800X AotS benchmark leaks - without knowing when future leaks are coming I don't see how we can predict any specific movements.\n\nMarch 21 95C, 100Cs",

You sound almost as full of shit as Bob Swan himself.\n\nThey are currently 4-5 years behind in their core business and not competitive in their other segments. They have a ton of cash and they will keep using it to try and spend themselves out of this mess while they suffer delay after delay. By the time they even have EUV basics figured out TSMC will likely be producing 3nm chips.\n\nWhat does this mean? Dramatically lower power consumption (\\~ 25%) especially in the mobile sector. With the advent of 5G applications, better power/performance ratio is everything for mobile which AMD will then take from intel too.\n\n[https://www.howtogeek.com/394267/what-do-7nm-and-10nm-mean-and-why-do-they-matter/](https://www.howtogeek.com/394267/what-do-7nm-and-10nm-mean-and-why-do-they-matter/)\n\nLearn about how these things are actually made and how this shit works and you will see clear as day, they have made EVERY wrong move. 4 years of stagnation and failure is not an accident. They are going in the shitter and their core business is on life support. They are fucked.",

        "body": "well exactly my reason for posting. to hear what other people think. here are some of my thoughts on the entire situation...\n\n1. the semiconductor impact\nbecause this is such a huge player in the markets at the moment between AMD, NVDA, INTC et al, could effect the entire Tech sector. It all pivots on TMC in Taiwan which makes it tricky.\n2. 3500 US companies are suing Trump for blocking China trade access. which implies US companies want to go to China not stay locked into US.\n3. DCEP Chinese digital currency, not mentioned but could challenge the global dollar in time.\n4. Democrats are going to be more aggressive than Trump towards China. They called him \"Uncle Donald\" at one point. friendly-ish, they likely respect his financial approach even if he is brash. I dont think US will be friendly if Dems get in, and the vibe towards China will get a lot colder and nastier. that is not good if they are losing the global cold trade war, then US will start to play dirty tricks. Hilary would have had us all in a war by now imo. psychopathic woman. maybe she is still pulling strings somewhere. I truly hope not.\n5. Propaganda machine that has been driving Anti-Chinese sentiment for months is working very well and that is a big worry as once China feel even more cornered, they will likely react more aggressively. US are the cause of this whole fiasco, not the Chinese, but we are being sold differently on that narrative because US are dirty war players. history upholds that truth.\n6. China gaining more economic power and US losing it globally would totally change the face of world economy and markets fundamentally to the point it is almost impossible to imagine what that future would look like and one big question - how far would US Government be willing to go to stop that happening? that is scary because historically US Govmt have no limits that they have not been willing to go to before, including killing their own in extremely large numbers.\n\nAnyway, how all that effects trade, we will only really know after the election. I was hoping other peeps might share their wisdom/thoughts here which was my reason for posting.",

This guys cannot handle tough questions from his shareholders and her is terrible for investor confidence when they grill him (and they do).   \n   \nRead this ass wipe.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there's higher demand or because you're trying to offset the seven-nanometer delay? **Because it's hitting the margins big time, which doesn't really tie in my head to, like, yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So how do I think about the drivers of that seven-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven -- or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven-nanometer delay given what it's doing to the margins?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yeah. Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year 'cause it's clearly -- it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And we're -- part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and, I would say, on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we had forecasted for the year. So it's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that, again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer products.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**But wait a minute. If I look at your annual guidance now versus where it was in the beginning of the year, it's higher, but it's actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied in -- when you first gave the annual guidance six months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were now given you've actually lowered the second half?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue, Stacy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Well, I think I'll start with our full-year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. So that's --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Yeah. But you're just making it sound like where you can typically get to, is there --**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let me just finish, Stacy. I think it's a good question, but maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sorry.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Full-year demand for the company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer we've kind of set are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first six months, and we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, that the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And as we accelerate 10 faster, because customers are banding it more, the implications are that our margins, all else equal, will be lower. George kind of highlighted those were the primary drivers of the one-point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster, and our 5G comms business and the data center group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think, is a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If it's more of our growth than we had anticipated, all else equal, margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume, all else equal, will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year. Thank you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Operator**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/23/intel-intc-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/23/intel-intc-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx)\n\nI bolded her questions. Read bobby's had wavy bullshit response. She had a VERY GOOD very precise point as she caught them in their bullshit. Then he just bobble headed through with a response that has nothing to do with what she asked.

There will be another terrible conference call like that and the stock will tank because Bob Swan is a fucktard.  \n\n\nI'm not only shorting Intel, I'm shorting Bob Swan himself.",

I think this means it could be a good long play up to earnings.",

        "body": "It seems like you think that Apple was recycling so they can promote their pro-green stance. Which is true and it is how branding works, by enforcing what your company beliefs are, but having a look at the company as a whole, they are moving towards being self sufficient such as with their A series microprocessors, the rumored ARM MacBook (which would make them not need Intel and seeing as their contract expires this year, it makes sense to promote their pro-green actions).\n\nThis would make it so that Apple will eventually control the entire process of manufacturing, from buying the minerals from Miners to giving the product in the hands of the customer, which is cheaper than buying components through other companies such as the Intel CPUs for the current MacBooks. \n\nNow for the statement, it looks like you think that the recycling company was hired for the pure sense of recycling, and you\u2019re right, they were: but if Apple was truly sticking by their chance of being pro-green, wouldn\u2019t you think that Apple shouldn\u2019t have an issue with them reselling phones the phones that Apple provides them. The recycling company wouldn\u2019t have phone repairers (because it would be unwise to set a specialized department for one specific client), hence its more than likely for the devices to be sold to people who would like Apple devices but can\u2019t afford new ones, or phone repairers that believe that the devices have a longer lifetime. \n\nIn short, it sounds like you believe that since the company has been hired to recycle, they should only do that, which is completely fair, but if you had the opportunity to support your business further and not break the ideals of your client (being pro-green as reselling actually does reduce pollution by a minuscule amount), wouldn\u2019t you opt for that offer?",

        "body": "I think NVDA and AMD are fairly valued compared to each other, but incredibly overvalued compared to Intel. NVDA/AMD are likely also fairly or undervalued compared to the broader markets - which are grossly overvalued.\n\nFor AMD - they will soon be revenue constrained based on TSMC capacity. ATM, it looks like they're selling everything they produce. As more and more of their sales mix shifts to TSMC fabs, they will become more constrained. Even with the better products, they will only ever be able to grow revenue by a predictable amount. They're consistent, but with this constraint in place, I don't know how you can justify their current valuation.\n\nNVDA - I think they are currently worth more than INTC, while INTC makes twice the operating income that NVDA makes in total revenue. Not only this, but INTC is actually still growing revenue. \n\nThe whole TAM is expanding, such that even though NVDA and AMD have comparable or superior products, INTC is actually still growing at a respectable pace and generating considerably more revenue and profit. Part of this comes down to the fact that INTC is less supply constrained - huge fab space. Part of this is that even though AMD products are generally superior, they aren't superior for the average consumer - i.e. people buying laptops for general work, people buying desktops for general work. INTC wins in gaming, but AMD works in productivity (parallel workloads), but has a worse software stack.\n\nNVDA is growing in the server space, but not unperturbed. Competition is growing faster than NVDA is improving, and this space will be under attack in the coming half-decade. On the gaming front, NVDA is seeing it's gap close against AMD, but NVDA still has a far superior software stack. INTC is entering the GPU space in both server and consumer segments. This will still take them time, but in this time, they'll likely also remedy a lot of their FAB issues.\n\nOverall, I think AMD and NVDA have more downside than upside risk atm. They're both very vulnerable to competition, fighting for fab space and very vulnerable to any trade issues (fabs are overseas).\n\nJust my own thoughts, though.",
