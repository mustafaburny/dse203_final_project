        "body": "After we killed the Iranian terrorist dude, Sulamani, about a year ago I went in big on a number of cloud security stocks including $NET.  I am a software and devops engineer with a lot of exp in the industry and I have seen demos/sales pitches from just about every one of these companies and used many of them (good and bad).  So I bought the stocks that I make good products I enjoy using and trust as a consumer of these products.  Full disclosure, I made these picks because their tech works and I feel that technical leadership in this area will beat out accounting, marketing, and other aspects of successful companies.  That bet has paid off with 300-400% gains in the last year for the companies I bought with every penny of available capital \\~yr ago.  Those were $NET, $CRWD, and $ZS I am still long on these.  I also was into $MSFT which is good in this respect and $ESTC (which I unfortunately sold around $100 because they were going sideways). I have since gone into $FROG, $PLTR, and $SUMO which are more recent IPOs.\n\nThere are a few categories of attack that you worry about from an IT organizational standpoint.  This list is in no particular order other than the first one because you asked about $NET.\n\n* Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)\n   * Cloudflare ($NET) is the best protection you can have for this.  End of story.  They have many other products that make them a great company. They have introduced a new set of tools that cover everything you need for a work anywhere company.  They also have made some things that do for cloud computing what CDNs (like Akamai) did for static content.  There main competitors are Fastly, Akamai, and Limelight but $NET is best from tech standpoint.\n* ID management and access control\n   * $MSFT, $OKTA, Ping, Sailpoint from login perspective\n   * $FROG is also good from the perspective of managing access control to intellectual property\n* Malicious websites and phishing \n   * $ZS, $PANO, Fortinet, and a few others play in this space\n* Post attack cleanup\n   * $CRWD is the best here\n   * $ESTC is actually the best but it is open source and european which I think had some negative influences for me as an investor.   Splunk, $SUMO, Data Dog, and Snowflake can also be really good in this regard \n* Secure development\n   * There are a few companies but all of their stuff is hum drum",

But I am sure that wasn't the same for everyone. \n\nIf you were fortunate to have chosen a stock that recovered quickly and continued to climb then that's great. But that was not true for many other high-flyers stocks. Cisco for example has never recovered from it's highs. Akamai has never come close to recovering. Microsoft took about 10-15 years to recover.  Verisign which was the hot cybersecurity stock or the day is now only starting to recover.

(I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",
