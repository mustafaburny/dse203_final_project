        "body": "After we killed the Iranian terrorist dude, Sulamani, about a year ago I went in big on a number of cloud security stocks including $NET.  I am a software and devops engineer with a lot of exp in the industry and I have seen demos/sales pitches from just about every one of these companies and used many of them (good and bad).  So I bought the stocks that I make good products I enjoy using and trust as a consumer of these products.  Full disclosure, I made these picks because their tech works and I feel that technical leadership in this area will beat out accounting, marketing, and other aspects of successful companies.  That bet has paid off with 300-400% gains in the last year for the companies I bought with every penny of available capital \\~yr ago.  Those were $NET, $CRWD, and $ZS I am still long on these.  I also was into $MSFT which is good in this respect and $ESTC (which I unfortunately sold around $100 because they were going sideways). I have since gone into $FROG, $PLTR, and $SUMO which are more recent IPOs.\n\nThere are a few categories of attack that you worry about from an IT organizational standpoint.  This list is in no particular order other than the first one because you asked about $NET.\n\n* Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)\n   * Cloudflare ($NET) is the best protection you can have for this.  End of story.  They have many other products that make them a great company. They have introduced a new set of tools that cover everything you need for a work anywhere company.  They also have made some things that do for cloud computing what CDNs (like Akamai) did for static content.  There main competitors are Fastly, Akamai, and Limelight but $NET is best from tech standpoint.\n* ID management and access control\n   * $MSFT, $OKTA, Ping, Sailpoint from login perspective\n   * $FROG is also good from the perspective of managing access control to intellectual property\n* Malicious websites and phishing \n   * $ZS, $PANO, Fortinet, and a few others play in this space\n* Post attack cleanup\n   * $CRWD is the best here\n   * $ESTC is actually the best but it is open source and european which I think had some negative influences for me as an investor.   Splunk, $SUMO, Data Dog, and Snowflake can also be really good in this regard \n* Secure development\n   * There are a few companies but all of their stuff is hum drum",

Their balance sheet is a bit sketch given their debt load which is the primary reason the share price is so low. However they used low interest rates to completely restructure their debt and paid down a good chunk. With near term maturity dates pushed out and lower interest payments, Lumen should be able to invest in growth. \n\nWhile their consumer business (CenturyLink) may take a hit due the 5G rollout, their rest of the company is positioned to power the transformation and they could be a huge player.  They have laid, and continue to lay, fiber in Asia which gives them some of the broadest reach of all global carriers and strengthens their already strong position with global multinationals.  They are also adding edge computing and security services to their portfolio that will help them take market share from the likes for Akamai, Fastly and CloudFlare. Admittedly, these competitors are way ahead in their services but the fact the there are so many recent entrants in this sector shows that CDN is commoditizing and it shouldn\u2019t be too hard for Lumen to build a competing platform. My own company uses some of their more advanced services at price points their competitors can\u2019t touch. \n\nLet\u2019s ride this \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "body": "Ok, let's talk about Tesla.\n\nFor the record, I do not own any Tesla stock, nor do I own a Tesla car, nor do I plan to own either in the foreseeable future. (I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",

EIGHT dollars! 92 percent drop. Even though Amazon recovered 10 years later, is anyone going to be able to stomach a 92% drop? I doubt it. Way better to get out now, and look to buy at a reasonable level, even if you think the stock is a winner in 15 years.

        "body": "Thanks for providing some supporting evidence. I would say my only remaining question, which I'm not sure we can actually properly answer with the available data, is whether or not all this capital flowing into railroad investments during the 19th century would have yielded investors with returns. Capital can flow into a sector without ever being returned to shareholders and I think this could have been the case with something like the early days of railroads. The capital would have been used to develop new technology and build infrastructure and many of these companies would have been leveraged and in a environment with high competition. As you mention, we know that some of them paid dividends, but would that actually offset the cost of other railroads going out of business and their stock going to zero?\n\nI remembered this podcast that I listened to recently that talks about investing in technological revolutions and they mention the railroad mania as an example. Part of the idea is that some companies will come out of these tech revolutions and winners and some will come out as losers, but it's often very hard to predict who. You can think of the tech bubble in 2000 as an example, almost everyone thought Cisco would be huge, but they still haven't reached their previous high from 2000. On the other hand, no one would have predicted Amazon, a book seller would be what it is today. In the same way, if you'd invested in Kansas City Southern 100 years ago you'd be very happy, but if you'd invested in The Ann Arbor Railroad you would have lost everything.\n\nHere is a link to the podcast if you are interested. They also go into some of the theories, based on the efficient market hypothesis, that try to explain the returns that typically come out of these tech revolutions: https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/123",

Don't take it wrong, I agree with you to some degree, but I feel like it's a one sided list, while it would be worth to consider the differences to the dotcom bubble too, since many companies are backed up fundamentally a lot more than that time.\n\nTesla is a pretty complex topic. While I don't agree that they can't potentially be the new paradigm and disrupt several different industries at once, valuation still matters. The best example is Cisco. During the dotcom bubble, the sentiment was that the internet is the future, and any company associated with it can be a huge winner. Cisco, as basically an infrastructure building/supply chain company of the next big thing was a sure bet also.\n\n* Did the internet became the future? In a way, yes!\n* Was Cisco a good company? It was and it's still solid today.\n* Did these factors justify the huge valuation during that period? **Hell no!**\n\nEvery time I argue about Tesla being overvalued, fans say \"bUt It'S dA fUtuReE!!!4!\". Yes, it very well might be, but it still can be overvalued now as an investment...duh.\n\nI was just wondering today how interesting it is that we see potential bubbles forming in both the stock market and \"commodities\" like crypto (you listed these as if they were one market, but IMO they are very different assets).

They have been slowly moving towards a subscription-based business model that focuses on remote services and I think it's fair to say that they will continue to gradually increase their revenue numbers.

Many dot com survivors, good companies, just now reaching year 2000 levels (e.g. Cisco). 20 years later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTSLA would need to take over the entirety of the vehicle manufacturing industry to grow into its current valuation. Even if you believe the TSLA story, that'd take 20 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\netc. etc. etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course valuation matters. A good company doesn't mean it's a good stock to buy.  When buying a stock, you're buying a piece of the business. You need to expect a reasonable return on this purchase. If I were to offer you amazon stock for $1,000,000/share, would that make sense? Would the valuation not matter because it's a good company that has expected growth? How about $10,000,000/share? $100,000,000? Of course that's ludicrous. The valuation always matters. There is a point there, well before $1M/share where it becomes ridiculous to buy into AMZN, regardless of how \"good\" you think the company is. To say valuation does not matter is complete and utter nonsense.",

Imo P/E is completely irrelevant for growth companies (especially in tech sector) when you compare them, they usually want to minimize earnings and do more growth.\n\nIf we just compare historical P/S of AMZN and TSLA  you can easily see those two are completely different growth companies in terms of marketcap exceeding the revenue:\n\n [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/price-sales](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/price-sales)\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/price-sales](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/price-sales)\n\nAMZN P/S was increasing steadily with its growth (P/S of 2-4), while TSLA P/S went from 3 to 25 P/S in the last 12 months. \n\nIs this the new pattern of a growth company or are we seeing another Cisco or Yahoo story from 2000 ?",

So my mother is transferring her 401k from her previous employer and I will manage it for her. I wanted to get some thoughts on asset allocation. \n\nHer scenario is she doesn\u2019t need this money within the next 10 years at least. She is still working self employed. She is 60 doesn\u2019t have any debt has other passive income (rentals), cure t holding are random funds her employer had with mass mutual they will be liquidated into cash and put into a traditional Roth. Risk tolerance I would say a 5 out of 10 (10 being very risky).\n\nMy thoughts where to select a handful of dividend stocks for 50-60% i like names such as jnj, mmm, xom, T, pg, Abbv, csco, ibm (trying to stick with dividend champion companies that are reasonably priced now..) etc and then the remaining 20% would be in a couple vanguard bond funds and remaining 20% in a vanguard s&amp;p fund. \n\nAny inout would be great this isn\u2019t her complete retirement fund it is a small portion and 1 of 3 of her retirement accounts. \n\nThanks,",

Would the valuation not matter because it's a good company that has expected growth? How about $10,000,000/share? $100,000,000? Of course that's ludicrous. The valuation always matters.

Imo P/E is completely irrelevant for growth companies (especially in tech sector) when you compare them, they usually want to minimize earnings and do more growth.\n\nIf we just compare historical P/S of AMZN and TSLA  you can easily see those two are completely different growth companies in terms of marketcap exceeding the revenue:\n\n [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/price-sales](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/price-sales)\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/price-sales](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/price-sales)\n\nAMZN P/S was increasing steadily with its growth (P/S of 2-4), while TSLA P/S went from 3 to 25 P/S in the last 12 months. \n\nIs this the new pattern of a growth company or are we seeing another Cisco or Yahoo story from 2000 ?",

        "body": "The comparisons to the dotcom bubble are absolutely maddening to me. A couple additional points below:\n1) To add onto your first point, the Nasdaq also jumped from like 1,400 to a peak of 5,050 in less than 2 years, while the Nasdaq is only up ~31% between February and 12/31/20. \n\n2) My central point of frustration is these articles, tweets, posts, etc all make it seem like the dotcom bubble burst over night, just like magic, poof 90% of the Nasdaq wiped out overnight. In reality, the crash took over a year to play out and there were plenty of opportunities to sell your positions. For example: Cisco peaked in March 2000, then decreased by about $10 per share on a monthly basis until April 2001. Even if you won 1st place in the bagholding competition, how long did you decide to hold the bag? \n\n3a) although there is certainly a lot of speculation going on now, the dotcom bubble was all speculation. Even Wall Street was buying up shit companies because tech was new and few people understood it. Everyone wanted a piece of tech but tech wasn\u2019t ingrained into our daily lives as it is now. The Covid Crash proved that tech is essential to not only our daily lives but critical to the global economy. Over the next decade, tech will become bigger, stronger and faster but that can\u2019t be said about other sectors who were adversely affected by the crash. \n\n3b) personally, I think we (the global economy) are at the dawn of the next tech revolution (industrial revolution 4.0). By 2030, technology will be so far ahead of where we stand today that the tech of our childhoods will be almost unrecognizable (if you have small children, now might be a good time to do a 10 or 20 year time capsule with them). 5G will pave the way for autonomous driving, robotic surgeries, AI and automation. Renewable energy is declining significantly in price where we will reach a point that it becomes widely adopted. First, the government will push forward green energy initiatives garnering business interest &amp; adoption which will result in the wide spread adoption by the general public. By 2030, you will be \u2018shunned\u2019 by society for not being \u2018green\u2019, \n\n4) there will be bubble stocks that pop, but I think this will be compartmentalized and the blows will not drag down the entire market. Moving forward, it is critical that you are investing in great companies and industry leaders. Do you due diligence. Have a plan in place. Dont invest in a company because everyone else is doing such (I.e. no FOMO trades). Determine where the \u2018smart\u2019 money moved / is moving \n\n5) Tesla is one that will always be an internal struggle for me. Based on their historical performance, they are extremely overvalued but if Elon\u2019s plan comes to fruition they might be substantially undervalued. Even though they have experienced some delays, Elon has executed his long range vision almost to a T. 1) build luxury long-range EV to garner interest while earning higher margins due to limited production capacity, 2) use cash flows from luxury model to create mid-tier model to increase awareness, 3) after enough factories have been built, use cash flows from 1 &amp; 2 to create economy class EV. 4) as technology improves over time, begin building robo-taxis, which will eventually change the way we travel from A to B forever, 5) use profits and future capital calls to expand business and revenue streams: solar panels, insurance, battery production, battery storage, semi-trucks and software licensing. \n-he\u2019s nailed point #1, #2 and part of #5, point #3 sounds like it\u2019s in the near future \n-from my view, Elon was never about selling the most cars. Elon sells cars only to bridge the gap until technology caught up to his vision of a world where autonomous vehicles reign supreme. At some point in time, it will become more cost effective to use a robo-taxi than to buy your own car. This is what Elon aims to capitalize on, he isn\u2019t concerned about everyone buying his car as he wants his cars to take you everywhere. \n-the biggest issue I have with comparing Tesla to the likes of Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota is that these companies often sell their cars at a loss or break even point because they make their profits from repairs, maintenance and selling OEM parts which is why they were so resistant to EVs as they require far less than maintenance than ICE vehicles.",

        "body": "Yeah sure I was 20 myself just getting started in 2000 and the internet was really taking off. Basically every solid company was trading at an insane valuation. I remember Cisco as it was one of the buys I made with my meager funds as a 20 year old. So I basically bought this wonderful company Cisco for an insane valuation probably about 50 times warnings which translated into ludicrously high growth thst was simply not possible.\n\nThere were so many examples of this even non tech companies like coca cola I recall there was a book I read which noted its valuation in 2000 would mean that they'd need several Americans to start taking baths with coca cola.\n\nI'm glad I learned these lessons early in my life as now I might miss out on things like tesla and Shopify mania but I can still scoop up solid companies at good valuations.\n\nMy example to a young guy like you would be the following - there is a massive difference in a buying a great company like Apple at 20x earnings vs 40x earnings. It's not a great investment at any price.\n\nImo tesla Shopify investors will learn the hard way. No way on earth is Shopify a better business than td or rbc yet its got a larger market cap than banks which make money hand over fist and are the backbone of any nations economy.\n\nValuation is the key as we can't predict how and when the bubble will burst (yes we are in one) hope that helps.",

The only stand out was CSCO at 220 although right now TSLA is sitting at what 1500?\n\nOf course interest rates are rock bottom right now and that does put some upwards pressure on stock prices.

        "body": "Ok, let's talk about Tesla.\n\nFor the record, I do not own any Tesla stock, nor do I own a Tesla car, nor do I plan to own either in the foreseeable future. (I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",
