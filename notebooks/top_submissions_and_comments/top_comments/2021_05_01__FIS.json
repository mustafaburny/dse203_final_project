        "body": "If you have enough money in a trading account the company (Fidelity, Charles Schwab, etc.) will let you buy stocks on credit. This can amplify your gains - but also amplifies your loses which can easily wipe out your investment. \n\nAs an example, say I have 100k in Fidelity. I purchased a stock and it goes up 10% - it's now worth 110k - a nice 10k profit. However, if I wanted I could purchase on margin (credit) - using Fidelities money I buy $1 million in stock. This same 10% rise turns my 100k + 900k from Fidelity into $1.1 million - I see a profit of 100k on a 100k investment by leveraging the banks money to increase my position. This works great when the stocks (or options) value rises - the gains are amplified.\n\nThe opposite side occurs as well. Take the same example - $1 million in stock, $100k cash + $900k borrowed on margin - but the stock goes down 10%. If using only your money your $100k goes down to $90k. You lost 10%. Now with margin - your $100k + Fidelities $900k goes down 10%. However Fidelity is going to cover their loss. They do this through a margin call. Basically they have the right to sell all your assets they hold to prevent loss. They sell your full position - all $100k leaving you with $0 to make sure they get back the money they borrowed you (your now $90k + their now $810k = $900k you borrowed). \n\nBasically margin calls can wipe out your full position if the stock you bought on margin drops too much. Look at the recent collapse of Archegos Capital if your curious what a margin call in the billions of dollars looks like. Banks registered big losses because a Hedge Fund made some bad leveraged trades to an extreme scale.",

I also don't know how many players we really need in that space.  \n\nSo far I think nobody is leading in truth.  If Regulatory changes occur re: open banking (which they probably will) then the playing field gets leveled pretty quickly and you go back to the ones building tech as the favorites.
