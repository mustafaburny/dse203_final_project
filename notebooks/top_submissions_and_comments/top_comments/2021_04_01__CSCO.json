(We're using entirely x64 traditional architecture in our fleet right now.) \n\nAs Hyperconverged network/virtualization/storage/compute infrastructure continues to grow in the datacenter world, AMD will need to compete with non-traditional companies in this sector like Cisco, but I believe the cost of Cisco Hyperconverged infrastructure limits their appeal to many SMB size companies. \n\nLastly, I see regular advertisements from HPE (our current vendor) showcasing the benefits of AMD processors in the datacenter, but I see little from Dell EMC and some other vendors we are working with. If AMD can secure the kind of exposure they are getting from HPE with other vendors and increase their name recognition and reputation in the Datacenter market, thats going to be a massive boost to sales. \n\n\\*Disclosure\\* I own AMD stock, my personal machine has an AMD processor, and I would do unspeakable acts for a 6000 series graphics card. Do your own research, and I am not a financial advisor. \n\nTl;Dr: AMD make expensive machines go brrrrrrrr, I like the stock, etc.",

And due to regulatory systems where I live, I paid 0% income tax (instead of 25%) on this asset. This is similar in other parts of the world, which adds interest in this asset class.",

The share price peaked before Obama was President, never recovered, and was trading at current prices when he left? Unless you believe Biden for some reason has some raging hard-on for BB that doesn't breach any conflict of interest or doesn't damage his reputation, I can't see why a Biden administration would favour BB massively. I also don't really see how BB would have friends in high places - where? John Chen's only been CEO since 2013, so for half the Obama presidency (and after BBs peak relevancy). And how would those friends in high places be any different to the friends any powerful CEO would have? I imagine Bill Gates/Satya Nadella and the rest of Microsoft could sway the US government far more effectively.\n\nI know Obama used to use a BB phone, but he switched during his presidency, and I can't find what phone Biden uses. Additionally BB doesn't really make phones anymore so I can't see how it'd be too helpful. Might benefit TCL if the licensed BB phones are still in use. So I don't think there's even a serious reputational bonus for BB in the US government.\n\nI mean obviously it's pure speculation talking about FB/Google etc, but until we start seeing serious repercussions for data leaks does it really matter? The whole cambridge analytica scandal cost FB $5bn, nothing. Data leak the other day affected over 500mn people and there's not much talk of serious repercussions. They can get grilled all they want they won't stop until there is serious consequences, and tbh I don't see Biden delivering that.\n\nTalking of SolarWinds - you know the US government hasn't even announced they'll stop using SolarWinds, let alone the myriad of other suppliers like VMware, Cisco, Crowdstrike, Microsoft, GrammaTech, etc etc? I'd stake a bet that BB might be able to take advantage in a small way and get some more security contracts, but until I see that the US government is seriously thinking of shifting its cybersecurity outsourcing to BB I'm not going to believe it.",

I have a few new buys from last year or slightly earlier  that have became multibaggers....these companies have good stories, good growth but they are priced many multiples of current revenue, have little or no net income (but they nice operating margins and operating income so the reason they don't have net income is because profits go back into the business for reinvestment or marketing to increase market share) and they have to keep growing in the double digits to meet lofty expectations of growth. Any slight upset and the share price can tank and if there's a macro event that affects their business, it could have a similar response to the Dotcom bubble bursting IMHO. Dotcom blue chip darlings like Cisco, Microsoft, EMC were priced similarly (though they had netincome) but the multiples were crushed after the dotcom bubble burst. It took Microsoft some 10+ years &amp; starting a dividend to get back to it's 2000 high, EMC never did and neither did Cisco after all these years.",

        "body": "Good discussions are always welcome.\n\nThey do have a loyal customer base. I've known a couple photographers since the 80's who have only ever bought Macintosh. Trouble is in the PC market it's a winner take all, and they've never gotten anywhere close to displacing Microsoft &amp; the PC. For most of modern history Microsoft has owned something like 90% of the OS marketshare.\n\nIt doesn't seem to me like the phone market is the same situation. At least not yet. Perhaps it is just slower developing into dominant players on account of more global players in tech than the 90's had, but we are looking at Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, etc. Apple had just 21% in Q4 2020, according to Counterpoint - and that was the biggest marketshare of any. Hardly a monopoly.\n\nSecurity is definitely important, but it's not always an economic factor. What a reasonable person might think \"Yeah definitely I want a secure device\" doesn't always translate into the best security-focused companies wins. Look at the Equifax debacle. Talk about complete failure at the most basic levels. That problem rolled off their back like water off a duck. People were outraged, it's quickly forgotten in the news churn. When it comes to spending money on security upgrades (and people training!) any IT manager on earth will tell you it tends to be the lowest possible priority, right above fixing that broken soap dispenser in the men's room.\n\nGoogle's dominance (in my view) is the fact that their API's and enabling software have tentacles into so many of the world's web services. If you want a fascinating experiment *block all google owned domains/IPs from your PC's localhost file* and then surf around the web a while. See just how many websites and services break.\n\nThey own the #1 and #2 most visited websites in the world (Google and Youtube), and it isn't even close (22B visits in February). #3 (Facebook) had 3.75B. #4 Amazon had 3.25B. #5 Wikipedia had 3.08B. #6 Yahoo 1.83B.\n\nThe 4 largest websites that are not Google-owned barely make up 50% of the visits Google sees each month.\n\nThe trouble smart phones are going to run into, I think, **is the problem of state-sanctioned monopoly**. When Microsoft dominated the PC market, it was basically the US, Europe and Japan. Some semiconductors in Korea, if we're being generous. But basically all the heavy lifting of added-value was happening in the US (Intel, IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Novell (deceased), Apple, Sun Microsystems, etc).\n\nBut now the game is worldwide. China, Korea, lots of other places have real production capabilities and smart phones have opened a new frontier to own an enabling technology. Nation-states aren't stupid, they don't want to be beholden to the guy across the pond for their critical infrastructure. So they start putting protectionism into place and guarding the home-grown flavors, because those are the companies they can directly influence.\n\nWe're seeing a lot of this with EV's too. I don't know how it ends. Apple could turn out to own the whole cell phone pile. But I think it's a very risk that Google isn't nearly as susceptible to. I see no way Baidu or Yandex ever finds it's way into competing in western markets for search dominance.",

They are competing with Dell, Cisco, Ericsson, Verizon, Samsung, Huawei; even other companies you wouldn't think about telecommunications have their own hardware as well such as Facebook and Google.\n\nNokia also has a massive amount of fucking shares. They need extremely large movements in order to raise the stock price. Movements like being the first to market in 6g (or whatever the fucked up name is for the next iteration) not being a mid player in a oversaturated market..\n\nAs for BB (and I say this as a recently dumped bagholder, still have my Jan 2023 15C leaps), they have done nothing to proven they know how to pivot to a SaaS company. You mention cybersecurity... every company is selling cybersecurity services for IoT. Go on the AWS market place and you can choose from hundreds of SMEs as consultants:\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/security/partner-solutions/?partner-solutions-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.partnerNameLower&amp;partner-solutions-cards.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-type=*all&amp;awsf.Filter%20Name%3A%20partner-solutions-filter-partner-categories=*all&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-location=*all#Consulting_Partners\n\ndon't want services, what about products?\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/solutions/security\n\nLiterally click any box and you'll see dozens of services overall.\n\nJust because BB put up a shite product on the AWS Marketplace doesn't mean much, I can do the same thing after paying some fees as well. It's equivalent to the app store.\n\nThis is also just one ecosystem, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, etc all have equivalents.\n\nWhat about direct companies? Companies like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, CyberArk, Zscaler, FireEye, Proofpoint.\n\nBB is terrible about productization. There's a reason why talent is flocking to companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Oracle, Netflix, etc; because BB is a dead-end.\n\nThey have to do a lot, they don't need a management shakeup; they need a shakeup in their board and executive team. I don't see that happening, so unless they give their management the go-ahead to make and experience many possible sources of revenue they will continue to falter behind.",

But the real story was the correction statement: \"Not included in the 2020 Q1 financials are the previously referenced Bitcoin buys of 513 BTC (circa 2014) and the conflicting 576 BTC (circa 2016) as seen and carried over from previous managements reports. As of Q1 2020 current management has yet to receive any company (CCTL) books, statements, bank info, property, assets or proof of any Bitcon holdings from old management. All previous financial reports 2018 and 2019 were mostly reconstructed from previous reports filed by Coin Citadel and old CEO Bill Schaefer. Without substantive proof of current Bitcoin holdings still held by old management, or that a loss was incurred from an unusual event and or negligent action by prior management due to lost access to private keys and or wallets, or Bitcoin was sold and previous sale was never disclosed to new management, Coin Citadel cannot continue to reference the aforementioned Bitcoin Treasury in its financials moving forward.\"\n\nSo it's either been a scam or someone pocketed 500+ bitcoin, or someone lost access to wallets.

It's amazing what the compounding will accomplish by allowing the funds to reinvest the dividends and capital gains back info the funds.

In other words the un verified unsecured currencies died a decade plus ago from not being hack proof.\n\nThe currencies are currently competing with each other the same way the Yen, Euro, US dollar and more are competing with each other. They all have their own supply and demand and the more credible companies hop on, the more credible it will get.(compared to currencies being manipulated by stimulus packages, interest rates and buying other currencies). \n\n\nIt IS being regulated and audited. The mid February crash happened because some firm falsely stated that they found a double transaction. It was later backtracked but the damage was done. \n\nThe values is linked to how hard it is to mine 1 coin at this point. You could mine a coin with an idle computer so at the time it was chump change, now it takes high powered hardware, a heavy electricity bill and a ton of cooling to get one so the price goes along with it + how it can only get harder to have one. \n\nYour coins are as secure as you make it. There are crypted USB keys  to keep your wallet safe but like everything, the more valuable it is, the more someone will have the patience to get it.\n\nThe future is in that it cuts currency exchange fees(the banks) and rates(the government) and financial institutions from host to client. You get a coin, you trade parts of it the way you want internationally or confidentially with no brick and mortar fees. \n\nThe GME saga showed big banks can and will interfere to make money over the well being of free market.\n\nBitcoin might not be the end all solution but something can be said about the infrastructure behind it where no \"package\"(hash) can be hacked since the time and date , the number of characters, sender and receivers , and so much of the the data that makes the hash can be used to encrypt it thus can't be \"reinserted\" in the blockchain.",
