If this started a week ago and you chose Tesla, then you'd be a happy camper right now!  But I think it'll pull back quite a bit after some hype wears off.  Stocks that shoot up very high and very quick like that always pull back, sometimes a lot.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this project is how investing shouldn't be boiled down to weeks, but I guess that's all the time you have to work with in a school.  So my advice:  if you do this for real when you're older, think about 8 YEARS instead of just weeks or months!\n\nStill reading, or getting bored yet?  Here are some picks:  Amazon, Mastercard or Visa, Shopify, The Trade Desk, Adobe, Cognex, MongoDB, Match Group, Okta, Stitch Fix, Square, Twilio, Zscaler, Zoom Video Communications, MercadoLibre, Wix, Roku, Nvidia, Netflix, Micron Technology.  Given your short time frame, some of these should give you a good boost during that time - unless the market has a bit of a correction, which it might because it's been \"hot\" lately.  Pick some, pick all, whatever your teacher lets you do.  Hope this helps!",

AMD is making CPUs that are blowing the data center market away when it comes to performance, Nvidia is making the best GPUs money can buy and Intel is presumably doing something. \n\nGame streaming is GOING to become ubiquitous in the near future because consoles cost money and so do graphics cards. All the shit for Brains window lickers said the same fuckin thing about video streaming \n\n\"Bro, there's no way that will take off!\"\n\n\"Bro, blockbuster has the Lions share of the rental market, what the fuck is Netflix?\"\n\nGuess who won out? Netflix won out so fucking hard on their streaming service that they spun their DVD mail order rental business off into its own thing. Is that doing well? Sure, but does it matter? No.\n\nSo here's what is going to happen. Every single industry is moving towards the software as a service business model whether you like it or not and whether it's a good thing or not. Take a look at adobe for confirmation you literally cannot BUY a copy of Photoshop anymore other than legacy versions because of their SaaS model.\n\nNvidia was working on this project for 3 years and they've don't the math and if I know anything to be true, Asians are good at math. if this game streaming idea wasn't the most profitable avenue, they wouldn't have thrown down the gauntlet against google stadia. Nvidias GeForce now service is so good that they undercut stadias price point by $15 because that's how confident they are they will own this market. \n\nIf you're looking for short term gains, buy June $300 calls before it goes back up but don't discount the stock either because it's going to be jack hammering Google's asshole until it looks like hamburger meat in the near future. AMD and Nvidia are going to be good long term returns regardless.",

They were all U.S. stocks before and will be U.S. stocks again (except SHOP).  My winners were SHOP, MA, PYPL, TTD, ADBE, FB, MTCH, OKTA, TWLO, ZS.  Most of these doubled, some multiplied in value.  SHOP went up 10x, MA went up 3.5x, MTCH, OKTA, and PYPL more than doubled.  I took small losses only in CGNX, MDB, SFIX, and SQ but I was more interested in drastically reducing my mortgage interest.  I now use that saved interest to re-invest into my TFSA.  Overall portfolio gain (winners minus losers) was 87% in less than 6 years.\n\nAMZN remains in my RRSP, currently up 5.5x.  I also immediately re-bought MA, PYPL, SHOP, and TTD last summer for my RRSP because those are the ones I couldn't live without owning.  Only PYPL is losing (by less than 1%) whereas SHOP is up 69% once again and MA up 20%.  BTW, each stock I sold is still on my watchlist for future re-purchase.\n\nThat's way more than I wanted to share, but I get really annoyed when people doubt me.\n\nThe point being that SHOP is a buy no matter what price it's currently at.  You need to look at the future prospects of a company, not just where it's currently at and ESPECIALLY NOT current share price.",

        "body": "&gt;So design should be based on what? One persons opinion?\n\nYes.  Or only a handful of people who work as a team.  You haven't heard the expression, \"too many chefs in the kitchen?\"\n\n&gt;Who decides how it SHOULD go? Epic uses data to determine the best workflow \u2014 fewest clicks, best outcomes in current practice, etc \u2014 and puts out a software designed with these workflows in mind. One person making this decision isn\u2019t going to make a better end product. And the reality is that organizations will deviate no matter who gives the recommendation because people with credentials after their name feel the need to justify their education and salaries.\n\nData is useful for scientific exploration.  It is NOT useful in designing usability for software.  \n\n&gt;This is absolutely a problem. There aren\u2019t enough qualified IT people in healthcare. Or really just in general. It\u2019s getting better but there\u2019s still a massive shortage.\n\nMore IT people isn't going to help the problem.  The problem is the fundamental model of Epic is not well-designed and depends far too much on healthcare workers who know what they need FOR THEIR JOB, but don't know what they need from Epic to get it done optimally.  \n\nLet me point out our example: I work at a rural hospital that has Epic courtesy of a larger academic hospital who we've teamed with.  So when they were first going to implement Epic, they asked us how we wanted our \"module\" to be built.  Our department consists of five people.  Two of us are MD's.  I'm the ONLY tech savvy person in the department.  Our staff is 3 people who are all women average age of 58.  The person who directs our workflow doesn't have a college degree.  Yet, they expected us to know how Epic, a software that we had no experience in, should build our module.  Then later, when we encountered problems or missing codes, or things we wanted to change, they either took forever to get done, or simply were ignored.  The IT team eventually got fed up with all of our requests and said that they couldn't do anything more for us because what we wanted wasn't \"critical\".   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The usability issues typically come from the local IT folks you mentioned above. But it\u2019s not really fair to compare something like Epic to a basic iOS app. It\u2019s more comparable to something like the adobe suite or audio editing software. Try jumping into photoshop and finding your way around with minimal training. It\u2019s not easy.\n\nIt's absolutely fair.  Let's be clear about what healthcare IT software really is.  The fundamental need for healthcare IT software is to function as a tool to record and communicate information.  Healthcare is complicated.  The tool to record and communicate that information should not be.   You cannot compare this to Adobe Suite or Audio Editing.  Those kinds of software are meant to be used by professionals only and virtually all of them are tech savvy.  Healthcare IT software is used by a LOT of people, many if not most, are not tech savvy.  This includes the doctors and nurses.  It HAS to be usable by a lot of tech ignorant people.  \n\nHere's another example of the early days of our using Epic.  When I first started entering my reports, every once in awhile, the screen would seemingly hang.  Nothing I typed into the keyboard would do anything on the screen.  However, the mouse worked fine, and if I switched to another window, the keyboard would type just fine.  I had to logout of Epic and then back in to get it work again.  I told the IT people about it and they investigated.  A month went by and they still had no idea what was going on.  They couldn't replicate it, and neither could I.  But it happened sporadically.  Like at least twice a week. It didn't happen to anyone else.  FINALLY, one day I figured out what happened.  My keyboard has a backslash key above the Enter key that I was accidentally brushing when I was typing.  Apparently, doing this while in a report, it functions as some kind of \"escape\" key.  If you keep typing on the keyboard, nothing appears.  However, if you tap it again, it brings up a little window that shows everything you were typing while it was in \"escape\" mode.  The IT people had no idea why it was doing that nor what it was for.  There is NO indication on the screen that you've entered this mode, or what that little window is for after you type it in.  As far as I can tell, it's some developer's backdoor way of doing something to the system. \n\nBut that is a small example of all the little random unexplainable shit that happens in Epic.\n\nI haven't seen anything in Epic that couldn't done a LOT better.  The problem is that the fundamental model that Epic is built on is inadequate to accommodate the functionality that now is expected in healthcare IT systems.  But Epic is SO big and so widely used, that they will never start over from scratch.  \n\n&gt;Judy is that person. She\u2019s not perfect but she\u2019s already accomplished exactly what your asking of a healthcare professional.\n\nOkay, it's pretty clear that you work for Epic at this point.  Judy is NOT Steve Jobs.  Maybe she's a good company leader.  But she's certainly not a visionary.  I get frustrated with Epic not because it's not functional.   We certainly CAN get our jobs done by figuring out workarounds.  But there are so many examples of things that shouldn't need a workaround.  I get frustrated because being a tech savvy person, I KNOW that current day software is capable of so much more and has been for a long time.  Another example?  The search bar in Epic feels like it's there just because Google made it trendy.  I've tried searching for so many things.  It's pretty much useless.  If I have to learn how to use a search bar, it's already a failure.  \n\n&gt;No physician I talk to is happy with Epic or Cerner.\n\nThat\u2019s anecdotal. Read reviews on HIMSS. Epic is the best reviewed enterprise EMR. Period. Most of the reviews are positive.\n\nIf you asked a society of software engineers back in the 80's how they liked Unix, the reviews would also be nearly universally positive.  If we just said that was good enough, we would have never gotten Windows or Mac OS.  \n\n&gt;I get where you\u2019re coming from. I listen to physicians complain about Epic on a daily basis, but when I start to dig down into the issue, the overwhelming majority of the complaints aren\u2019t BECAUSE of Epic. There\u2019s something else that\u2019s causing the issue. And when I ask if they have a better solution, most cannot actually produce any viable ideas. It\u2019s all smoke. The average MD has an insane amount of hubris when it comes to other fields outside of theirs. Just because you have a shitload of medical training doesn\u2019t mean you have any clue how to build software or run a multi-billion dollar enterprise. (Not singling you out personally, just again, the average MD)\n\nIt's not up to physicians to come up with the solution.  That's the whole point.  Just like food critics don't need to be world class chefs to be able to tell what's good food from bad food.    To be a leader in any field means presenting to the public what they never knew they needed.  I presume you are aware of the history of technology.  You shouldn't need me to explain this to you.",

It's run up a lot lately but has strong support in mid 50s.\n\nSPCE is a meme stock but can make you rich or wipe you out. Keep bets small and potentially triple your money or more.

But the usage case you mentioned is probably already solved with iPad Pros.\n\nIn the context of iPadOS, which is just a variation of iOS, there's a lot of apps that support split-screen, take advantage of the bigger screen and keyboard optimized. \n\nThis is due to the fact that the iPads continue to sell very well, and we see a huge demand for iPad Pros for light professional use cases such as word, emails, excel documentation, note-taking and digital art. Many people who buys MacBooks just for simple things can bring all their use cases on to the iPad Pros.  \nBecause of these market demands and powerful hardware of the iPad Pros, you see more optimized apps such as Adobe with full flagship photoshop and lightroom popping up.   \n\nIn the context of Android, because no one buys android tablets anymore, there's no point in optimizing specifically for tablet or split-screen usage. Even though the OS supports split-screen, for the size of the phone you can't really take advantage of the extra productivity.\n\nNow with the new wave of Android phones that supports foldable or multiple screens that can act essentially as a tablet. if they sell well and people want it, you will see more Android apps that optimize for split or multi-screens.  \n\nBut right now no, I doubt any apps will even use the Android official APIs to optimize for multi-screen let alone with the Microsoft Surface Duo SDK unless they partnered with Microsoft. Most developers will start optimizing when they see more market share of these kinds of devices.",

        "body": "Familys been in it for 40+ years. When you first start out you are going to literally bust your ass until you hit the point you can hire a driver to deal with the work.\n\nLets say you have a machine that takes 20 cases of soda to fill and you have 20 machines around. Your talking about 400 cases at 20 pounds a case. 8000 pounds.\n\nYour moving 8000 pounds at the store to your cart, from your cart to the truck, from the truck to the hand truck, from the handtruck into the machine. Can your back handle 32000 pounds and bending up and down each time you refill? Obviously rough math, but you get the idea.\n\nDo you have a vehicle that can handle this?\n\nRepair is dirty cheap if you have good machines and a good mechanic. Very easy to swap boards, validators, etc.\n\nStay away from snack and food machines if you are just starting out. Hassle to be cognizant of perishables and dates, etc. Need to consider how well candy holds as well - are you in Florida and have candy/chocolate machines?\n\nYou can absolutely crush it in the right location - but keep in mind its not get rich quick. It's get rich slow and by making sure your machines are all in a relatively close proximity (at least to start).\n\nWhen we do the rough math it usually comes out that 50% of sales price is profit. So for $1 can of soda, $.50 goes towards gas, products cost, commission, operational expense etc.\n\nHow do you plan on moving the machines? Each time you move its $150-$200. Where do you store them when not using?\n\nJust food for thought :)",
