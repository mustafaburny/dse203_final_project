        "body": "(Disclosure: I have a small position in IONQ and a smaller one in SNII--&gt;Rigetti) \n\nComments: \n\n1. OP is correct in saying that there's not much point in investing in the biggies (Alphabet, etc) as QUANTUM plays. (But SPY, QQQ, and the FAANGs or whatever are pretty good bets on large-cap tech in general.) \n2. RE: IONQ:  their investor pre-SPAC-merger presentations project significant revenue starting in 2023 and cash-flow-positive in 2025/6. Negligible actual revenue now, so things like PE are pretty meaningless.  Now that it's out of the SPAC  merry-go-round process, it's a highly speculative long-term bet on the company being one of the survivors that develop a useful QC architecture, and executing well enough to take advantage of it. \n3. However, IONQ has some impressive backing. Alphabet owns a bit over 10% of it (per E\\*Trade data). Its first operational computers are running in all three major clouds on a SaaS basis (selling presumably to those trying to develop quantum algorithms and languages.) They also have have partnerships with Goldman (experimenting with financial applications), Accenture and others. And lots of IP licensed from UMd, with whom they are also building a National Quantum Lab at Maryland (Q-Lab.) So I'd say that are on the short-list of quantum-computer-specialist companies, but again, highly speculative. \n4. Rigetti is another QC-specialist startup, now expected to go public via the SPAC route in the next few months. The SPAC sponsor is SuperNova Partners Acquisition Co. II Ltd -- SNII. Interesting about Rigetti is that one of their investors is IN-Q-Tel, the US Intelligence Community's \"venture-capital\" entity. No sure that means much--just interesting. \n5. RE: timeline for useful quantum computing capability.  I am NOT a physicist, so I am interested to see other comments suggesting that QC won't be real for a long time.  However, I did read and article this week on the potential challenges posed by QC threats to increasingly electronic and especially self-driving vehicles: basically, current encryption will be  broken by QC so computer-dependent automobiles will be vulnerable to hacking. The article noted that NIST, which has been working on quantum-safe encryption algorithms for some years now, advises that all sectors should plan to have their encryption and authentication infrastructures converted to quantum-safe algorithms not later than 2030.  (Which, BTW won't happen.)  So that's eight years and three weeks from now.   \n\nI would LOVE to have a good source to keep up with the \"short list\" of companies in the lead for developing practical QCs.  If there were an ETF doing that I'd buy it, but not if it is diluted with big companies like Alphabet, IBM, Honeywell, etc. Meanwhile, I'm trying to track any small QC-specialist companies that have public shares and seem to have a plausible approach to scalability, error correction and practical hardware requirements. Does anyone have a good source of such info, like a journal or quantum industry mag that is not so technical I can't read it? \n\nGood luck to all!",
