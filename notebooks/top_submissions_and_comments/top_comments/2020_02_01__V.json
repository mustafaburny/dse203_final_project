They are the most popular companies in this sub, but I think they are priced with such high expectations I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying at these prices. I own msft and Apple and am holding. But I bought significantly lower. Their multiples are all well above their historical range. I understand multiples are high across the board but I think it\u2019s an over crowded trade.\n\nI think brkb is good. Lots of cash to buy dips in the market, which I am predicting will occur in the next 3-5 years. It also trades at a very reasonable multiple.\n\nUber/lyft. I would pick one of these or both. Rideshare companies are going to focus on profitability rather than market share and I am confident both will achieve profitability by 2022. Fundamentally ridesharing is a much larger market than taxis since more people use apps because of convenience etc vs taxis. \n\nDocusign is a company that makes software for signing legal docs online. I think they have a lot of room to grow still because the current way of printing signing and faxing docs is so much more hassle. It\u2019s a really scalable and simple business. The valuation is very rich though. \n\nDisney. This is a commonly recommended company on this sub and I have to agree. I think they have great IP, lots of revenue streams. And Disney plus will be a big growth driver. Company has a tendency to consolidate for months before popping so be patient.\n\nMatch owns tinder and the ever increasingly popular hinge. I believe online and app dating will become the norm for people, as we are already seeing in the younger generation. People pay a lot to get better visibility on these apps, and I expect that to continue. Banking a lot on hinge to deliver additional growth to this company. \n\nI personally own all of these companies so I\u2019m definitely biased. All from lower prices but I think these all look good still.\n\nLike I said I actually still own Apple and Microsoft like others recommended but I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying more at current prices tbh. If you want a big tech play I\u2019d recommend amazon.",
