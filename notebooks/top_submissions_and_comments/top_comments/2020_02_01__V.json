        "body": "An interesting study on human behavior about denial vs. panic in an epidemic or pandemic: [Link](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html)\n\nFrom the 5 principle bulwarks in the article\n\n&gt;**Legitimize fear.** People go into denial because they don't feel entitled to be afraid. The more entitled people feel to be afraid, the less likely they are to go into denial. This is why the message, \"Don't be afraid,\" is a very destructive message in serious circumstances. Much superior is the message, \"Well, of course, you're afraid, I'm afraid too. We're all afraid. We'll get through this together.\"\n\nRemember this started with only a few cases in the beginning of January. We are currently over 40k infected and this is very underreported. We are anywhere between 300k-450k at this point in time. Here is a video from renown Prof. Neil Ferguson and his modeling for the virus: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALQTdCYGISw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost likely there were a lot more cases when it was initially reported on in December, however the reporters, doctors, journalists, etc. were arrested and silenced and the numbers will inherently be skewed. We know the Chinese are reporting false information of mortality rates because it is exactly 2.1%. They have recently changed what confirmed cases are and if you are not showing symptoms then you are not \"confirmed\" to have the coronavirus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat we'll see is continuing new all time highs in the markets is what I speculate as we've just recently closed today at new all time highs. \"Markets are forward looking\", that seems almost null and void at this point wouldn't you say? Something must be wrong. If China closes their factories, wouldn't the markets react? Shouldn't the markets react? Not necessarily so. Remember that JFK was assassinated and 3 days later  market recovered its losses. This is directly from Peter Lynch's book **One Up on Wall Street** [Link to chapter in book](https://books.google.com/books?id=KcJaXu7FVZ0C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=jfk+assassination+stock+market+rose+peter+lynch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e2OLuIAVFb&amp;sig=ACfU3U30NxiclgI60gkxZ7W2h5LdT2sKaA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiX_JeK9MfnAhXOVc0KHQ88Bf8Q6AEwAHoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;On November 22, 1963, I was about to take an exam at Boston College when the news that President Kennedy had been shot spread across the campus. Along with my classmates I went to St. Mary's Hall to pray. The next day I saw in the newspaper that the stock market had fallen less than 3 percent, though trading was halted once the news of the assassination became official. **Three days later the market recovered its losses of November 22, and then some.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe may very well be in the midst of a perfect storm from the end of the expansion cycle in the stock market and the black swan being the coronavirus/catalyst. Complacency in investors as you can see with some of the comments telling you you're panicking and not to worry. But like the first link I provided says \"Is a very destructive message.\" Only time will tell at this point. We'll have a much better understanding in the next month or so on how bad this all may be. I hope it will blow over. I really do.\n\nSo what do you do now? Well for one you need to begin getting some basic necessities like extra food, water, toilet paper, and medication. Prepare yourself for self quarantining and do not go to the hospital if you feel ill unless you need immediate attention. If the virus does come to the States or your country, going to the hospital is almost a guarantee in having a higher potential of being exposed to the virus and other viruses such as influenza. This virus may not have a high mortality rate, but the length of time spent in the hospital is anywhere from 2-3 weeks time. That is a fairly long time for one person to be in the hospital, any 1st world country's medical system will easily be overburdened. Imagine a 2nd or 3rd world country. It will be disastrous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an optimist I hope this virus will be contained. As a realist I know it's most likely too late.",

Right up until there is. Once that happens, there's no way to move fast enough to get away from the ensuing tsunami.\n\nIt's possible that our dam won't burst this week, or this month... but the erosion to the internal structure of the financial system is clear.
