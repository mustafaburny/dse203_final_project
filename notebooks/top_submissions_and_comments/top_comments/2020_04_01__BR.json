Unfortunately we can't bribe him with V-bucks but his BR squad is garbage. If we have a group of autistic individuals who can prove their worth to Barron, get squaded up with him, we can then start pulling sweet sweet insider info coming straight from the source that is Papa Trump.

Ironically, real estate prices in the area have risen so much, I've been priced out from buying a significantly larger spot now (2+ br) without moving far, far out to the burbs (currently renting again while renting out my studio). I've been waiting for another buyer's market so I'm really pumped for this. How were you narrowing your search during this time period?

        "body": "I think Calgary and Edmonton will take a trim (might be small, but could be a big trim). They never did have a strong bounce back from the 2015 debacle. Now with the 1-2 punch of oil layoffs and corona virus some people are fucked and panicking. I have the following comments to support a decline in Calgary specifically: \n\n\\-Job losses in oil and layoffs from COVID\n\n\\-The market hadn't fully bounced back since 2015\n\n\\-There's already a huge influx of fully furnished apartments hitting websites like RentFaster. People's investment properties that run on Air BNB are now empty and burning holes in their pockets. The market can only absorb so many of these rentals hitting the market at once. Few people want to move apartments in this environment, so its quite plausible these units will have to be put up for sale. Then you have even more folks forced to sell, without an increase in buyers. \n\n\\- Using a specific example. There was a 1 BR+den unit in Mission (Young but nice area, within walking distance of downtown Calgary) for $293K. It was being used for short term rentals. This week the priced dropped $75K to $218K. \n\nI'm expecting some more fire sales out of desperation (job losses and empty investment properties) which will drag down the price of most sales. Long term though there could be 1 last boom in AB oil and gas. Should TMX, KXL and Enbridge Line 3 replacement all be executed and put into service, the mid 2020s could provide 1 last big hurrah for Canadian Oil.",

This whole big drop could be a \"bear trap\" .\n\nin both scenarios its just up to the individual how you look at it, kind of like a half empty/half full. \n\nLike I said, the way to deal with a big sideways market is dollar cost averaging. You'd still be able to make profit even in that.\n\nAnd all your assumptions youre making are based on hindsight by looking back. Its ignoring that, certain events can trigger a change. events that we arent aware of.\n\nJust like the big stimulus package.\n\nFor this extreme bear market to happen, youd need a  pretty big catalyst which would lead to extended unemployment,reduced spending, reduced foreign investment.\n\nI dont think the US govt would let it get to that level. Look at the past two bail outs.\n\nYes we the US could be like japan, but it may not br an apples to apples comparison, if you look at 90s US vs 90s japan. At this point, the US is the biggest developed \"free market\" with a highly educated , highly diverse work force...so if investors are seeking returns, where else would they put their money? their bed? 1-2% bonds? investors could have left japan and put their money in the US. without the US market, where will investors put their money?",

I had ~400 shares of it when it was $4-5/share. I sold it all at $5ish because I got impatient. It then proceeded to skyrocket.  It\u2019s recently dipped back down below $30 and I\u2019ve considered getting back in.",

A dem in the white house would prob be needed to get the subsidies back. But SEDG, NEE, VSLR, ENPH, etc are decent.\n\nThere's a bunch of other good buys for good reasons but this should be a good start for ya.\n\nAlso and it should be obvious, I am not a financial advisor nor should anything I say be taken as anything other than friendly scuttlebutt.\n\nTickers are from memory so hopefully I got em right.r\n\nEdit: typos",
