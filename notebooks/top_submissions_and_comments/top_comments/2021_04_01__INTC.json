        "body": "**Highlights:**\n\nApple is selling a single CPU across a wider range of products than any competing Intel or AMD CPU is ever sold. This speaks volumes as to what Apple believes it has its hands on, namely: a CPU fast enough at the quad-core level \u2014 because, scaling-wise, the M1 is effectively a quad-core chip, with four low-power cores to handle low-power workloads and provide a little extra performance boost \u2014 to address a huge range of markets, while drawing so little power, it can also be sold in a laptop.\n\nPart of the reason Apple can get away with doing this is that it\u2019s been selling badly underpowered systems at certain price points. The old 21.5-inch iMacs included a $1,099 option with a dual-core CPU and only a 3.6GHz (no turbo) quad-core at $1,299. Only the six-core iMac, at $1,499, had a CPU powerful enough to even arguably be shipping in a 2021 PC at that price. That matters because, when these systems get reviewed, they\u2019re going to be compared in part with the hardware they replaced. The M1 appears to be faster and more power-efficient than current x86 CPUs, regardless, but it\u2019s going to compare particularly well when the other systems are underpowered relative to what a PC OEM would have been selling at the same price point.\n\nBut lopsided configurations are only part of the equation. Apple couldn\u2019t position the M1 this way if it wasn\u2019t an excellent CPU in its own right. The M1\u2019s dramatically higher efficiency and improved performance relative to x86 allowed Apple to standardize on a single CPU core across a wide range of products and price points. This is in complete opposition to the way PCs are traditionally positioned.\n\nx86 OEMs almost never standardize a product family on a single CPU. If a vendor offers more than one thin-and-light laptop in the same product family, the upper-end SKU will offer a higher-end chip. Workstation and gaming boutiques that offer premade systems follow the same pattern. Step up the price stack, and the amount of CPU horsepower available increases.\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious historical reason for this. For most of the past four decades, higher CPU performance cost more money and was more difficult for companies like Intel and AMD to deliver. In the modern era, performance advances have slowed, and minimum spec requirements have slowed with them. Apple is betting that the M1 is good enough to serve a much larger range of markets than x86 can typically address and that the M1\u2019s innate performance is good enough to satisfy consumers at this range of price points.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t seem like a fusillade across x86\u2019s metaphorical bow, consider the issue from a different perspective: According to Apple, the M1 is the right CPU for a $699 computer, and a $999 computer, and a $1,699 computer. It\u2019s the right chip if you want maximum battery life and the right CPU for optimal performance. Want the amazing performance of an M1 iMac, but can\u2019t afford (or have no need) for the expensive display? Buy a $699 Mac mini, with exactly the same CPU. Apple\u2019s M1 positioning, evaluated in its totality, claims the CPU is cheap and unremarkable enough to be sold at $699, powerful and capable enough to sell at $1699, and power-efficient enough to power both a tablet and a pair of laptops priced in-between.\n\nNo single x86 CPU is sold this way or positioned as a solution to such a broad range of use cases. There are three reasons why. First, PC customers generally expect higher-end systems in the same product family to offer faster CPUs. In the past, both Apple and x86 systems were sold in such fashion.  Second, Intel and AMD both benefit from a decades-old narrative that places the CPU at the center of the consumer\u2019s device experience and enjoyment and have designed and priced their products accordingly, even if that argument is somewhat less true today than it was in earlier eras. Third, no single x86 CPU appears to be capable of matching both the M1\u2019s power consumption and its performance.\n\nApple\u2019s willingness to position the M1 across so many markets challenges the narrative that such a vast array of x86 products is helpful or necessary. It puts Intel and AMD in the position of justifying why, exactly, x86 customers are required to make so many tradeoffs between high performance and low power consumption. Selling the M1 in both $699 and $1,699 machines challenges the idea that a computer\u2019s price ought to principally reflect the CPU inside of it.\n\nApple\u2019s gamble, with the M1, is that its custom CPU performance is now so high, at such low power consumption, that the choice of chip inside the system has become irrelevant within a given product generation. It challenges OEMs to consider how they might spec higher-end systems if some of the higher price tag didn\u2019t have to pay for a faster CPU. It threatens both AMD and Intel with the idea that a CPU with just four high-performance cores is fast enough for the company to 1). Call it an eight-core chip and 2). Position it against the 6, 8, and 10-core Intel and AMD systems that sell for $1,500+ in the desktop and laptop markets.",

        "body": "AMD is down today and here's why:\n\nTake a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means hedge funds need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit or else they'll have to cover. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases. Analysts are already saying to buy, and buy aggressively at this price.\n\nI know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  \n\"This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.\"\n\nOne could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% QoQ which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers \"digesting\" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales QoQ saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.\n\nOne could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.\n\nOne could speculate that the \"chip shortage\" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.\n\nAll of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.\n\nWith AMD, there's no need for WSB or individual investors to try to turn it around on the short selling hedge funds, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, diamond hands, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.\n\nAMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022. My price target is $120 which is more conservative than even some analysts.",

        "body": "**Highlights:**\n\nApple is selling a single CPU across a wider range of products than any competing Intel or AMD CPU is ever sold. This speaks volumes as to what Apple believes it has its hands on, namely: a CPU fast enough at the quad-core level \u2014 because, scaling-wise, the M1 is effectively a quad-core chip, with four low-power cores to handle low-power workloads and provide a little extra performance boost \u2014 to address a huge range of markets, while drawing so little power, it can also be sold in a laptop.\n\nPart of the reason Apple can get away with doing this is that it\u2019s been selling badly underpowered systems at certain price points. The old 21.5-inch iMacs included a $1,099 option with a dual-core CPU and only a 3.6GHz (no turbo) quad-core at $1,299. Only the six-core iMac, at $1,499, had a CPU powerful enough to even arguably be shipping in a 2021 PC at that price. That matters because, when these systems get reviewed, they\u2019re going to be compared in part with the hardware they replaced. The M1 appears to be faster and more power-efficient than current x86 CPUs, regardless, but it\u2019s going to compare particularly well when the other systems are underpowered relative to what a PC OEM would have been selling at the same price point.\n\nBut lopsided configurations are only part of the equation. Apple couldn\u2019t position the M1 this way if it wasn\u2019t an excellent CPU in its own right. The M1\u2019s dramatically higher efficiency and improved performance relative to x86 allowed Apple to standardize on a single CPU core across a wide range of products and price points. This is in complete opposition to the way PCs are traditionally positioned.\n\nx86 OEMs almost never standardize a product family on a single CPU. If a vendor offers more than one thin-and-light laptop in the same product family, the upper-end SKU will offer a higher-end chip. Workstation and gaming boutiques that offer premade systems follow the same pattern. Step up the price stack, and the amount of CPU horsepower available increases.\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious historical reason for this. For most of the past four decades, higher CPU performance cost more money and was more difficult for companies like Intel and AMD to deliver. In the modern era, performance advances have slowed, and minimum spec requirements have slowed with them. Apple is betting that the M1 is good enough to serve a much larger range of markets than x86 can typically address and that the M1\u2019s innate performance is good enough to satisfy consumers at this range of price points.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t seem like a fusillade across x86\u2019s metaphorical bow, consider the issue from a different perspective: According to Apple, the M1 is the right CPU for a $699 computer, and a $999 computer, and a $1,699 computer. It\u2019s the right chip if you want maximum battery life and the right CPU for optimal performance. Want the amazing performance of an M1 iMac, but can\u2019t afford (or have no need) for the expensive display? Buy a $699 Mac mini, with exactly the same CPU. Apple\u2019s M1 positioning, evaluated in its totality, claims the CPU is cheap and unremarkable enough to be sold at $699, powerful and capable enough to sell at $1699, and power-efficient enough to power both a tablet and a pair of laptops priced in-between.\n\nNo single x86 CPU is sold this way or positioned as a solution to such a broad range of use cases. There are three reasons why. First, PC customers generally expect higher-end systems in the same product family to offer faster CPUs. In the past, both Apple and x86 systems were sold in such fashion.  Second, Intel and AMD both benefit from a decades-old narrative that places the CPU at the center of the consumer\u2019s device experience and enjoyment and have designed and priced their products accordingly, even if that argument is somewhat less true today than it was in earlier eras. Third, no single x86 CPU appears to be capable of matching both the M1\u2019s power consumption and its performance.\n\nApple\u2019s willingness to position the M1 across so many markets challenges the narrative that such a vast array of x86 products is helpful or necessary. It puts Intel and AMD in the position of justifying why, exactly, x86 customers are required to make so many tradeoffs between high performance and low power consumption. Selling the M1 in both $699 and $1,699 machines challenges the idea that a computer\u2019s price ought to principally reflect the CPU inside of it.\n\nApple\u2019s gamble, with the M1, is that its custom CPU performance is now so high, at such low power consumption, that the choice of chip inside the system has become irrelevant within a given product generation. It challenges OEMs to consider how they might spec higher-end systems if some of the higher price tag didn\u2019t have to pay for a faster CPU. It threatens both AMD and Intel with the idea that a CPU with just four high-performance cores is fast enough for the company to 1). Call it an eight-core chip and 2). Position it against the 6, 8, and 10-core Intel and AMD systems that sell for $1,500+ in the desktop and laptop markets.",

There is no one chip for all in compute industry. \n\nYes, Apple has done an amazing and remarkable job with M1 chip and has shown the world the true potential of ARM architecture. That doesn\u2019t mean Intel and AMD should just make one chip for all devices. Apple consumers might want that but to be fair and honest not \u201cevery\u201d consumer wants that.\n\nEdit: plus unless Apple releases some really powerful software for iPad OS, I think M1 chip on iPad as it stands, is an overkill.",

Or is there actually something wrong with citing information?  \n\n\nAnd Intel has GPUs.   They sell more than anyone else.  Their integrated GPUs are a giant portion of the market, so their transition to making discrete GPUs should not be crazy.  They also have their own supply of chips that isn't nearly as affected by the shortage as AMD and Nvidia, so they stand to capture as big a piece of the GPU market share as they are able to produce.  I'm betting they are able to release before 2022, it's understandable if you are more skeptical though.  \n\n\nEven without the addition of discrete GPUs, due to the extreme shortage+demand at the moment, people are actively seeking out CPUs with integrated graphics in order to have working systems until supply for discrete GPUs is finally met.  AMD's integrated graphics options in the desktop market are not nearly as desirable - the SKUs are too low end for gamers or power users to use it as a viable upgrade path (buying a 3400g to hold you over until you can find a 3070 or 6700xt creates a CPU bottleneck, buying nearly any intel CPU with an iGPU avoids that scenario by being a way better CPU than the current AMD offerings)  \n\n\nIn any event, go ahead and hate on Intel if you want.

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

The strikes are disjoint but the vol trades reasonably tight, and there's enough volume to hedge a moderately sized position if you need to.\n\nAs you mention, Intel has been in the foundry business before; Intel Custom Foundry was the entryway for the Altera acquisition. Not really a failure in that sense, although it's telling that they dropped ICF around when their roadmap and yield woes began to arise. I don't think that's where people will be looking in order to judge Intel short term, but I agree it's a big deal for custom datacenter applications. What matters most IMO, short term (1-3y), is the 7nm roadmap, as well as a swift commitment to capex. If Intel sends the right signals that they're executing on those two factors, the rest of the bricks will fall into place. AMD already started to lose a bit of market share in the past quarter, and the messaging around 10nm yield has gotten better. I guess it's obviously better because the 10nm chips are widely available. And I believe that Rocket Lake is a brilliant move because it keeps LGA1200 engaged and 14nm humming along.\n\nAlso, if you look at it from a valuation perspective, rotation to INTC makes sense. Personally I believe IDM is the ideal strategy for a supply-constrained market because you become less reliant on predictions and your lead times can get shorter when needed.\n\nIntel Foundry isn't immediately gonna be a game-changing player for most of these automotive chips. AKM is a big supplier and they had a big factory fire. They offloaded some production to Renesas, which also had a relatively sizable factory fire more recently.",

If you check their earnings transcripts you can see that they talk about their deliveries as well as their inventory.\n\n&gt;For that reason, I believe that we're going to start seeing this revenue certainly inside 2021. At least, the execs at companies like AMAT seem to agree, and the market seems to be anticipating the PEG.\n\nYou're probably right about the latter part and perhaps wrong about the former part. AMAT isn't going to book profits in 2021 for the new capex outlay that was announced in the past couple of weeks from TSMC and Intel and the others. It would be accounting fraud. Even a nontrivial expansion of an existing fab will take 2-3y minimum. But the market is certainly anticipating the forward earnings. I am long-term bullish AMAT and the others, have been for a while, but AMAT is trading at a 33 P/E and INTC is trading at a 12.5 P/E. Assuming their earnings are correlated (which they ought to be if you normalize for lead/lag), I'd rather play the cheaper valuation with far cheaper IV.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I so desperately want to be involved in the capex names but the entry point right now is mediocre. My thinking is that if they rip, they will carry the rest of the fab side of the sector with them. So I prefer the insanely cheap upside skew of INTC because it will rip if it can break through the psychological barrier that 65 represents for the spot price. My play is to wait for everything to get crushed in a correlation event later this summer and then scoop them up. The stars will have to align but I think they just might.",

They are also releasing  mid-range and entry level GPUs \n\nBecause Intel makes their own chips, and can supply the market. anyone hesitant to try an intel chip might take the leap because they could actually get one. \n\nLong story short, AMD being a fabless chip makers is really putting them in a bind with the chip shortage, I can't feel good about the price in the short term and long term is murky because some inherent advantages AMD has built over the last couple years are being hampered by the inability to get products to market and unattractive margins.

        "body": "You're right... but there's an important distinction. Apple is NOT using ARMS architectures. They spent the cash to do their own R&amp;D and come up with something of their own. It takes some of the benefits from ARM-like designs, and some from Intel-like designs.\n\nThere's reasons that Apple has done this while others haven't. First, they have the most to gain from this. They have two enormous lines of consumer hardware which will benefit from this investment. Second, Apple has more cash in their coffers than fucking everyone else, so the expense doesn't impact them materially. \n\nSamsung already has their own mobile chipset, and they don't have a significant product line in laptop/desktop world. They have no interest in making an M1 competitor. Huawei is in the same position. Fujitsu? Lol.\n\nThe M-series is an enormous win for Apple and no one is going to contest it for a long time unless Intel decides they want to do anything other than coast on their market share anytime soon.\n\nApple has so much cash that if TSMC doesn't handle the M-series fabrication in a satisfactory way, then Apple will just buy their own fabs and control their entire supply chain instead.",

Perhaps this can change with their new ceo.\n\nTelling people Intel is competitive is blatantly false imo (I'm retired now so I don't work in the datacenter field and I no longer keep tabs on tech that closely) \n\nYou've got Apple that has gone away from intel and in my short time of owning an M1 macbook air, I can tell you this thing blows away anything intel has by miles, the battery life, the heat, the fanless design, the speed in the cpu, the gpu is light years ahead of whatever intel has.  \n\nAMD is going to continue to own Intel in the datacenter space, it owns them in the enthusiast market, intel still had a good hold of the oem market through shady bribes and deals etc.\n\nEven many years ago Intel literally lied about their advancements in 14nm 10nm etc and it got delayed every year.",

But the trajectory is terrible right now and they were saved only by their robust manufacturing capacity during the silicon boom of the last year when TSMC is all booked up.
