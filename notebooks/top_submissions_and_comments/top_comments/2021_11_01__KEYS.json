And if they wanted to allow it, they could easily create their own version of a used game marketplace without NFT or needing GME. Like Steam does for cards. NFT really isn't necessary for game licenses.\n\nCollectibles in game? Same problem. Unless the game is coded to allow NFT transfer of in game items, GME can't force it. And if games wanted to allow that, they could do a marketplace without NFT or giving a cut to GME. Like Diablo did originally.\n\nSo I'm not sure what NFT will be linked to.

        "body": "&gt;Quantum computing in the near future will usher in huge advances in technology and perhaps transform how we go about our daily lives for the better. The unfortunate part of our quantum future is that when quantum computing arrives, current encryption methods keeping all of our information safe, will fail. This is not a question of if, it is of when. The Global Risk Institute released a report titled \"Quantum Threat Timeline\" in 2019 which polled 22 leading data scientists on the forecasted timetable for a quantum computer to break current encryption standards. The consensus at the time was around 15 years, or 2034. Since that report was released, the quantum computing market has experienced a massive surge of investment with incredibly fast progress reported from companies around the globe, several, such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Rigetti Computing and Honeywell (HON) already have broken past 100 qubits, with a rapid doubling of capability shown.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;For reference, a recent article from Cornell University shows that PKI encryption (the current industry standard) may require as little as 2,000 logical qubits to break, making the timeline for current encryptions' obsolescence disturbingly close, likely in the 2025-2030 time frame, with governments such as the USA, UK, China and Russia likely well ahead of that date. A troubling trend noted recently by nation-state actors is to \"harvest now, decrypt later\" which is the term for stealing encrypted data from hardened sources today and then store the data to decrypt when the technology is available.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;It has even been theorized that the entire blockchain that cryptocurrencies depend on may be at risk of total hijack or collapse once quantum computers reach maturity. This trend makes it critically important for nations to migrate away from PKI encryption as soon as possible to symmetric encryption keys. The biggest problem currently with symmetric key encryption is that you need to have a way to get the key to the other party with whom you are sharing the data. Arqit believes that it has a solution for this critical problem that is completely computationally secure, which means it cannot be broken by any current or future machine, along with a delivery system that cannot be intercepted via the quantum cloud. The key to this entire technology's eventual adoption is that the algorithm used is already the global standard (AES), meaning that it is operable with current systems, giving users no logical reason to not adopt the technology.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;The technology Arqit invented is covered by over 1,400 patent claims making this company and its technology potentially protected from copycats looking to set up similar business models for some time to come. The commercial strategy also appears to be very well thought out, with the software downloaded by customers and used automatically. Billing events are created by usage via commercial customers with key creation events being metered. The brilliance of this strategy is the incredibly low capex Arqit has to expend once the core infrastructure is in place, as the software needed is basically zero touch.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;With current systems operating on a compatible format, ultimately every connected device is a potential customer of Arqit without the need of the company building any further infrastructure as the 2 planned and paid for satellites used are able to generate two quadrillion unique keys per year. To get an idea of the explosive potential of this company, please keep in mind that the below pipeline and business development was accomplished all in 2021, with only 2 dedicated salespeople, one being the CEO [himself.To](https://himself.to/) land executed, recurring and framework contracts with the likes of the British Government, British Telecom (OTCPK:BTGOF), Sumitomo Corporation (OTCPK:SSUMF) ESA and Dentons in addition to an \"unnamed\" major payment network, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Iridium (IRDM), Verizon (VZ) and BP (BP) accomplished pre hard rollout is unbelievably impressive and gives credibility to the massive potential ahead for the company.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;During recent analyst conferences before the de-SPAC event, the CEO has reported massively increased interest in the product well before any ramp up in sales and marketing efforts by the company. Generally I do not like to discuss financial projections generated from the SPAC process as many companies simply throw hopes and dreams into a blender to come up with these. However, given the solid and proven pipeline of customers Arqit has signed already and the fact that the service is already live give me enough confidence to share the company's 2025 projections.With Arqit, I really have to control my enthusiasm a bit, not only does the company appear to have a scalable solution to a massive problem affecting nearly every sector around the globe, but the company also has a way of doing it that is low capex and very high margin.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;In addition, the company having expended basically zero sales effort to date, has secured $130 million in guaranteed revenues from A list customers with a high probability of closing a $1.1 billion backlog pipeline already. The CEO indicated in the recent investor day that in his 30 years of sales experience, he has never had any product like Arqit's and that his closing percentage is nearly 100%. If Arqit even comes close to the financial projections they have presented, which the CEO notes is a very conservative projection, then the company could be worth many multiples of the current $2.1\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;billion market cap. It also would appear, counter to many of the recent SPAC IPOs, that dilution should not be an issue going forward. In the SPAC transaction, the company has received $376 million in cash to the balance sheet, to which the CEO recently commented that the deal brought it \"twice the money that we need to fully fund our business\" and that \"We don't need to raise any more money, ever,\" he told CNBC. In late August I purchased a moderately sized speculative position in the SPAC. My only hesitancy in purchasing more is that generally, when a company seems to have a no-brainer, hugely profitable solution to a massive problem, red flags tend to appear.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;So far, I have not found any true red flags with Arqit, but as I am not a cybersecurity expert, I will be keeping my position moderately sized until at least a few quarters have run off and I gain a greater comfortability with the progress of the technology and management. I am very excited to see how this company develops as it would appear they may have solved a truly massive problem that nearly all NATO countries have been losing sleep over for years, before it actually existed. If they are successful in the product roll out, shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely. I look forward to your comments and views of the company, thank you for reading and good luck!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHey /u/bdkendalll, it looks like you posted a wall of text.

        "body": "Let me introduce you the exciting world of proptech my mousey friend. There are currently hundreds of services that rely on entering people\u2019s homes: dog walkers, housecleaning, maintenance, delivery, etc. All of this is coordinated via technology, yet it relies on a physical key for access. That\u2019s absurd. You give a real key to your housekeeper, but what happens when your housekeeper loses the key? What happens when tenants turn over? Why on earth would we be paying to change physical bulky hardware every time a new resident takes possession?  Wouldn\u2019t it be better to give your housekeeper a one time use code only valid for entry at the specified times?  Wouldn\u2019t it be better to unlock your door with your phone instead of calling a locksmith when you lose your keys at in the Uber? \n\nOur connected digital world relies on a physical key and that just simply isn\u2019t going to be the case in just a few short years.\n\nEventually, Amazon is going to announce a partnership with either Latch or SmartRent that allows AmazonFresh to deliver groceries directly into your fridge while you are at work. That WILL happen, and I know which side of the trade I want to be on when it does. \n\n3 out of every 10 newly built apartment buildings in the US are installing Latch. In the future, 9 out of 10 will use either Latch or SmartRent. \n\nBoth of these companies fully integrate with all of the common smart home applications, you can have Alexa unlock your door for the dog walker for example. \n\nBoth of these companies have 0% attrition. To date they have NEVER had a customer cancel their contract or fail to renew. That is absolutely remarkable. \n\nThe market simply doesn\u2019t yet understand this industry and the inevitable shift into smart building management. \n\nThe words oldest subscription service (renting an apartment) is have its tech transformation moment.

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage wallets, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can easily confirm their legitimacy and I have been stacking free Satoshis for a few years now.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not completely insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your crypto\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the crypto-asset, it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your adjusted cost base (ACB) for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your ACB for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really crypto itself, but rather, it is in the application of blockchain technology which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the crypto-assets itself simply have a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Moreover, investing is simply risk management and from a risk-adjusted returns perspective, having some excellent crypto-projects is better than not having any at all while I personally see this as the 12th sector in the overall global market index.\r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the crypto-asset, it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your adjusted cost base (ACB) for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your ACB for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really crypto itself, but rather, it is in the application of blockchain technology which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the crypto-assets itself simply have a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

There's a difference. \n\nI didn't address it because I didn't feel it was important to your point that BTC transactions were $75. \n\nThe concept you're talking about is immutability. You're framing it as a downside, but that is actually by design. Surely you can think of reasons people might see it as a positive. \n\n&gt; Based on actual crypto in the real world - this isn't true at all. \n\nOf course it's true, there's a sizable amount of transactions happening on altcoin chains.

        "body": "It is not a lack of drivers. It is a lack of those who meet the requirements now that California has the California Truck Ban that says all trucks must be 2011 or newer combined with a law called AB 5 which ended up being a boon for people who drive directly for a single employer like Uber or Safeway or who are independent contractors but the changes negatively impacted owner-operators which make up a not insignifcant amount of trucking logistics in the state.\n\nAB 5 establisheds the ABC test to determine employee or independent contractor.\n\n 1. Is the person hired given extensive freedom in how about they go accomplishing the   \n task?  \n\r  \n 2. Is the work performed done outside of the hiring company\u2019s normal business   \n operations?  \n\r  \n 3. Is the person hired a member of an established business for the line of work they are   \n doing?\n\nIf one of the above fails, they are considered an employee.\n\nThe goal of AB 5 was to prevent worker abuse from Uber and Lyft, and unitentionally or intentionally it affects truckers as well due to the wording that affected companies like Landstar System which started moving out of California as a result of it due to it labeling them as a shipping/logisitics business and since the owner-operators are doing logisitics/shipping work, they must be employees despite the owner-operators not being forced to take any dispatches, they choose their own loads they want to do.\n\n If the owner-operator on his own authority hauls chairs on behalf of Costco from California to Texas and isn't given a specific route to take:\n\n 1. The driver has the freedom to determine how he will get the truckload to its destination.  \n\r  \n 2. Costco's primary business is wholesale/retail, not shipping products.  \n\r  \n 3. The owner-operator is a member of his own trucking business.\n\nWith all of those met, they are an independent contractor.\n\nNow, consider owner-operators taking dispatches through a company like Landstar System.\n\n1. The driver has the freedom to determine how he will get the truckload to its destination.\n\n2. Landstar System's primary job is shipping/logistics, the same as the owner-operator they got the dispatch from.\n\n3. The owner-operator is a member of his own trucking business.\n\nTaking a dispatch from Landstar System fails check 2, so now they are employees rather than independent contractors despite being owner-operators of their trucks.\n\nLong term truckers in the state aren't investing in new trucks because California has a law that makes those illegal in 2035, as the next requirement will be to purchase electric tricks which do not exist yet. So they are going to hold onto anything they already have that meets the requirements.\n\nThese problems are completely left out of discussion because no one wants to talk about how policies they passed built this shitstorm up. Anything coming out of California is affected by its state regulations.\n\nOn top of that, I can't imagine they are just going to let a 18-21 year old 88M who they can't trust to drive across a base alone to drive across -states- alone and then you run the matter of handing over the keys to vehicles they aren't trained on nor have any care for.",

Though not only Valdez  but dropping 70% in two years recently. Not only did I hold, I added a little more (although not much to be honest. Mostly done adding to Exxon). \n\nAlso just to clarify those companies I listed were for a reason. Everyone pretends like it\u2019s hard but I\u2019m showing you it\u2019s not. Pick any of the top ten companies in the country or world and you are likely to dominate the average. We have known for 50+ years that Exxon has its hands in government pockets. Easy pick. We\u2019ve known for 30 years that Microsoft would rule the PC world. You could have waited 20 years \u201cjust to make sure\u201d before increasing and you would destroy the S&amp;P. How about Walmart? Amazon? Apple? Disney? We always know that these companies control their sectors. You did not need to invest day one to make money.

        "body": "We are talking multiple years here if not decades. Companies like Exxon. a.) They are in a dying industry and have been unsuccessful in pivoting away from fossil fuels to alternative sources of revenue. b.) They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",

Using a 5-year average of price/earnings is ok, because it normalizes the value of the company to their earnings at the time, and shows where wall street is pricing the company over time.  Using 5-year averages on earnings, or revenue only is dumb unless you think the company is going to regress on it's revenue.  \n\nAt one point they're averaging FCF for the last 5 years and comparing that to current market cap.  That just simply doesn't work when FCF today is nearly double what it was 5 years ago, and it's not only still growing - but it's still accelerating.  The fact that MSFT had 34B in free cash flow in 2016 is completely irrelevant to the stock's price today, where they have 56B in FCF.   \n\nThe way these guys are coming up with their valuations are as if MSFT isn't growing any more - it's more useful when looking at mature dividend companies, but it's not really a good way to value a company that is going to aggressively grow for the next 5-10 years.",

Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term.

My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.",

Everybody that matters in the market knows what it is, and they all knew it was going to pass the house. Remember, it had strong support by both parties in the senate months ago when it was passed. People have mentioned buying related ETFs (I.e PAVE) and construction companies (like CAT) for that entire time for this reason. Basically, it\u2019s priced in.\n\n2. Besides allowing for news,  speculation and possibly improved forward guidance (all priced in imo) this bill isn\u2019t going to make these companies more valuable overnight. It will take a long time for them to get these projects/money, and even longer for them to report their financial improvements from this, which does have an impact on stock prices. Even then, this is probably priced in.\n\nI hesitate to say this is 100% priced in right now because there are probably retail traders buying in, but the term \u201csell the news\u201d exists for a reason.

So you can sell it and take what the contract is worth right now. Or exercise it. Exercising means you'll be purchasing 100 shares at the strike price of which you bought the option for, you pay per share the strike price. So you bought .03 cent option strike price. You pay .03 cents for each share of 100. You then own 100 share of Said company, this is for going long on a company. There's much to option but it really isn't that hard to understand once you begin learning and understanding. Cause when you purchase a option contract your buying the \"rights\" to 100 shares of said company. Options are a tricky game but is a good game when played strongly. If you knew a stock was going up and you purchased many calls you can profit more for calls than buying said stock. Puts are like shorting, when you expect a stock to go down. Again man, I'm sure I'm making it confusing but YouTube it and read about it.

It's gone down due to a fall in the revenues from EBay, and they've lowered their guidance for revenue and earnings. \n\nHowever, I'm excited about their future. From what I understand, they're looking at starting a stock trading platform which should see revenues grow in the future. And, with their acceptance of cryptocurrencies, I imagine there might be deals being signed elsewhere for them to be a payment provider on more platforms. That's just my speculation though.\n\nI got in at $212. Will stop looking at the charts for now, and check back in a few months. For now, it's a long-term hold for me.",
