In our experience, the PASCAL system's independent grasping ability as well as the flexible and less traumatic clasp design are important features for our patients.\"\n\nThe PASCAL system is indicated in Europe for the percutaneous reconstruction of the tricuspid valve through leaflet repair by tissue approximation. The clasps and paddles gently grasp the leaflets to facilitate coaptation, while the spacer is designed to fill the regurgitant orifice area and prevent backflow. The clasps can be operated independently to facilitate optimized leaflet capture and the implant can be elongated to a narrow profile, allowing for safe maneuvering in dense chordal anatomy.\n\n\"Patients with tricuspid valve disease are in great need of solutions,\" said Bernard J. Zovighian, Edwards' corporate vice president, transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies. \"Edwards is the first company to introduce multiple transfemoral tricuspid repair therapies in Europe, providing physicians with both leaflet repair and annular reduction therapies to help meet their patients' needs.\"\n\nIn early clinical experience, the PASCAL repair system demonstrated high procedural success and significant clinical improvements in patients with challenging tricuspid anatomy and severe TR. Sustained TR reduction was observed at 30 days, with 85 percent of patients seeing a reduction to TR \u22642+ on a five-grade scale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Benzinga Pro's Top 4 Stocks To Watch For Tues., Apr. 28, 2020: BA, FFIV, EW, ATIF\n\n7:54 am ET April 28, 2020 (Benzinga) Print\n\nToday's 4 Stock Ideas:\u00a0\n\n* **Boeing (BA)**\u00a0\\- An earnings play.

        "body": "Amazon didn't anticipate everything that was coming along with it.   Many companies had increased their AWS platforms and expanded their infrastructure to support work from home and home users.    Big players like Netflix expanded their infrastructure on AWS in large numbers to accommodate the increased traffic.    Thinking that Amazon stock was going to tank isn't good sense.  \n\nWhat I expect is that tech companies will start to drop when more layoffs occur in the big business sector.  Small business isn't where tech is making money, they are making it off of the big corporations.   I bought up F5 (FFIV) as much a week or two before their earnings.   Not because of them selling more hardware (more expense, less margin) but based solely of how many corporations had to increase their VPN licenses (minimal overhead and high margin).   This was  a good tech play.   I made off pretty with that one.  I also expect their earnings to tank in Q2 because people will expect them to be high again, but corporations have already purchased licenses to accommodate.   Now they are screwed for probably the next year for licenses alone.   Stock will start to drop because of that.   \n\nTech sector is an interesting one.   Unless I know about the technology and what drives it up/down I don't play in it.   I understood AWS and FFIV working in IT.   Just my two cents.",

        "body": "I'm sorry but this is a gross misunderstanding of what is going on.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is not the economy.  It also is not an equal weighing of all the companies in the S&amp;P.  As long as there's not full blown fear, there should be some differentiation.  Owning MSFT and owning M are not equal.  The stocks like MSFT are helping carry the S&amp;P while M being down a lot is a not a proportionate loss.\n\nDon't forget, we are down.  It's not like we're up YTD.\n\nYou also have to remember that there's no competition to equities.  The 10-year is yielding less than 1%.  Why would I buy that when I can buy AAPL and get a better dividend than that?  After all, it has about $100 billion in cash alone right now so the dividend seems pretty safe.\n\nThere's also this thing called sentiment.  In layman's terms, it's the general belief of what will happen.  So while unemployment may not return to the record pre-crisis levels, the market believes most of these jobs will be back soon.  And that makes a lot of sense if you believe the world will be re-opening soon, which I do.  Since the general belief is that unemployment will be resolved shortly, the market is priced accordingly. \n\nThere's also TRILLIONS of dollars of stimulus being issued in a variety of ways.  I think you might underestimate how much TRILLIONS really is.\n\nEven if you're right and the market is being irrational, these bullish rallies are normal in a bear market.  That means you can be right AND THIS STILL HAPPENS.  These must be accounted for but you're not accounting for them whatsoever.\n\nMost importantly, you're looking at this like an amateur.   Big time investors are capitalists.  They understand ups and downs and all sorts of things I'm sure I don't know.  But markets are functioning.  The big fear in the Great Recession is that markets weren't functioning.  We recovered once it proved the markets functioned.  Knowing this, the Fed went right after this point immediately.  THAT'S WHY THE FED DID WHAT IT DID BECAUSE IT'S THAT IMPORTANT.  The day the Fed announced infinite QE was the bottom on the chart for the reason.  The Fed basically guaranteed markets will work so the worst case scenario is off the table.\n\nLastly \"Things aren't returning to normal anytime soon\" is a massive assumption.  I'm not saying the world will be back to normal on May 15th but a lot of people think the opposite of you, myself included.  Be careful what assumptions you make.\n\nEDIT:  You also have to remember how people think.  Let's say 20% of people thought the world would open again in April, 20% in May, 20% in June, 20% July, and 20% in August.  Well it's May now so the April 20% and the May 20% think re-opening is right around the corning - that's 40%.  In June, you add that 20% to the existing 40% and now we're up to 60%.  Just like you think the market will fall every day, they believe the opening is just around the corning.  You keep thinking \"tomorrow is the day\" forever.  Being stubborn  goes both ways.",

There will always been a need for flash arrays but I just have a hard time seeing exponential growth in a company that is moving away from their core product and moving more cloud based which is already a heavily saturated market with much bigger players.

I've got some 50c 7/17. I was thinking of getting some farther out, because of how slowly this has been recovering. I am kind of confused why some of these other cloud stocks have exploded with massive losses, yet NetApp is barely crawling back, even though they have a good balance sheet, cash flow, dividend. They def haven't been a growth story lately, but at the very least they should be closer to pre-covid numbers.",
