        "body": "Other can answer with the more intangible items. From a financial perspective, let's take a look at the 10K's of each company (since this is the last filing of NVDA). Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:\n\nRevenue:\n\nNVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)\n\nGross Profit:\n\nNVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)\n\nIncome Before Taxes:\n\nNVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).\n\nNet Income:\n\nNVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).\n\nSo what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference.",

        "body": "Fear of inflation is inducing a rotation out of growth. Tech (especially FAAAN/MG-ish stocks) are seeing  TREMENDOUS earnings reports and then either immediately staying flat or seeing a steep discount. AMD not only had a great quarter, but changed guidance from 37% growth for the year to 50% growth. The result? AMD is down 15% since the high on their earnings day. Same with MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, and even NVDA. PLTR is going with the market.  \n\n\nAdditionally, PLTR has no reason for price to increase right now, outside of the market/sector drop. They are significantly over-priced. I don't think the price is likely to drop down to a saner value. I think it's more likely to hold and stick around 20-30 *until the fundamentals  rise to justify the price*.  Everyone suspects they should have a pretty good quarter. That'll be good. They'll need several of those consecutively for the market to respond. Every few new big contracts and news stories, they gain another analyst adding them to their coverage. Enough really great quarters of growth (say, another year worth) and the market will start responding.  \n\n\nThose of us invested now -- and those like Cathie Woods -- are playing the hunch and taking the risk that we are recognizing the potential of the company before the rest of the market has caught on to it. While they're waiting for results to move the price, we're betting on results. We could be wrong. Probably not, but we could be.  \n\n\nAnyway, I have been calling this for weeks. Nobody -- not even the CEO -- has implied that PLTR is a short term profit play. Everyone knows you hold PLTR for the long term, if you have conviction in the company. And yet, you have all these people going \"HURR DURR PLTR TO THE MOON ON EARNINGS DAY!\" and \"HURR PLTR 50/100/150 by END OF YEAR\".  \n\n\nFor weeks, I've been saying this: ***PLTR will drop to 20 before earnings and then it will moon... back to 24 or so, where we are today***.  \n\n\nWe've done the \"reached 19/20\" part. I expect good earnings on 5/11. I no longer think we'll see a lift back to 24 or 25 on earnings, though. Not in the current senseless market. I think we'll see it trade flat after earnings or possibly very slightly higher for a day... and then all the \"HURR DURR PLTR 50 BY END OF YEAR\" people will get impatient (despite being warned since the beginning) and start selling off... leaving us back down to around  wherever we are just before the earnings report.  \n\n\nIf you don't have conviction in PLTR, don't invest. If you do, leave your position alone and relax for a few years.  \n\n\n***11% of  portfolio is PLTR at 23.98***",

        "body": "Idiots in this thread, Jesus. Shortage issues? AMDs market share gains have slowed down due to shortages, they're selling every chip they can make.\n\nWhen supply catches up to demand (which isn't happening for another year at least), their sheets will still look great because they'll start chipping away at Intel and Nvidias market share. With the Xilinx merger they'll become the largest customer at TSMC. As they start transitioning to 5 nm, they'll be able to allocate 7nm to lower margin GPU products, a segment which is currently neglected due to shortages, both by Nvidia and AMD.\n\nBesides that, they just announced a $4b share buyback. AMD have never had this kind of free cash before. This is going to prevent any sub $70 targets, unless there's a very sudden macro cause, and even then they'll eat it up because they want to buy the shares at a decent price. The reason they're doing share buybacks and not investing in the company? They have no factories, so they don't need capital to increase production levels. They've already effectively maxed out on R&amp;D, and as Intel have proven over the last 4 years, you can't throw extra money at semiconductor R&amp;D to get better results.\n\nTheir product roadmap for the next 5 years is amazing and they have a proven track record of delivering.\n\nThey said themselves that their gpu lineup should get another 50%+ per/watt improvement next gen, and leakers who have been pretty reliable previously are pointing to much higher numbers.\n\nIn the CPU space, Intel's next two generations are no threat whatsoever, and AMDs iterative design approach means consistent gains in performance and power consumption every year. Intel's 10nm laptop CPUs can increase their performance by 10% for a 50% power consumption tradeoff. It proves how bad the state of their foundries really is.\n\nThe Xilinx merger is a big brain play if it goes through, which it should. It gives them the FPGAs necessary to chip away at Nvidias monopoly on machine learning. Xilinx already easily outperforms Nvidia here, but Nvidia has an ecosystem that needs to be broken. As we move towards smaller processing nodes, transistor size reductions will no longer be the way to get better performance. A mix of FPGAs, ASICs, and general compute units is the future. That's what AMD have recognised and why they're building an arsenal of integrated CPU and GPU products now. They're building the experience required to meet the demands of the future.\n\nI don't have much money so I've got 265 shares via CFDs on 5x leverage. Assuming the Xilinx merger is successful, $100-130 EOY is easily manageable imo. It will likely take a hit after the merger as Xilinx owners sell their converted shares, but that's to be expected. With the guidance AMD have for this year it's also plausible they may increase the buyback program depending on demand/shortages, which could alleviate Xilinx sellers.",

AMD is not getting back in manufacturing and for good reason, it is simply too difficult for any single company at the current level of complexity. \n\nHell, even Apple, a Trillion dollar company, would rather pay TSMC to make their chips than start making it themselves. Chip making is not easy and even Intel, which is multiple times bigger than AMD can't get it straight.",

When I asked my gaming friend about his new computer, he said it was AMD components. Then I learned AMD are supplying chips for the new gaming consoles. Around that same time they announced the acquisition of XLINX. Stock dipped and I bought in.\n\nSo yea, if you're looking for long term hold, general consensus is AMD will perform. Buying as a short term trend looks dangerous since the stock has been on a drastic downtrend for a while. I dont know what's keeping it down. Obviously the \"tech panic\" the media portrays but I feel like it's a combination of the acquisition and just being overlooked.",

Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. \n\nTL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has.
