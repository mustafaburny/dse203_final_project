In fact, they were still drifting down after the initial bounce!\n\nThen what happened? Cyclicals started creeping up. Everyone screamed that the market didn't make sense again yet ADP released a good report, mobility metrics were ticking up, and I guarantee you large institutional investors have more data than you. Official job reports released. Both Canada and US beat expectations by an insane amount. This just decreased the probability of a worst case scenario and pulled forward the recovery expectations (as it should!)\n\nThe only thing I can fault the market for is possibly getting a bit too optimistic but the price movements have made a lot more sense to me than the average doom and gloomer.\n\nGo down the largest market cap companies and think to yourself will these companies emerge from this crisis stronger, the same, or weaker? https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;o=-marketcap\n\nI'll add this quote from the dean of valuation:\n\n&gt;There are some market gurus who are pointing to this disconnect as evidence that markets are just wrong and that a major correction is around the corner, but their credibility is undercut by the fact that many in this group have been forecasting this correction for the last decade,  and with metrics (PE, CAPE, Shiller PE) that have lost their potency.\n\nhttps://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2020/06/a-viral-market-update-ix-do-it-yourself.html",

ADP and Moody\u2019s Analytics reported private payrolls fell by another 2.76M in May. The ADP number was far less than the 8.75M estimate. The reason for the wide disparity was not immediately clear. Data from the Institute for Supply Management showed the U.S. services sector contracted less than expected, rebounding from an 11-year trough. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 2% so far in June, bringing its gain from its pandemic low in March to more than 40%. Data compiled by LPL Financial showed the S&amp;P 500 was experiencing its largest 50-day rally in history. The data also showed stocks were higher 100% of the time six and 12 months after the previous largest rallies on record. Stocks poised to benefit from the economy reopening rose broadly on Wednesday, while shares of companies that surged during stricter stay-at-home orders, lagged. Elsewhere, gold futures, a traditional safe haven for investors along with Treasurys, dropped more than 1% to settle at $1,704.80 per ounce. On Tuesday, stocks rose as optimism around reopening businesses overshadowed concerns about the global pandemic, U.S.-China trade tensions and nationwide protests.",

I just think people are reading this good news as economic recovery starting already in May, V shape on the way!    \n\n\nMy point is just the PPP was basically an alternative unemployment benefit. Instead of the state paying people directly, the federal government paid business through the SBA and then the business paid the employees. It actually is a nice way to handle it, takes the load of state unemployment systems, etc. But it is messing with the numbers. As soon as that money runs out business will just let people go so I think unemployment will be somewhere between 13% and 20% (closer to 20%) once the PPP runs out.",
