But TD, having an actual risk &amp; compliance dept isn't just going to hand you the keys to the kingdom that easy.\n\nWhen I first got started with them I called up and spoke to the compliance dept directly and told them I was into trading futures (which requires Lv 3) and they pushed the button for me, NBD.\n\nI recommend the same approach. Yes, they have a risk dept, but they all want to take ur money from you and want to help you give it to them in the way that makes you most comfortable.\n\nWhat they won't budge on is the min balance of $1500 to trade Lv 3 tho.\n\nGL",
