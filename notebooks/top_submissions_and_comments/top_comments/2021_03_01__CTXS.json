Internet will get faster and reduce latency times, you can shift computing resources as needed, it keeps all the data under a controlled environment instead of letting employees bring their computers/hard drives where ever they happen to go. It also lets a company instantly provide a setup to an employee for virtually no added cost, which the employee can access from anywhere as long as they have a computer with internet.",

        "body": "The warning signs of a market pullback were there present in January 2020 so my exposure was minimal. I was in cash and trying to enter 5 of bullish put spreads on Thursday Feb 20th when the market dropped suddenly. Fortunately, I was not getting filled on most my spreads because the stocks were holding up well and I was not able to get the credit I wanted. The spread that I did get filled on (DIS) I took immediate losses on of about 10%. I was in cash on Feb 21. On Sunday Feb 24th I recorded a video and posted it on YouTube forecasting a market drop. In March I let the market come in and I started selling naked OTM puts on stocks like FB, GOOG, CTXS and others. Once the market stabilized in April I started selling OTM bullish put spreads and I continued with that strategy the rest of the year. I won't post it here, but you can privately message me and ***I will provide you with a link to that YouTube video from Feb 24th. You can watch other videos recorded after that to verify my claims.***\n\nI did not short the on a swing basis during the market drop, but I did day trade it. \n\nThe intent for my original post on a 3 Step Process to Options Trading was to help beginner options traders. I was going to go through the entire process and culminate with an options trade with specific instructions, but given the hostility here I doubt I will do that.",

Not only can it lead to you becoming a bag holder, but the SEC frowns upon the \u201cwe talk\u201d you mentioned in your post. I do not mean this in any rude way but everyone makes their decisions themselves and is ultimately for themselves. We are not a pack here in WSB. We are individual investors who do not coordinate in any way on a stock. \n\nIf you see information that is scattered, like you mentioned, it is imperative to do your own research and figure out what is true and what is not. Not everyone who got in early on RKT did DD but the people who got in last week and knew about this definitely did. \n\nAs far as UWMC goes, I have seen a few posts about it but nothing close to the amount on RKT or GME. I plan on doing my own DD on UWMC tonight before deciding to go in tomorrow morning. \n\nI have no positions in UWMC as of now but I am intrigued enough to do some DD and possibly get in tomorrow. \n\nAnother major point to keep in mind, if you do get into something like RKT, make sure you have a PT in mind and do not be greedy. My EOW PT for RKT was hit today and I cashed out to secure my profits. Could it continue its run the rest of the week? Absolutely. Could it pullback and decline the rest of the week? Absolutely. If you plan on getting into UWMC, plan on how you will get out. Everyone likes to talk about how losses aren\u2019t realized until you sell. But the same goes for gains. It\u2019s great seeing green in your account but until you sell, it\u2019s not real.\n\nAlso, this is a casino.",

        "body": "Interesting.  I've was telling drug reps at Shire *years* ago that there was a market for a pro-drug version of Ritalin.  \n\nThis is basically a 30:70 biphasic Focalin IR/Focalin prodrug.  This is actually a big deal.\n\nStimulant prodrugs, (of which Vyvanse is the one FDA approved currently and is an amphetamine and goes generic next year) are ideal because of their lowered abuse potential.  The IR component doesn't lend itself to this factor but I'm glad to see such a product has finally come to the market.  I use methylphenidates for ADHD obviously, but also chronic fatigue synd, shift work d/o, \"chemo brain\", idiopathic hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and treatment resistant depression.   \n\nA lot of folks don't tolerate amphetamines- they can be too anxiogenic - and have to be switched to one of the methylphenidates.\n\nInsurance companies will make coverage very difficult but if there's enough demand they'll start putting it on formularies in a year or two.\n\nIf coverage wasn't an issue- I'd prescribe this medication regularly.  ADHD is one of my bread and butter diagnostic codes.\n\nThis isn't just a tweak of Focalin like we've seen several times previously with Ritalin. \n\nA good analogy would be this is like Vyvanse with an integrated dose of Adderall IR to hasten onset of action- just with Focalin instead.  Very cool.  \n\nApprove for ages 6 to adult.  \n\nLower peak concentration than Focalin XR, but wears off more slowly- hence less of a crash.  \n\nI've been through this with other new approvals before.  It takes several months before enough is made to get to market. Then the drug reps go do their things. Then the insurance companies play dumb and don't know what you're talking about.  6-8 months for Rxs to be written depending on how well they have their shit together.  Then maybe maybe get approval for night shift disorder and extend the patent, then sell rights to a big pharma company.  \n\nYou got in on this at 0.19.  Good job.  If this is all that it looks to be, it'd be a top 15 drug i prescribe.  Very cool.",

The company had their IPO a few months ago and after gaining value for a couple weeks it crashed, and since then has drawn a few hedge funds who have spent the last few months shorting it. However, it has backfired on the shorts for a few reasons, the biggest being that RKT\u2019s execs aren\u2019t fucking around and have decided to actively fuck over the shorts. In late November, RKT announced they intend to do a massive stock buy back of $1 billion worth of shares during Q1. This has yet to happen so it\u2019s likely to occur in the very near future; current float is about 100M, so they intend to buyback roughly 25% of all outstanding stock. Then, during their Q4 earnings report on 2/25, they announced a special dividend of $1.1/share is going to be paid out to all holders at the end of market 3/9. On top of that, the shorts got noticed by the retail investors, having overplayed their hand again and irresponsibly pushed to 40% short interest. So now the shorts are stuck in a shitty position. If they don\u2019t settle up their positions by 3/9, they\u2019ll wind up having to cover that dividend, and on top of that retail is buying the stock up like crazy. Bonus, RKT is roughly 70% institutional ownership, and those firms are more than happy to throw fuel on the fire to burn their competitors attempting to short them.",

That\u2019s lunacy. You\u2019re giving up nearly all the upside on day 1.\n\n2. Getting emotionally attached to what they hold. How many posts and comments do we see every day about the same few companies where people are lamenting the fact that their favorite SPAC isn\u2019t going up with a chorus of others parroting how strong the company is. We first saw it with HCAC and now we\u2019re seeing it with GIK and THCB. \n\n3. Refusing to realize gains. People here are up 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200% (even higher with warrants) and not only do they refuse to take profits, but they criticize others who do. Most of which is because of how new so many people are to the market and simply don\u2019t know that the overall market (that many here don\u2019t participate in) averages 8% yearly gains. That and desperate attempts to get rich quick.",

So, we could assume the same was happening with other brokers. At the same time, I know that at least TDA isn't allowing short selling of GME at all (was on the phone with them the other day, and the guy told me they haven't allowed it since the end of January).\n\nStill, the price has not only held, but risen pretty significantly today. I'm having a hard time seeing the downside to continuing to hold, I just don't think it's a wise thing to sell at this point. The gamma squeeze seems like it'll happen, the short squeeze is likely too. And even if it's not, the company is pivoting and may become a big player in the years to come. All those things are why I will keep holding.\n\nAt the same time, if you haven't covered your initial investment, please do so. I sold off enough at the end of January to pay off almost $50k of CC debt and to have a bit leftover to provide for me and my kids. Now I'm playing with house money, so it's easier for me to weather the dips.\n\nI'm holding 307 shares @ \\~$70 per share. I also have a 17 calls for different dates.",

But they don't understand just how dumb we really are. We are far too stupid to be afraid of their fearmongering, and we'll hold 'til the moon.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060If you're new, this may not be for you\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060This is something you have to be really brave or really stupid for\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060You will either see enormous gains or enormous losses\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Invest wisely, don't spend your rent money, and read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060DD is short for Due Diligence, and it's basically just researching a stock before you buy in. There's plenty of great DD on this sub, and you can sort by the DD flair to see the highest-voted posts. Do that before asking dumb questions and risking your karma.\n\nIf you think there's anything else I should add, please reply and tell me.",

The best time to buy GME was 2 months ago, the second best time is NOW.\n3. Buy shares, not options. Invest only the money you can afford to lose.\n4. Don't fall for FUD. Any account can be a shill/bot, even the ones created before January. They are PAYING users to spread fear and enroll you to post negative comments/posts.\n5. GME has been and will always be the only play. Anything else is a distraction to limit the impact GME can have. (Yes, even RKT). Never will the planets align this perfectly again to trigger the biggest short squeeze of your lifetime.\n6. The most important point : Don't sell. Supply and demand : you have something they want, we all do. So YOU set the price you want. And the price can actually go up to infinity. This is going to be the biggest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen, don't ruin it being a paper hand and selling low.\n7. Hold. Hold. Hold. Selling at 1k is trolling. They want you to sell at 1k, that's why they keep spamming comments saying they put stop limits at 1k. 1k is lowball. 1k could just be a gamma squeeze. 10k is lowball.\n8. As stated by u/Polihanna, the squeeze will last multiple days. Don't be afraid that it lasts a few seconds and you'll miss it. You won't. \n9. Don't day-trade GME. It's extremely volatile, and you actually help them by selling shares that they can buy for cheap. You delay the squeeze and reduce its impact if you day-trade.\n10. THIS IS NOT A GAME OF GREED. IT IS A GAME OF TRUST.",
