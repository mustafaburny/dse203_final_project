However, the way I look at it is you still lost on those original 40 shares and your technically losing money because those shares never broke even.",

        "body": "Bitcoin supply and demand factors:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s supply is famously limited, with only 900 per day being created currently. Compare this to a trade volume around 3,000,000 daily. Unlike most commodities, an increased price does not lead to increased supply, so your Econ 101 supply curve is flat.\n\nThe recent bull run has instead been driven by increased demand, with four primary factors:\n\n* Institutional demand is the biggest story. When 150+ year old insurance company MassMutual buys in with a cool $250m, you know institutional acceptance is finally happening. Institutions hold just 15% of all Bitcoin and we should expect to see that increase dramatically this year.\n* New retail exposure. New demographics of retail buyers now have crypto exposure through easy, established channels like PayPal and Cashapp.\n* Payments use case. PornHub going crypto-only is a big deal IMO. Many people globally don\u2019t have credit cards and cryptocurrency holds the promise of actually increasing the reach of ecommerce. The internet revolutionized content delivery but has always been missing the same level of revolution in payments to complete the cycle. Porn has always been an innovation leader on the Internet, and if the PornHub experiment is successful, it could open the door for others.\n* Gold replacement. Investment banks have issued statements saying their clients are shifting their gold allocation to Bitcoin. Also, a survey of Millenials found that they prefer Bitcoin to gold. As fiat currencies devalue globally, Bitcoin gains.\n\nWe are just getting started and this bull run has a long way to go. I\u2019ve been in crypto professionally since 2013 and IMO we are nowhere close to the next top.",

        "body": "The positions are spread among portfolios:\n\nThe. mutual funds are in my work retirement account where all I can own are mutual funds.\n\nThe bulk of the ETF's are following a risk parity portfolio that I've devised. Based on both the All-Weather and Unconventional Success. The allocations should be close to this:\n\nhttps://lowlyinvestor.com/risk-parity-target-allocations-december-2020/\n\nThen all the remaining stocks are my play money/self managed account. Any month that that one outperforms, I shift money over to it from the risk parity account, and vice versa. Been keeping the records I have on my site only since beginning of June and am too lazy to try to backfill, but since then there's only been one month where money moved from my individual picks account back to my risk parity account. As you can see in the Risk Parity account, there's a heavy tilt away from fossil fuels (SPYX rather than the traditional SPY, as well as FAN and TAN). \n\nLots of the holdings in the individual stocks are just set and forget, unless the price gets too high then I sell. There was a LOT more Apple earlier this year, for instance - it was taking up 40% of that bucket, so I had to pare back. Microsoft has been slashed. Facebook has been sold.\n\nHigh dividend stocks like O and T, I'll continue to hold through thick and thin. Preferring low prices so long as the dividend doesn't get cut.\n\nThe latest additions are at the lower end of the capitalization scale. You'll see Upwork, RealReal, Southwest Airlines and recently, Elastic. Also a couple of meme stocks PLTR and GME, because I don't even know. \n\nYou think it odd to own so many stocks, Id find it worrysome to hold so few :) I agree with the notion of getting into ARKG. I may sell a little ARKW, and maybe even my entire FITB position to get into that. You probably have a better chance of striking it rich and hitting 7 figures, I assume I have a smaller chance of catastrophic failure.\n\nOh, and crypto. I have a little Bitcoin that I bought on both CashApp and PayPal, just because. I actually have more BTC, BCH and LTC all on a Ledger wallet. I haven't even looked at that in two years, I honestly forget how much I own. I'm trying not to look, in all honesty, as there are certainly some gains over there. \n\nMaybe I'll pull the balances and add them to my asset list next month :)",

Square is owned by someone who only believes in Bitcoin, while PayPal seems much more open to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is important because this will enable Square to offer many more profitable services to its customers. For example, PayPal has been rumored/linked to likely issuing a stablecoin pegged to the USD (built on Ethereum), which is a service that Square likely won\u2019t offer in the shorter term because they really only believe in Bitcoin which largely restricts their ability to offer these stablecoin services (including potentially offering DeFi services).",

Deflation or stagflation will prohibit an economy from growing e.g.) Japan over the last 30 years. \n\nBtc may not be the true answer but I can guarantee you that central banks are not.

But there needs to be somewhat stable prices and medium of exchange. Do V/MC/AMEX really need to take up to 4% of small business transactions to transfer money from one person to another, No crypto eliminates those companies. Do we even need WU or MGI for remittances, no, crypto solves for that. Can we get rid of BAC/WF/C et cetera? I\u2019d like to think we can.",
