In his 54 years running Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B), thousands of people have become millionaires by buying shares and then sitting on their hands while he turned the former textile manufacturer into one of the most-profitable holding companies on Earth. As of this writing, Berkshire owns dozens of subsidiaries that earn tens of billions of dollars a year, and has a market capitalization of nearly $560 billion. \n\nYet Buffett is best known for his skill as a great stock picker, and deservedly so. A massive portion of Berkshire's market value is derived from its roughly $215 billion stock portfolio. One of Berkshire's biggest holdings is Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC): The 378 million shares it owned at the end of last quarter is worth $19.8 billion at recent prices.\n\n\n===== ======\n\n\nSo how much money has the Oracle of Omaha made for himself and Berkshire investors on Wells Fargo? It depends on what you're measuring; on a cost basis, Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake has roughly doubled in value, netting about $11 billion in unrealized gains. However, that doesn't tell the entire story, including how much value Wells delivers to Berkshire's coffers in the form of its generous dividend.",

This means the trend is driven by a few companies such as Apple, Oracle, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Broadcom, Alphabet and Intel. We can see this in the S&amp;P 500, where no fewer than eight tech companies figure among the top 15 buyback programs. We still expect tech companies to continue dominating the buybacks spectrum (currently 31% of S&amp;P 500 gross buybacks) but the levels should gradually normalize from the abnormal amounts due to Trump\u2019s end-2017 tax reforms through cash repatriation and the boost to US GDP\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4317967-sixth-porsche](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4317967-sixth-porsche)",

Didn\u2019t mention it in my short post about the online retailing site because it was in response to the other comment about Amazon\u2019s impact on the public. \n\nAs you may well know, AWS\u2019s advantage may be slowly eroding as Microsoft wins the biggest tech military contract ever from AWS, meaning that it may develop capabilities to rival AWS\u2019s current dominance. This space is evolving fast. A decade ago Oracle was dominating this space, and it only took a few years for AWS to beat them. Microsoft may very well do the same to AWS as the tech race continues in the cloud computing sector. \n\nThat being said, it is undeniable that AWS\u2019s current dominance is a strong moat. But imo I believe the market is right in valuing Apple over Amazon taking into account the hundreds of factors on the table.",
