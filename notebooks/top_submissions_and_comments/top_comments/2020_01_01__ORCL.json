In his 54 years running Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B), thousands of people have become millionaires by buying shares and then sitting on their hands while he turned the former textile manufacturer into one of the most-profitable holding companies on Earth. As of this writing, Berkshire owns dozens of subsidiaries that earn tens of billions of dollars a year, and has a market capitalization of nearly $560 billion. \n\nYet Buffett is best known for his skill as a great stock picker, and deservedly so. A massive portion of Berkshire's market value is derived from its roughly $215 billion stock portfolio. One of Berkshire's biggest holdings is Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC): The 378 million shares it owned at the end of last quarter is worth $19.8 billion at recent prices.\n\n\n===== ======\n\n\nSo how much money has the Oracle of Omaha made for himself and Berkshire investors on Wells Fargo? It depends on what you're measuring; on a cost basis, Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake has roughly doubled in value, netting about $11 billion in unrealized gains. However, that doesn't tell the entire story, including how much value Wells delivers to Berkshire's coffers in the form of its generous dividend.",

This means the trend is driven by a few companies such as Apple, Oracle, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Broadcom, Alphabet and Intel. We can see this in the S&amp;P 500, where no fewer than eight tech companies figure among the top 15 buyback programs. We still expect tech companies to continue dominating the buybacks spectrum (currently 31% of S&amp;P 500 gross buybacks) but the levels should gradually normalize from the abnormal amounts due to Trump\u2019s end-2017 tax reforms through cash repatriation and the boost to US GDP\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4317967-sixth-porsche](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4317967-sixth-porsche)",

        "body": "Then one company goes down and you loose a substantial amount of your wealth !! Happens all the time. Any single company can be disrupted out of the market with relative ease and you may not be able to get out on time. \n\nDiversification is about security, you trade the potential for high gain for minimizing the potential for a high loss. That is why every investor is different, if you are young and have no problem riding out a share that went low until it recovers then that\u2019s great, you should take risks. \n\nBut when you really need your money, like a person who is living off a retirement account, and have to sell shares to live then concentrating your money would not be a great idea. Even a temporary low in the company price can cause a significant loss of money. \n\nThat is why they call Warren Buffet \u201cthe oracle of Omaha\u201d and \u201cthe greatest investor alive\u201d. His reputation isn\u2019t about taking the correct gamble, but about making a steady solid progress regardless of the circumstances",

Didn\u2019t mention it in my short post about the online retailing site because it was in response to the other comment about Amazon\u2019s impact on the public. \n\nAs you may well know, AWS\u2019s advantage may be slowly eroding as Microsoft wins the biggest tech military contract ever from AWS, meaning that it may develop capabilities to rival AWS\u2019s current dominance. This space is evolving fast. A decade ago Oracle was dominating this space, and it only took a few years for AWS to beat them. Microsoft may very well do the same to AWS as the tech race continues in the cloud computing sector. \n\nThat being said, it is undeniable that AWS\u2019s current dominance is a strong moat. But imo I believe the market is right in valuing Apple over Amazon taking into account the hundreds of factors on the table.",

TSMC is effectively a factor of the R&amp;D budgets from apple, qualcomm, nvidia, amd, mediatek, marvell, broadcom, xlinix, huawei...\n\nif you have the vision to realize what AMD can and most likely will accomplish, you would buy in at these levels without hesitation. if you are running a fund... the big and smart money... you are not interested in day trading. they want a nice stock that will have consistent growth for a minimum of two years. a growth company. they want an industry that is expanding. they are not looking at the past, they are looking forward to 2+ years (\"TTM PE\" vs \"forward PE\"), to when earnings will be around $5/share (at this rate) from a dominant company with almost zero debit and the best track recordd of any stock over the last two years.\n\nall aboard!
