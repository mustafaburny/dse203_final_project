They have over 3 times the money they need to service their existing debt which would allow them to sustain the net few years of operations without issue. They have a superior product to Microsoft and portfolio of services that appeal more to the user. Microsoft is only a serious threat because they can afford to provide Teams for free and subsidize that cost through their other revenue streams. Slack's current P/S ratio is under 23 and P/B ratio is under 21. They have a revenue retention rate of over 125% and target smaller businesses with greater appeal than Microsoft while still having a wide customer base among the large corporations including Shopify, IBM, Lyft, BBC, Intuit, Splunk, Fastly, RBC, Newscorp, Hubspot, TD Ameritrade, Vodafone, Target, Jet, Hello Fresh, NASA, Liberty Mutual, NBC, Buzzfeed, Turner, Nasdaq, Walmart, Nike, McKinsey, T-Mobile, Comcast, Airbnb, NY Times and many more. Ark Invest is bullish on this company and it is the 7th largest holding in their Inovation ETF and the 6th largest holding in their Next Generation Internet ETF. People may not like to root for the underdog when it comes to the stock market and monopolistic behemoth tech companies like Microsoft, but I like the idea of rooting for the smaller players with superior products and services that are trying to provide in a new market segment. Slack is also posting over 50% revenue growth this year and should post over 35% revenue growth next year.",

        "body": "1. **AMZN**. Amazon. At the core they are a disruptor and Bezos has the capital to legitimately compete in any space he wants. The pandemic only accelerated the timeline for Amazon's retail domination. AWS is dominating the cloud space. They have their hands in everything to the point where it's almost kind of scary.\n2. **INTU**. Intuit. Taxes aren't going away and they dominate the tax filing software space for individuals and professionals. Quickbooks, nearly every small business uses QB and the subscription model  for QBOnline is a cash cow. Plus they have been slowly transforming QB into a FinTech processor for all small business financial services. Payroll, Payments, Small Business Financing, POS, mobile payments, e-commerce payments, can all be processed through QB. They are basically doing everything SQ is doing with the added advantage of being fully integrated into the bookkeeping platform. SQ is trading at an insane multiple which INTU can benefit from once more people realize how competitive their FinTech offering is.\n3. **FB**. Facebook. Like it or not they have hands down the best advertising platform on the internet. Google SEO and Facebook Ads are must haves for any business and Facebook's return high ROI for most advertisers because of how much time the average user spends on FB and IG.  In the last 3 years we've seen them emerge virtually unscathed from scandal after scandal, continuously posting revenue and user growth. People are addicted to their platforms and their ad algorithms give amazing ROI for businesses to the point where it is necessity for advertisers. Their marketplace has practically replaced craigslist in the last 4 years, and now they are entering the e-commerce space with Facebook Shops. They are a cash-printing machine and still have room to grow. I understand not wanting to invest from a moral perspective but as a business they are as good as they come.\n4. **BIG**. Big Lots is a pure value play. Trading at only 2.77 PE and 8.30 forward PE. They have extremely solid fundamentals, every metric you look at is amazing, free cash flow, low debt, price to book, 2.5% dividend. The only thing that needs to be seen is if they can continue their sales growth (30% Q/Q). When compared to other discount retailers like Dollar General(DG), Dollar Tree(DLTR), Walmart(WMT), Target(TGT), Pricesmart(PSMT)  which are trading at 20+ PEs, they are severely discounted even after growing +300% since March's low. \n5. **PINS.** Pinterest. More of a risky pick but I like their chances. While Google and Facebook dominate advertising PINS is growing at an incredible rate and is unique in the sense that their users are actively engaging with products for DIY ideas, fashion, recipes, etc. Which means they are easy to advertise to. They are one of the top fastest growing social media companies.",

Stock marketing trading is also like the only place I ever see people tell others this is how you should learn. It\u2019s so counterintuitive to how education works in general. We don\u2019t put kids in math class and say \u201cthese are numbers now go and develop a thesis on how to put them together to make new numbers\u201d. We teach them how math works and different approaches for how to math. Hell even opening a small business has plenty of specific business models that you can research to see which one might work best for you. But trading is treated like this thing you have to learn on your own and blaze your own trail with. In reality, it would be much easier for a new trader to be shown 5 different ways to do due diligence on company\u2019s, 5 different types of trades you could make based on what that due diligence tells you, etc. Then that person could figure out what works for them and what they intuit the most. The vagueness surrounding trading advice can be so infuriating because it feels like people are just purposefully hiding things from you.",
