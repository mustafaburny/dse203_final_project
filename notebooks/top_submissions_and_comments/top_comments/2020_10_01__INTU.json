They have over 3 times the money they need to service their existing debt which would allow them to sustain the net few years of operations without issue. They have a superior product to Microsoft and portfolio of services that appeal more to the user. Microsoft is only a serious threat because they can afford to provide Teams for free and subsidize that cost through their other revenue streams. Slack's current P/S ratio is under 23 and P/B ratio is under 21. They have a revenue retention rate of over 125% and target smaller businesses with greater appeal than Microsoft while still having a wide customer base among the large corporations including Shopify, IBM, Lyft, BBC, Intuit, Splunk, Fastly, RBC, Newscorp, Hubspot, TD Ameritrade, Vodafone, Target, Jet, Hello Fresh, NASA, Liberty Mutual, NBC, Buzzfeed, Turner, Nasdaq, Walmart, Nike, McKinsey, T-Mobile, Comcast, Airbnb, NY Times and many more. Ark Invest is bullish on this company and it is the 7th largest holding in their Inovation ETF and the 6th largest holding in their Next Generation Internet ETF. People may not like to root for the underdog when it comes to the stock market and monopolistic behemoth tech companies like Microsoft, but I like the idea of rooting for the smaller players with superior products and services that are trying to provide in a new market segment. Slack is also posting over 50% revenue growth this year and should post over 35% revenue growth next year.",
