Also loaded on what was a speculative position last year with higher conviction now - bought quite a few CRSP at what I believe to be the bottom at the 78 range - currently avg at 102+-.{Not even mentioning my stupid PLTR,BB position - gambles going wrong atm, believing in the hype and the reason I bought hasnt changed still hence why i havent sold}\r  \n\r  \nAlthough I have sizeable losses here these positions have elevated my positions amazingly.\r  \n\r  \nHolding a sizeable position with xxx% returns on AMD and NIO and very bullish on SE - recently added to my position at 280\r  \n\r  \nbought into the AMC hype with a 14 avg and sold of 80% at around the 60 mark\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSquare shouldve been scalped and rebought 205-280 range and back is ridiculous but oh well\r  \n\r  \nsold JD into strenght to buy into my weaker positions - had a big position before. still bullish but seeing more upside elsewhere atm.\r  \n\r  \nI dont have any us mega caps- I know winners stay winners usually but I am looking for hopefully bigger returns albeith I run risk of big losses, clearly, as well - such as sizeble position in a clinical trial biotech AGTC - currently at a big loss aswell but that was expected. Lets see what happens here. stock at all time lows.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nfor example although im sitting at a 10avg with my SKLZ position the downside is limited here imo, and potential huge hence why I have been adding to my position lately a lot bellow 10\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI do recommend people look into CPNG and let me know their thoughts. I am torn between adding to this position or keeping it small.",

Gonna take a while to double your investment (assuming you bought today) but strong financially and bright future. \n\n$NIO is insanely overvalued. There\u2019s no argument here. All EV and renewable stocks, wouldn\u2019t suggest hopping in. P/Es are inflated so high it\u2019s a guarantee we\u2019ll see lower prices (a lot lower!) soon. History has shown.\n\nI like undervalued gems. \n\n$SMCI, $ASO, $VIRT, $ERIC, and $MTZ are my small cap stocks for long term hold. Each have their reasons as to why I\u2019m holding but more importantly, their financials are strong. P/S approximately 1 (tough to find this ratio in today\u2019s market. Gotta dig.) P/E ratios are low relative to competitors. Some have little long term debt. Good ROEs. Increasing revenue. Just safe to hold and DCA down during times like this for me. \n\nLarge cap stocks I\u2019m holding long are $TMUS, $VZ, $AAPL, $V, $MA, and waiting for $PYPL to hit $130 to hop in. But guess what? If it doesn\u2019t hit, I\u2019m not jumping in. Simple as that. Plenty of stocks out there, no reason why you should jump in a stock that hasn\u2019t convinced you yet.\n\nOr if you don\u2019t wanna bother and have a strong stomach to handle red days, buy $TQQQ. \n\nLast thing. Rule of thumb: if it\u2019s being newly mentioned highly on Wall Street bets, and media outlets, most likely it\u2019s too late.",
