I like VOO, but if you want to diversify outside of tech you may want to consider some value stocks and buy individual stocks instead of an ETF, or buy sector ETFs.  \n\nValue stocks that I'd recommend:  ABBV, ACN, AES, CLX, DIS, IBM, JNJ, JPM, KHC, KO, KR, LOW, MA, MAR, MCD, NVS, O, PEP, PFE, PLAY, SBUX, T, TD, TGT, TROW, VZ, WBA, WMT, WSM. I think you could easily pick any three to five of these and have a nicely balanced portfolio given the amount of money you are investing.\n\nSector ETFs that I like include:\n\nICLN, TAN or PBW - Clean energy/renewable energy\n\nFHLC, XLV - Health Care\n\nIDNA, ARKG - Genomic Research and DNA technology\n\nPRNT - 3D printing\n\nARKQ, THNK, ROBO - artificial intelligence and robotics (However, this is \"tech\")\n\nVFH, FNCL, XLF, IEFN - financial sector ETFs\n\nI'm not a financial advisor and have no business giving financial advice.

I set out with the intention of beating the market, and was successful at some points. Let me tell you I would have better far better off if I just started with building a good foundation (index funds). Now I\u2019m 25 and while I\u2019ve made some good investments ultimately my losses are still weighing me down (that said some of my investment theses have not played out so this can change in the future). To give some more perspective, I\u2019ve been working for 2 years and 4 months and I only have one years worth of max contributions in my 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA, when I could easily have maxed it out this whole time.\n\nGranted this isn\u2019t a terrible position to be in\u2014I\u2019m probably still ahead of many people my age and even some older than me. I\u2019m grateful for this and count my blessings every day. But I\u2019d be so much further along in my journey if I didn\u2019t indulge in so much speculation and gambling (yes even investing in companies like Apple or Microsoft for the long term is not foolproof.. just look back at giants past of the S&amp;P and see where they are today. IBM, XOM, Enron are some classic example). Index funds are truly the only investments you can blindly hold for a long period of time with minimal re evaluation and decision making.\n\nAs for what to buy, look for the lowest cost index funds you can find. VOO or VTI are classics. If you have fidelity, they have zero fee equivalents (FNILX,FZROX), which can save you a lot of money over time if you take into account compounding gains. Hope this helps!",

But let me keep it simple: AI can not think or reason, it is only used for limited tasks that involve crunching huge amounts of data that humans cannot. Now you need to ask yourself the question of whether or not IBM can do this for profit and grow their sales of AI services.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Because of covid 19 I don\u2019t think big corporate companies are going to want humans they are expensive and are snowflakes. There for most major companies will be more inclined to robots and artificial intelligence\n\nOK, among AI professionals IBM Watson is kinda considered a joke that did good at Jeopardy and nothing else. It's tried to expand into health but very few hospitals take it, and even then its only used in limited capacity to evaluate its judgements. I haven't heard of it being used widely, and there are certainly no clinical studies that have been done to evaluate any improvements over human professionals. Just the clinical study part should give you massive pause.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Plus you don\u2019t have to pay taxes for employing artificial intelligence\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\n\nI don't even know what this means.

Their acquisitions have been garbage and they're a garbage company. They will need a total overhauling as a company if they want to have growth in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Edit: When you walk down the street do you see IBM on the street or when you drive or when you go to the store no they are not a consumer goods product but corporate product. Pandemic happens corporations cut costs and restructure most companies will want to have less human work force thus AI will take over go to Walmart and look at the self checkout or when you go to a amazon warehouse tell me what you see boy.\n\nAgain, no one is using IBM's crappy Watson AI.

        "body": "I bought some stock on June 1st, not the best day price wise but it\u2019s the stock I plan to hold the longest out of my whole portfolio, except for MSFT maybe. I made a DD for myself and made a brief summary around April. Most of it is based on their 10-K last year and their first 10-Q of the year. The key here is that this has been seen as a dinosaur for the past decade, due to lack of innovation, terrible management decisions (crazy high EPS and a buyback program that should have been cut long ago), and recruiting issues. A new CEO (Arvind Krishna) and a switch to the cloud (and quantum computing for the 2030s at least) are the key changes that could drive change. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit messy, was not meant to be posted when I wrote it : \n\nIBM : New CEO Arvid Krishna has my trust, hope he will change top and mid tier management (which did weird accounting tricks like the pseudo Lenovo \u00ab\u00a0sale/buy\u00a0\u00bb, laid off workforce for no reason, did not R&amp;D enough, focused on business services and consulting too much, had the crazy 20$ EPS goal, etc\u2026). Krishna pushed Red Hat acquisition (open source enterprise software, will allow them to become hybrid cloud providers, hybrid cloud is interoperable (BFF example), scalable (ERP switch to 3rd parties), portable, and secure (user data still in private cloud)). Krishna was senior VP for cloud and cognitive software. \nIBM has switched industries several times throughout its life : time clocks, then tabulating machine, then typewriter, then mainframe (good changes), then personal computers (good initially but then poor because used competitors\u2019 chips), etc\u2026 Cloud/AI could be their next successful switch (1/3rd of revenue in 2019, still increasing). Quantum Computing too, as they\u2019ve strongly positioned themselves as industry leaders, but that\u2019s in the very, very long run.\nWhile not the most important aspect, company is a dividend aristocrat (increasing div payout for 25 years), but what matters is that div payment was never removed, even though I think it should have been decreased during the struggles of the 2010s and instead reinvested in R&amp;D, they should have also paused their share buyback program. Financials : P/E around 10 (very good for a tech company), P/BV is 5.5 (good for a tech company, especially one transitioning to less tangible assets), net income slowly increasing, current ratio of nearly 1 at end of 03/31 which is decent given Red Hat acquisition and coronavirus, D/E is 2.62 (that one is indeed bad, but they got cash I guess, still not great).",

        "body": "Bit of a personal anecdote here:\n\nSo I have a degree in IT with a focus on Computer Networking.\n\nI once interviewed for IBM because they had positions open for Network Admins.  Unfortunately, when I sat down and looked over their list of jobs I discovered that they were only looking for senior level positions (something they did not mention in the email they sent to my university).\n\nI decided to interview anyway because I was already there in suit and tie so I wasn't about to get all dressed up for nothing.\n\nThe interview went well, but the guy told me he just didn't have anything for me at the time.\n\nI decided to walk around afterwards and saw a guy interviewing for entry level programmers.  My campus did not offer a Software degree (they offered it at a different campus), but I did have to take 9 credits in basic programming which was Java, C++, and HTML.  I had already taken the Java and C++ classes.\n\nI sit down with the guy and we get to talking.\n\nHe asks my background in coding.  I tell him one intro in Java and C++ so far.\n\nHe asks why am I interviewing if my degree is not focused on coding.  I tell him because those two classes opened my eyes to something that I didn't even know I wanted before.  I love creating stuff with code, I find it cathartic to sit and stare at code, getting lost in it while trying to figure out where my errors are, the absolute joy of finally getting it to compile and run.  I even started to make some basic programs at home in my free time.\n\nHe asks me if I have any of my work to show him.  I did not bring any copies of my code because I wasn't even thinking about the possibility of interviewing for any other positions (let this be a lesson to anyone who's still getting their degree, bring everything!).\n\nI tell him I did have it on a thumb drive that I carry around in my briefcase, but of course he waves his hand and says that's a security issue (totally agreed).\n\nHe asks me what a function is.  I draw a blank.  I ended up stammering out something like, \"it's the part of the code that does stuff\".  Not necessarily wrong, but more of an ELI5 definition.\n\nHe shows me some code and asks what I can decipher from it.  It's a function that takes a variable, runs it through a formula, returns a variable, and then loops 4 more times using the new return variable each time, and finally shows a set of the return variables at the print out.  He confirmed that I was right.\n\nHe asks me what that sets of numbers is called.  Obviously it's an array, and I had heard the term before, but again I did not know at the time.  He frowns and says something along the lines of, \"You really don't know basic terminology.  You should work on that.\"\n\nWe shook hands and parted ways, never got a call back.  Now, I know I messed up by not having some of my work printed out, and not being up on the terminology.  But it really rubbed me raw that this guy was so hung up on terminology, knowing that coding was like 5% of my entire degree, and yet I still had a basic working knowledge of programming to at least be able to read and understand what was going on, and that I was passionate enough about it to go home and write some basic programs of my own.\n\nNow I don't know that the lack of terminology was the ultimate reason I was turned down.  I do know that they were looking to start up a class that would take about 3 years to go through, and they were going to teach a proprietary language that was similar to Java.  Obviously, the terminology would have been brought up again multiple times in that 3 year program.  The only clue I had for why I was turned down was the lack of lingo.\n\nI am now a manager at a FinTech company, and I don't ask \"lingo\" questions of interviewees.  I want to know if they understand the meat and potatoes of what the job entails because, to me, that means so much more.  Lingo will happen over time as they do the job.\n\nI'm not saying that is all the OP was concerned about in their interviews, but they certainly seem to think it's a flaw in an interviewee that makes them unsuitable for hiring.",

Almost everyday i would think about investing in the us stocks but I had to settle for stocks in my own country. I did lot of study my thesis everything on this topic. So on 22/06/2020 i started. Not a great time to enter. Made few mistakes at the beginning because of excitement.\n\nI can't predict every ups and downs. This one is very similar to 1999/2000. Check CSCO and QCOM chart for the period. You will see amazing similarity. And if you are asking why these stocks they were the market leaders of the time and their split marked the beginning of a bear market.",

It might not be quite as steep a bubble yet, but its definitely getting there.  it took 4 years to go from 1200 -&gt; 5000 in 2000.   4 years ago the nasdaq was 5000 or so, so I could see it gettingto even 15000 and then crashing.  maybe not quite as big, but still as someone above mentioned economic conditions are far far worse now and we have much more debt than we did in 2000 as a nation",
