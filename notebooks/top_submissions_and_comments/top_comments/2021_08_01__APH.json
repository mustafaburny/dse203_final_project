        "body": "I did the same thing. I started investing in 2016 going all Canadian cannabis (ACB, WEED, APH). In 2019 I pulled out 85% of my Cannabis and threw it into XEQT. The remaining 15% I held, and well, I think you guys can figure out what happened there. For people that have a fairly small portfolio (let\u2019s say 10-20-% of yearly earnings) I would go 50% XEQT and 50% individual stocks. If you think you can really beat XEQT, try your best, but 8/10 times, you won\u2019t.",

        "body": "Fair enough- good points. I'd point out a few things though:\n\n1) Market share for the top LPs (canopy, Aph, acb, Tilray) has been on a multi-year downward trend as Canada continues to license new operators and small players continue to take share. Not saying that continues forever but going to be a challenge. The legacy Aphria business had more cannabis revenue 1 year ago in Q4 2020 than this most recent report for example when the market expanded significantly in that time. Buying their way to $1B seems more likely \n\n2) 25% of all of Europe where there are hundreds of different players seems like a long shot. No doubt in a good position but 1/4 of the entire market is asking a lot. There are quite a few scaled, private companies targeting the export market to Europe \n\n3) All good \n\n4) I don't think it'll be any of the largest players. Cura and GTI are already larger by market cap and Trul/verano/cresco will continue to catch up. My point is mainly that they are essentially buying their way to $4B with this approach, meaning shareholders are getting diluted to fund it. It's not quite the same as organic growth that actually raises the share price \n\nPlausible sure, but unlikely imo. Would need to execute close to perfect at every aspect across the board",

I added the suggestions from the other comments for tickers more than 2 years old. You can run this tool on any companies you like to see which ones are the best fit. Since you are already using leveraged ETFs, I would recommend adding TMF (at least until bond yields start rising again). For individual stocks, I recommend LLY, PG, VZ, or any mega cap company that has less than .5 correlation to both of your ETFs.",

        "body": "Hi\n\nAs i am invested and did my DD and DCF on GEO:\n\nThere are 2 major risks:\n\nA) loss of contracts with us government agencies which could lead up to 50% drop in rev/op CF/profits\n\n-&gt; i did a sensitivity analysis and modeled out drops until - 50% overall after looking at all of their facilities\n-&gt; Conclusion: the margin of safety even in case of a partial loss of contracts is huge (IRR north of 20% for 10 y holding)\n\nB) refinancing risk: take a closer look at the payment schedule of GEOs debt. 2024 could be crucial as they are in need of hefty refinance by then. Problem is: some bank institutes don't want to finance them because of the bad press.\n\nMy take:\nA) offers a good margin of safety even if things go south. B) banks want one thing and that is make money. GEO offers strong CF and is likely to be able to repay debt and interest. I believe some institute is going to refinance them.\n\nI hope that helped. I wish you all the best and continue to do your own DD. I am interested in your opinion!\n\nBR,\nChris",

This means we have no edge in w.e analysis we have. those privy to this information before hand will have edge. If you are relying on this, your hope is that someone in the future sees the same value you see today.\n\nyou will find your dd has a tendency to be more right in a bull market, since everything is going up. \n\nIf you really want to confirm your DD and research ability, then you will have to find those come back stories in bull markets and have a high degree of success. You will also need to be able to identify when a stock will sell off.\n\nHowever, unless you are getting paid well and this is your sole occupation, its unlikely you will pick up on these, to the success that would confirm your ability.\n\nsome people will disagree with the above, but this is my observations after 15 years.\n\nYour best bet in being successful is focusing on risk management.\n\nYour overall portfolio should have an expected return and a plan for a drawdown. Within this portfolio you can have an allocation for riskier plays but a drawdown in these positions should not eclipse your expected annual return.\n\nThe real game is holding on to your winnings.",
