The remaining 15% I held, and well, I think you guys can figure out what happened there. For people that have a fairly small portfolio (let\u2019s say 10-20-% of yearly earnings) I would go 50% XEQT and 50% individual stocks. If you think you can really beat XEQT, try your best, but 8/10 times, you won\u2019t.",

        "body": "Fair enough- good points. I'd point out a few things though:\n\n1) Market share for the top LPs (canopy, Aph, acb, Tilray) has been on a multi-year downward trend as Canada continues to license new operators and small players continue to take share. Not saying that continues forever but going to be a challenge. The legacy Aphria business had more cannabis revenue 1 year ago in Q4 2020 than this most recent report for example when the market expanded significantly in that time. Buying their way to $1B seems more likely \n\n2) 25% of all of Europe where there are hundreds of different players seems like a long shot. No doubt in a good position but 1/4 of the entire market is asking a lot. There are quite a few scaled, private companies targeting the export market to Europe \n\n3) All good \n\n4) I don't think it'll be any of the largest players. Cura and GTI are already larger by market cap and Trul/verano/cresco will continue to catch up. My point is mainly that they are essentially buying their way to $4B with this approach, meaning shareholders are getting diluted to fund it. It's not quite the same as organic growth that actually raises the share price \n\nPlausible sure, but unlikely imo. Would need to execute close to perfect at every aspect across the board",

        "body": "Not sure how they get there based on his projections:\n\n1) $1B from the Canadian cannabis market- ~$53.7M in total cannabis sales last Q (included 1 month of Tilray so call it $75M) which includes some international revenue. So roughly a $250-300M annual run-rate meaning they need to 3-4x by 2024 in a very competitive Canadian market. Not impossible but quite a high bar. \n\n2) $1B out of Europe- I assume this includes the distribution business cause international cannabis revenue is fairly small at this point ($$20M/q of so). $66M in dist revenue this past quarter so again a $250M annual run-rate roughly on that. The distribution business is not a growing one so I assume they see most growth coming from the actual cannabis side then. For that, all of Europe is projected at a $3.5-3.8B in 2025 (so maybe closer to $3B for 2024) so that means Aph thinks will need to control ~25% of the entire European market to reach their numbers - very unlikely imo given there are no entry barriers on who can export to Europe. \n\n3) Expansion in alcohol/hemp seems somewhat reasonable. \n\n4) Buying an MSO with $1.5B in 2024 revenue. Again not impossible, but there will be just a handful of companies that size and they will obviously need to dilute significantly to pay for it. Maybe Columbia Care?     \n\nSo overall feels pumpy given they will essentially have to acquire/dilute like crazy to remotely approach that $4B number. I'd wager on the under",
