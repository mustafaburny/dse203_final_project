Expect at least 5% jump\n\nEXPECT: Banks are no longer allowing buy backs for a lot of companies. Expect companies and banks to liquidate falling shares to cover short term liquidity needs \n\nEDIT: EXPECT: More unscheduled Repos that may temporarily pump the market - This means buy longer dated puts. 3 weeks minimum. 2-3 standard deviations OTM **maximum**.\n\nEXPECT: A low of today near 245, likely around 3PM. \n\nEXPECT: A lot of sideways movement this week in the downward direction, likely will hurt you with IV but wont be an IV killer\n\nEXPECT: Friday to have a massive run up and a gap down Monday morning.\n\nEXPECT: Approx 10-25 thousand infections in the US, if testing permits. Actual values will likely be closer to 30-40 thousand suspected cases. \n\nEXPECT: Major metropolitan areas to shut down all nonessential businesses. \n\n\n# GOOD LUCK, THIS HAS BEEN YOUR NOON DD.

Some people do short/long MA/EMA crossovers but I feel like it's kind of pointless.  Short MAs are pretty much going to be on candle anyway.\n\nRSI is pretty simple on longer windows, anytime it's below 40 it's oversold, anytime it's below 40 with other bearish indicators it's a full blown selloff. On shorter windows it's more used to pick entry positions.  For example, this monday/tuesday I'm going to be using it to pick my short/put entry.

        "body": "After the fact, you can clearly see the downward channel. You can even see arbitrary lines that very clearly acted as support or resistance along the way. \n\nThe problem is that the market actually sets up hundreds of such lines. It sets up major lines, minor lines, horizontal lines, channel lines, if-it-ever-reaches-here lines, and more.  It sets up expected lines, and it sets up backup-plan lines. It sets up a bull line and a bear line. And then throw in moving averages and other very common indicators that constrain price action as well. And all these lines and indicators do have some effect on how the algos play and what eventually happens... but only some effect. \n\nIn the end, the exact way it ends up playing out depends on which lines the market decide to respect throughout that specific day. Whichever lines the market respects that day become the lines that are noticeable after-the-fact. If the bull line gets respected, price action bounces off it, or hugs right along it before breaking through 15 bars later, then we notice that line later and completely ignore the bear line that never ended up being relevant because the market moved away from it. And the same the other way. \n\nTrying to predict the market is basically like trying to predict which lines a majority of algos and market participants are likely to respect. They become self-fulfilling in some ways. If everyone believes that the first reversion to the 15min MA after a big trend will be rejected / bounce off, then it will be that way bc a majority of market participants will act accordingly and make it so. If everyone believes the first hit to a recent low or the low of the week will be rejected (like Friday's 2900 hit as the first time to hit 2900 since March 2nd lows) then bears will close their shorts and bulls will accumulate at that line and make it so. \n\nTough game.",

        "body": "Here are the usual caveats:  I'm just a guy in my bedroom.  I don't have a fancy MBA or work at some prestigious, boutique financial firm.  I'm just a guy trying to day/swing-trade for a living in my humble abode.  Watching the show, *Billions*, back in 2016 is what first piqued my interest.  And I started actively trading at the beginning of 2019.\n\n**One:**  Re hard economic data and China-- It's a country of \\~1.4 billion people.  Because of the one-child policy that lasted for decades, there's also a pretty big M/F gender disparity.  Additionally, in such a top-heavy government, Xi cannot afford to look weak for much longer; his COVID-19 honeymoon is quickly waning, IMHO.  Many big companies are already highly automated anyways.  Those of them that aren't will simply throw human bodies at the assembly lines to meet production quotas again, regardless of the infections.  Remember, there are no human rights in China; it's a communist state.  Either come to work or you're fired and will never work again *anywhere* for the rest of your days.  I recall that scene from Chernobyl where the workers were already so badly radiated that they decided to just keep shoveling the uranium \"for the greater good.\"  In times of crisis, humans lives (esp in communist states) are forfeit and cheap in the mission of the almighty dollar/RMB.  Gotta keep the engine of capitalism humming!  (There is some great irony in this, I know.)\n\n**Two:**  Looking forward, what is the strategic macro picture?  Here's my speculation for several moves ahead on the board:\n\n\\- Meat-space is going to get increasingly more fraught.  I currently live in an apt rental complex and I already see those Amazon Prime vans making multiple trips *a day* delivering stuff to our complex.  Millennials are already reluctant to go outside.  My God, back in my day, going to the mall, getting pizza, and hanging out at the arcade was a thing.  [Nowadays.](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/05/dead-malls-everywhere/588970/) \n\n\\- The other day I was in line at our local Walmart (when times are good, it's Target and Whole Foods.  When times are like now, it's Walmart and Aldi's) and some guy ahead of me was in line was trying to use multiple gift cards to make a huge purchase.  There was some problem with the register and the whole ordeal took something like ten minutes as the queue grew increasingly long, with everyone inline considerably annoyed.   Yes, there was something like twenty registers, but only three were manned at the time (it was a weekday afternoon).  I mean, seriously, can you blame millennials for not wanting to venture out into meat-space?  It's awful.\n\n\\- So back to now:  What are the implications of COVID-19?  Will it make meat-space more attractive or less?  You do that math.  My feeling is that the Coronavirus will just accelerate what had already been a growing trend:  People doing more commerce from home, people being more entertained at home, etc.  I'm a big follower of a16z and their big claim to fame is *\"Software is Eating the World.\"*  I wholeheartedly believe in that.  This is why I currently have huge positions and am overweight in memory and semiconductors.  I believe in more datacenters, more people going online (according to Andreessen, only half of the global population is currently online.  Vast swathes of South America, Africa, etc are still in the queue), and the basic human way-of-life is fundamentally changing.\n\n**Also:**  I do believe we'll eventually figure out crypto.  And that translates into (my belief, anyway) a big/bright future for semis and memory.  Long AMD and MU!",
