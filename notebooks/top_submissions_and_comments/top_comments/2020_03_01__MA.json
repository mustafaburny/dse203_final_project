Expect at least 5% jump\n\nEXPECT: Banks are no longer allowing buy backs for a lot of companies. Expect companies and banks to liquidate falling shares to cover short term liquidity needs \n\nEDIT: EXPECT: More unscheduled Repos that may temporarily pump the market - This means buy longer dated puts. 3 weeks minimum. 2-3 standard deviations OTM **maximum**.\n\nEXPECT: A low of today near 245, likely around 3PM. \n\nEXPECT: A lot of sideways movement this week in the downward direction, likely will hurt you with IV but wont be an IV killer\n\nEXPECT: Friday to have a massive run up and a gap down Monday morning.\n\nEXPECT: Approx 10-25 thousand infections in the US, if testing permits. Actual values will likely be closer to 30-40 thousand suspected cases. \n\nEXPECT: Major metropolitan areas to shut down all nonessential businesses. \n\n\n# GOOD LUCK, THIS HAS BEEN YOUR NOON DD.

Some people do short/long MA/EMA crossovers but I feel like it's kind of pointless.  Short MAs are pretty much going to be on candle anyway.\n\nRSI is pretty simple on longer windows, anytime it's below 40 it's oversold, anytime it's below 40 with other bearish indicators it's a full blown selloff. On shorter windows it's more used to pick entry positions.  For example, this monday/tuesday I'm going to be using it to pick my short/put entry.  When it's overbought on the 1h window I'll either buy a put or go short.",

Pneumonia is closer to 30% and when they say mild it means the worst flu of your life. The US healthcare system will get completely shocked and if we start seeing rising numbers like South Korea or Italy there will be some serious pain. In addition other places like South America, Central America, and Africa could see death rates as high as 10-15% due to extremely poor health care.\n\nNext the supply chain right now is completely screwed. Los Angeles saw a drop off 25% shipping in February which the last two weeks it was a reduction of almost 36%. In march they believe it could be a yoy drop of 40 % which is catastrophic. Any rally here would make a good short just buy Puts out a few months. I don't want to get into all the implications of if widget C isn't produced, but widget A, B, and D are here but make your own assumptions.\n\nIn addition I have traded for a long time and one thing I know is the market hates uncertainty. Supply chain, virus, and panic is not a model that can be priced in. I don't see any of these factors being settled any time soon.",

Ofcourse I have a \"fundamental opinion\" which goes first, also I look a lot bond yields &amp; currencies for confirmation bias, because I believe those markets are less speculative.
