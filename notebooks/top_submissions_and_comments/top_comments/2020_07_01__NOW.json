        "body": "IV Crush Explained:  \nBased on the state of the current market as a whole, and the state of the stock in question, the stock will have a certain % of Implied Volatility.  \nFor example, if the IV is 40%, this means that a year from today, the market expects that the current stock price will either be 40% higher than it is today, or 40% lower than it is today.\n\n  \nThat's why IV was very high for stocks during Coronavirus, because the market was volatile and nobody really knew what was gonna happen, so there was a chance for stock prices to move drastically either up or down.  \nAbout a couple of weeks or a month before the earnings of a stock, people start talking about how the company will perform on their earnings report. If everything has been chugging along normally, their Implied Volatility stays pretty low since nobody expects there to be a huge move in either direction.  \n\n\nNow in the case of Tesla, which is a meme stock (basically incredibly popular and in the news all the time), there are drastically varying opinions. Some people believe they will fail their earnings for Q2 and the stock will crash down to 1000 or less points.   \nSome people believe they will succeed and the stock price will jump to 2000 points.  \nBecause of these drastically varying opinions and controversy, the Implied Volatility goes up.   \n\n\nBecause IV goes up, more people buy into the stock thinking they could earn some nice tendies. This increases the demand for options, which in turn raises the premium fee of buying those options.  \n\n\nThe demand and premium price stays high right up until earnings, since people are expecting a huge move in the stock price. As soon as the earnings gets released, everyone knows the truth and they know if they were wrong or right. The stock price changes quickly in after earnings trading to reflect the earnings report.  \n\n\nThis instantly crushes the Implied Volatility since nobody expects the price the move drastically anymore, and this GREATLY reduces the premium price of the option you own, so you lost all of that extra value due to increased demand.   \n\n\nOn top of that, your option expires tomorrow and the extrinsic value of your option decayed over time. Tomorrow, the extrinsic value will be worthless, so all you will be left with is the difference in stock price and your strike price. If you're not above break even, you basically lost all of your money.",

        "body": "For 8 years, I worked at Intel as an electrical engineer designing circuits for the future manufacturing processes that Intel would be releasing 2-4 years into the future. There are literally thousands of MS and PhD engineers working on the myriad of challenges involved in making better computer chips. All the way from the design of the manufacturing tools, the amount of NAND gates in a library, the modeling and forecasting of dozens of transistor parameters, writing and supporting the simulation tools, to what I was doing designing and testing: analog circuits in a not yet stable manufacturing process. And hundreds of other challenges that each had teams from a few to a few dozen engineers trying to solve them. It's an insanely complex task. Most engineers working on any of these tasks are so specialized that they don't have any idea how to do the job of the engineers sitting a few aisles over. These engineers are 5-9 management layers below the CEO. Other companies operate the same way, it's just how chip design is done. \n\nIntel's main advantage over the last few decades was that it continuously had the most advanced manufacturing process, maintaining a 1-2 year lead over its closest competitors. However over the last ten years, TSMC has caught up and now overtaken Intel. This is mostly due to Intel's engineering struggles with it's last few manufacturing processes. These things spend half a decade in planning and development. Decisions were made years ago that they are now stuck with. \n\nYour points are all about top level management and I'm sure there's some truth to how important the CEO's decisions are, but I think Intel's current problems are primarily engineering problems with the manufacturing process. I sincerely doubt it's for lack of investment by CEOs. I think it's more likely that TSMC had better engineering talent and was able to do things more creatively that ended up wildly successful.  And surely some luck there too.\n\nAMD has been doing well with their architectures recently and they should get credit for that, but their architectures were always quite good, the thing holding them back was their process and what had been a disadvantage, with TSMC, is now a huge advantage. They are poised to take market share, but they mostly have TSMC to thank for that.",

        "body": "That often doesn't work in practice.\n\nSuppose you have the highest pay in the industry.  You spend $1B researching 500 different formulas for batteries.  Any of them is simple enough that anybody could memorize them.  It turns out that 499 of them are duds, but 1 of them is a significant improvement.\n\nHere is the problem - that formula is something that dozens of employees at least end up knowing.  It cost the company $1B to obtain that formula - not so much to obtain the formula but to figure out that this is the one worth putting in the product.\n\nNow some other company can just offer one of those dozen employees $1M as a signing bonus and they get a $1B secret.  So, pay them all $10M a year!  Well, now the company can offer $100M and STILL get a $1B secret.  \n\nAnd it wasn't like any of those dozen employees \"discovered\" that formula due to their ingenuity and deserve all the money personally.  Maybe those 500 formulas are just all random tweaks of a common formula, and it was purely trial and error that lead to the right formula.  ANYBODY who did the work would have discovered it - the company just had to assign the testing to 100 scientists testing 5 formulas each at great expense, and one got lucky, purely because they were lucky.\n\nWhile I agree that companies should pay employees well to retain them, that doesn't mean that this is a substitute for IP law.  If you make the cheapest approach to R&amp;D to let somebody else do the work and then just poach their employees for a bit more, then nobody will do R&amp;D, and all of those employees will end up unemployed.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I think that plenty of employees are underpaid or not given sufficient bonuses for their creative discoveries.  However, the person who pulls the ball out of the lottery machine shouldn't get a cut of the jackpot every time somebody wins just for being the person who drew the ball.",

So to hedge/protect your position you could buy puts on Tesla which gives you the right to sell 100 shares of Tesla at an agreed upon price. This would hedge your position because if the price of Tesla falls the value of your puts would go up. Now buying puts can be expensive, so to cover the cost of that you would sell   calls on the Tesla stock you already own giving someone else the right to buy from you at an agreed upon price, and use the premium from selling your calls to pay for your puts you just bought. \n\nThe only disadvantage to this strategy is if Tesla really moons your going to miss out on more profit because the calls you sold are going to get exercised and your shares of Tesla are going to get called away for a lower price then what Tesla is currently trading at in this scenario.

Their cash cow being licensing of Windows and Office.\n\nWhen Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014, he had a different philosophy and started opening up Microsoft to different revenue streams.  Microsoft became more open to open source and the company became more relevant again with enterprise companies.  For example, there is now native support to allow running Linux on Windows.  This would never have happened under Ballmer.\n\nWall street has always rewarded companies with re-occurring revenue model vs companies that had a \"CAPEX\" or \"one time purchase\" revenue model such as Apple (but now Apple is pivoting more towards software and services) with higher valuation.  Microsoft shifted from one time purchase model of their consumer Windows (95/XP, Vista, 7, etc) and Office licensing.  Office became O365, which could be purchased on a monthly/annual subscription.\n\nAzure services helped and played into the re-occurring revenue model for Microsoft.  AWS was introduced in 2006 and took many years to be where they are at today.  Microsoft is playing catch up with Azure.  However, the big advantage with Microsoft and Azure is that they have an existing enterprise organization that sold into enterprise accounts for many years.\n\nAWS didn't have an enterprise sales team and in the early years really only catered to the developers and \"rogue IT\".  Even today, in my opinion, AWS still doesn't have have the enterprise sales organization they need to compete more effectively.\n\nSame with Google.  Google never had an enterprise sales organization for GCP and is really playing catch up.  It was mentioned by Thomas Kurian that GCP sales team was only 1/15th the size of Microsoft/AWS and would like to be 1/5th the size in the next 2 years.",

Their management either laid off too many important, expensive engineers in an effort to save money. Or they were far too aggressive which led to the massive failure they had today. Or a combination of both. There are definitely fields where you can layoff staff and outsource costs to save money. But semiconductor manufacturing definitely isn't one of them.\n\nI've said in other posts that shareholders are tolerating this now, but they won't do so forever.

Or if the pandemic gets worse than it is now which is becoming more and more likely as fall/winter season approaches. \n\n2. Not being worried is actually pretty worrying. It\u2019s normally good to be optimistic but in certain times of uncertainly it\u2019s better to be wary than it is to be blindly hopeful. That\u2019s how unexpected bad news can make a bad situation worse.\n\n3. I cannot stress that we haven\u2019t even begun to see the economic ramifications yet. Entire supply chains and industries will be drastically affected after the temporary period ends. Who knows how far the hospitality industry will come back. What will all those millions of people that rely on those jobs do after the pandemic ends if those jobs don\u2019t come back? Government action seems like the only solution.
