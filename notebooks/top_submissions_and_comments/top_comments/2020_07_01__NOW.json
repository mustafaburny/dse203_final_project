        "body": "IV Crush Explained:  \nBased on the state of the current market as a whole, and the state of the stock in question, the stock will have a certain % of Implied Volatility.  \nFor example, if the IV is 40%, this means that a year from today, the market expects that the current stock price will either be 40% higher than it is today, or 40% lower than it is today.\n\n  \nThat's why IV was very high for stocks during Coronavirus, because the market was volatile and nobody really knew what was gonna happen, so there was a chance for stock prices to move drastically either up or down.  \nAbout a couple of weeks or a month before the earnings of a stock, people start talking about how the company will perform on their earnings report. If everything has been chugging along normally, their Implied Volatility stays pretty low since nobody expects there to be a huge move in either direction.  \n\n\nNow in the case of Tesla, which is a meme stock (basically incredibly popular and in the news all the time), there are drastically varying opinions. Some people believe they will fail their earnings for Q2 and the stock will crash down to 1000 or less points.   \nSome people believe they will succeed and the stock price will jump to 2000 points.  \nBecause of these drastically varying opinions and controversy, the Implied Volatility goes up.   \n\n\nBecause IV goes up, more people buy into the stock thinking they could earn some nice tendies. This increases the demand for options, which in turn raises the premium fee of buying those options.  \n\n\nThe demand and premium price stays high right up until earnings, since people are expecting a huge move in the stock price. As soon as the earnings gets released, everyone knows the truth and they know if they were wrong or right. The stock price changes quickly in after earnings trading to reflect the earnings report.  \n\n\nThis instantly crushes the Implied Volatility since nobody expects the price the move drastically anymore, and this GREATLY reduces the premium price of the option you own, so you lost all of that extra value due to increased demand.   \n\n\nOn top of that, your option expires tomorrow and the extrinsic value of your option decayed over time. Tomorrow, the extrinsic value will be worthless, so all you will be left with is the difference in stock price and your strike price. If you're not above break even, you basically lost all of your money.",

        "body": "For 8 years, I worked at Intel as an electrical engineer designing circuits for the future manufacturing processes that Intel would be releasing 2-4 years into the future. There are literally thousands of MS and PhD engineers working on the myriad of challenges involved in making better computer chips. All the way from the design of the manufacturing tools, the amount of NAND gates in a library, the modeling and forecasting of dozens of transistor parameters, writing and supporting the simulation tools, to what I was doing designing and testing: analog circuits in a not yet stable manufacturing process. And hundreds of other challenges that each had teams from a few to a few dozen engineers trying to solve them. It's an insanely complex task. Most engineers working on any of these tasks are so specialized that they don't have any idea how to do the job of the engineers sitting a few aisles over. These engineers are 5-9 management layers below the CEO. Other companies operate the same way, it's just how chip design is done. \n\nIntel's main advantage over the last few decades was that it continuously had the most advanced manufacturing process, maintaining a 1-2 year lead over its closest competitors. However over the last ten years, TSMC has caught up and now overtaken Intel. This is mostly due to Intel's engineering struggles with it's last few manufacturing processes. These things spend half a decade in planning and development. Decisions were made years ago that they are now stuck with. \n\nYour points are all about top level management and I'm sure there's some truth to how important the CEO's decisions are, but I think Intel's current problems are primarily engineering problems with the manufacturing process. I sincerely doubt it's for lack of investment by CEOs. I think it's more likely that TSMC had better engineering talent and was able to do things more creatively that ended up wildly successful.  And surely some luck there too.\n\nAMD has been doing well with their architectures recently and they should get credit for that, but their architectures were always quite good, the thing holding them back was their process and what had been a disadvantage, with TSMC, is now a huge advantage. They are poised to take market share, but they mostly have TSMC to thank for that.",

Any of them is simple enough that anybody could memorize them.  It turns out that 499 of them are duds, but 1 of them is a significant improvement.\n\nHere is the problem - that formula is something that dozens of employees at least end up knowing.  It cost the company $1B to obtain that formula - not so much to obtain the formula but to figure out that this is the one worth putting in the product.\n\nNow some other company can just offer one of those dozen employees $1M as a signing bonus and they get a $1B secret.  So, pay them all $10M a year!  Well, now the company can offer $100M and STILL get a $1B secret.  \n\nAnd it wasn't like any of those dozen employees \"discovered\" that formula due to their ingenuity and deserve all the money personally.  Maybe those 500 formulas are just all random tweaks of a common formula, and it was purely trial and error that lead to the right formula.  ANYBODY who did the work would have discovered it - the company just had to assign the testing to 100 scientists testing 5 formulas each at great expense, and one got lucky, purely because they were lucky.\n\nWhile I agree that companies should pay employees well to retain them, that doesn't mean that this is a substitute for IP law.  If you make the cheapest approach to R&amp;D to let somebody else do the work and then just poach their employees for a bit more, then nobody will do R&amp;D, and all of those employees will end up unemployed.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I think that plenty of employees are underpaid or not given sufficient bonuses for their creative discoveries.  However, the person who pulls the ball out of the lottery machine shouldn't get a cut of the jackpot every time somebody wins just for being the person who drew the ball.",

So the real question is when do we see inflation? \n\nAt the end of the day Mark is right, asset prices are frothy and you shouldnt put more in the market right now then you can stomach to lose.

So to hedge/protect your position you could buy puts on Tesla which gives you the right to sell 100 shares of Tesla at an agreed upon price. This would hedge your position because if the price of Tesla falls the value of your puts would go up. Now buying puts can be expensive, so to cover the cost of that you would sell   calls on the Tesla stock you already own giving someone else the right to buy from you at an agreed upon price, and use the premium from selling your calls to pay for your puts you just bought. \n\nThe only disadvantage to this strategy is if Tesla really moons your going to miss out on more profit because the calls you sold are going to get exercised and your shares of Tesla are going to get called away for a lower price then what Tesla is currently trading at in this scenario. But profits are still profits, and this strategy protects you from losing bad if the \"Tesla bubble\" pops. (Idk if it's actually a bubble, Idk anything anymore in this market)",

It's honestly sort of amazing how many mistakes Intel has made in the past year or so, and they are legitimately at risk of becoming completely uncompetitive.\n\nThey basically lost 100% of the enthusiast/custom PC market overnight, and most of their revenue now comes from contracts with Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc for desktop and notebook CPUs (and a few other random components, like wifi and Bluetooth cards). And, these companies will almost definitely be looking to AMD, as Intel's 7nm chips aren't expected to be available until *at least* 2022, and AMD is already mass-producing. Depending on how hard these companies ditch Intel, it could be an actual death blow. \n\nAnd that doesn't even bring up the issue that things are shifting more and more to mobile platforms, where Intel completely failed. Companies like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm absolutely dominate in the mobile SoC sector and managed to castrate a titan when Intel attempted to enter that market and failed miserably. \n\nIt's bad news all around. \n\nDoes that mean they can't come back? No. Of course they can. But the concerns are real.\n\nWhat other major stocks have you seen recently crash 13% on earnings then just... Stay there? Flat? We are in the most legendary dip-buying market of all time, where almost any dip will be bought without any logic, and yet no one would touch INTC, which is one of the biggest tech companies in the world.\n\nIt's a bit concerning.\n\nYour DD is basically \"bruh, it's Intel.

Anyone posting to the investing subreddit is likely doing pretty good financially, which likely means they've got a much bigger financial cushion 12 years later.  I was an entry level grunt in corporate America in 2008 still paying off student loans.  In 2020, I'm now in a middle management role with a large enough cushion to fall back on if I were to lose my job.  Accordingly, 2008 felt a lot worse to me personally, but the economy is more than my personal experience.  Graduating college in 2008 is still preferable to graduating college in 2020, in my opinion.\n\nAdditionally, it's still very early in the COVID crisis timeline.  The dust hasn't settled on this at all yet.  People talk about 2008 as if the crisis happened in a single year and things were fine right away, but in reality, things started getting bad in 2007, and things were still pretty dicey through 2011 or so.  We're less than six months into the impact here.  Things like eviction protections and expanded unemployment benefits have dampened the impact, but those won't last forever.

        "body": "Long history to answer your question, but on a high level.....\n\nUnder Steve Ballmer (2000-2014), Microsoft was all about preserving their cash cow.  Their cash cow being licensing of Windows and Office.\n\nWhen Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014, he had a different philosophy and started opening up Microsoft to different revenue streams.  Microsoft became more open to open source and the company became more relevant again with enterprise companies.  For example, there is now native support to allow running Linux on Windows.  This would never have happened under Ballmer.\n\nWall street has always rewarded companies with re-occurring revenue model vs companies that had a \"CAPEX\" or \"one time purchase\" revenue model such as Apple (but now Apple is pivoting more towards software and services) with higher valuation.  Microsoft shifted from one time purchase model of their consumer Windows (95/XP, Vista, 7, etc) and Office licensing.  Office became O365, which could be purchased on a monthly/annual subscription.\n\nAzure services helped and played into the re-occurring revenue model for Microsoft.  AWS was introduced in 2006 and took many years to be where they are at today.  Microsoft is playing catch up with Azure.  However, the big advantage with Microsoft and Azure is that they have an existing enterprise organization that sold into enterprise accounts for many years.\n\nAWS didn't have an enterprise sales team and in the early years really only catered to the developers and \"rogue IT\".  Even today, in my opinion, AWS still doesn't have have the enterprise sales organization they need to compete more effectively.\n\nSame with Google.  Google never had an enterprise sales organization for GCP and is really playing catch up.  It was mentioned by Thomas Kurian that GCP sales team was only 1/15th the size of Microsoft/AWS and would like to be 1/5th the size in the next 2 years.",

Their management either laid off too many important, expensive engineers in an effort to save money. Or they were far too aggressive which led to the massive failure they had today. Or a combination of both. There are definitely fields where you can layoff staff and outsource costs to save money. But semiconductor manufacturing definitely isn't one of them.\n\nI've said in other posts that shareholders are tolerating this now, but they won't do so forever.

Or if the pandemic gets worse than it is now which is becoming more and more likely as fall/winter season approaches. \n\n2. Not being worried is actually pretty worrying. It\u2019s normally good to be optimistic but in certain times of uncertainly it\u2019s better to be wary than it is to be blindly hopeful. That\u2019s how unexpected bad news can make a bad situation worse.\n\n3. I cannot stress that we haven\u2019t even begun to see the economic ramifications yet. Entire supply chains and industries will be drastically affected after the temporary period ends. Who knows how far the hospitality industry will come back. What will all those millions of people that rely on those jobs do after the pandemic ends if those jobs don\u2019t come back? Government action seems like the only solution.

Already now you won't deal with AWS without dedicated 2-3 specialised cloud engineers with certifications. Hundred of services, a lot of of them duplicate each other (just try to google how to enable logging &amp; monitoring in AWS). The same was with Oracle 20 years ago, their RDBMS was like invetiable, but very very complex and the cost of adopting Oracle grew every year. The same story with AWS now, as for me.",

Lots of stores do online shopping and delivery these days.  [Jet.com](https://Jet.com) was a thing.\n\nOracle, Azure, Google all have AWS competitors.\n\nNFLX, Disney+, et al for video streaming.\n\nAmazon isn't getting big via acquisitions of its competitors, either.  There's no antitrust discussion like there would be if ATT tried to buy Verizon, for example.\n\nI think AMZN is safe from any kind of antitrust lawsuit.

If a company is very difficult to replace their business with, then that is a moat. (Oracle for example)\n\nNetwork Effect- As the business expands, do they create channels where only their business can run through? Are consumers becoming almost forced to use their business because they are so widely accepted? If so, this is a moat.\n\nCost Advantages (Non scale and Scale) - Does the company have access to tech that makes production cheaper or the cheapest available? Is there scale so massive competition can\u2019t move in? Are they able to keep their prices low through other means? If so, this is a moat.\n\nHope this helps!",

Back in 2000 Microsoft was riding high but there was tons of bad news and it lagged for next decade or so. Post Balmer company pivoted to a cloud based and again is a huge player.\n\nGE, Cisco did not reinvent themselves, if anything GE went downhill post JW while Cisco was hit hard by white glove manufacturers of their core products and did not innovate fast enough to be relevant. On the other hand Amazon, Apple etc reinvented themselves significantly since 2000 and are the biggest players along with Microsoft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo blindly following even Oracle of Omaha is not a great idea. He avoided most tech firms and invested in oil/energy/banks. Not exactly ideal approach in past 2 decades. Thankfully post Todd Combs and Tedd Weschler coming in, Berkshire has invested in some tech firms and now Apple is the biggest position in Berkshire portfolio.",
