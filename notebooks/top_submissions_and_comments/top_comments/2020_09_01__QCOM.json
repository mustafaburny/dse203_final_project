AMD, Apple, Qualcomm are all using TSMC fab and are all moving between 7nm EUV and 5nm EUV nodes.\n\nOP should be buying TSMC (or ASML) if it's the process that they are impressed by because they are the ones that produced it, Apple is just a customer.\n\nEdit: Also it's not the chip that's 5nm it's just the name of the fab process and is roughly indicative of the transistor size. Really the properties that matter for a chip (outside of just how good the design is) are the chip area (in mm^2), transistor count (which is a function of transistor size) and yield (which is a function of size &amp; process)",

TSMC is the big loser in this since new nodes are so crazy expensive now and they need crazy volume to drive down cost of production and still have enough to invest billions in the next node. Samsung is also a huge loser. I bet you they were almost excited for a few hours at the TSMC/Huawei ban, before realizing they would probably be covered as well.",

        "body": "Broad Market:  That's tough to say.  If your very bullish on Tech stocks, QQQ might be your best bet. If you want a broader fund, then VOO is a good one.  QQQ uses the NASDAQ 100 as its bench mark while VOO uses the S&amp;P 500 as its benchmark. The top five holdings are the same for each of these, but in different percentages.  Another broad market fund I like is IWF. IWF uses the Russell 1000 as its benchmark.  It has a very good track record and seems to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over time. It's very similar to QQQ in its holdings, but again, percentages are slightly different.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices for a broad market fund. \n\nTech:  You'll get lots of opinions on this.  ARKQ and ARKW would be the choice of the ARK funds if you want it to be purely tech.  If you want to invest in disruptive innovative companies, but don't mind expanding beyond tech, consider ARKK. \n\nAnother one I like for tech is XLK. However, you have to keep in mind that XLK is almost 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft.  If you believe in those two companies, consider this one.  (VGT is very similar). \n\nSOXX is a fund that invests in semiconductor technology. One thing I like about this fund is that there will not be a lot of crossover between this one and your broad market fund.  Top holdings include: QCOM (9.5%), NVDA (9.5%), AVGO (8.3%), TXN (8%), INTC (5%). \n\nWCLD:  Cloud computing is a great sector, but be aware that many of these companies will also be in QQQ.  Top holdings include ZM (2.4%), CRM (2.3%), PLAN (2.2%), CRWD (2.1%), WDAY (2.1%). One thing I like about this ETF is that the investments are much more spread out than most ETFs. So, if any one company in the ETF is affected by bad news, it should have little impact on the ETF as a whole. I think WCLD is an excellent choice. \n\nClean Energy ETF:  I like ICLN like many others on this site.  I think the clean/renewable energy sector is really going to blossom over the next 10 years and I think ICLN is one of the better ETFs in the sector. Others you may want to look into include:  PBW, QCLN and TAN.",

        "body": "My main concern is mostly that he doesn't follow the stock market much and has a bunch of random stocks. It wasn't anything he picked, was inherited. He's had it for over a year and thought it was doing great. I looked at it and almost everything is down 15% and Apple is up 100%. So for a year all he was looking at was how his portfolio was doing overall. Once Apple started going down the portfolio was going down much harder than the market last two weeks so I looked at it. Then I noticed close to 20% Altria in it and 30% Apple. Then it's about 7-10% each of Qualcomm, JPM, and PM, AEP, and Verizon Then a few more at like 1%-5%. Portfolio is all over the place and it just makes me nervous if he's not going to be hands on with individual stocks. Also in a taxable account Altria and some of the other higher dividend stocks are going to be taxed. Over 7 or so years that's going to add up. Especially if the stock isn't moving or is going down steadily. \n\nFor now what he's going to do is stick with the portfolio but I mentioned to him to keep on top of these stocks. I think that as the dividends get reinvested that'll lower his cost basis and also if the stock itself goes up that'll lower his loss on it. Once some of the stocks are closet to break even he can look to get out of them for ETFs. I gave him a few to look into and see the top 10 holdings. I think he would be better off in the long run with stuff like VYM and SCHD along with building his current ETF positions. It would be different if these were hand-picked stocks but he inherited it and then all he did for a year was look at Apple going on an all time high.",

I believe in the company but people have been burned in the past so they are hesitant to invest in it. They are still restructuring and their products cost more than the other players; however, that should change in 6 or 9 months. Their data center seems promising too and I believe Apple is a customer.  To be honest, it's probably dead money for awhile and it's going to be in this $4 to $5 range. I wouldn't be surprised if it dips under $4.  Maybe pick up 250 shares and sell when it goes up a quarter and wait for pullbacks or hold on for the long term in case they get acquired. Other than that, you are better off with Marvell Technologies, Apple, Qrvo, Qualcomm for a 5G play. Even if you get less shares for $1000, the likelihood of the stock moving up is much greater. Also, if they pay dividends (Apple pays divs but not sure of the others), just reinvest the dividends and you will have more shares in the future. I've been burned by a lot of these cheap stocks that they are almost not worth investing in because they just don't move much.  You can consider having a portfolio of 6 of these under $7 stocks but don't put more than $3k. If one of them pans out, great. Not all will be winners.  \n\nYou may want to consider Ark Invest ETFs as I have a couple of them (ARKK and ARKF). The returns have been tremendous and Cathy (CEO) invests in disruptive companies. Vanguard funds are good too and I am considering getting one of the cloud ETFs and information technology ETFs when the market pulls back again as valuations are still too high. I may also look at the IPO ETF and getting some Snowflake (SNOW) shares for the long term. Good luck and I agree to not day trade with your IRA and take profits when the stocks/ETFs climb as you can buy them back again. Try to sell option calls if you have 100 shares for some additional passive income.",

Since the my first short ULTA made me 12% in 8 days which I covered at 187. Shorting FFIV i have made me 9.2% so far. Shorting BDX has made me 8.6% in just over a week. I have recently opened more short position. I also went long on aapl and tsla and made 17.5% in just over a week. I closed those position first thing on Tuesday because it was same as CSCO March 2000 and QCOM dec 1999.\n\nAnyways this is also my last post in Reddit because I believe you guys already know a lot about stocks. So I am not going to disturb you with your endeavor. Best of luck and may God always guide you in your endeavors",

The minor pullback today didn't phase atvi and it feels almost impervious* (I know it's not). It is at ATH levels so that is a risk, but it's fundamentals make it not crazy overvalued going into its best holiday season. Santa comes recession or not.

(NYSE American: ZOM) announced today that it has agreed with its development partner Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Qorvo US, Inc., to develop three new assays -- Cobalamin, cPL (canine Pancreatic Lipase), and Folate -- to target diagnosis of canine gastrointestinal issues. The new assays are in addition to the initial five assays currently under development, including panels for adrenal and thyroid testing, for TRUFORMA\u2122, Zomedica's point-of-care veterinary diagnostic platform. The agreement to pursue development of the new assays has triggered the final $2 million milestone payment under Zomedica\u2019s Development and Supply Agreement with Qorvo.\n\n\u201cOur intent for TRUFORMA\u2122 always has been to have it serve as a broad diagnostic point-of-care tool for dogs and cats and to continue to expand the diagnostic offerings available on the platform,\" said Robert Cohen, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Zomedica. \"We believe that the combination of the Cobalamin, cPL and Folate assays will enable veterinarians to use TRUFORMA to conduct a thorough testing panel to diagnose dogs in gastrointestinal distress.\"\n\nIf successfully developed, the Cobalamin, cPL, and Folate assays will represent what the Company believes is the first non-infectious gastrointestinal panel optimized for use in canines fully available at the point-of-care to facilitate rapid diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders. Evaluation of the health of different components of the gastrointestinal system is necessary to identify the cause of clinical symptoms. This panel is intended to assay the function of the pancreas, proximal small intestine, and distal small intestine. The Company believes that the ability to conduct testing at the point-of-care will facilitate real-time clinical decision-making, reduce in-patient clinic stay, promote earlier detection and treatment, and increase pet owner satisfaction.\n\nAccording to a DVM360 study*, ASPCA Pet Insurance, Embrace, Nationwide, Pets Best and Trupanion agree that \u201cGI condition\u201d is the most common insurance claim for dogs. Signs of digestive system disease can include excessive drooling, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting or regurgitation, loss of appetite, bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating, straining to defecate, shock, and dehydration. The TRUFORMA diagnostic device, which is smaller than a desktop printer, is anticipated to provide highly sensitive, species-specific assays using Qorvo\u2019s proprietary, non-optical Bulk Acoustic Wave (\"BAW\") sensor technology. The BAW sensor is a proven semiconductor technology used in telecommunications and aerospace markets. The Company believes that BAW technology has the potential to improve veterinary diagnostics by delivering reference laboratory accuracy and test performance to the veterinary clinic at the point-of-care.\"\n\nI bolded the important parts. This is a long hold regardless if r/s happens or does not. IMO the r/s ain't happening.",

Only NVDA and broadcom saw a slight bump. \n\nHardware like $QRVO, $QCOM, $INTC, $AMD, $SWKS, $WDC, $MU, $TSM has some ground to make up. The sector rotation cant go to airlines or financials, so Semis and Retail it is",
