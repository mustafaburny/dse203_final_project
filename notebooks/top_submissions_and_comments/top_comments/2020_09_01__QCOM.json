AMD, Apple, Qualcomm are all using TSMC fab and are all moving between 7nm EUV and 5nm EUV nodes.\n\nOP should be buying TSMC (or ASML) if it's the process that they are impressed by because they are the ones that produced it, Apple is just a customer.\n\nEdit: Also it's not the chip that's 5nm it's just the name of the fab process and is roughly indicative of the transistor size. Really the properties that matter for a chip (outside of just how good the design is) are the chip area (in mm^2), transistor count (which is a function of transistor size) and yield (which is a function of size &amp; process)",

To date, ARM says 180 billion chips have been made based on its solutions.\n\nThere is certainly a good chance the UK will impose restrictions on the deal which might make it impossible for Nvidia to complete the sale, like requiring they continue to provide chips to the Chinese companies that they already deal with.",

        "body": "I was invested in QCOM in 1998 and many tech stocks during the 1st DOT-COM bubble.  SEBL, NTAP, CREE...all good companie. CREE, NTAP and QCOM still exist and are doing very well.  SEBL was bought by oracl maybe 7 to 10 years ago.\n\nBut companies can do very well and still lose 90% of their stock value.  Every one of those stocks, and in fact the entire NASDAQ lost 90% of its value from its peak in the 2000 NASDAQ bubble.  Some of those companies have not seen their 2000 bubble stock prices despite running perfectly good companies and experiencing 2 more 'tech bubbles' in the preceding 20 years.\n\nNTAP has reached about half its 2000 stock price in the preceding 20 years, CREE about the same it looks like.  QCOM has done the best-- it just recently exceeded its 2000 all time high, but it took 20 years to do so, meaning if you bought the stock any time near its bubble peak and held through the crash thinking it would someday return a value, you would have been right.  After 20 years of holding,  in the last couple months you would have finally seen a small return, a much worse return than holding treasuries bonds, but not a loss I guess.\n\nThe point is valuation does matter, and a business can be a good business and run perfectly fine and in a great environment for what it sells, but if you buy at an extreme premium you may not see a return on your money, even after holding for 20 years and that company performing its business well .\n\nTSLA may very well be a great company, but it seems like it is priced like as if its going to be the only car company in the world with high margins to boot.  It feels very much like QCOM to me- in fact QCOM split 4-1 after a relentless run up and then immediately began to tank, bringing the market down with it shortly after.\n\nQCOM had a patent on a tremendous and pioneering technology that other companies had to pay (and still do) royalties on, this was challenged and won in many court battles.  A technology that would go in billions of phones eventually and was/is a very well run business.\n\n  I don't even know if the same could be said for TSLA honestly, they may be well run, but they don't have a patent that they can force other companies to use or pay on..but in any case, that's beside the point.  The point is that valuations really do matter.  The average investor in 2000 because people were so heavily weighted in technology lost 85% of their portfolio value.  That takes a long time to recover from.  You have to make 100% gain if you lose 50% of your money, then suddenly you realize you are almost 50 years old....don't waste time, it feels like you have forever, but it goes fast, I promise.",

So I am not sure if there is a difference that is not shown, but for example looking at QCOM you can see a couple of rows being repeated a bunch of times.\n\nAlso, the format is too simple. I understand the focus on simplicity, but in this case it makes it difficult to actually understand it or make any sort of conclusions. I suggest that if you want to keep the default view then add a control that expands the table and shows additional columns, such as strike, expiration, amount spent, volume, open interest, price of the stock at the time and make the table sortable by columns. Export to Excel and prior dates data is very much nice to have, but at the very least the features I mentioned above are a necessity for the screen to be usable.",

The premiums of sensible calls finally got lowered after 3 days of selloff, which may continue all week. \n\nIt really feels like the stock wants to be 130 now, and investors want in before that. I (obviously) have no idea of the timeframe for when it will gap upwards of that but I'd say either by elections or, should trump not bother furthering any 5g dev, in late winter/by early spring - that's my projection the first 5G US govt contracts start showing up (which secondarily [majorly] affect QCOM). With any luck, qualcomm's worth and sooner to realize future profitability than other chip makers catering to the auto (NVDA) and 5g marketplace. Obviously QCOM isn't a new kid on the block nor is it an all in one. US(/China spyware free [western]) doesn't have a huawei (nor eligible equivalent) so will have to contract multiple avenues of suppliers to fulfill its 5G desires*. QCOM owns the IPs to so much that virtually everyone will have to pay QCOM at one point, regardless of whether or not they even use their chips (look no further than apples failed attempt to fight them in court).\n\nThis company is arguably integral to the foreseeable future of tech in america. I want to be well positioned before that's undeniable. imo they downplayed their outlook. \n\nThe timing of the tech selloff and 'doubt' and caution surrounding ATH'ers makes this look like a nice entry but im absolutely not qualified to say any of this as advice and no reason to doubt it wont get yanked down with further tech selloff. Win win \n\nI still think OP's calls will print but not my approach to getting in bed with them.",

I know he's not going to sell any Apple, it's hard to try to get him to and I wouldn't really advise it. Just wouldn't have 30% Apple to begin with. This is far from a set and forget portfolio right now. I looked and technology and communications is 48% or so of his portfolio. Thanks for actually giving input. Most of the people in here are just belittling and thinking I'm trying to ruin his portfolio. Assuming he spent 30 years to build this. It's literally something he has had for over a year and is just realizing last 2 weeks that something is wrong. Before September he was talking about the portfolio doubling in the next 5 years. His dividend yield is around 3% right now I believe. \n\nHe's going to most likely hold until some of these get closer to even but that was my justification for MO and QCOM. Gets his large exposure out of MO, reduces tax drawdown, and also gets him a little bit out of technology while getting more diversified. SCHD has 5% QCOM so he would still get exposure. I'm 30 years from retirement and am almost entirely in ETFs because I don't feel like following stocks. All I do is DCA into ETFs as I go along. Don't really sweat about anything. So far the ETF portion of his portfolio has done twice as well as his individual stocks on green days and half as poorly on red days.",

Its a fast growing sector and every kid i know is gaming and these esport players are kinda stars for them. Gaming is taking over board games i can actually think of a future where parents play with their kids computer games or console games regulary instead of playing board games or going out thats why i kinda believe in this but if i was you i would probably suggest the same.\n\nDamn thank you for those stocks i will look into them and probably if the balance sheets and company visions are fitting i should atleast change teradyne with manz ag and just add costco next to walmart.\nI dont really like tesla it feels like there is to much unlreastic expection from the community but it actually would fit really great into my plan.\n\nYes a lot of doubles except from qualcomm i put every double company with a double in my plan. Qualcomm seems to me a little bit overvalued\n\nMan thanks again for your reply it made me happy to see someone actually care enough and grest suggestions!",
