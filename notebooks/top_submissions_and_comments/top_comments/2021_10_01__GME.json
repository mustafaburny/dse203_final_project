        "body": "This last year has been a wild ride.\n\nI was a Bogle Head for 10 years only investing in a Roth IRA into the S&amp;P 500 Index fund. I also built up over almost $100K in cash savings for a house down payment, but the housing market continued to out-price my purchasing power (Fuck you California). I saw annual inflation eating away at my savings and decided I wanted to do more active investing. I opened a Fidelity brokerage account and slowly started legging in capital. One of the first plays I made was a $5K loss on GME and Nokia (Yes, I lost money on GME) after losing money on the hype and selling at the bottom I decided to do some deep diving into value plays. I stumbled across $CLF as one of my first very high conviction plays when it was at $14 and also bought shares in $AA when it was $25. Boy oh boy do I just wish I simply held those shares.\n\nA tale as old as time - I learned about options and my account balance quickly became as volatile as $DWAC. Take a look at that Fidelity chart. By the time June rolled around I had allocated almost all of my cash into my Fidelity account and at my highest point, I had made roughly 50% total account gains and maxed out at $156K, primarily due to $NUE and $CLF calls.\n\nIn mid-June, steel stocks got shit on (and I'm talking forceful Taco Bell style projectile shitting) and I had OTM calls that were absolutely murdered. I was a paper handed bitch and sold for 80% losses and watched steel rise from the ashes a couple weeks after I sold. Something switched in my head after those heavy losses that made me want to chase. Classic newbie dumbass move right? Anyway, I decide to go FUCKING HARD IN THE PAINT on short dated $QQQ puts. At one point intraday I had massive gains on those drops on 7/14/2021 through 7/19/2021. The problem was I held and sold almost at the complete worst times. Also, once the market reversed, I held onto my puts like a dumbass and my account was crushed to almost nothing.\n\nDepression and anxiety ensue, but I am fortunate enough to not have other people depending on me,  I don't have kids, I have a good job, and as much as it sucked asshole I could get by on beans and cans of tuna for a while.  I am lucky to have an amazing support network of internet friends who helped lift me up and believed that I could make my money back.  Also, like Naruto says, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the hand that fate\u2019s dealt you with, fight for a new one.\u201d\n\nA month or so later I try for the big dick comeback.  I started trading with $200 somewhere around 9/7/2021, but like the degenerate I am, I kept my rent money in Robinhood just in case I wanted to blow up my life even further.... So my 3 month chart doesn't show my true total gains and I'm not going to post it here because it will just be confusing.\n\nSo for all intents and purposes with the limited screenshot documentation I took along the way, I have documented confirmation that I went from $7.7K on 9/9/2021 to $67K on 9/16/2021 to a peak of $141K on 9/20/2021 and EOD balance of $110K on 9/20/2021 all in 11 calendar days!!! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK, RIGHT?\n\nSPAC-sanity was back in business and I was lucky enough to catch massive gains on $IRNT calls on 9/7/2021. I took the $IRNT gains and snowballed into consistent 30%-100% day gains on other SPAC plays including $OPAD. On 9/14/2021 I threw cash into $SPRT puts right before they merged wit $GREE and on 9/15/2021 I realized my single highest percentage gain (50,000%). I made so much money on this play that I panic sold thinking I was doing something wrong or breaking the law (I wasn't). I also made about an average of 200% total gains off of $HSBC and $DB puts, alongside $YANG calls and $YINN puts that I held from 9/17/2021 through 9/20/2021 on the initial Evergrande fear. Mixed in between these plays I made several 50%-200% gains on more $QQQ/$SPY puts mixed in with other SPAC calls.\n\nWell, as most of you could have guessed, after I made it to $100K again, I slowly bled my account balance back down to $500 making trades with poor judgement. I am sitting here writing this up to share some very expensive lessons. As much fun as it was to win this big in such a short period of time, I was bound to lose it with the extremely risky way I was trading near the end. Don't be a Treabeard. Protect your capital. Take a break after you see massive gains. There will ALWAYS be more plays. Never feel rushed to go into another. Take a step back and enjoy life for a minute. Easier said than done, I know.\n\nI will be back in some time. I plan to do a better job documenting my trading journey starting with $500 this time. This time is different ;) ..... Right? .... \\*please\\*\n\n\\-Trea",

If you think about it, its actually a smart move for Citadel, why play tug-o-war against the GME and AMC crowd when you can make $ attacking the Tilray people. I think you nailed it when you said that Tilray's the biggest target in the space since its very liquid on a real exchange with high retail ownership. Despite what people are saying about legalization getting push back or \"it won't happen\" the truth is everything is up in the air right now. The fact is that (despite speculation) the democrats have not done anything yet to stop the advance of the legalization bills advancing through congress and thats a very good sign. And as per Schumer in his interview just a few days ago, he said that \"they have made great progress\" on getting the other senators on board so there are a few catalysts coming up and those are great opportunities to attack Citadel &amp; friends.",
