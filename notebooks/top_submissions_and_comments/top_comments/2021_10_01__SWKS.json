We are not in any economic crisis now, but at the pits of the 2008 crash I had 250 K cash and asked myself the same question. I bought AAPL and though I was broke at the time (the 250 K was a loan) now I have 9.5 million dollars, about 7 of it due to AAPL.  So you might say, Apple has already run up. True, but not so much. AAPL's current PE is only 26, 12 points less than the inferior and slower growing MSFT.  Then you can ask, which companies make money off Apple, 5G connections, streaming, etc which are low priced and pay high dividends?  Nice to have income after all.  Well my picks are all very undervalued and are T, VIAC, VZ and SWKS.  So I would buy 100 K of AAPL and 50 K of the other four.  for that you get large upsides, limited downsides, and an income of about $9000 per year.",

        "body": "Possibly Very Bullish Sectors for the Next 3-12 Months Amid Troubled Times. The examples below are certainly not buy recommendations. Just examples.\n\nBelow is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\nAnyway enjoy the dips now because these are likely to get beefed up as the supply chain &amp; worker shortages unwind\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",
