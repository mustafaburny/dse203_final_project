I have a feeling the price won\u2019t go up to my target price and I\u2019m worried I might have made a bad play, I don\u2019t have a strategy yet, I\u2019m still new to Options, My expectations were to start trading to build my retirement account and profit but I know every trader has to experience losses at one point or another. I\u2019m not to worried about loosing, I\u2019m worried I might not learn from my mistakes. \nAny guidance or advice is greatly appreciated\nThe current price for that NLOK call is at $0.16",

        "body": "I understand what you\u2019re saying, I do feel that NLOK should\u2019ve been at the $22 mark by now. Given the amount of time I have left in the contract I have faith that it will climb again before Oct 16 but it won\u2019t give me the necessary gain that I need in order to break even, which is why I was considering the double down in order to save my investment, Now I know this is a speculative on my part. I tried selling the other day at my risk tolerance which was 50% but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to sell. I\u2019m scared of the risk but I\u2019m even more scared of selling and FOMO.\nThe visuals that you shared are amazing, I\u2019ll be using that in the near future.\nAs for scaling into another position, I\u2019ve made a play into BMY for Nov 20 $65 Call. But I don\u2019t want to scale into anything else because the amount of buying power I have left is enough to double down on NLOK. Tough decisions lol",

        "body": "the way I would approach it is, do you think NLOK will move at least 9% between now and expiration? That is about how much it has to move for you to reach breakeven $22.36 ($22 + $0.36). Ideally, you want it to rally way above/close before exp.\n\ncheck out this visual [http://opcalc.com/fcy](http://opcalc.com/fcy) Your trade will lose value to theta every day.\n\nIf you think this is a losing trade, doubling down would just add to your losses.\n\n\\`also, maybe not applicable to this trade, but instead of doubling down, you can look into scaling into a position\n\nfor example, I have been playing around with leap diagonals and I have a set amount I am willing to allot to it. I might put a couple on, if it moves in my favor, great. If not, I can average down as long as my assumption on the trade has not changed.",
