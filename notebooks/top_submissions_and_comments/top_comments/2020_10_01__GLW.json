I sold some and bough marvel comics which was around a 1 dollar a share after the release of the first x-men movie but they were risky due to flirting with bankruptcy yet again.

        "body": "Not even close to what I was saying. I had suspected it was going to form a cup and handle on Thursday. Which is why I anticipated a drop today, which forms the handle. If I had bought at the bottom of the cup, there was no way of knowing whether it was forming a cup or about to trade flat or drop. Right now is the best time to buy in since there\u2019s a stronger probability of it completing the formation. Once it pushes through the resistance, it will go up by the difference between the resistance (~$13.80 for GME) and the bottom of the cup (~$11.80), which is $2. So anticipate GME reaching at least $15.80 this week. Just look at the cup and handle formed by GLW between July 28th and August 12th. \n\nRight now is when you buy, it\u2019s definitely not too late.",
