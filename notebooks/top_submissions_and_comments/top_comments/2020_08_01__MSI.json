Apple is very dependent on hardware for example. What if iPhones fall out of trend for another kind of smart phone? You may think this is impossible but Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry were all in this position at one time where they were the king of cell phones. \n\nGenerally, you should mix it up. If you think tech is a great investment, then put a good chunk in that but you should also hold a few other industries because these things cycle in performance.",

        "body": "In a semiconductor no one ever cares about the firmware or software. It\u2019s not central to the bottom line. It\u2019s usually considered \u201cfluff\u201d. \n\nHowever if you talk to customers you\u2019ll usually find two defining factors for what they choose to build they products with: past experience and ease of use. The first comes from positive experiences and investing in universities (you ever wonder what TI puts a Delphino DSP in every EE classroom? That\u2019s why.). The other is expensive. It requires building consistent, quality HALs and tools to complement those. \n\nFeeescale was actually the leader in that. They were Metrowerks (the semiconductor arm of Motorola) and created CodeWarrior. The only IDE to ever come close to the usage and utility of Visual Studio. That came to an end when the RF and other hardware engineers started to take over. The firmware and software engineers played second fiddle and the VPs viewed it as a luxury. Lisa Su did not. She took an active approach in pushing for advanced software that made making applications on Freescale chips easier. \n\nThat is largely considered the reason the I.MX chips took off in the automotive field as well as the networking area. It\u2019s a classic case of saying \u201cfuck the MBAs\u201d.",

        "body": "I've been studying this. I think I've figured it out -- at least for the people I know who are invested in TSLA. (I am not, if that matters.) \n\nBefore the iPhone, everyone had a Nokia, Motorola or Blackberry phone. No one has those anymore. MSFT tried to come out with a phone and failed. Android is the only real competition anymore, and AAPL and GOOG are both trillion dollar companies. \n\nTSLA is only worth 350 billion. It's cheap!  A lot of people see a six-bagger potential when comparing TSLA to AAPL. \n\n\"A Tesla is a computer on wheels\" I've heard said. \"It's a disruptor.\" \n\n In their minds, Toyota, VW and Chevy are like Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry. No one else matters. The future is all TSLA, just like the future of phones (in 2008) was AAPL. \n\nBut cars aren't phones. You'll never see only two brands of cars on the road. The solar panel business isn't new either. We've all seen the \"SOLAR IS COMING!\" hype and a lot of us have lost money on it. Don't get me wrong, solar is definitely worth doing and has a great future, but that doesn't mean it's a good stock play. \n\nIs TSLA more like Amazon? Remember, AMZN doesn't make much money off the retail business. Their big profit center is AWS. Maybe TSLA will license their self-driving tech and all the data from their telemetry system. I don't know. But with so few Teslas on the road compared to Ford Trucks alone (In 2019 Ford sold three F-series pickups for every Tesla sold), I don't see how they can keep that advantage for long either.  The tech is pretty much off-the-shelf. Someone could duplicate it pretty easily. \n\nBased on the exuberance of so many people, and the unfortunate comparison to AAPL and AMZN, I think TSLA will probably go to $5000 ($1000 split adjusted) before it will crash. But it will definitely crash, and crash hard. I have no doubt.",

Today apple is a $2T valuation. Nokia and Blackberry are still around, barely. \n\nI thought Barnes and Noble, later Wal-Mart would jump in and throttle Amazon. Nope. Amazon's main income isn't from its retail sales, but from AWS. Again, I thought MS or IBM or SOMEONE in the OS/networking industry would eat their lunch on cloud services. Nope. \n\nAnyone remember Flooz? The SAP/(and some other big names) attempt to unseat PayPal?\n\nOld industries like Ford, GM, VW, Toyota, etc. are too big and have too much momentum to be nimble or \"cool.\" And I think the \"cool\" factor is a lot more important than it should be. \n\nHaving said that, we'd still need 1/3 of all new vehicles on the road to contain some kind of royalty-paying Tesla tech installed. Starlink? Not likely, you say? How long did it take for Zoom to replace Skype and Facetime as the dominant media? \n\nDon't get me wrong, I DO NOT think TSLA is a good investment. I think the odds of a collapse in the stock price are more likely than not, but not by much. The stakes are too great in this gamble, and the reward is too far off in the haze of an unknown future.",

        "body": "If you ever figure out how to do that successfully let me know where you learned how to do this. I've tried buying options, but I always seem to fail because of the short timeline. The event horizon for options is usually months, so you're betting on some sort of short term trend based on news or events. It's like betting on the weather.\n\nYou can use options as insurance against a loss when a stock you are up in plummets, but again it comes to timing. AMZN has been overvalued for over 20 years now. When cometh the fall? Who TF knows, but longer trends, like Sears, JC Penny, Walmart and all the mom and pop brick-n-mortar stores were market capital for AMZN to consume. And like Apple, when I'd look at the iPhone in its early days and look at market caps for Motorola, Nokia, etc as growth food. And Apple sucked them dry and left behind husks. \n\nOptions seem to me about as bad as day trading. The sharks with their millisecond connections to the floor with automated trading algorithms make it impossible for the little guy with an online broker to do much of anything except provide the chum. This is why a lot in these kinds of threads advise not to trade very often. The long game is your friend. I've almost always lost trying to time the market.\n\nI'm sure there are some people out there that can spin options and day trading into gold, but back to my original point in this thread: if you have it, use your special knowledge to identify companies that have an edge.\n\nAnd seriously, what is going on now is insane. A market propped up by cheap liquidity is not an economy, where for months now 1/3 of renters and mortgage holders couldn't pay. I might be a fool to still be long in this period of delusional exuberance before the reckoning, but do you really want to be holding dollars? It's going to really suck when the bottom falls out deeper than Y2K and 2008. Those were character building events. Same as it ever was. Cheers.",

This is absolutely awesome and with those tools anyone can achieve their desired wealth and dreams. My opinion anyway.\n\nThe problem with that is it's completely unrealistic.

They're going through rapid, rapid expansion right now, and the potential for them from pivots is very real.\n\n\\- Their battery tech is way ahead. Right now they're supply constrained, but ramping up quickly. I would fully expect them to make an almost 1:1 switch from revenue from green credits to being a battery *supplier* as other car manufacturers get into EVs.\n\n\\- They already operate the largest public charging network in the world. This actually *benefits* them as other manufacturers move into EV.\n\n\\- They also benefit from [the Starbucks effect](https://aipcommercialrealestate.com/the-starbucks-effect) as other companies move into the EV market and drive EV acceptance.\n\n\\- They're making a heavy, heavy bet on autonomous driving. Right now, I put them behind Waymo, but ahead of most other players in the market. And they're absolutely 100% ahead when it comes to eventually building fleet-scale autonomous, and financially way, way ahead as they pursue doing it with lease returns. (Waymo will get to an autonomous fleet quicker, but Tesla will do it cheaper.)\n\nAll of this means you can't evaluate Tesla as if it's an automaker running in the red. It's an automaker, *plus* a battery supplier, *plus* a fueling station operator, *plus* a potential rideshare operator. Plus like five other things.\n\nMeanwhile, car revenue for them is constrained from the supply side, not the demand side. They have **four** factories under construction at this very moment\u2014 Nevada, Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin \u2014 with yet another one on the way. \n\nAnd those green credits? Cadillac isn't even coming out with the Lyriq until 2022. Volkswagen is having production issues and hasn't delivered a single ID3 yet, despite promising 100,000 this year. That's how far behind everyone else is.\n\nYes, everything you've said is completely valid. But it's an incomplete picture.\n\nThat said, are they still overvalued? Yes, absolutely.",

The CCP doesn't specifically target any American companies.\n\n&gt;We should reciprocate.\n\nShould we copy their Great Firewall as well and ban any apps that doesn't allow government backdoor for data access?

What's next, banning CNN and MSNBC because the FBI \"uncovered\" some connection between the networks and some foreign government?\n\nFurthermore speaking from personal experience, WeChat is used by millions of Chinese Americans as a chat app, very often with friends/relatives back in China. It's very similar to Line and WhatsApp in that regard.

        "body": "I'm only a few months into my stock market journey and i'm going to spill a little secret cause i want other newbies to do well also. \n\nIf you use Webull and you wake up early.. 4am EST. I usually wake up about 2:30am.\n\nThere is a section called Top Gainers. You can choose categories such as Pre Market, After hours, 5 Minutes, 1 Day, 5 Days, 1 Month, 3 Months, 52 Weeks.\n\nWhen i wake up i go through the Pre Market and 1 Day category. The 1 Day lets you know what was running the day before and the Pre Market will let you know whats starting to run that day after WB hours start up. If i see the same stock on the 1 day and the PM slots i write it down and pull up the chart on WB. You can choose to include PM and After hours on the charts. The same stock on the 1 day and the PM chart is a strong indicator that this stock still has some gas in it. Sometimes just the top 3-4 on the PM movers are good targets to follow.\n\nI'll pick 2-4 of the stocks that i like for the day and in the first 5-10 minutes after WB opens you can see which ones are starting to run. If i feel good about i will buy about 5 of it and watch it for a few more minutes to see if it keeps climbing while i watch the charts. \n\nIf it keeps trending up ill buy more and then set a stop loss about 7% below my entry. If it bombs out right away i walk away. You have to learn to let it go if it drops. If it keeps climbing i adjust my stop loss along with it.\n\nThis strategy has served me pretty well so far. I know that the motto is \"dont chase.\" and while i normally agree with it the condition of the market right now is that we have multiple +50% daily runners so getting a piece of that action is totally doable. You dont need to catch the entire ride up but you can easily 10-20% of a run. A few months from now it wont be the same... but for now the getting is good so why not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this information helps some people out. I started out with 3k back in June and have more than tripled that. I know its not lambo money but hey im still new and learning haha",

Personally, I'm *extremely* doubtful this is going to happen, the least reason being that I've met Ford several times and who did he remind me of? Paul Jacobs and XCOM. Long story short, few years ago Jacobs came up with a harebrained idea to take QCOM private. He was basically laughed out and ejected from his chairman spot. \n\nThis is the *exact* same setup - family scion thinks he can pull off the heist of the decade while actual investors laugh their asses off.\n\ntl;dr F $4P Jan 2021",

There could potentially be a lot more runup if/when it goes pop.\n\nAlso, I was in the market back then...there was A TON of warning from the FED. They seriously gave like a 2 month lead to the intrest rate hike...so its not like everyone just woke up on Monday and blew their coffee into the morning newspaper.\n\nWas there FOMO? Hell yes, and a ton of denial. But people who were playing the market did fine...the guys that lost there asses were the dudes that YOLO'd their live savings into Pets.com and then took out a third mortgage on their house to get a little QCOM on the side.\n\nAs long as you aren't doing something like that right now I honestly wouldn't sweat it yet, theres zero indication that anything is going to turn the market. FAAMG just smashed earning in a quarter where the entire globe was shut down. Microsoft is trying to buy TikTok, Facebook just partnered with SHOP, SHOP just partnered with Walmart, Google just bought a stake in ADT, Amazon probably absorbed 15 more companies on the downlow between breakfast and lunch.

Investing in it 5 years ago, or even 10 years ago, in a set and forget style strategy would have yielded very middling returns.\n\nBut if you look at the recent spread, it had a golden cross on June 25, which is not too long ago.

Intel has had virtually unlimited supply of money to invest if they wanted to. But they didn't, because improving the next quarter's bottom line took priority over long term development into new markets.\n\nAtom is a perfect example : it failed first because Intel sold their ARM division (they thought it was not profitable enough - first big mistake), and then they made an half-assed effort by scaling down their x86 stuff which was cheaper than getting back into ARM (again being too obsessed with cost and margins rather than taking a long term view and putting in the work). To the surprise of nobody, it failed while Qualcomm thrived.\n\nBy comparison the FAANG invest in pretty much any emerging idea that shows up. Facebook acquires or imitates any new trend. Google puts money in a zillion different ideas (most end up killed, but at least they make sure they get their foot in the door if it goes big), etc. They know there will be new big hot markets and they don't want to be left out, and they are willing to lose the money on failed projects just to be sure they won't miss the boat on tomorrow's next big thing.

Like you said tech is becoming more and more a part of our daily lives so you can benefit as an investor from tech without investing directly in tech companies. \n\nRegarding your second point, it actually depends on how you measure largest holdings. You're right that they are outside the top ten in terms of dollar value but they aren't that far out. By your own measure tech companies take up around 50% of his portfolio.

You could argue that this is in some ways a better measure of which companies he believes in the most. By this measure both Sirius and VeriSign are in his top ten. So by both measures he puts a good amount of importance in tech companies.
