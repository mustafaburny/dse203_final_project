Apple is very dependent on hardware for example. What if iPhones fall out of trend for another kind of smart phone? You may think this is impossible but Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry were all in this position at one time where they were the king of cell phones. \n\nGenerally, you should mix it up. If you think tech is a great investment, then put a good chunk in that but you should also hold a few other industries because these things cycle in performance.",

        "body": "In a semiconductor no one ever cares about the firmware or software. It\u2019s not central to the bottom line. It\u2019s usually considered \u201cfluff\u201d. \n\nHowever if you talk to customers you\u2019ll usually find two defining factors for what they choose to build they products with: past experience and ease of use. The first comes from positive experiences and investing in universities (you ever wonder what TI puts a Delphino DSP in every EE classroom? That\u2019s why.). The other is expensive. It requires building consistent, quality HALs and tools to complement those. \n\nFeeescale was actually the leader in that. They were Metrowerks (the semiconductor arm of Motorola) and created CodeWarrior. The only IDE to ever come close to the usage and utility of Visual Studio. That came to an end when the RF and other hardware engineers started to take over. The firmware and software engineers played second fiddle and the VPs viewed it as a luxury. Lisa Su did not. She took an active approach in pushing for advanced software that made making applications on Freescale chips easier. \n\nThat is largely considered the reason the I.MX chips took off in the automotive field as well as the networking area. It\u2019s a classic case of saying \u201cfuck the MBAs\u201d.",

        "body": "I've been studying this. I think I've figured it out -- at least for the people I know who are invested in TSLA. (I am not, if that matters.) \n\nBefore the iPhone, everyone had a Nokia, Motorola or Blackberry phone. No one has those anymore. MSFT tried to come out with a phone and failed. Android is the only real competition anymore, and AAPL and GOOG are both trillion dollar companies. \n\nTSLA is only worth 350 billion. It's cheap!  A lot of people see a six-bagger potential when comparing TSLA to AAPL. \n\n\"A Tesla is a computer on wheels\" I've heard said. \"It's a disruptor.\" \n\n In their minds, Toyota, VW and Chevy are like Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry. No one else matters. The future is all TSLA, just like the future of phones (in 2008) was AAPL. \n\nBut cars aren't phones. You'll never see only two brands of cars on the road. The solar panel business isn't new either. We've all seen the \"SOLAR IS COMING!\" hype and a lot of us have lost money on it. Don't get me wrong, solar is definitely worth doing and has a great future, but that doesn't mean it's a good stock play. \n\nIs TSLA more like Amazon? Remember, AMZN doesn't make much money off the retail business. Their big profit center is AWS. Maybe TSLA will license their self-driving tech and all the data from their telemetry system. I don't know. But with so few Teslas on the road compared to Ford Trucks alone (In 2019 Ford sold three F-series pickups for every Tesla sold), I don't see how they can keep that advantage for long either.  The tech is pretty much off-the-shelf. Someone could duplicate it pretty easily. \n\nBased on the exuberance of so many people, and the unfortunate comparison to AAPL and AMZN, I think TSLA will probably go to $5000 ($1000 split adjusted) before it will crash. But it will definitely crash, and crash hard. I have no doubt.",

Today apple is a $2T valuation. Nokia and Blackberry are still around, barely. \n\nI thought Barnes and Noble, later Wal-Mart would jump in and throttle Amazon. Nope. Amazon's main income isn't from its retail sales, but from AWS. Again, I thought MS or IBM or SOMEONE in the OS/networking industry would eat their lunch on cloud services. Nope. \n\nAnyone remember Flooz? The SAP/(and some other big names) attempt to unseat PayPal?\n\nOld industries like Ford, GM, VW, Toyota, etc. are too big and have too much momentum to be nimble or \"cool.\" And I think the \"cool\" factor is a lot more important than it should be. \n\nHaving said that, we'd still need 1/3 of all new vehicles on the road to contain some kind of royalty-paying Tesla tech installed. Starlink? Not likely, you say? How long did it take for Zoom to replace Skype and Facetime as the dominant media? \n\nDon't get me wrong, I DO NOT think TSLA is a good investment. I think the odds of a collapse in the stock price are more likely than not, but not by much. The stakes are too great in this gamble, and the reward is too far off in the haze of an unknown future.",

        "body": "If you ever figure out how to do that successfully let me know where you learned how to do this. I've tried buying options, but I always seem to fail because of the short timeline. The event horizon for options is usually months, so you're betting on some sort of short term trend based on news or events. It's like betting on the weather.\n\nYou can use options as insurance against a loss when a stock you are up in plummets, but again it comes to timing. AMZN has been overvalued for over 20 years now. When cometh the fall? Who TF knows, but longer trends, like Sears, JC Penny, Walmart and all the mom and pop brick-n-mortar stores were market capital for AMZN to consume. And like Apple, when I'd look at the iPhone in its early days and look at market caps for Motorola, Nokia, etc as growth food. And Apple sucked them dry and left behind husks. \n\nOptions seem to me about as bad as day trading. The sharks with their millisecond connections to the floor with automated trading algorithms make it impossible for the little guy with an online broker to do much of anything except provide the chum. This is why a lot in these kinds of threads advise not to trade very often. The long game is your friend. I've almost always lost trying to time the market.\n\nI'm sure there are some people out there that can spin options and day trading into gold, but back to my original point in this thread: if you have it, use your special knowledge to identify companies that have an edge.\n\nAnd seriously, what is going on now is insane. A market propped up by cheap liquidity is not an economy, where for months now 1/3 of renters and mortgage holders couldn't pay. I might be a fool to still be long in this period of delusional exuberance before the reckoning, but do you really want to be holding dollars? It's going to really suck when the bottom falls out deeper than Y2K and 2008. Those were character building events. Same as it ever was. Cheers.",
