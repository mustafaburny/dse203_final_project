        "body": "You\u2019re definitely right about Starbucks. In Manhattan there is literally a Starbucks just around every other corner it feels like. I don\u2019t know enough about their business model honestly, but their stock is still very well in the very high territory that isn\u2019t worth touching imo. Starbucks doesn\u2019t make that much net income per stock (earnings per share), so it has ALOT of room to fall down. Also Starbucks still has competition with companies such as Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Keurig/K-cups, other cafes and other coffee sellers. I count things such as k-cups as competition since Starbucks only does coffee, no one goes there for the food. It\u2019s one thing if they were like Visa/MC where they had an entrenched oligopoly (arguably they do since Dunkin\u2019 is the only real competition). I do agree that they\u2019ll probably stomach the next recession since people are bad at money management and will keep buying Starbucks. \n\nI personally don\u2019t like touching companies that have unstable finances such as Tesla. It\u2019s the same as gambling, you\u2019re better off just going to the casino and putting all of your money on either black or red, at least you know your odds there and you\u2019ll have less time wasted holding the stock, hoping for it to go up. Tesla also as a short-squeeze issue with its stock price. It is the most shorted stock, so when they report good news and the stock price goes up - the shorters sell out  to take their losses. Causing the stock to prop up even higher due to less shorters. That\u2019s why Tesla\u2019s stock price has soared within this past month. \n\nSemi-conductors are probably the best industry as of right now. Computers aren\u2019t going away, and if anything there\u2019s higher demand for better processing power be it video games or managing large data. AMD, and Lam Research are pretty good companies in this field. There is a big susceptibility due to China having most of the mineral materials used in the chips. They also make a lot of the chips in China as well. So many sort of bad tensions with the Chinese leads to these stocks tanking.",
