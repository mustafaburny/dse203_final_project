It won\u2019t take much to send this back down to 35 and I\u2019m not going to get caught bag holding again. I\u2019m happy to keep trading it when it\u2019s going up but that it.\n\nThings are definitely frothy right now. I sold the rest of my LRCX yesterday and am going to sell AMD next week. \n\nMy plan is to just make short term plays until we get a pullback and hope to get some good deals.",
