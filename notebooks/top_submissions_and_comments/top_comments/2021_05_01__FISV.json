When it comes to being the piping behind it all, I'm not sure anybody is winning, nor that a bank will win out there.  Core technology/infrastructure providers are likely in a better position.  Fiserv/FIS/Visa/take your pick.\n\nSome smaller banks have really looking to be the backend for fintechs (CrossRiver, Sutton, Avida, Evolve, and so on) but larger ones were late to the party.  I also don't know how many players we really need in that space.  \n\nSo far I think nobody is leading in truth.  If Regulatory changes occur re: open banking (which they probably will) then the playing field gets leveled pretty quickly and you go back to the ones building tech as the favorites.  Jamie Dimon has taken it the most seriously for the longest when it comes to banks, I'll say that.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy $.02",

Similarly with TSLA and the EV boom.\n\nTesla could grow sales by 100% per year, but I don\u2019t think they improve margins as required.\n\nAlso, sentiment on Teslas all looking the same is brewing. At what point does that start dragging sales as competitors release unique cars? Of this happens then the 100% sales growth might not even happen.\n\nPriced to perfection means the investment will be dead money for a long time and people will start selling it.",
