(i can't believe i couldn't find any other ticker that had a range of 160-170). this is close to tesla's price/10.\n\nTheir earnings is tomorrow morning so the IV is high, and i expect TSLA's options tomorrow IV to still be high, not high as it is now but about as high as citrix's pre earnings so i think it's a good estimate.\n\nso go look at citrix's options and take ur strike divided by 10, and the value of that option/10 is about how much your option is worth tomorrow morning.\n\nthis is assuming tesla is in the 1660-1680 range.",

As a result they usually finish the end of the day in the green, albeit at a lower average. If I buy in too much I sell the excess on the pops as I did yesterday. I look for a solid company with outstanding earnings at a value price. One they hit bottom and trend upward I use my excess averaging down money to find others. And if any of these investments go bad, well, I don't mind bag-holding these companies. Sleep like a baby! Can usually pull 10% or more a month this way.",

Check to see your break even point and think about whether or not you think it will move by more than that.\n\nOverly simplistic example: \n\nIf the stock is $55 and your call is worth $10 at a strike price of 50$. If the stock goes up $2, you may get IV crushed. If the stock toes up over $10 then you would not get IV crushed and would make money. \n\nIV crush only happens when the stock moves less than it is expected to. This happened to Tesla over earnings. Something like $SAM obviously moved way more than expected and calls went up 5 to 20x their value in one day. It all depends on what you expect the stock to do. If you think that the market is pricing in a larger move than the stock will make, then sell your option. If you think the stock will move more than what the market is pricing in, hold the option.\n\nThere's also the risk that your stock could beat earnings and still go way down.

If you started 20 years ago, advice like MSFT would be like advice to buy Ford (20 years ago). 20 years ago it would have been better to buy MSFT, and not particularly risky either.\n\nHere's what you should do.\nNCNO IPOs tomorrow.\nSit at your computer or phone or whatever, and watch for this stock to start trading.\nPut all your money into it the minute it starts trading.\nNow you can either hold it for a couple years while it booms, or take an exit in the next day or two when it for a quick 20-30% or more.\n\nI own MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, PYPL, and many others that have produced 100-200% gains for me, but I bought them in 2016, not now.\n\nKeep putting your money into your account and buy 40% boring stable stocks like MSFT, but really now is kind of a questionable time to be buying stocks like NET or SHOP... these things have a LOT of room to cool off. More important than what you buy, is developing a strategy and learning to follow stocks.\n\nIf anything, I'd wait for the next dip (which I think will hit this week), and take some positions in stocks that haven't fully broken out yet, but have pretty solid long term growth in front of them (I'm looking at you AMD, EDIT, SNCR, RAMO, CRNC, ADPT).\n\nFor long, low-risk, my next investment will be FISV.\nMy most recent high-risk play was OSS bought last week... 30% up from there.",

While also participating in every single possible chargeable service in payment processing and using their extensive platform to cooperate with MasterCard and other card networks to create a unified payment processing ecosystem.\n\nFor Square, their big services are their merchant aquiring + gateway services and cash app(big Bitcoin volumes exchanged here), while also offering payroll and banking services.  Their value will be dependent on Cash app utilization, their ability to poach merchants from existing providers, and their ability to build new technologies while implementing existing ones into their suite of services. \n\nFiserv is another interesting mover, they are helping to allow for the acceptance of Ebt transaction online, a big deal for American grocery retail with the transition to online ordering. They also are now the acquiring bank for Aldi as of July 3 and this added over 2k locations to their customer base. \n\nAlibaba is popular to most because we all know the online store, but they also are a FinTech provider and have Ant financial/Alipay under their belt. And they heavily invest in new technologies. \n\nEven PayPal is still highly profitable with potential for further growth. Using app based tech like one touch, and the overall simplicity of their process is fantastic. But it is yet to be seen how negatively they will be impacted by the universal checkout standard the big 4 card networks are set to release.\n\n\nCheck out FINX for a FinTech ETF and compare it's performance by % to Spy. You will be impressed.",

Other then that do a lot of research. Read a lot. Dont buy and think your going to sell again any time soon. Ive only been actually investing for about 2 years. In that time I have only sold 1 position because I no longer liked the investment long term. Everything else i have bought with the intent to hold for 10+ years baring something extremely unforeseen. I buy a lot of blue chips and companies im somewhat familiar with as well. I work in tech so I own cisco, palo alto, fortinet, netapp because I work with there products a lot.

The analyst says there is now a \"meaningful disconnect\" between Akamai and other security and CDN stocks, despite its larger scale, higher profitability and \" still solid growth.\" He sees Akamai as an \"attractive way\" to play long-term trends like cloud security and edge computing.\n\nSynesael points out that the stock looks cheap relative to both security plays like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) and to other content- delivery networks, such as Cloudflare (NET), Fastly (FSLY), and Limelight Networks (LLNW). He argues that Covid-19 has served as a catalyst to Akamai's security and CDN businesses.\n\n\"We believe Covid-19 has resulted in increased demand for both its enterprise and internet security product offerings given the increase in the number of attacks across organizations and the internet,\" Synesael writes. \"We believe Akamai's security business is an underappreciated component of its long- term growth opportunity and that as it becomes a larger portion of total revenue more investors are likely to start valuing it on its [sum of the parts] which we believe will result in a significant re-rating of the stock.\"\n\nThe analyst notes that there have been investor concerns about the company losing market share to peers like Fastly, but asserts that \"the growth of competitors is more a function of an expanding opportunity for CDN providers rather than share stealing from Akamai.\"\n\nAkamai shares were up 7%, at $113.78, in recent trading, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9%. The stock is up about 32% year to date, which is impressive growth -- except when compared with Cloudflare, which has more than doubled, and Fastly, which has more than quadrupled",

Valor glass. Same Corning update suggested that this sales levels would materialize upon the product\u2019s \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d by the market. Reasonably likely that demand from clinical trials and production of Covid vaccine/treatments alone would be sufficient to satisfy the threshold for \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d if not more; not surprising per se, covid is merely a catalyst.

Valor glass. Same Corning update suggested that this sales levels would materialize upon the product\u2019s \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d by the market. Reasonably likely that demand from clinical trials and production of Covid vaccine/treatments alone would be sufficient to satisfy the threshold for \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d if not more; not surprising per se, covid is merely a catalyst.
