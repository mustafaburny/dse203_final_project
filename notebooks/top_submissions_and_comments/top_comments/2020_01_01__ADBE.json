Today, if you're a professional graphic designer, your only choice is to buy Photoshop and illustrator...except that, since there were no real competitors to turn to, Adobe successfully changed their business model to a monthly lease, rather than the ability to purchase and own their software. This means that most users now need to pay $50/mo - $600/yr - for the rest of their lives to have access to their files. Sure, there have been some small, third party apps that have been created to try to fill a niche - non-professionals on a budget - but there is no chance of any of those apps ever achieving industry adoption. Adobe bought their only true competitor, making their solutions the only possible purchase for industry/professionals, then changed the model so that you now had to lease forever what you had previously been able to buy once and own outright. In this climate, piracy flourishes.",

Adobe needs about 0.40/sh capital investment to generate about 5.50/sh in earnings. The reason their P/E ratios run high is because of the efficiency of their earnings.\n\nCompare that to Caterpillar, capital investments of 3.50/Sh to earn about 7-10/sh.\n\nOne company needs 1/10th earning power to grow the business and earn 20% roic and the other needs 1/3rd earning power to just maintain the business and generate 10% roic (not bad for their business but not as good as an asset light business like adobe).\n\nThat said, Adobe is probably a 120b company right now selling for 160b. A far cry from 8/2002 when it was worth about 44b selling for 10b growing the top line at a +10% clip. That discount to fair value is what drove to future high rates of return + savvy management in significantly growing the intrinsic value of the business. Good luck, forget PE and ignore adobe unless you think they can grow fcf to 12.5b annually from the current 3.8b. Enjoy.",

        "body": "If I gave the impression GIMP is as good, then that's my fault. My intention was to communicate that there are plenty of other options other than Photoshop now and most if not all of them do what Photoshop did before but more efficiently. (GIMP has come a LONG way.) Where Photoshop was the king and industry-standard across many design tasks, it's now relegated to only a few and those few are only still around because designers hate to learn new tools or they're working on legacy projects.\n\nI think the biggest takeaway is that Photoshop used to be THE tool for all things design: UI, illustration, photography, graphic design, textures, etc. etc.  It was THE toolbox and there were no alternatives. You might hop into Illustrator for a logo and then hop back, or Fireworks/Flash for an animation/prototype and then hop back, but everything touched Photoshop in some way shape or form. Especially for handoffs.\n\nThe UI design tasks are now dominated by Sketch, Figma, or Framer instead of Photoshop. It's not even a question anymore. Photoshop is bloated, slow, and horribly inefficient at these tasks where 10 years ago it was the industry standard. Adobe is pushing XD as a response but it feels too little too late. The killer features that Figma and Framer are leading the industry on are nowhere to be found in XD.\n\nThe illustration tasks are quickly being taken over by Procreate. Even simple animations are no longer occurring in Flash or After Effects. Procreate and similar apps that are designed from the ground up specifically for those tasks. I'm not saying Photoshop isn't still being used here, but it's no longer \"preferred\" and in most cases, it's slower and harder to accomplish these specific workflows in it.\n\nSpecial effects are still dominated by AE unless someone else in that industry can say otherwise?\n\nTL;DR: Adobe should no longer even remotely be considered a monopoly. They're losing market share in multiple arena's and are playing catch up due to their software being bloated and inefficient.",

        "body": "Thanks for the comment. Curious. What makes you say RDFN will be out of business?\nMy RDFN avg is $16 and is up pretty good from that point. I think it is better positioned in real estate market than other technology focussed companies like Zillow in the space. Its focus on tech and investments in expanding platform capabilities is amazing. IMO it is a slow but sure winner in real estate brokerage space.\nMy GWRE average is $79. GWRE is a monopoly in end to end cloud based solutions for large insurance companies. Insurance companies have just started investing in technology/ digital transformation for their processes and have a long way to go. GWRE is coupling its platform capabilities with AI/ML which allows for better CRM, risk management and pricing. I know few consultant friends who are making a killing in implementing this for their customers. The management is awesome as it is led by a former McKinsey partner who had worked in this space for 15 yrs or so.\nWill take your word and buy more ADBE :)",

I saw the Macromedia team coming up with unique solutions and rolling out constant updates to dodge the lawsuits. It was childish finger-pointing. Macromedia finally invented the modern slider/docked sidebar method that is popular today and the lawsuits stopped. Stock kept tanking, I started investing. Bounced back 2.5x once it blew over.

TRUL has captured most of the FL market, but that will dwindle as a percentage. They\u2019ll still see strong growth, but the competition will always find a way to undercut their market share. It\u2019s just basic market fundamentals.\n\nAs the cannaguy mentioned, 3/21 (14%) for CL and 2/21 (9.5%), of cultivation. That\u2019s about 24% and doesn\u2019t factor in retail establishments or newer small craft growers that could take over a huge % of the market.
