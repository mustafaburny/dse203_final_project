Adobe needs about 0.40/sh capital investment to generate about 5.50/sh in earnings. The reason their P/E ratios run high is because of the efficiency of their earnings.\n\nCompare that to Caterpillar, capital investments of 3.50/Sh to earn about 7-10/sh.\n\nOne company needs 1/10th earning power to grow the business and earn 20% roic and the other needs 1/3rd earning power to just maintain the business and generate 10% roic (not bad for their business but not as good as an asset light business like adobe).\n\nThat said, Adobe is probably a 120b company right now selling for 160b. A far cry from 8/2002 when it was worth about 44b selling for 10b growing the top line at a +10% clip. That discount to fair value is what drove to future high rates of return + savvy management in significantly growing the intrinsic value of the business. Good luck, forget PE and ignore adobe unless you think they can grow fcf to 12.5b annually from the current 3.8b. Enjoy.",

I think it is better positioned in real estate market than other technology focussed companies like Zillow in the space. Its focus on tech and investments in expanding platform capabilities is amazing. IMO it is a slow but sure winner in real estate brokerage space.\nMy GWRE average is $79. GWRE is a monopoly in end to end cloud based solutions for large insurance companies. Insurance companies have just started investing in technology/ digital transformation for their processes and have a long way to go. GWRE is coupling its platform capabilities with AI/ML which allows for better CRM, risk management and pricing. I know few consultant friends who are making a killing in implementing this for their customers. The management is awesome as it is led by a former McKinsey partner who had worked in this space for 15 yrs or so.\nWill take your word and buy more ADBE :)",
