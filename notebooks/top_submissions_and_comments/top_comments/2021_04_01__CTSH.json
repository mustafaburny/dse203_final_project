Splunk focuses mostly on IT operations, whereas Palantir built a software platform that can handle any type of data-driven operations, hence allowing it to replicate Splunk, ERPs, supply chain operations, healthcare, etc. That said, there is some tradeoffs (larger learning curve than Splunk/others, steeper pricing, etc.).\n\nThe stock is definitely carrying a premium and by no means cheap at all, but I'm not worried about holding shares of a company with great outlook. And most of its peers (who have worse business/products) are at a higher valuation/premium. If anything, comments like these give me confidence that this stock will be a money maker as it means there is a huge knowledge gap between what the public thinks it does vs. what it actually does.",
