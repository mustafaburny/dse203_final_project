        "body": "Fear of inflation is inducing a rotation out of growth. Tech (especially FAAAN/MG-ish stocks) are seeing  TREMENDOUS earnings reports and then either immediately staying flat or seeing a steep discount. AMD not only had a great quarter, but changed guidance from 37% growth for the year to 50% growth. The result? AMD is down 15% since the high on their earnings day. Same with MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, and even NVDA. PLTR is going with the market.  \n\n\nAdditionally, PLTR has no reason for price to increase right now, outside of the market/sector drop. They are significantly over-priced. I don't think the price is likely to drop down to a saner value. I think it's more likely to hold and stick around 20-30 *until the fundamentals  rise to justify the price*.  Everyone suspects they should have a pretty good quarter. That'll be good. They'll need several of those consecutively for the market to respond. Every few new big contracts and news stories, they gain another analyst adding them to their coverage. Enough really great quarters of growth (say, another year worth) and the market will start responding.  \n\n\nThose of us invested now -- and those like Cathie Woods -- are playing the hunch and taking the risk that we are recognizing the potential of the company before the rest of the market has caught on to it. While they're waiting for results to move the price, we're betting on results. We could be wrong. Probably not, but we could be.  \n\n\nAnyway, I have been calling this for weeks. Nobody -- not even the CEO -- has implied that PLTR is a short term profit play. Everyone knows you hold PLTR for the long term, if you have conviction in the company. And yet, you have all these people going \"HURR DURR PLTR TO THE MOON ON EARNINGS DAY!\" and \"HURR PLTR 50/100/150 by END OF YEAR\".  \n\n\nFor weeks, I've been saying this: ***PLTR will drop to 20 before earnings and then it will moon... back to 24 or so, where we are today***.  \n\n\nWe've done the \"reached 19/20\" part. I expect good earnings on 5/11. I no longer think we'll see a lift back to 24 or 25 on earnings, though. Not in the current senseless market. I think we'll see it trade flat after earnings or possibly very slightly higher for a day... and then all the \"HURR DURR PLTR 50 BY END OF YEAR\" people will get impatient (despite being warned since the beginning) and start selling off... leaving us back down to around  wherever we are just before the earnings report.  \n\n\nIf you don't have conviction in PLTR, don't invest. If you do, leave your position alone and relax for a few years.  \n\n\n***11% of  portfolio is PLTR at 23.98***",
