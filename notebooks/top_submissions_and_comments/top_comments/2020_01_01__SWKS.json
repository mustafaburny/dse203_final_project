Wasn't the commission crazy. I thought u cant predict stuff in one day, only like long term trends...\n\nWhen do you cut your losses, I have 120% returns on my amd call option, but -80% returns on another option, and i was curious whether i should have sold it at -10% when i saw it.... Like since amd was going up, i figured other semi conductor stocks would too, so i bought skyworks call option itm, but then its just been bearish and -80% yet the stock only when down like 5% so its leverage... But then, i bought a JP morgan chase call, and in one day it the option dropped 15% but then today it came back and canceled my loss. How do you know when to take the loss or hodl or etc. I usually buy options with 1 month to expiry so i have lots of time and i think less time decay?!",

Why dont you just then make a a few bigger trades, or is it because of risk?? Do you buy market order, or use TA to find an entry. So if i understand, you will read quaterly reports and such to see if you should sell. I never done that, and skyworks does seem to have lower revenue than expected, which could be why.... Do you buy options contracts expiration like 1 month of 1 week, or depends. \n\nYeah i meant sell as in close a naked option position, not option writing or iron condor, credit spread... I still have to learn about those, but they are very confusing and seem to be more risky than naked puts/calls.",

Over the last year, after I bought my shares over the course of a few months, I really didn't pay that much attention to the stocks. I started checking in again a few weeks ago and I am up quite a bit, all of my positions are up at least 50%. I realized recently I have absolutely no business picking stocks. I was just following what some people on youtube were doing and since the market on a whole was doing awesome, I got really lucky. I should just take my money and run, but the fear of missing out of continual growth is weighing heavily on my mind. I know the FOMO is what causes people to lose money. I think I know what the right thing to do is, which is to sell while I'm ahead. But my emotional side is keeping me from do ing so. What do you guys think of the market and my position?",

Wasn't the commission crazy. I thought u cant predict stuff in one day, only like long term trends...\n\nWhen do you cut your losses, I have 120% returns on my amd call option, but -80% returns on another option, and i was curious whether i should have sold it at -10% when i saw it.... Like since amd was going up, i figured other semi conductor stocks would too, so i bought skyworks call option itm, but then its just been bearish and -80% yet the stock only when down like 5% so its leverage... But then, i bought a JP morgan chase call, and in one day it the option dropped 15% but then today it came back and canceled my loss. How do you know when to take the loss or hodl or etc. I usually buy options with 1 month to expiry so i have lots of time and i think less time decay?!",

Why dont you just then make a a few bigger trades, or is it because of risk?? Do you buy market order, or use TA to find an entry. So if i understand, you will read quaterly reports and such to see if you should sell. I never done that, and skyworks does seem to have lower revenue than expected, which could be why.... Do you buy options contracts expiration like 1 month of 1 week, or depends. \n\nYeah i meant sell as in close a naked option position, not option writing or iron condor, credit spread... I still have to learn about those, but they are very confusing and seem to be more risky than naked puts/calls.",

        "body": "I think I should sell now. I was very very lucky. I started investing in individual stocks for the first time in late 2018. I invested in AAPL, FB, NVDA, SWKS. And I invested in TSLA a few times during 2019, with average buying price at $220. \n\nI've made some really good gains. Over the last year, after I bought my shares over the course of a few months, I really didn't pay that much attention to the stocks. I started checking in again a few weeks ago and I am up quite a bit, all of my positions are up at least 50%. I realized recently I have absolutely no business picking stocks. I was just following what some people on youtube were doing and since the market on a whole was doing awesome, I got really lucky. I should just take my money and run, but the fear of missing out of continual growth is weighing heavily on my mind. I know the FOMO is what causes people to lose money. I think I know what the right thing to do is, which is to sell while I'm ahead. But my emotional side is keeping me from do ing so. What do you guys think of the market and my position?",

Basically chip stocks initially, then pure TSLA  weekly calls from 430 which made up most of the gains. Minus big losses from Google and Amazon calls. Google because I had weak TP hands and sold right before the jump to 1400+ which if I held for a few more days would have netted profit out the ass.",
