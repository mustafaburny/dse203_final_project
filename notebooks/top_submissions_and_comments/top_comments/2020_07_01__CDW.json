[A couple days ago, Corning reported that they will ramp up production for vaccine bottles.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/13/coronavirus-vaccine-corning-glass/)\n\nCorning also makes glass for phones and electronics.

Valor glass. Same Corning update suggested that this sales levels would materialize upon the product\u2019s \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d by the market. Reasonably likely that demand from clinical trials and production of Covid vaccine/treatments alone would be sufficient to satisfy the threshold for \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d if not more; not surprising per se, covid is merely a catalyst. If true, then the marginal contribution of Valor sales to the bottom line will be substantial.\n\nLinks to referenced sources:\n\n [Pharmaceutical Glass Packaging 2017](https://s22.q4cdn.com/662497847/files/doc_news/disclosure/valor_FAQ.pdf)\n\n[Examining Supply Chain Risk For Pandemic Preparedness](https://pharmablog.syntegon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/06/whitepaper-Corning-Valor.pdf)",

[FDA review itself has gotten a lot faster in recent years (\\~6mo for priority review), even though trials are taking longer.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2758605) (you can read the full article on sci-hub by searching the DOI). The big question I haven't been able to answer through googling is how quickly companies can take drugs from phase 3 completion to filing the NDA. I imagine it takes a year if they're being aggressive, so if we say \\~3mo until phase 2/3 studies finish, 1 year to NDA, and 6mo to approval, that's almost two years from now, if we're very lucky (I'd say luck is on our side with how many companies are taking their shot at this) \n\nThat being said, from the perspective of Corning, I think drug companies can be pretty sure if they will see approval soon after Phase 3 completion (and publication of the results), so I imagine they will put in their big order of vials before the NDA is filed.",
