        "body": "So, regarding airlines: you\u2019re right to think \u201cthis industry is distressed right now, I should buy it to earn on the recovery\u201d, that is a logical thought. However, airlines are taking on an *insane* amount of debt to weather this storm. They\u2019re straight up burning *tens of millions a day* to keep what travel is allowed available. Airlines are getting hit even harder than casinos right now, and that recovery will take a very, very long time.\n\nBut, if you step that logic back a couple steps into something more fundamental it avoids a lot of those issues. No, I\u2019m not talking Boeing (that will be shorter but still extremely subdued), I\u2019m talking about Amphenol. They\u2019re an electronics manufacturer that makes aerospace-grade parts. The further you get away from consumer habits, the wider timeframe these profits and losses operate in, and (right now at least) the more attractive that makes an investment.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t flying, companies aren\u2019t going to be replacing planes any time soon either, but there\u2019s foundational companies that are already up and running in anticipation of that. Because that\u2019s *their* business cycle. Same goes for other industrial companies, like Air Products, or raw materials manufacturers on the DOW.\n\nDon\u2019t play this recovery at the consumer level, whatever you do. Play it at the manufacturing level, and play it as diversely as you can.",
