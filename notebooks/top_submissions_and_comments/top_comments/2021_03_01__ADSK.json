There just isn't any consistency like her other etfs and this is coming from someone who isn't the biggest cathie fan but her other etfs have consistency. I can see this etf getting very mixed returns because you are not betting on a sector you are betting on multiple diffrent sectors that move differently.",

        "body": "&gt;They had their best year ever and couldn't even bring in 1b of revenue \n\nYou don't mention bookings which is critical to understanding the economics of a free-to-play ecosystem. When a player buys $120 of their in-app currency, accounting rules around virtual currencies state that can't be reported as revenue because the player hasn't received value yet. So it's counted as $120 in bookings but it converts to revenue over a trailing 24 month period.\n\nSo: bookings are a leading indicator of performance; revenue is a trailing indicator of performance.\n\nRoblox had $1.9 billion of bookings in 2020, which will convert to revenue over the following two years. And while that happens, they're generating more bookings for 2021 which will convert to revenue in 2022 and 2023... etc.\n\nSo when you look at Roblox and see that they have $500 in revenue you're looking at how they did in the past, not seeing how much money consumers have already spent with them - and you're not seeing the explosive revenue growth that's about to arrive. You can't compare their numbers (which have been growing year-on-year) to Autodesk who is basically flat.\n\nPut another way: if you think Autodesk is fairly valued at $60B with $1B in revenue, then when next year's Roblox revenue catches up to this year's $1.9 billion in bookings, Roblox should be worth $120B. That gives Roblox an upside of 3x from where it is now and shares should be valued at about $210 each.",

I think PLTR is expensive right now myself too,  and they're about the same as RBLX. Id probably still buy PLTR first. \n\nI see at that everyone investing buys thinking that the company is going to make a lot more money. The question is, are they going to make enough money in the future to validate their value? How much money do they need to make to increase the value?  Where will they be in 10 years? If roblox takes 10 years to do 6 billion in a year,  are they still going to be worth 40 billion like EA? I don't know based on their guidance that they will be there any time in the next 5 years.  Is this going to tie up my money at this crazy premium? The clientele are children.  If we compare to platforms,  Twitter has a ton of users,  but hasn't traditionally been able to monetize well.....I guess where I'm going with all of this,  I love doing comparison shopping.  If something is going to tie up my money and the upside within the next decade is already priced in,  I can likely find something trading cheaper.  I think I would only get a sizeable return here on hype trading.",

        "body": "Franklin Templeton released a bunch of  thematic active ETFs in February 2020 &amp; March 2021. They seem pretty interesting, with a disruption/innovation theme to each of them. Matthew Moberg &amp; Joyce Lin are the fund managers.\n\nAll these ETFs have done very well in the recent past (but then again, 2020 was an exceptional year &amp; past performance doesn't imply future), but they have fallen quite a bit over the past 1 month, giving us potential entry points to \"buy the dip.\" Here's my humble attempt at a summary:\n\n[**Disruptive Commerce ETF $BUYZ**](https://www.franklintempleton.com/investor/investments-and-solutions/investment-options/etfs/portfolio/29096/franklin-disruptive-commerce-etf/BUYZ)**:**\n\n1.

This keeps me balanced and I can wait out the pain that tech is providing.  \n\nMy biggest gains that I have held are from VIAC, SBUX, HP, JPM, STOR, LUMN, SPY, and a host of others.\n\nLet's see if adding to tech this week will pay off.",

Basically the most fabs have been out of game for advanced technology nodes. For example, TXN has some fabs, but they are old technology (still a descent market especially for analog chips). MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC. Samsung is still in the game and SMIC is trying to catch up. But basically TSM takes the majority of the market. \n\nDisclosure: I have been holding TSM for a couple of years.

So if starting from 6.5% (again very rare for a company growing 10% top line which should say something about simply using present FCF yield to say that\u2019s the return I\u2019ll get), combining that with high growth and what I believe to be sustainable growth based on strong competitive positioning and secular megatrends, the return will be north of 6.5%.
