There just isn't any consistency like her other etfs and this is coming from someone who isn't the biggest cathie fan but her other etfs have consistency. I can see this etf getting very mixed returns because you are not betting on a sector you are betting on multiple diffrent sectors that move differently.",

        "body": "&gt;They had their best year ever and couldn't even bring in 1b of revenue \n\nYou don't mention bookings which is critical to understanding the economics of a free-to-play ecosystem. When a player buys $120 of their in-app currency, accounting rules around virtual currencies state that can't be reported as revenue because the player hasn't received value yet. So it's counted as $120 in bookings but it converts to revenue over a trailing 24 month period.\n\nSo: bookings are a leading indicator of performance; revenue is a trailing indicator of performance.\n\nRoblox had $1.9 billion of bookings in 2020, which will convert to revenue over the following two years. And while that happens, they're generating more bookings for 2021 which will convert to revenue in 2022 and 2023... etc.\n\nSo when you look at Roblox and see that they have $500 in revenue you're looking at how they did in the past, not seeing how much money consumers have already spent with them - and you're not seeing the explosive revenue growth that's about to arrive. You can't compare their numbers (which have been growing year-on-year) to Autodesk who is basically flat.\n\nPut another way: if you think Autodesk is fairly valued at $60B with $1B in revenue, then when next year's Roblox revenue catches up to this year's $1.9 billion in bookings, Roblox should be worth $120B. That gives Roblox an upside of 3x from where it is now and shares should be valued at about $210 each.",

Google? For their Gmail on the moon or....? Amazon because they're going to sell rocket ships in 2145 if they still exist? [JD.com](https://JD.com) Chinese commerce site?\n\nThey add names like Amazon because ARK has complete faith in all these big names to rescue them in case their picks in the actual space sector turn out to be duds.... which means they aren't really 'in the know' with what's going on at the companies they're investing in, don't have a lot of confidence, and just want people to throw more money at them.\n\nThey make whacky statements like bitcoin is going to replace t-bills, and Tesla is going to $4000 by 2023..... yeah ok. Ark is stupid. Ask Cathie about any tech stock \"oh yeah I think it is undervalued.\"  They routinely buy companies at all time highs, buy every dip, its not going to end well for them, sorry.",

I think PLTR is expensive right now myself too,  and they're about the same as RBLX. Id probably still buy PLTR first. \n\nI see at that everyone investing buys thinking that the company is going to make a lot more money. The question is, are they going to make enough money in the future to validate their value? How much money do they need to make to increase the value?  Where will they be in 10 years? If roblox takes 10 years to do 6 billion in a year,  are they still going to be worth 40 billion like EA? I don't know based on their guidance that they will be there any time in the next 5 years.  Is this going to tie up my money at this crazy premium? The clientele are children.  If we compare to platforms,  Twitter has a ton of users,  but hasn't traditionally been able to monetize well.....I guess where I'm going with all of this,  I love doing comparison shopping.  If something is going to tie up my money and the upside within the next decade is already priced in,  I can likely find something trading cheaper.  I think I would only get a sizeable return here on hype trading.",

Sorry for poor formatting I am on mobile but i really want to discuss this. \n\nProof of position before starting: https://imgur.com/a/GXhOznp\n\nShares: https://imgur.com/a/urp4YcN\n\nLoss porn the first week: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay29a/hold_lads_gme_will_remember_us_we_will_not_be/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n$250-250k to basically 0 now to the theory! \n\nI have been watching \ud83e\udd13 the GME saga for weeks now and ready every single post, shitpost from WSB, GME and so on and something has really bothered me. \ud83e\uddd0\n\nHow will \ud83d\udca9 shitadel get out of this. So lets talk about a few theories as to what is happen and multiple fronts.\n\n1. Front is old and new shorts, have a war according to uncle bruce between NYC hedge funds and CME options traders in which shorts are flipping long at the expense of naked sellers of the CME. To do this you buy enough ITM calls to cover your short and a little extra to sell back to naked options sellers thus getting out of the short and passing the burning house to options sellers. Now granted this may only work for small positions.\n\n2. The second front is the large short positions that are so fucking deep it will form the black hole of the galaxy. How do they cover and still break even or profit without necessarily cheating. \n\nWell you heard of interstellar \ud83e\ude80 i shall put on my tin foil hat and explain black hole event horizon slingshot.\n\nHow does it work? Well it requires 3 things shorts that will exit, put/call options but mainly puts and chaos/volatility. \n\nThe theory is that shitadel will tank the market and use the stimulus money. Now retarded spud \ud83e\udd54 how do they do that? Well.. \n\nMost people are getting a $1400 \ud83d\udcb0 check which they should be buying food and shit with but are buying FDs and stonks.  Fun fact if 1 million Americans yoloed GME thats 1.4 Billion $$$. Now imagine how much shitadel can get out with if half did that. \n\nEffectively pumping the markets. So what do you do if your short so fucking deep that your anus is wider than the sun and the sun is shining? \n\nYou first cheat to stabilize the position aka GME and the market. Thus effectively shorting volatility and lowering IV. \n\nNow how does that relate to GME? Well if GME does the damage we think it will do then you need insurance. Which are basically options.\n\nQueue magnifying glass. If you look at any boomer stock and or blue chip etc there are 10s of thousands of puts for march 19th. \n\nFOR EVERY FUCKING large cap. Now lets look at the chaos/volatility fuel in this case VIX and VXX derivatives. \n\nConsidering how chaotic the market looks and the looming doom that is GME vix is really low. \nIf you look at VXX in particular for march 19th there are 80000 calls at $20 and 40000 at 40.\n\nIm no tin foil man but that seems like an elaborate setup for a rug pull and ive been through many. \n\nShitadel may use that as justification for shorts and right now theyre fucked. GME turn around, they lost their mole CFO and now the SEC is turning sides with new officials. This smells the ultimate exit.\n\nJDST, JNUG, UVXY, SVXY, AMD, BEYOND MEAT, THE piss, the coup, the shitcoins shill, montezation of WSB attempt, SPY FDs 0DTE and Trump Tweets I have been with WSB through it all and this time i want to contribute.\n\nTl;dr. Shitadel is planning the biggest rug pull ever and its powered by gamestop. How do you capture the violence that will occur to 401ks ane retirement? \n\nGamestop, VXX, and puts on \u201cinsert favorite boomer stock here\u201d or SPY.\n\nPositions \n\nGME: \nCalls for \n\n3/5\n3/12\n3/19\n3/26 \n\nat various strikes at 115-800\n\nVXX: \n\nCalls for\n3/19 at $40 for 500 calls adding an additional 500-1000 for insurance.\n\nFun position\nRKT\n\n3/12 at $25 for 45 calls. \n\nThey will be rolled into GME and additional puts across the market.\n\nAlso: 100+ shares and holding across 5 brokers https://imgur.com/a/urp4YcN\n\nLet me know and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 my fellow smooth brain \ud83e\udde0 \ud83e\udd8d  brothers! Ice cream on me when this is over \ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\n\nSide note i bet a girl to marry me at 10000 on GME make sure it happens y\u2019all invited to the livestream.\n\nEdit: A SILVER? Spend it ON GME, also when and if we implode load up on the dip! You now can feel like rich billionaires crashing the market to buy cheap shit! Or you know LONG black berry\n\nEdit2: Shoutout to the boys over at the other subreddits with the amazing DD you all helped me develop a wrinkle you know who you are. Pixel man and New guy\n\nEdit3: added shares for confirmation bias and \ud83e\udd8d hype for bananas \ud83c\udf4c",

Sorry for poor formatting I am on mobile but i really want to discuss this. \n\nProof of position before starting: https://imgur.com/a/GXhOznp\n\nShares: https://imgur.com/a/urp4YcN\n\nLoss porn the first week: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay29a/hold_lads_gme_will_remember_us_we_will_not_be/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n$250-250k to basically 0 now to the theory! \n\nI have been watching \ud83e\udd13 the GME saga for weeks now and ready every single post, shitpost from WSB, GME and so on and something has really bothered me. \ud83e\uddd0\n\nHow will \ud83d\udca9 shitadel get out of this. So lets talk about a few theories as to what is happen and multiple fronts.\n\n1. Front is old and new shorts, have a war according to uncle bruce between NYC hedge funds and CME options traders in which shorts are flipping long at the expense of naked sellers of the CME. To do this you buy enough ITM calls to cover your short and a little extra to sell back to naked options sellers thus getting out of the short and passing the burning house to options sellers. Now granted this may only work for small positions.\n\n2. The second front is the large short positions that are so fucking deep it will form the black hole of the galaxy. How do they cover and still break even or profit without necessarily cheating. \n\nWell you heard of interstellar \ud83e\ude80 i shall put on my tin foil hat and explain black hole event horizon slingshot.\n\nHow does it work? Well it requires 3 things shorts that will exit, put/call options but mainly puts and chaos/volatility. \n\nThe theory is that shitadel will tank the market and use the stimulus money. Now retarded spud \ud83e\udd54 how do they do that? Well.. \n\nMost people are getting a $1400 \ud83d\udcb0 check which they should be buying food and shit with but are buying FDs and stonks.  Fun fact if 1 million Americans yoloed GME thats 1.4 Billion $$$. Now imagine how much shitadel can get out with if half did that. \n\nEffectively pumping the markets. So what do you do if your short so fucking deep that your anus is wider than the sun and the sun is shining? \n\nYou first cheat to stabilize the position aka GME and the market. Thus effectively shorting volatility and lowering IV. \n\nNow how does that relate to GME? Well if GME does the damage we think it will do then you need insurance. Which are basically options.\n\nQueue magnifying glass. If you look at any boomer stock and or blue chip etc there are 10s of thousands of puts for march 19th. \n\nFOR EVERY FUCKING large cap. Now lets look at the chaos/volatility fuel in this case VIX and VXX derivatives. \n\nConsidering how chaotic the market looks and the looming doom that is GME vix is really low. \nIf you look at VXX in particular for march 19th there are 80000 calls at $20 and 40000 at 40.\n\nIm no tin foil man but that seems like an elaborate setup for a rug pull and ive been through many. \n\nShitadel may use that as justification for shorts and right now theyre fucked. GME turn around, they lost their mole CFO and now the SEC is turning sides with new officials. This smells the ultimate exit.\n\nJDST, JNUG, UVXY, SVXY, AMD, BEYOND MEAT, THE piss, the coup, the shitcoins shill, montezation of WSB attempt, SPY FDs 0DTE and Trump Tweets I have been with WSB through it all and this time i want to contribute.\n\nTl;dr. Shitadel is planning the biggest rug pull ever and its powered by gamestop. How do you capture the violence that will occur to 401ks ane retirement? \n\nGamestop, VXX, and puts on \u201cinsert favorite boomer stock here\u201d or SPY.\n\nPositions \n\nGME: \nCalls for \n\n3/5\n3/12\n3/19\n3/26 \n\nat various strikes at 115-800\n\nVXX: \n\nCalls for\n3/19 at $40 for 500 calls adding an additional 500-1000 for insurance.\n\nFun position\nRKT\n\n3/12 at $25 for 45 calls. \n\nThey will be rolled into GME and additional puts across the market.\n\nAlso: 100+ shares and holding across 5 brokers https://imgur.com/a/urp4YcN\n\nLet me know and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 my fellow smooth brain \ud83e\udde0 \ud83e\udd8d  brothers! Ice cream on me when this is over \ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66\n\nSide note i bet a girl to marry me at 10000 on GME make sure it happens y\u2019all invited to the livestream.\n\nEdit: A SILVER? Spend it ON GME, also when and if we implode load up on the dip! You now can feel like rich billionaires crashing the market to buy cheap shit! Or you know LONG black berry\n\nEdit2: Shoutout to the boys over at the other subreddits with the amazing DD you all helped me develop a wrinkle you know who you are.
