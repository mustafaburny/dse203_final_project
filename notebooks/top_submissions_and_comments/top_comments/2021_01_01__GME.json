        "author": "Tarsupin",
        "body": "For anyone watching the situation on GME, please also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:\n\n1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.\n\n2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.\n\n3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\n\n4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\n\n5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\n\n6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.\n\n7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Then consider moving to SoFi, since Chamath is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and is offering probably the best alternative.\n\n8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.\n\n9. Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood to leverage the losses from the day you couldn't buy GME. Document evidence of owning GME (it will be in your Robinhood history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, you should join as a Named Class Representative for outcomes specific to you. These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud. Details are still coming.\n\n10. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.\n\nYou're welcome to exchange this info freely if you find it useful. I am not a financial advisor, yadda yadda, you know the drill.",

        "body": "For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:\n\n1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.\n\n2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.\n\n3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\n\n4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\n\n5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\n\n6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.\n\n7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.\n\n8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.\n\n9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.\n\nYou're welcome to exchange this info freely if you find it useful. I am not a financial advisor, yadda yadda, you know the drill.",

        "body": "Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:\n\nFunds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to \u201ctap\u201d down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it\u2019s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I\u2019ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It\u2019s a classic short move.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren\u2019t calling in favors like this right now you\u2019re living in fantasy land.\n\nSo for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It\u2019s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There\u2019s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked\n\nPlease share and upvote this for god sakes so people don\u2019t think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I don\u2019t want credit I just don\u2019t want the little guy to lose!\n\nFYI I work in healthcare and have 6 figures in student loan debt and I\u2019m finally making enough $ from you retards that makes me think one day I might pay off.

        "body": "30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb\n\nI'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.\n\nDisclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:\n\nWe were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.\n2.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.\n3.\t\u2060\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n5.\t\u2060\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n6.\t\u2060\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n7.\t\u2060\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.\n\nI saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nCredit: u/PlayFree_Bird",

        "body": "I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall. Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:\n\nYesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.\n\nYesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.\n\nLast night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n\nToday, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n\nAt approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n\nTwo minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n\nThe trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede. That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",

The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future.

This text will be the most important piece that you\u2019ll see today!!!\n\nThey didn\u2019t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold \u2014&gt; price goes down \u2014&gt; the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place \u2014&gt; price drops even more \u2014&gt; they keep doing that \u2014&gt; price drops lower every time \u2014&gt; but as long as we hold they weren\u2019t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don\u2019t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!\n\nFurthermore don\u2019t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I\u2018m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!\n\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n\u2022 \u2060Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. \u2022 \u2060Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. \u2022 \u2060A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n\u2022 \u2060imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. \u2022 \u2060Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future.
