As a former IBMer, it\u2019s a garbage company run by garbage management and has been desperately failing at making lemonade every chance it gets.\n\nIt\u2019s constantly behind the curve on things that it ducking invents.  And the leadership cares about nothing other than the short term.  It\u2019s been utterly gutted and it\u2019s only redeeming feature is that it\u2019s got so much money it can\u2019t go bankrupt quickly.  \n\nI would never work for IBM again, nor do I think it has a place in any portfolio.",

Think of winter vs. summer. If you move north in the summer and south in the winter, you'll skip the freezes and the droughts and life will be good. \n\nThis is also known as \"timing the market\". It's difficult. Dangerous. More people fail than succeed. \n\nThis is not advice. It's an explanation for why some people trade instead of just buying an index fund. \n\nAlso (more importantly) most people don't think that much about it. They want to \"do the thing\" without really understanding what they're doing. They buy whatever is moving, what their friends are buying, what's in the news. This is momentum investing. It's also tricky, but some people with their \"fingers on the pulse\" can really clean-up this way. I know a guy who's made around 70% every year for the past ten years this way. He's got a masters in economics and used to work as a bank president before he retired to trade stocks and race cars full time. You're not that guy. Neither am I. And I expect one day he won't be that guy any more either.",

Apple is on a league of its own, and someone like nvdia or Qualcomm will create the M1 equivalent for PC.\n\n\nAnd the other problem as someone who works in Silicon Valley, in this industry and has a lot of friends in Intel is: \n\nIntel has been bleeding talent left and right for the last 5 years. \n\nIntel pays very low compared to Silicon Valley standards, that\u2019s partly because there is so much competition for talent from nvidia, apple, Qualcomm who are all killing it.  And as a big chunk of compensation is tied in RSUs, Intel cannot compete with salaries as these companies stocks have done extremely well. Apple\u2019s stock has gone up 300% in 5 years and if 30% of your compensation is RSUs, then you are basically getting 30-40% yoy raises for 5 years straight. No way Intel can keep up with that.\n\nIntel pays like 30-50% lower for a comparable position at apple. You just cannot retain top talent with that kind of a pay disparity. Anyone I know, who is talented enough and can leave Intel, has left Intel. \n\n\nIntel is seriously at the danger of becoming IBM of chip makers. Especially now, with amazon working on its own server chips, google working on its own, Microsoft is rumoured to be working on their own silicon for azure. Apparently Qualcomm is going to compete in PC processors. Intel is increasingly looking its in a death spiral. Google, Amazon, Microsoft can pay intel\u2019s top people 2x and poach them left and right. Because these companies are swimming in money form their other businesses.\n\n\nOne thing they have going for them is their fabs. With the increased attention to on shoring chip manufacturing, they should leverage that and start manufacturing chips from competitors for domestic consumption, especially like the defence industry. They have a healthy head start with chip manufacturing infrastructure and know how. They should lean into that. The days of them competing to make the best processors in the world is over.",

Cisco. Oracle. \n\nWhat operating systems do majority of servers run? It's not windows, or iOS, or android. It's Linux. And the best one is redhat. It can run on and interface with any of the cloud providers securely. It's a platform to switch between any cloud provider easier than conforming to each cloud setup separately. \n\nWhat company makes the best server to process transactions for credit cards, banks, large retailers and service companies? Ibm, their processors are purpose built. Some like banks, hospitals, insurers are require by law to run their own data transaction systems. Their 7nm power 10 / telum processors can handle more work load any one else. Amd and Intel chip followers take note of ibm's CPU architecture. Specifically their cash system that result in much lower latency and cash pools in the size of gigabytes, also shared memory pools in terabytes. \n\nThey came up with the 2nm and lower transistor process for chips. They led in creating a programming language for quantum computing. They set a world record in data storage solution with their 580 terabyte tape units. Not worth listing all the little things they do. \n\nTheir new CEO is outspoken about collaboration and getting ibm out from being a siloed company. I am sure they will find the right partners for their tech. He switched the company over to Salesforce and slack and such. Deepens partnerships with companies like SAP and others. Increasing consulting business. IBM was also early in jumping in and providing lots of online open courses with100s of thousands taking part across the world. \n\nIBMs role might be niche and you might not understand them. But, it doesn't mean they are not relevant globally. $75B in revenues.",

Initially IBM did not believe in the PC revolution nor did they want to cannibalize their high revenue mainframe business, so they did not bother developing PCs. Once Apple took off they realized their mistake and wanted to quickly rush a PC to market. They quickly made the hardware but needed an operating system. Instead of developing their own they looked to hire an outsider to do it since that would be faster. They entered into an agreement with Microsoft that allowed Microsoft to retain the rights of the operating system.  This initially seemed fine since IBM dominated hardware, so they did not anticipate what would come next: dozens of competitors rip apart IBM personal computers, reverse engineer them, and then build their own IBM PC clones. The competitors sell the clones for a fraction of the cost of the IBM computer and take away huge market share. Meanwhile Microsoft is laughing their way to the bank as they own the rights to the operating system and make money regardless of who the hardware provider is. \n\nIBM realizes that they need to lower the cost of their products to compete in the marketplace so they look to cut costs. They cut back significantly on hiring. So where do all the top engineers go to? Not IBM but other tech companies like Microsoft and Oracle (and eventually Google, Facebook, etc).\n\n\nSo essentially they had no moat, and stopped hiring talent. Today\u2019s tech giants are constantly hiring and spending insane amounts on R&amp;D. The second they stop is when you should get worried.",

Add declining margins and a big debt pile and you got a winner for the next fallen giant. \n\nAs much as IBM want you to believe it, the cloud is not their friend. It's their enemy. New companies will choose Google/Amazon/Microsoft and older ones start to migrate too, as IBM's cloud offerings are far behind. The Red Hat Acquisition was a good idea, but they killed CentOS and thus eroding the trust that Red Hat has built with the Open-Source Linux community. It seems that they have spend more money marketing Watson than creating it, as there has been no results so far. IBM's marketing team is insanely good at creating a false narrative. \n\nTheir accounting is absolutely weird. Recurring one-time charges that are very consistent, counting Red Hat Consulting revenue in the cloud basket. Additionally last quarter their Free Cash Flow wasn't even enough to pay for the dividend. They had to take up$1.5b in debt to pay it out. \n\nA good indicator of potential value is how many \"superinvestors\" there are. IBM is the only, the only company in excess of $150b EV that didn't have a single superinvestor on it. It seems that the money is mostly coming mostly from passive dividend ETFs. What happens when IBM is forced to cut the dividend and those flows gets removed? \n\nTaking their FCF, IBM should currently be more in the $40-60 range not $125. \n\nJust to iterate how expensive IBM is. IBM's revenue is declining at it has a PE of 23, while Google grows at around 40% a year and if you include the latest quarter has a PE of 26. Facebook with 30% growth has a PE of 22.

Intel is investing anywhere from 10%-20% of its invested capital back into the company each year.
