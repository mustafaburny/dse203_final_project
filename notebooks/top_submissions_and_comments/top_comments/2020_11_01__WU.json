        "body": "- First off, the founder/chairman Bruno Wu founded a company a while back called Sun Seven Stars group. There were a couple scandals that the group was related to that was pretty fishy. It didn't originate from them, but some of the people they were doing business with ended up taking a lot of money from investors.\n\n- Wu also has had no clear vision for Ideanomics. It's been a while that I did research on this so I forget some of the paths they took, but I know at one point IDEX used to be in the oil business (lol?). They would be the middle man of selling oil directly from the supplier to the consumer. It failed miserably, so then they got into fintech/blockchain because it was the next big thing (also failed). Now they're in the EV space because, you guessed it, it's the next big thing.\n\n- Ideanomics has cycled through more leadership than I care to count. I don't mind Alf Poor, but he doesn't get me excited to invest in the company.\n\n- Hindenburg Research put an article out on them back in June/July about a few things I mentioned above, but they also targeted the MEG center (glorified EV expo). They claimed that IDEX mislead shareholders into thinking that IDEX owned this entire facility, when in fact they were given permission to use part of it for selling EVs by the Chinese government. I always take everything Hindenburg says with a grain of salt because they are short sellers and looking to profit off stocks selling, but I already knew this. The way Alf and the company explained MEG to the shareholders did make it seem like they owned the entire building and that it was a full fledged operation. Not true\n\n- Speaking again of Hindenburg and MEG, they sent someone to this expo and had them take pictures and ask around about IDEX. They claimed there was no IDEX presence there in their article. IDEX took a very long time to provide any sort of proof that they actually had presence at the MEG center, and it came in the form of an LED sign outside the building that read \"MEG\". Those were probably the most painful weeks any investor has experienced, and I know they lost a TON of trust with people during this time. Imo this is the biggest point, because once you lose trust with someone, it's over.\n\n- From a financial/actual business perspective, their balance sheet was bad at the start of this year, but I will say they did clean it up a little regarding debt (nothing too impressive). The thing that was keeping their share price so high (and is now) is the China EV market. I will admit, there is amazing potential there, and when Alf laid out the PowerPoints with the potential order numbers, I was impressed. I sat on so many virtual conferences with these guys, and I always liked the outlook. However, when actual numbers came in, they were abysmal. The meat of their backlog is the electric bus orders, but as far as I know, none have been filled even to this day.\n\nThere's a lot more but I'll spare the details. It's fine to play the hype train, but from a long term investing perspective, I will never buy and hold IDEX. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

        "body": "&gt;How can it be a reserve asset when it has no intrinsic use? \n\nIt has plenty of intrinsic value (see below). As for it being a reserve asset, it is the hardest asset known to man. There is a reason BTC was recently added to the balance sheets of Square, MicroStrategy, and numerous hedge funds. \n\nhttps://ir.microstrategy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microstrategy-adopts-bitcoin-primary-treasury-reserve-asset\n\nhttps://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment\n\n&gt;Gold and silver are semiconductors and thus always have some value. \n\nSomething like 20% of golds price is based on utility. The rest is entirely speculative. Its use-case outside of semiconductors is even worse than BTC. It has an unknown supply and is very difficult to transport and transact with. \n\nBitcoin has plenty of intrinsic use. These include borderless transfer without needing to convert to to local currency (cant do this with Western Union), black markets, safe haven from oppressive governments, sending aid to citizens of oppressive governments, ways to bypass import sanctions (see Iran), and more. Just because you don't have intrinsic use for BTC, doesn't mean others don't (see links below). \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html\n\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amid-protests-bitcoin-gives-nigerians-alternative-to-banking-system-2020-10-19\n\nhttps://asiatimes.com/2020/10/iran-to-use-bitcoin-to-fund-imports/\n\n&gt;Anyone can clone Bitcoin and spin up their own Blockchain, and there are hundreds of altcoins that do things better.\n\nOf course they can and they have, thats the beauty of being open source. However, all of those forks continue to die a slow, painful death. This is like saying anyone can create a better social network than Facebook and therefore Facebook has no value. Just like with Facebook,  network effects are real. BTC is trusted and secure and every day it doesn't die it becomes stronger. \n\n&gt;Best case scenario Bitcoin remains a niche currency used by tech enthusiasts and criminals online. Worst case scenario governments ban it due to usage by criminals, and it's valuation tanks due to inability to buy/sell through an exchange.\n\nWrong. Best case scenario is that BTC continues to be added to the balance sheets of large, publicly traded companies and that small nations continue adopting it until it can no longer be ignored all while second layer solutions continue to be improved upon. This is literally already happening. Its not speculative at this point\n\n&gt;You can say \"what about fiat currency it has no intrinsic use\". It's still legally required to be accepted to settle debts, and is required to pay taxes that are mandated by law. So it has statutory support. Also fiat currency generally isn't an investment besides as a hedge.\n\nAgain BTC does have intrinsic use today and those uses will continue to expand. The genie is out of the bottle at this point and adoption is occurring rapidly.",

It was 2017 when the fireworks started. Those are coming. Interestingly enough 2016-2018 was almost entirely retail investors. Now that institutions are in the mix? Look out.\n\n&gt;oh Jesus Christ.

It's also too early to trying to figure out exactly what bitcoin is or will become (store of value, payment system, monetary unit, method for software applications to validate each other without a central provider, etc).\n\nIt isn't about getting rich and it isn't about a new world order. I find it most useful to think of the bitcoin protocol in the same way we view other protocols (ftp for files, https for secure web, sip for calls, tcp for data assembly, ip for data routing, etc). It's just another layer to the internet, albeit an incredibly powerful layer that I personally believe will eclipse all others aside from tcp/ip &amp; https.\n\nEvery time I hear people trying to prescribe what exactly bitcoin is or will be all I can think about are these quotes:\n\n&gt;\"By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet\u2019s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine\u2019s.\u201d Paul Krugman\n\n&gt;\"This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.\" William Orton, President of Western Union\n\n&gt;\u201cFooling around with alternating current (AC) is just a waste of time.

These include borderless transfer without needing to convert to to local currency (cant do this with Western Union), black markets, safe haven from oppressive governments, sending aid to citizens of oppressive governments, ways to bypass import sanctions (see Iran), and more. Just because you don't have intrinsic use for BTC, doesn't mean others don't (see link below).\n\nYou can do this with Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Vertcoin, even Dogecoin. I agree cryptocurrency and blockchains are useful but I don't see Bitcoin as a long term store of value. It's far more volatile than precious metals and also intangible.\n\nIBM is making huge strides towards quantum computing, and once they pull it off, Bitcoin will become worthless once the public/private key cryptography is cracked and anyone with access to a quantum computer can simply sign transactions to send coins to themselves. We're easily within 10 years at this point, possibly less.\n\n&gt;This is like saying anyone can create a better social network than Facebook and therefore Facebook has no value\n\nWhat about Myspace? It came first.\n\n&gt;Wrong. Best case scenario is that BTC continues to be added to the balance sheets of large, publicly traded companies\n\nLike 1 or 2 companies that hold it as a tiny position.

        "body": "Copy and pasted from another comment, TL;DR I'm staying away:\n\n- First off, the founder/chairman Bruno Wu founded a company a while back called Sun Seven Stars group. There were a couple scandals that the group was related to that was pretty fishy. It didn't originate from them, but some of the people they were doing business with ended up taking a lot of money from investors.\n\n- Wu also has had no clear vision for Ideanomics. It's been a while that I did research on this so I forget some of the paths they took, but I know at one point IDEX used to be in the oil business (lol?). They would be the middle man of selling oil directly from the supplier to the consumer. It failed miserably, so then they got into fintech/blockchain because it was the next big thing (also failed). Now they're in the EV space because, you guessed it, it's the next big thing.\n\n- Ideanomics has cycled through more leadership than I care to count. I don't mind Alf Poor, but he doesn't get me excited to invest in the company.\n\n- Hindenburg Research put an article out on them back in June/July about a few things I mentioned above, but they also targeted the MEG center (glorified EV expo). They claimed that IDEX mislead shareholders into thinking that IDEX owned this entire facility, when in fact they were given permission to use part of it for selling EVs by the Chinese government. I always take everything Hindenburg says with a grain of salt because they are short sellers and looking to profit off stocks selling, but I already knew this. The way Alf and the company explained MEG to the shareholders did make it seem like they owned the entire building and that it was a full fledged operation. Not true\n\n- Speaking again of Hindenburg and MEG, they sent someone to this expo and had them take pictures and ask around about IDEX. They claimed there was no IDEX presence there in their article. IDEX took a very long time to provide any sort of proof that they actually had presence at the MEG center, and it came in the form of an LED sign outside the building that read \"MEG\". Those were probably the most painful weeks any investor has experienced, and I know they lost a TON of trust with people during this time. Imo this is the biggest point, because once you lose trust with someone, it's over.\n\n- From a financial/actual business perspective, their balance sheet was bad at the start of this year, but I will say they did clean it up a little regarding debt (nothing too impressive). The thing that was keeping their share price so high (and is now) is the China EV market. I will admit, there is amazing potential there, and when Alf laid out the PowerPoints with the potential order numbers, I was impressed. I sat on so many virtual conferences with these guys, and I always liked the outlook. However, when actual numbers came in, they were abysmal. The meat of their backlog is the electric bus orders, but as far as I know, none have been filled even to this day.\n\nThere's a lot more but I'll spare the details. It's fine to play the hype train, but from a long term investing perspective, I will never buy and hold IDEX. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

As for it being a reserve asset, it is the hardest asset known to man. There is a reason BTC was recently added to the balance sheets of Square, MicroStrategy, and numerous hedge funds. \n\nhttps://ir.microstrategy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microstrategy-adopts-bitcoin-primary-treasury-reserve-asset\n\nhttps://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment\n\n&gt;Gold and silver are semiconductors and thus always have some value. \n\nSomething like 20% of golds price is based on utility. The rest is entirely speculative. Its use-case outside of semiconductors is even worse than BTC. It has an unknown supply and is very difficult to transport and transact with. \n\nBitcoin has plenty of intrinsic use. These include borderless transfer without needing to convert to to local currency (cant do this with Western Union), black markets, safe haven from oppressive governments, sending aid to citizens of oppressive governments, ways to bypass import sanctions (see Iran), and more. Just because you don't have intrinsic use for BTC, doesn't mean others don't (see links below). \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html\n\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amid-protests-bitcoin-gives-nigerians-alternative-to-banking-system-2020-10-19\n\nhttps://asiatimes.com/2020/10/iran-to-use-bitcoin-to-fund-imports/\n\n&gt;Anyone can clone Bitcoin and spin up their own Blockchain, and there are hundreds of altcoins that do things better.\n\nOf course they can and they have, thats the beauty of being open source. However, all of those forks continue to die a slow, painful death. This is like saying anyone can create a better social network than Facebook and therefore Facebook has no value. Just like with Facebook,  network effects are real. BTC is trusted and secure and every day it doesn't die it becomes stronger. \n\n&gt;Best case scenario Bitcoin remains a niche currency used by tech enthusiasts and criminals online. Worst case scenario governments ban it due to usage by criminals, and it's valuation tanks due to inability to buy/sell through an exchange.\n\nWrong. Best case scenario is that BTC continues to be added to the balance sheets of large, publicly traded companies and that small nations continue adopting it until it can no longer be ignored all while second layer solutions continue to be improved upon. This is literally already happening. Its not speculative at this point\n\n&gt;You can say \"what about fiat currency it has no intrinsic use\". It's still legally required to be accepted to settle debts, and is required to pay taxes that are mandated by law. So it has statutory support. Also fiat currency generally isn't an investment besides as a hedge.\n\nAgain BTC does have intrinsic use today and those uses will continue to expand. The genie is out of the bottle at this point and adoption is occurring rapidly.",

Square and MicroStrategy are the two biggest examples.\n\nI believe this trend is just getting started. Time will tell.\n\n&gt;chaos hedge? If there's actual chaos, you need internet and electricity for it to even matter. Actual chaos has neither of those things. The rest of what you said is crypto fan fic.

It's always about it's price in sweet sweet USD after all.\n\nNo no -- right now is most similar to 2016. It was in 2016 when BTC slowly made its way back to its previous ATH of $1K (from $200). It was 2017 when the fireworks started. Those are coming. Interestingly enough 2016-2018 was almost entirely retail investors. Now that institutions are in the mix? Look out.\n\n&gt;oh Jesus Christ. A) there are other ways to avoid hyper inflation than buying bitcoin.\n\nSuch as?\n\n&gt;B) most of the people in those countries don't own bitcoin and won't.\n\nMost don't, plenty do. Who are you to criticize what actions they take to protect themselves and their families?\n\n&gt;If you actually cared about those people you'd probably try to circulate the currency around instead of pretending that the best thing we can all do for the really poor people in hyperinflation countries is to just buy and hold bitcoin.\n\nHow exactly do you plan to do that? Sending them money via Western Union forces them to withdraw in their home currency. The same home currency that devalues itself by the literal minute.\n\nFurthermore, both Venezuela and Nigeria were seizing aid because...central banking! BTC helps to solve this. Also - how do you know I haven't sent small amounts of BTC as aid to both countries. Many people have - thats why its been so helpful!\n\n&gt;Do it for the poor starving kids.

Nobody will use it, ever.\u201d Thomas Edison \n\n&gt;\"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM\n\nThe limited supply and ownership of a digital asset that is secured by a system processing 131,000,000,000,000,000,000 SHA-256 calculations per second on a global scale that has built in governance and economic incentive is powerful. Will it change the world, yes. Will it make everyone who invests rich or poor, who the heck knows :)",

        "body": "&gt; Bitcoin has plenty of intrinsic use. These include borderless transfer without needing to convert to to local currency (cant do this with Western Union), black markets, safe haven from oppressive governments, sending aid to citizens of oppressive governments, ways to bypass import sanctions (see Iran), and more. Just because you don't have intrinsic use for BTC, doesn't mean others don't (see link below).\n\nYou can do this with Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Vertcoin, even Dogecoin. I agree cryptocurrency and blockchains are useful but I don't see Bitcoin as a long term store of value. It's far more volatile than precious metals and also intangible.\n\nIBM is making huge strides towards quantum computing, and once they pull it off, Bitcoin will become worthless once the public/private key cryptography is cracked and anyone with access to a quantum computer can simply sign transactions to send coins to themselves. We're easily within 10 years at this point, possibly less.\n\n&gt;This is like saying anyone can create a better social network than Facebook and therefore Facebook has no value\n\nWhat about Myspace? It came first.\n\n&gt;Wrong. Best case scenario is that BTC continues to be added to the balance sheets of large, publicly traded companies\n\nLike 1 or 2 companies that hold it as a tiny position. I think Overstock and Square? Most companies that accept it just use Bitpay or Coinbase to instantly sell it.",

        "body": "Copy and pasted from another comment, TL;DR I'm staying away:\n\n- First off, the founder/chairman Bruno Wu founded a company a while back called Sun Seven Stars group. There were a couple scandals that the group was related to that was pretty fishy. It didn't originate from them, but some of the people they were doing business with ended up taking a lot of money from investors.\n\n- Wu also has had no clear vision for Ideanomics. It's been a while that I did research on this so I forget some of the paths they took, but I know at one point IDEX used to be in the oil business (lol?). They would be the middle man of selling oil directly from the supplier to the consumer. It failed miserably, so then they got into fintech/blockchain because it was the next big thing (also failed). Now they're in the EV space because, you guessed it, it's the next big thing.\n\n- Ideanomics has cycled through more leadership than I care to count. I don't mind Alf Poor, but he doesn't get me excited to invest in the company.\n\n- Hindenburg Research put an article out on them back in June/July about a few things I mentioned above, but they also targeted the MEG center (glorified EV expo). They claimed that IDEX mislead shareholders into thinking that IDEX owned this entire facility, when in fact they were given permission to use part of it for selling EVs by the Chinese government. I always take everything Hindenburg says with a grain of salt because they are short sellers and looking to profit off stocks selling, but I already knew this. The way Alf and the company explained MEG to the shareholders did make it seem like they owned the entire building and that it was a full fledged operation. Not true\n\n- Speaking again of Hindenburg and MEG, they sent someone to this expo and had them take pictures and ask around about IDEX. They claimed there was no IDEX presence there in their article. IDEX took a very long time to provide any sort of proof that they actually had presence at the MEG center, and it came in the form of an LED sign outside the building that read \"MEG\". Those were probably the most painful weeks any investor has experienced, and I know they lost a TON of trust with people during this time. Imo this is the biggest point, because once you lose trust with someone, it's over.\n\n- From a financial/actual business perspective, their balance sheet was bad at the start of this year, but I will say they did clean it up a little regarding debt (nothing too impressive). The thing that was keeping their share price so high (and is now) is the China EV market. I will admit, there is amazing potential there, and when Alf laid out the PowerPoints with the potential order numbers, I was impressed. I sat on so many virtual conferences with these guys, and I always liked the outlook. However, when actual numbers came in, they were abysmal. The meat of their backlog is the electric bus orders, but as far as I know, none have been filled even to this day.\n\nThere's a lot more but I'll spare the details. It's fine to play the hype train, but from a long term investing perspective, I will never buy and hold IDEX. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",
