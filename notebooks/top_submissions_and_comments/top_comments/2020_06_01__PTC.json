Trade Desk up another 11% today and is now more than 2x since early April. Car sales were considerably better than expected in May (https://www.autoblog.com/2020/06/02/may-2020-us-auto-sales/), which sent Carvana up big yesterday. Security? Okta had a very good quarter the other day, Crowdstrike yesterday. Visa said two days ago that trends continue to improve, Paypal said April was the best month since its IPO.\n\nSome emerging markets tech names doing well. Look at SE +117% YTD. MELI +40%\n\n Google and Facebook suffered from ad spending on things like travel being down (Booking and Expedia spend a fortune on Google ads - Expedia's chairman noted \"\u201cAt Expedia, for instance, we spend $5 billion a year on advertising. We won\u2019t spend $1 billion on advertising probably this year.\" A couple of years ago, Booking spent a billion on Google ads in the quarter (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/05/travel-giant-booking-spent-1-billion-on-google-ads-in-the-quarter.html.) So those companies are uniquely effected, but things have improved as Facebook noted on their conference call. Google may have suspended some spending recently, but they announced the other day that employees who choose to work from home can expense a grand worth of office furniture. https://nypost.com/2020/05/26/google-will-let-workers-expense-1000-worth-of-office-furniture/\n\nWork from home has certainly done well too, but if that becomes a bigger part of culture going forward to some degree, that becomes a long-term theme. Remote work - look at RNG, ZM, FIVN.  Look at telehealth - Teladoc has done well this year but Livongo +145% YTD. Look at CDN names like FSLY, which is +150% YTD/NET +71%",
