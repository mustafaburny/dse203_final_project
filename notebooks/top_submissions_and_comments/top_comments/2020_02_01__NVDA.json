But until it does, you're missing out on the going up part.\n\nWhen this article was written, $TSLA was hovering at or just under $200 (800 now).  $NVDA was at $67 (290 now).  $AMZN was at $1000 (2100 now).  $AAPL was at $163 (325 now).  And the author called the thought of owning these stocks in 2017 \"absurd.\"  \n\nThe list of companies this guy recommended against owning at that time is so far off from what would go on to happen, it almost reads like an article written now that's intentionally designed to look terrible in retrospect.  Imagine quoting an article that told people to get out of TSLA and AMZN in 2017 and using it as an argument for anything.",

Broke one of my rules and didn\u2019t take profits to re-roll (It\u2019s so close to 950! 10% day!) and watched them slowly bleed. Had a small recovery near EOD though with tesla and nvda calls. (Praise NVDA)\n\nI made a goal of $30k by end of Feb. a couple weeks ago on here, so I can\u2019t be mad about hitting that on an 11% day though. Still holding tesla and nvda calls (3/6a and 3/20s) too, as well as the usuals like MSFT and AAPL. New goal is $35k by end of Feb.\n\nThank you for attending my WSB diary.
