Let me tell you\n\nEisenhower: +72%\nObama: +71%\nClinton: +60%\nTrump: +40%\nReagan: +28%\n\nProps to both Obama and Trump, honestly. Obama was president during the 2008 crash and managed +71%. While Trump had to shut down the US economy and managed +40%. \n\nThe whole \"my guy is better than your guy\" shit is fucking retarded.

        "body": "Happens very often. Happened with CVNA last month. I made the following post about it, which mods removed after it gained significant traffic:\n\nPeople have been complaining that this sub has gone to shit in the last several months. There was a post earlier today arguing this, citing a lack of quality DD being posted here since March.\n\nIt is not that there has been a lack of DD posted, but nearly all quality DD gets deleted by the mods. DD on CVNA was posted yesterday only to be removed by mods, while CVNA shot up 30% today. I have seen users post similar comments in the daily threads over the past few months, saying they posted DD that was removed by mods, only for their predictions to have been right. Some of these users posted their DD in the daily thread instead, some didn\u2019t, but I remember many of these comments ended up ringing true.\n\nNow now now, OP, you might say, mods just want quality DD with charts and fundamentals and \u201cInsider Information.\u201d This is why they let fucking VALE and PRPL guys post pump and dumps, leaving such as the few DD that doesn\u2019t get removed. Even though PRPL guy posted numbers that were undeniably false and proven false by the Earnings Call. Mods let these pump and dumps happen.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the real fucking kicker. On the surface those seemed like fine DD to those who didn\u2019t know better. HOWEVER, I, too, posted \u201cDD\u201d on PRPL: /r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3k4lf/ive_had_a_vision_from_god_and_he_showed_the/\n\nMods let me keep my PRPL \u201cDD\u201d up, where I cited \u201cvisions from god\u201d as the reason to buy calls. This got 137 upvotes and nearly 100 comments. It got legitimate traction and attention. So mods definitely saw it. And they let my post tagged as \u201cDD\u201d remain. This completely disrupts the argument that mods want a certain standard of quality DD when my post with 0 fundamentals, analysis, or any legitimate indication or information to stay up.\n\nYou could say that posts like mine are part of the problem. I wouldn\u2019t dispute you. I will say though, that based on how many people have been getting their DD posts deleted, I was sure my post would be deleted, or at least have the flair changed to Shitpost or Satire. I flaired it as DD cuz I thought it was funny, which it was, while fully expecting it to be removed. This proves that the mods left it up to fuel the Purple pump and dump, instead of suppressing what was truly low quality DD. Instead they surppressed DD like CVNA that would have captured many of us with 10 baggers today had they left that DD up instead.\n\nMods here want you to lose and are entirely to blame for the deterioration of this subs quality as a forum to spread useful information to help us make money. I would go as far to argue that, in my eyes, I am becoming convinced that this sub might be being moderated with those with nefarious intentions to leave everyone here holding heavy bags, though we would need more evidence.\n\nTLDR: if mods delete this post you will know they don\u2019t want you to know the truth.",

        "body": "&gt;The risk taking mentality/gambler mentality is CRITICAL to making money. You won't hear this much and it might even be a controversial statement to make but your end goal should be to place a bet on a trade which you know, based on experience, will have a favorable/profitable outcome in the near future. To execute this you need to have the guts and the belief in what you are doing but also very low aversion to risk.\n\nJust to add a counter-opinion. When I first started trading (I have a degree in the field but never had the time to go full day-trader until I was in my mid-20's), I deposited 26K (just for a slight PDT buffer) and made some *huge* plays. Within a week, I had 100k, and I wasn't even risking much of my capital. I was making like 2-3k trades at a time. It was nutty.\n\nI had your mindset and wanted to keep upping the ante and retire, and I fucking blew up my account the next week. Like literally 100k back down to 1k in a few bad days.\n\nSo, personally, I'd recommend the exact opposite. Be super risky in the beginning with money you are okay losing, to try to get out of the trenches. Okay completely gambling with $5k? Go for it, and be completely ok losing it.\n\nIf you get lucky and manage to blow that up to $50k, it's time to pump the brakes, not slam the gas. Keep making your yolo plays, but so many people work 5K to 50K, then yolo 45K on plays because it's \"house money.\" It's not. It's your money, and this is a recipe for eventual disaster.\n\nOnce you work your way up a good bit, lower your % of options in your portfolio. Start trading some stonks. Do some theta gang shit. You already won, so don't blow it. I really wish someone had told me this back then, because I got caught up and carried away and it fucked my up financially for a good while.\n\nI'm not knocking OP or anything, as I'm sure he was making educated trades. But I'm sure that even he knows there was *a lot* of luck here. Even the smartest traders on earth will blow up their account without proper portfolio management. It's literally the most important thing.\n\nThe goal with trading is to win more than you lose, but you will lose some. So if you bet 50% of your portfolio over and over again, it's only a matter of time until a loss kills you.\n\nJust my two cents.",

        "body": "well exactly my reason for posting. to hear what other people think. here are some of my thoughts on the entire situation...\n\n1. the semiconductor impact\nbecause this is such a huge player in the markets at the moment between AMD, NVDA, INTC et al, could effect the entire Tech sector. It all pivots on TMC in Taiwan which makes it tricky.\n2. 3500 US companies are suing Trump for blocking China trade access. which implies US companies want to go to China not stay locked into US.\n3. DCEP Chinese digital currency, not mentioned but could challenge the global dollar in time.\n4. Democrats are going to be more aggressive than Trump towards China. They called him \"Uncle Donald\" at one point. friendly-ish, they likely respect his financial approach even if he is brash. I dont think US will be friendly if Dems get in, and the vibe towards China will get a lot colder and nastier. that is not good if they are losing the global cold trade war, then US will start to play dirty tricks. Hilary would have had us all in a war by now imo. psychopathic woman. maybe she is still pulling strings somewhere. I truly hope not.\n5. Propaganda machine that has been driving Anti-Chinese sentiment for months is working very well and that is a big worry as once China feel even more cornered, they will likely react more aggressively. US are the cause of this whole fiasco, not the Chinese, but we are being sold differently on that narrative because US are dirty war players. history upholds that truth.\n6. China gaining more economic power and US losing it globally would totally change the face of world economy and markets fundamentally to the point it is almost impossible to imagine what that future would look like and one big question - how far would US Government be willing to go to stop that happening? that is scary because historically US Govmt have no limits that they have not been willing to go to before, including killing their own in extremely large numbers.\n\nAnyway, how all that effects trade, we will only really know after the election. I was hoping other peeps might share their wisdom/thoughts here which was my reason for posting.",

Also, it looks like mofos in AMD are doing their best to squeeze every single bit of performance from that new GPU since Cousin Jensen brought some big guns onto table.

They didn\u2019t have to redesign a GPU PCB (3000 series GPUs have weird PCB shape). Making shit that tight is also another cost. They showed a decent 3 fan cooler, just like non-reference cards. So, cost of manufacturing would be way less than Nvidia. So, they can actually sell cheaper.\n\nThen adding the experience they got with 7NM, less voltage and more clock speed (on boost) is a possibility now. Considering twice the size of the die; it gives me threadripper vibes. I think she delayed the announcement just because Jensen did some cheeky play. She wants to hit harder and right now, only way of doing that would be;\n\n1) going for software with drivers (which I think what they\u2019re doing right now)\n2) making some crazy shit like x2 cards they did back in the day.
