However, Samsung's 5nm process is nowhere near the true density of TSMCs process.\n\nMore importantly, TSMC is about to jump to 4nm, and seems to be fully on-track with 3nm for next year. More than anything else, they appear to have an unstoppable *cadence* at the leading edge, which is not the case with any other fab. \n\nFor that reason, I actually agree that it's very possible they're undervalued.",

There is much skepticism on this sub regarding the value of funding early growth at at the expense of fundamentals, due to some large failures in the canadian legalization.   Aurora comes to mind.  IMO Cresco  seems to have a good growth cadence, are not massively diluting, but are focused on getting a national footprint.  Long term(3-5 years) these absolute State license related moats are coming down, and national branding will become the defensible moat against commoditization.

Astra claims they were successful for what they were trying to do. Rocket 3.0 was destroyed in a fire due to a fueling problem, not exactly a good sign but it didn't ever launch and there was no payload on it when it was destroyed. Kemp said that he believed it would take 3 attempts to get to orbit and the 3rd attempt is in a few days.\n\nNeed I remind you that SpaceX failed several times with Falcon 1? Falcon 1 only ever deployed 1 satellite. The first 3 launches were indisputable failures, the Rocket 3.2 launch was more successful than Falcon 1's first 3 launches and was only their 2nd orbital launch. The 3rd Falcon 1 failed because of a single line of bad code and after they fixed it the next launch was a success.\n\nYou could just chill out and wait a few days. It wouldn't kill you. They might succeed.\n\nAs for their business model, I am as skeptical as anyone about their goal to launch every single day but it is not as though the company will go bankrupt if they fail to achieve that target. There is still plenty of room for success. SpaceX spent the first half of the year launching about 3 times per month with a much larger and more expensive rocket, I see no reason Astra could not achieve a weekly launch cadence eventually, especially as more and more companies are getting into space.",

And these guys think they can get the capacity to cover the globe with 5G speeds using a few satellites? And those satellites are going to be able to pickup the signals from 10s of thousands of phones across a large area when it's hard enough to get ground based coverage?? Then there is the massive arrays they want to deploy in space from these satellites, that's a huge engineering challenge alone.\n\nIt gives me Magic Leap vibes, they gained huge investments from big players like Google.

Gelsinger needs to (and I think he is)  identify all the negatives (or current issues they face, including internal bureaucracy) and quickly address the vision on how to rectify these issues. At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction.  Once he does that,  and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal,  he might have the most successful turn around story ever.   I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years.  If successful I'll be rewarded. If not,  another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",

        "body": "While investing in Chinese companies listed on US exchanges you have to remember 3 additional types of risk you are taking on in addition to your normal investment risk.\n\nFirst is fraud risk. Chinese companies arent held to anywhere near the same standard as American companies. As Luckin Coffee showed, new IPOs and smaller Chinese companies can easily get creative with their accounting. While BABA, JD and other mega caps are less likely to suffer from this problem, generally the risks are much higher with Chinese companies than with their American or European equivalents.\n\nSecond, US political risk. The US government is finally waking up to the fact that China has been competing with us in order to supplant us for the last 20-25 years, and is beginning to take action. China's multinational corporations, especially those listed on US exchanges, are the some of the easiest places to apply pressure.\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is political risk from the CCP. The Chinese government can be arbitrary, and political concerns supercede economic ones. They can and will crush certain businesses just to make a point. This is real.\n\nAll that being said, I think sentiment for Chinese stocks is about as low as it can be right now. Short of the CCP nationalizing their largest and most profitable companies, or the US banning chinese stocks from US exchanges or US brokers from dealing with them (both real possibilities, although not the most probably outcomes), I dont think Chinese companies, especially Chinese tech companies, have that much further to fall. Selling here is likely selling near the bottom.",

If any sub should understand a risk to reward ratio, its this one (actually scratch that, this sub abandons all assessments of risk now that I think about it). \n\nBut you have an experimental vaccine that was literally slapped together under Operation Warp Speed, with an uncertain long term health effect, that is already causing seizures, blood clots, irreversible neurological damages, paralysis, and then they tell you it doesnt even protect you from the virus and you still have to wear masks?

Gelsinger needs to (and I think he is)  identify all the negatives (or current issues they face, including internal bureaucracy) and quickly address the vision on how to rectify these issues. At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction.  Once he does that,  and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal,  he might have the most successful turn around story ever.   I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years.  If successful I'll be rewarded. If not,  another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",

        "body": "While investing in Chinese companies listed on US exchanges you have to remember 3 additional types of risk you are taking on in addition to your normal investment risk.\n\nFirst is fraud risk. Chinese companies arent held to anywhere near the same standard as American companies. As Luckin Coffee showed, new IPOs and smaller Chinese companies can easily get creative with their accounting. While BABA, JD and other mega caps are less likely to suffer from this problem, generally the risks are much higher with Chinese companies than with their American or European equivalents.\n\nSecond, US political risk. The US government is finally waking up to the fact that China has been competing with us in order to supplant us for the last 20-25 years, and is beginning to take action. China's multinational corporations, especially those listed on US exchanges, are the some of the easiest places to apply pressure.\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is political risk from the CCP. The Chinese government can be arbitrary, and political concerns supercede economic ones. They can and will crush certain businesses just to make a point. This is real.\n\nAll that being said, I think sentiment for Chinese stocks is about as low as it can be right now. Short of the CCP nationalizing their largest and most profitable companies, or the US banning chinese stocks from US exchanges or US brokers from dealing with them (both real possibilities, although not the most probably outcomes), I dont think Chinese companies, especially Chinese tech companies, have that much further to fall. Selling here is likely selling near the bottom.",

It's basically bidding for a contract from what I understand.

Same with Apple, Amazon, etc. So I kinda disagree that it makes business sense because it doesn\u2019t help just institutions it really helps everyone given that MSFT is also probably on every other ETF and Index fund. \n\nI find it more troubling when it is a smaller stock that not everyone owns. I remember earlier this year I think it was Morgan Stanley, late in 2020 they release a sell rating for PLTR and then earlier this year they raised the PT for PLTR and later I saw that they started buying PLTR a month before the PT was released. So I think if it is a smaller stock that it is not \u201cwell known\u201d I definitely would call that helping and pushing their BS",
