However, Samsung's 5nm process is nowhere near the true density of TSMCs process.\n\nMore importantly, TSMC is about to jump to 4nm, and seems to be fully on-track with 3nm for next year. More than anything else, they appear to have an unstoppable *cadence* at the leading edge, which is not the case with any other fab. \n\nFor that reason, I actually agree that it's very possible they're undervalued.",

You really can't compare Cresco directly to Trulieve before they merge with Harvest, and even then Trulieve started out owning three large FL greenhouses, and lions share of profits are in FL.   There is much skepticism on this sub regarding the value of funding early growth at at the expense of fundamentals, due to some large failures in the canadian legalization.   Aurora comes to mind.  IMO Cresco  seems to have a good growth cadence, are not massively diluting, but are focused on getting a national footprint.  Long term(3-5 years) these absolute State license related moats are coming down, and national branding will become the defensible moat against commoditization. I've been adding to Trulieve position since they acquired Harv, but will still have twice as much Cresco until I see two quarters of joint Tru/Harv quarterlies to decide if Trulieve can compete as well in states with stronger competition.",

        "body": "The Rocket 1.0 and Rocket 2.0 launches were suborbital test flights, they were never intended to make orbit and didn't even have second stages. Astra claims they were successful for what they were trying to do. Rocket 3.0 was destroyed in a fire due to a fueling problem, not exactly a good sign but it didn't ever launch and there was no payload on it when it was destroyed. Kemp said that he believed it would take 3 attempts to get to orbit and the 3rd attempt is in a few days.\n\nNeed I remind you that SpaceX failed several times with Falcon 1? Falcon 1 only ever deployed 1 satellite. The first 3 launches were indisputable failures, the Rocket 3.2 launch was more successful than Falcon 1's first 3 launches and was only their 2nd orbital launch. The 3rd Falcon 1 failed because of a single line of bad code and after they fixed it the next launch was a success.\n\nYou could just chill out and wait a few days. It wouldn't kill you. They might succeed.\n\nAs for their business model, I am as skeptical as anyone about their goal to launch every single day but it is not as though the company will go bankrupt if they fail to achieve that target. There is still plenty of room for success. SpaceX spent the first half of the year launching about 3 times per month with a much larger and more expensive rocket, I see no reason Astra could not achieve a weekly launch cadence eventually, especially as more and more companies are getting into space.",

Competition, but they are the front runner in the new group of launch companies.

It's 2021, people don't like waste.\n\n**ASTS** (Had a position pre-merger, had some hype so figured it would take the fairly common spac pattern of the moment and go up a bit then go down a larger bit. Sold on the up.)\n\nDoesn't pass the sniff test for me. \n\nFor years everything I've heard about 5G has been that there will be more towers (higher tower density) needed for coverage (I may be out of date on this?). And these guys think they can get the capacity to cover the globe with 5G speeds using a few satellites? And those satellites are going to be able to pickup the signals from 10s of thousands of phones across a large area when it's hard enough to get ground based coverage?? Then there is the massive arrays they want to deploy in space from these satellites, that's a huge engineering challenge alone.\n\nIt gives me Magic Leap vibes, they gained huge investments from big players like Google.
