        "body": "Come on man, you still aren't counting any costs or using any facts. \n\nOkay, I got some time and this is pretty simple, so here's some actual math. I don't think facts will change your mind, but maybe OP or someone else reading this will learn something.\n\n* You state $1400-$1800 in rent revenue. /u/kileek states that this would either be an undesireable condo or small, but I looked up actual condos for sale in Victoria, and found [this one](https://www.point2homes.com/CA/Condo-For-Sale/BC/Victoria/James-Bay/500-Oswego-St/82583898.html) for $300,000, so I'll use this as a comparison. It's pretty nice, but it's a 545 sq ft 1 bed 1 bath. I found several similar apartments, pretty close to that condo, renting for $1175-$1695 ([here](https://www.kijiji.ca/v-apartments-condos/victoria-bc/bachelor-available-at-1039-view-street-victoria/1480133121), [here](https://www.kijiji.ca/v-apartments-condos/victoria-bc/rockland-1-bdrm-2nd-floor-corner/1480132252), [here](https://www.kijiji.ca/v-apartments-condos/victoria-bc/1-bdrm-available-at-976-humboldt-street-victoria/1480133124), [here](https://rentals.ca/victoria?types=condo&amp;beds=1%2B&amp;active-listing-id=293490)). The $1695 one looks nicer to me, so let's use $1600 for rent (halfway in your range so I think that's fair).\n* 20% down payment and 30 year amortization, variable rate mortgage (at 2.65%) is actually a $965/month payment. Use the mortgage calculator here:  [https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-payment-calculator](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-payment-calculator) \n* That building lists its condo fees as $459/mo.\n* Assuming the tax assessment is also $300,000, the property taxes are $1500 a year, or $125/mo. Property tax estimator here:  [https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/residents/property-taxes/estimator.html](https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/residents/property-taxes/estimator.html) \n* You probably want some insurance eh? If you google [condo insurance Victoria](https://www.google.com/search?q=insurance+cost+victoria+condos&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA767CA767&amp;oq=insurance+cost+victoria+condos&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33.6547j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), the ads suggest it will be $40/mo. \n* Most rules of thumb say to try and save 1% of the value for maintenance, but the condo fees do a lot of the heavy lifting here. Let's say OP needs to save 0.25% for maintenance, that's $62.50 a month. \n* If you looked closely at the $1695/month apartment up there, you'll notice that actually included water and cable costs. Is OP going to pay those? [Water bills are $128/month](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/in-victoria-less-is-more-when-it-comes-to-paying-for-water/article1215390/), so let's hope not (even though a lot of those Victoria apartments do include water in the rent).\n\nLet's only count those costs okay? Even though there are obviously more costs (and we didn't count lower fees or anything to close the sale).\n\nSo we rent it for $1600, and our costs are actually $1651.50, so there is actually negative cash profit for OP. But you're building equity, you'll rightly say. You're right, your mortgage payments are paying roughly $450 of principal every month. So this property actually \"profits\" $400/month, even though there is no cash for OP. \n\nWhat could OP get with just margin? First some facts\n\n* XRE paid $0.81 per unit of distributions in 2019 ([source](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/individual/en/products/239843/ishares-sptsx-capped-reit-index-etf#distributionsDialog)).\n* Current market price $19.49.\n* [Interactive Brokers' margin rate is 2.25%](https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/index.php?f=45266) using OP's $60,000 down payment as an account cash contribution.\n* [IB requires you to put up 50% of the value](https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/index.php?f=202&amp;p=stk) (so you can only use margin to pay for half).\n\nOP's $60,000 means they can buy $120,000 of XRE. That investment would bring in $4987.17 a year, minus $1350/yr in interest, means OP actually takes home $3337.17 a year in cash, or $278.10 a month (compared to the condo's cash flow of -$51.50). \n\nAs you can see, OP does not make \"literally twice as much\" with the condo, and he doesn't have a dime of cash flow. Yes, if you are counting the mortgage paydown as profit (which it is), the condo does make a bit more, but it isn't close to twice as much. \n\nIf any of my numbers are wrong, I'd be happy to hear how. None of the numbers you've stated other than rent have even been close.",

        "body": "Not much.  I would say American Express is the closest you will find.  Visa and MasterCard are toll roads who make money off of every transaction.  AmEx is exposed to credit risk while Visa and MasterCard are not.  But since they collect data from both the customer and merchant side they can market more individualized products.  AmEx customers also tend to spend more.",

If I'm Apple and I can get a tiny piece of every Apple Pay transaction without having to build the rails (which would come at enormous cost) or having to face the regulatory scrutiny that a financial entity like V/MA do, not a bad deal for Apple. None of these tech companies wants to be a financial company and then face regulatory scrutiny like one.",
