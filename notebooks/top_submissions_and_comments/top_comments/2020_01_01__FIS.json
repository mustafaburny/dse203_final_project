        "body": "Strictly as a broker:\n\n1. Fidelity is the best all round broker by a small margin because you get cash on your sweep account without having to manually move into money market. Vanguard also pays cash (more than Fidelity) on their sweep accounts but Vanguard is lacking in the technology department as far as their app and web platform so I prefer Fidelity.\n2. Most of the other brokers don't really have enough differentiating factors in my opinion to say one is \"better\" than another. Vanguard is great, but their technology is lacking. Between the others, they all have easy to use apps and websites. Etrade, Schwab, and Ally tend to have the better website platforms and highly rated Android and iPhone apps. IBKR and possibly TD Ameritrade are good for advanced traders. If you don't go with fidelity, I would literally just choose based on which app or web platform you like the most.\n\nBroker plus other banking services:\n\n* The Fidelity rewards 2% cashback credit card is good enough to serve as a primary credit card. For this reason, combining your broker and credit card platform both at Fidelity for simplicity is a good option. Fidelity also offers a checking account with fee free/reimbursed ATM usage but their checking account platform is not as good as Schwab or BoA.\n* Schwab is a great all round broker. Although they do not pay cash on sweep accounts, their easy to use and fee free/reimbursed checking accounts make up for it. I personally use Schwab for brokerage and checking (and an Amex credit card).\n* Ally Invest should be way more popular than it is. Their saving account rates speak for themselves so combining Ally savings/checking/brokerage accounts is a win win win situation. Their web platform for brokerage is also excellent and might be my favorite overall. They also have a large ATM network and will reimburse up to $10 in ATM fees per month.\n* Etrade offers a checking account with unlimited free ATM usage and fee reimbursement and a competitive rate Savings account. Etrade's offerings are very similar to Ally Invest in my opinion. I don't know how one would choose between the two except that I like Ally's website and app more. With things changing so quickly at brokers right now, I'm not sure that Ally Invest, or especially Etrade, are sustainable. I could see Etrade being acquired very soon. This is another reason why I stick with Schwab.\n* Merrill Edge combined with their Preferred Rewards program is excellent and if you have enough assets with them you get up to 5.25% cash back on a no annual fee credit card for a category of your choice, 3.5% cash back on groceries, and 1.75% cashback on everything else. You really can't beat this. If you have enough assets with BoA/Merrile Edge, you also get unlimited ATM fee free/reimbursed.\n* Chase YouInvest is a decent platform but it feels really new and not fully fleshed out. They only added options trading a few months ago I believe and they definitely have the most basic platform being only a couple notches above Robinhood as far as features which can be a good and bad thing since it is pretty simple to use. Now that they have options trading, I would recommend Chase YouInvest, especially if you are going to combine your assets at Chase. Like BoA Merrill Edge, you have to have a certain amount of assets with Chase to get fee free ATM usage with reimbursement.\n* TD Ameritrade is a great brokers with nothing much to offer by way of banking features or their own investment products. Because of this I am not surprised that TD was acquired. They have an advanced trading platform but I'm not sure that it's worth it since they have below average app reviews on Android. I basically use my phone for everything and so the app is really important to me. For these reasons TD Ameritrade didn't really stand out to me.\n\n\\*\\*One other caveat....if you trade inverse and leveraged ETFs such as UVXY or TQQQ, respectively, certain brokers do not allow trading of these securities. Vanguard and Chase do not allow trading of either. Merrill Edge does not allow trading of inverse ETFs. If not for this I would probably be with Merrill Edge in order to get the 5.25% cashback credit card or Chase to utilize their credit cards and checking account. I know Fidelity and Schwab allow trading of either leveraged or inverse ETFs, but I am not sure about the other brokers.\n\n\\*\\*\\*I have personally used Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, and Chase YouInvest extensively. I have experimented with Merrill Edge, Ally Invest, and Etrade.",

        "body": "You DO have to be a Fidelity client to get this, go to their website directly to sign up, and they can do it because they are the biggest mutual fund provider, they want your funds under management (presumably to sell you something else that actually has costs later) and this fund 'cuts corners' that other index funds do not.\n\nI will discuss the corner cutting, since you seem interested. This fund does not licence an official S&amp;P index as a benchmark for what is in the fund, as many other index funds do. This means that the stocks are a 'generic' self made index, and not an official index made by a third party. As you can imagine, I don't really care for officially licenced crap, and I just want the performance of a broad index of stocks, and not some name brand on the prospectus. A second corner they cut is they have less stocks than a 'marque' index fund would have. For example, Vanguard's total stock market index fund has about 3400 stocks, while this no cost fund has about 2000. This means that the no cost fund is somewhat less diversified, but I personally feel that owning those tiniest of stocks is not important enough to pay a fee for. Another corner cut is the dividends are only paid out once a year. This makes it easier for the fund to pay out to people who sell, without the fund selling stocks and generating taxes, but you have to wait for income until the end of the year, while other funds pay every 3 months. While I do like income, I really invest for growth, so I can live with this compromise. Also, they will send you very little paperwork, besides tax forms, so you will have to check online, to see your status. I prefer paper mailings, but in the end, it is a cost to them, so I understand not getting a monthly update every month. You should consider these limitations, and if you don't want to do this, Vanguard has a very good total stock market index fund (VTSAX, $3000 minimum) without compromise, for about 0.04 % per year in fees, which is $ 4 per $10,000 invested per year, so not that significant a cost difference, at least with low balances. Also, you can get that vanguard fund as an ETF under the symbol VTI, which lets you trade it like a stock, through any brokerage, and not have to be a vanguard customer.",

        "body": "A few thoughts on Fidelity vs Schwab, which I agree are likely the best choices for most people. I've used and continue to use both, but I lean towards Fidelity personally.\n\n1)  Fidelity has a few benefits over Schwab, for an all around financial supermarket.  \n\na) ATM rebates on the Cash Management Account are next business day, same day the ATM withdrawal fully processes. Schwab is at month end.  \n\nb) Fidelity does have a 1% foreign transaction fee listed on their Visa Debit ATM card, but both personal experience in dozens of countries and many reports online are that there is no fee on cash withdrawals at ATMs, only on Visa purchases. So for domestic use or for foreign cash withdrawal use, it's just as good as Schwab Bank Visa Debit, maybe better because of the next-day rebate.\n\nc) Both firms are essentially $1 minimum for investments in own-brand mutual funds, both index and active for Fido (mostly $1 for index, $100 for active Schwab funds.) So really easy to get started. But when Fidelity got rid of minimums on their own mutual funds, they also got rid of minimums for monthly automatic  investing in them. When Schwab reduced minimum fund investments to $1 for the initial investment, they still kept the monthly automatic investment minimum as $100. So at Fidelity you can do, for example, a total of $70 allocated to two funds or three funds (or even less) as a fully automated monthly investment from your bank. At Schwab, you can't even do one fund on an automatic investment for that amount, it would have to be $100 per fund. Even for the $1 minimum funds. \n\nBoth are still way better than Vanguard's $3000 minimum investment for most of their mutual funds ($1000 for target date funds.)\n\nd) Fidelity has better CD laddering tools for brokered CDs than Schwab. Fidelity also has the same $1 per $1000 bond (which includes secondary brokered CDs) commission, but does not have Schwab's 10-bond (so $10) minimum commission. \n\ne) Last time I compared, Fidelity had more advanced order types such as trailing limits by both $ or %, and bracketing buy/sell ranges, which they call \"Trade Armor\", right on their web interface, than does Schwab. You can do that with Schwab's Streetsmart desktop trading tool but that's more complicated.\n\nf) Any Fidelity-branded Money Market Fund in your non-retirement Fidelity account (trading or CMA), even if not your sweep fund, is immediately available as same-day available to withdraw, cover checks, debits, or ATM use (and in most cases, purchases) without having to sell the fund and wait till the next business day for it to be available. Further, the total of you cash, sweep fund, and purchased Fidelity money market funds in your trading account can be linked to be overflow immediately available cash in the Cash Management Account. Schwab doesn't have anything like that - Schwab MMFs tend to pay a basis point or two more than equivalent Fidelity ones, but you have to manually buy them, and manually sell them and wait till next day for the proceeds to be available to withdraw, and then transfer it to Schwab Bank to use on the ATM Debit card. \n\n2) Schwab has a few benefits over Fidelity for an all-around financial supermarket.\n\na) ATM Visa Debit Card is totally no-fee, even for purchases. And that's true both for the Schwab Bank Visa Debit card and the separate and issued only on-request Schwab Brokerage Account Visa Debit Card. At Fidelity the free unlimited ATM rebates are only on the Visa Debit Card issued on the Cash Management Account. If you want only the main trading \"Fidelity Account\" or want both, and want a card on the trading account, that is not free ATM rebates unless you are a high-net-worth private client or do a lot of paid trades. \n\nb) Customer service is good to excellent at both firms, and all US based, 24/7/365, but in my experience I think Schwab is a tiny bit better. \n\nc) Despite the lack of full integration between Schwab Brokerage and Schwab Bank for instant use and same day setttlement of MMFs, it's still all run by Schwab, so no chance of finger-pointing or handoff to another firm's support. \n\nThat's not the case at Fidelity, where the often mis-named on Reddit \"bank\" (the CMA) is really a limited, checking-specific but legally brokerage account. Entirely managed by Fidelity in terms of you can't directly talk to the other banks involved, but there are up to about 20-25 outside banks really handling different parts of operating the checking account function. PNC Mellon Bank runs the actual Visa Debit Card portion. UMB Bank runs the check clearing and routing number for direct deposit/debit part of the account. Up to 4 outside banks out of a total at any time of around 20, hold your cash once it's been in Fidelity overnight. \n\nAt Schwab, all of that is Schwab Bank, or the other Schwab-owned bank they bought in 2018, or Schwab Brokerage. All part of the Charles Schwab Corporation. The only part outsourced is BillPay, which is done by CheckFree, just like almost ever other bank, credit union, and brokerage (including Fidelity.)\n\nI've rarely had support issues on either the Fidelity CMA checking or the Fidelity CMA Visa Debit, but when I have, and called Fidelity, I had to be transferred to the Fidelity checking (UMB) or Fidelity Debit Card (PNC) support teams. During business hours they answer as \"Fidelity (name of service)\" but one time on a weekend when an ATM transaction failed to give me money but debited it, I called and got the \"PNC Bank Card Services\" weekend support where the firstline rep didn't understand that I did not have a PNC account number and it was a Fidelity account. Still got it resolved but it was a bit of a hassle and a risk.",

You said you like to use your phone for trading, and I know Vanguard gets a lot of complaints about their outdated website and app, so maybe a switch is right for you.\n\nI personally use Fidelity because they offer the credit card with 2 percent cash back, 24/7 client services (I'm a 3rd shift worker), their website is top-of-the-line, and they always solve any issues I am having.  A lot of people are jumping to Fidelity because they offer slightly cheaper index funds than Vanguard, but that really does not factor for me.  At this point, they're all so cheap that we're talking about nickles and dimes.\n\nAt the same time, if I had a friend who did not know a lot about investing, I would send him to Vanguard...either using a Target date fund or their Robo Advisor with a human contact.  Their advisory services are less expensive than Fidelity or Schwab, and they are not going to trip you up with any high fee funds and services that you might find at their competition if you are not paying attention.  A great example of this would be the target date funds at Fidelity.  Look at the expense ratio differences in the Fidelity Freedom funds and the Fidelity Freedom Index funds.  Vanguard just offers the low cost, better version.  Vanguard is very straight forward, simple, and almost boring.  That is how investing should be.\n\nVanguard actively managed funds are also cheaper and VDIGX would very appealing to me.   Their money market also has a higher return.  Schwab's money market return is almost laughable.",

However if you want to buy specific bonds then yes Fidelity or Schwb may be your best bet however not all bonds are really tradable\n\nMeaning when muni bonds go on auction sometimes the minimum bid is 100k+, and possibly the secondary market just isn't there because no one is selling or there are too few sellers its just not worth to list them.\n\nAlso on fidelity and schwab they kind of hide a lot of bonds lower than a AA, mostly because lots of people are ignorant on bonds and think bonds=safe then might see a bond paying 10% interest and think thats a safe way to earn 10% (not realizing its rating is like CCC)\n\nEDIT\n\nIf you tell me the bond I can see if schwab has it",
