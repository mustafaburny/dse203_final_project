WELL is another stock I've been wanting to look more into myself. \n\nMSFT, JNJ and WMT or MCD might be some stocks to look into. They all offer decent growth and good dividends (well, MSFT's dividend is good compared to other tech companies). Other than that adding to your existing positions is a good move too.\n\nRegarding more speculative long term risk, if TSLA drops again it might be worth considering. Not sure what other companies I'd put in that same category. Airlines/Hotels/Casinos are a riskier play and have potential to bounce back over the next few years but they aren't industries I'd want to hold long term personally.",

Aka the bubble as some call it. Here are some interesting stocks that are going through even more interesting times:\n\n-\tJNJ Good stock, safe ship.\n-\tMCD Not about the burgers, it\u2019s a play on real estate.\n-\tDIS Some fairly large brands, Star Wars, ESPN, Disney itself, more likely to become bigger than smaller.\n-\t3M &amp; CAT Necessary stuff.\n-\tXOM Most competitors seem on the cusp of bankruptcy, long term good. Maybe wait for a cut, or not.\n-\tBRK.B Not a dividend payer ... yet.",
