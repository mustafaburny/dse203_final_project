They belong in your retirement account and you check on them a few times per year.\n\nIf your source of income comes from working, you should be dedicating a portion of your paycheck to your retirement account - and a portion to your YOLO account.\n\nAs money shows up in your YOLO account, you light that fuse and pray for it to be a bottle rocket. If it explodes in your face, you wait until next payday. If it's a bottle rocket - you send 75% of those profits off to pasture (i.e. lock it up in a retirement account). The other 25% is a bonus bet you get to make, instead of having to wait for another paycheck.\n\nYou want to be playing with underlyings that are just stupid, volatile and wild. Super high IV when it's not earnings time. The ones that just make no sense, and they're swinging up and down violently every day. The more drama, the better. If you were betting on a horse, you don't want the big stud horse that everyone is betting on because the payout sucks. You want the horse that stopped in the middle of the last race to eat the shit on the ground from the horses in front of it. The one that has tourette syndrome. You want... the [Becky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFs9jLN4siQ&amp;ab_channel=dnasewell) version of a horse. You will have no damn clue where it's going, but it's going somewhere - and fast. It's the unexpected move.\n\nWhen you buy that cheap OTM, and Becky happens to pop off while she's carrying you in Geralds bucket - you're turning that $100 into $10k. Risk $100 to make $10k? Fuck yes, all day long. Except, you can't do it with just any stock. It needs to be a Becky stock. (Can someone make me a meme of this, please?) How do you find Becky stocks?
