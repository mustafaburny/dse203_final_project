But Apple, GM, etc. US companies have operations in China. Some, like Amphenol, might even have more employees in China than in the US. But I don't think Microvast would be de-listed.\n\nmore importantly, Trump is out within January. Even if THCB signs a deal by then,  and even if it somehow delisted companies like Apple (no way!) or otherwise affected Microvast, then they could just complete the merger/DeSPAC after Biden is in office once that is rolled back or challenged by courts.",

I agree with your point, if you go to a recreational MJ dispensary in Canada all products are sorted by brands and most people wouldn't know which company Riff or San Rafael belong too. It seems they want to built household awareness plus alternative revenue right now and roll out THC/CBD type products later on as market conditions allow. \n\nYou can look at slides 25-27 in the APH 2020 AGM Presentation for proof of concept of their product line brands on SW cans. Not sure if this will be allowed in Canada, hoping they can circumvent the cannabis advertising rules until they change to match alcohol advertising. I trust their marketing is continually seeing how far they can push the rules, like how online poker sites use a .net vs .com domain.  \n[https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Aphria-Inc.-November-2020-AGM-Presentation-FINAL.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Aphria-Inc.-November-2020-AGM-Presentation-FINAL.pdf)",

They made the account change without any notice, and after being down like 80% on my puts, bad news hit GM and I was only down like 30% and couldn't close the position because my options level was no longer sufficient. By the next day the stock had recovered and I missed my window to close thanks to my broker fucking me when I needed to sell, which seems to be disturbingly common.\n\nI remember calling them and telling them I wanted a broker, not a babysitter. The dude sounded completely annoyed like he was my dad and doing me a favor. He wasn't wrong in hindsight. I was like a chimp with a machine gun back then. I'm better now. But damn...let the monkey shoot his load if he wants.\n\nFidelity isn't a bad broker. But they're like strict parents. They're not quick to trust or forgiving if you throw a party and their risk department flags you as a retard. TD is like your friend's cool parents who don't really give a fuck. And Robinhood is the skeevy guy outside the liquor store selling fake IDs. That guy will hook you up with whatever you want. He's cool, but not really a friend.

If you are buying TSLA now you are up for a hard reckoning.\n\n\"At a time like this, when our stock is reaching new highs, it may seem as though spending carefully is not as important. This is definitely not true.\n\nWhen looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that\u2019s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl\u00e9 under a sledgehammer!\n\nMuch more important, in order to make our cars affordable, we have to get smarter about how we spend money. This a tough Game of Pennies \u2013 requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost, a factory process or simply the design, while increasing quality and capabilities. A great idea would be on that saves $5, but the vast majority are 50 cents here or 20 cents there.\n\nIn order to make the electric revolution happen we much make electric cars, stationary batteries and solar affordable to all.\n\nThanks and great working with you as always,\nElon\"",
