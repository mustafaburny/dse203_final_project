But Apple, GM, etc. US companies have operations in China. Some, like Amphenol, might even have more employees in China than in the US. But I don't think Microvast would be de-listed.\n\nmore importantly, Trump is out within January. Even if THCB signs a deal by then,  and even if it somehow delisted companies like Apple (no way!) or otherwise affected Microvast, then they could just complete the merger/DeSPAC after Biden is in office once that is rolled back or challenged by courts.",

I agree with your point, if you go to a recreational MJ dispensary in Canada all products are sorted by brands and most people wouldn't know which company Riff or San Rafael belong too. It seems they want to built household awareness plus alternative revenue right now and roll out THC/CBD type products later on as market conditions allow. \n\nYou can look at slides 25-27 in the APH 2020 AGM Presentation for proof of concept of their product line brands on SW cans. Not sure if this will be allowed in Canada, hoping they can circumvent the cannabis advertising rules until they change to match alcohol advertising. I trust their marketing is continually seeing how far they can push the rules, like how online poker sites use a .net vs .com domain.  \n[https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Aphria-Inc.-November-2020-AGM-Presentation-FINAL.pdf](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Aphria-Inc.-November-2020-AGM-Presentation-FINAL.pdf)",
