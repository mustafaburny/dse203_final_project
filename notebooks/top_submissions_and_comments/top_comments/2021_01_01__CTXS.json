As soon as I heard that she got caught with inside tips, and I looked up which companies she dropped right away and which companies she bought, and I am so confused. She didnt make anything at all. Seriously. She lost tons of money. The ones she sold did well and the ones she bought tanked. I dont understand. So if anyone has some insight I am all ears.",

WE HAVE TO BRING BB UP. WE WILL SEE BB TO $300 per SHARE. Let\u2019s say 300... in 100 days. that is our motto. LETS DO IT! MY FELLOW SOLDIERS!
