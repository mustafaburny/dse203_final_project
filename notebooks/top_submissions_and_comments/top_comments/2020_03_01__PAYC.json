They recently froze their dividend while they increased cash on hand to pay for infrastructure upgrades/5g rollout. The dividend freeze caused the stockprice to crater... then it further fell as we entered this bear market.\n\nLongterm, although their margins are low I see a healthy company with a very strong balance sheet and a market that's not going anywhere. I'm looking to buy 2022 leaps once we fall into the 2.25-2.50 range.\n\nI'd like to increase my positions in AMZN, TSM, T, PAYC, MSFT as well but not until their valuations fall back down to earth. All five are good companies with strong growth potential longterm, but valuations that are just absolutely insane.",

In the end, an 80/20 spy or VTI / VGLT would have yielded better returns on a 2,3, and 4 year basis. I have some big gains in msft, paycom, dis before selling, adbe and some others. But for all those big gains there was stupid losses or not holding onto winners. Those big gains feel awesome and I focus on them, but the reality is, over a long period of time I pretty much am equal to an 80'20 with a ton more risk.",

Depending on how long this situation lasts, I don't think the market is wrong there.\n\nSoftware varies - some things have been rather resilient (COUP) and some things have not. It really depends on how critical aspects of the software are. If a lot of businesses are distressed they may drop non-essential software and/or sales teams aren't meeting with clients, etc. I do think there's a lot of SaaS names that are long-term compelling growth stories that are down but it's not unexpected. \n\nTWLO I wouldn't touch, ESTC has been a disappointment. \n\nPAYC, RNG, PLAN, AVLR, CRM, MSFT, COUP (although that's already bounced significantly), MDB, ADBE, AYX are fine long-term options IMO, as well as a few others.",
