        "body": "For me the 3 companies I regret not investing in was Microsoft, Monster Energy and ethereum (not exactly a company I know).\n\n \n\nMicrosoft:\n\nIn 2005 I discovered the stock market for the first time at 16 and I wanted to invest but back then I thought investing was super risky, basically gambling like playing slots... Anyway I had \u00a3500 that I had got from my family for getting certain grades at school and after looking at a list of companies I decided I was going to invest in Microsoft only to discover that I wasn't old enough to open an account.\n\nA year later and by the time I was old enough I had completely forgotten all about it and had blown the money on clothes, a swanky new Motorola Razr and other assorted material goods.\n\n \n\nMonster Energy:\n\nThen I got my first job in 2007 after finishing my A-Levels and by late 2008 I had a few thousand in savings. The housing crash had really started kicking in and everyone was terrified the world was ending so I had about \u00a32000 in savings but was terrified to invest in the stock market. Nevertheless my curiosity made me look into what things were looking like and again I was looking at a bunch of companies and remember looking back at Microsoft thinking \"wow I'm so glad I didn't invest in Microsoft back in 2005 \" as it was currently down about 30% from when I was going to invest in 2005.\n\nAs a huge Monster Energy drinker back then, that was one of the companies I looked at and had it not been for the huge crash, I probably would have bought in just because I enjoyed the beverage...\n\n \n\nEthereum:\n\nThe next 8 years or so it never occurred to me to think about investing again and so I just spent money like it was going out of fashion until I quit my job and decided to look for a new career. I decided upon programming (never stuck with it) and somehow I remember stumbling onto bitcoin on a programming forum. I first heard about bitcoin back when it was selling for a dollar but I literally thought it was some scammy game currency people were selling like runscape gold so I didn't do any research into it at all.\n\nAnyways I decided to check the price and my mind was blown... $250 bitcoin, like what the fuck! Of course this got me very interest until I heard about Mt Gox and it was crashing so thought the scam was over. I came into contact with Ethereum, which at the time had just ICO'd and was about $2 but I was still sceptical, if bitcoin was a scam, then surely the thing copying bitcoin is a scam... right?\n\nI was uneducated at the time and didn't know much about any of this stuff. I watched ethereum on and off and watched it \"crash\" from $2 to $0.40 and was very smug that I didn't fall for the scam... Again I had forgotten about it completely until a few years later and long story short, I fomo'd into ethereum at $250 in 2017 after doing a lot of research, I rode the wave all the way up to $1400, didn't take any profit, ended up selling at $250 in 2018... It took me 12 years to pluck up the courage to invest in something since first discovering investing and it was a damn cryptocurrency \ud83e\udd74\n\n \n\nBut if I did invest in Microsoft, Monster and Ethereum and held my positions, to this day I'd have:\n\nMicorsoft: \u00a3500 @ ~$25 = \u00a33,200 (560%)\n\nMonster Energy: \u00a32000 @ ~$4 = \u00a330,600 (1404%)\n\nEthereum: (probably would have only invested \u00a3100 or so) @ $2 = \u00a37613 (7513%).\n\n \n\nSo what stories do you have?",

Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

The only top of the mind thoughts I had are:\n\nGo with individual stocks if you enjoy stock picking, you can index in your 401k and ESOP.\n-drop oracle from the list\n- add AYX and possibly ANET to your tech list, everything else on there looks great.\n- I like higher growth names in healthcare as well, LVGO, GH, HQY come to mind as all long term plays (I also own Illumina, watching NVTA but don\u2019t love it)\n- PINS and SFIX seem to have a lot of upside from current levels as well, (SFIX popped pop my radar due to incredible amounts of insider buying). \n\nHope this gives you some decent ideas, either approach seems well thought out and would work fine.  I guess it depends on how much time you want to dedicate to it and how much you enjoy stock picking.",

Similar as it is in the world of investing in mutual funds/ETFs in a 401k/IRA (diversify and avoid pricey managed load-fee funds) there is such a thing as diversifying in options trades (not all-in on SPY or SPY and QQQ, place only small % on a position, include a contrarian position, don't overpay, always keep sufficient \"dry powder\"/cash equity that allows for repositioning in trades you believe in but market moved against in near term, have plan when to enter/exit before making a trade, don't get emotional, cut losses sooner rather than later, etc).  \n\nYou know you're in trouble if this applies:  \n\n\\--&gt; If you catch yourself using the word \u201chope\u201d.

Right before the first discovery of the books being cooked we had recommended he take $10 mm of his company stock and do a Charitable Remainder Trust.  I forgot exactly what his lifetime income would have been....like half a million a year.  He declined and so he lost about $70 mm when the stock tanked.   They moved the hdqtrs to Colorado from Silicon Valley and somehow clawed their way back to profitability and a high stock price.  The second time I met with the client we recommended a $5 mm CRT again to lock in some diversification and life time income as well as generate some tax deduction so he could sell some of his low basis company stock.  Again he declined.  The second time he lost nearly all of what was that time about $60 mm of stock.  Brilliant people don't always make the best decisions.",

The hedge of the space.\n\nEth: Most promising and popular platform for innovation, moving to proof-of-stake meaning improvements to efficiency and it's got a better 'at scale' thanks to the addition of layer 2 development on top.\n\nChainlink: 'The' Oracle network. This requires a bit of technical knowledge to understand, but this network works in conjunction with other types of DLTs. It solves the biggest problem of smart contract technology. Essentially it lets DLT applications make API calls to external systems (the web). I'm most bullish on this by far.\n\nIOTA: an outlier, a potential game changer. A more exploratory type of network that uses DAG tech which could ultimately be the fastest and cheapest per transaction. The team has made great progress and this tech has the potential to disrupt the rest, but their scope of work and vision is massive.",

Bought calls based on the following factors starting with the recent NBA deal and would advice you buy calls expiring in August or Sep since you will have time to hedge if anything goes sideways next week.\n\n [https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/04/16/microsoft-and-nba-sign-azure-surface-deal-starting-in-2020-21-season.html](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/04/16/microsoft-and-nba-sign-azure-surface-deal-starting-in-2020-21-season.html)\n\n1. Microsoft Teams  will eat slacks lunch and the new office 365 cloud subscription model which started on 4/21 has teams included. I believe corporations will slowly dump slack because of the higher costs and join Teams. Unfortunately it cannot take on zoom as zoom is a superior video conferencing tool.\n2. JEDI contract will help secure future government contracts and helps further to move the legacy applications from Cobol or whatever language the state's are running to .Net/ C#\n3. Has Visual studio, .net ( asp.net, c# and vb.net) to compete against java. Also SQL server competes directly with Oracle DB\n4. New Xbox releasing this year\n5. Linked helps during hard times like this\n6. GIT Hub - 60% of the worlds open source software projects are stored on GIT hub\n7. Azure which is the crown jewel and competes with AWS\n8. VR/ AR with Hololens and hardware with surface\n9. I assume they will buy Service now or Sales force since Microsoft Dynamics is not that of a great CRM tool.\n10. If azure can prove its reliable for NBA, it will open doors for international games like Soccer, Formula1, Olympics etc..",

Some of them released their Q1 earnings, too.\n\nOracle and IBM earn 70-80% of their revenue from their cloud based services and software. SAP and Citrix (Web-Ex) is more weighted in this area. Growth has been trailing for all of these companies, except for one: Citrix.\n\nMy favorite out of all of them, including Cornerstone, has to be Citrix. Unfortunately, that Citrix ship has sailed. It had a damn check mark recovery! Citrix seems like a safe bet to go long, but this LMS industry seems like a short term play for me. \n\nI'd stick with CSDO for the earnings play with a small position of $32.5 5/15 calls. I would prefer going out to June, but there is no volume.\n\nI think I'll wait and see how Citrix behaves to decide if I want to jump in long term.",

As a majority I\u2019m certain that most businesses will service. \n\nI know since I\u2019ve been unemployed I\u2019ve subscribed to three online subscriptions and have bought at least a half dozen books. \n\nDid anyone use Zoom before Coronavirus? \n\nSo, depends how you define a lot, I suppose.
