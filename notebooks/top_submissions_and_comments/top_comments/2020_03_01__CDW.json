Also [someone says](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9bpdse/do_all_the_big_brokerages_use_key_tokens_and_what/e557faa/) they can do facial recognition on an iphone app, which would be cool but not something I could use just now.\n\nIt baffles me that seemingly nobody supports either Yubikey or Google Auth (except uselessly like Vanguard apparently does for Yubikey). The Symantec app has poor reviews, and my prior for their security is considerably lower than Google's.\n\nAny suggestions? Thanks!\n\n(Background: I have a lump sum to invest in index funds and such. It's been sitting around a little while as I was too lazy/afraid to start investing. Now it seems foolish for me to not at least start averaging in. I know, don't time the market, but this is where I am now. So it looks like from the above I should resign myself to Symantec and try Fidelity, IB, or maybe Schwab if Schwab was giving the wrong impression in their vague security page. If there's someone supporting Google Auth or Yubikey, I already have those.)",
