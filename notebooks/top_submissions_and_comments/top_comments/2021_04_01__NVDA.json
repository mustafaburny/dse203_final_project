And if the stock isn't above 500 (call) by April 16 2021, then the options expire worthless. \n\nCost/share: OP paid 30.01 per share to buy these options (not the stock...just the options...more on that later). And remember, each option is a 100 shares and OP bought 80. So....80 contracts* 100 shares per contract * 30.01 cost/share = $240,000 bet. \n\nWho gets that money? The person who is putting up the shares. That is, someone (could be ultiple people) who owned 8,000 shares. That person got a $240,000. \n\nHere's where it gets a little complicated. You can buy and sell the option contracts itself. The value of those contracts is directly related to how much time is left before the expiration date and whether the options already are over the $500 strike price (or \"in the money\"). \n\nAs these options are already in the money (current nvidia price is like $612/share). The value of each contract is $127.20 per share. So, 80 * 100 * 127.20 = 1,017,600.",

It's probably worth like 40 grand now if you're still holding it!\" \n\nHe said he was still holding, but made one correction.

If Apple didn't take up that capacity, there are plenty of other companies that would (AMD, Nvidia, etc.) Given the semiconductor shortage going on right now, Apple is likely paying a premium for TSMC's fabs. The price difference is likely the reason why Nvidia went with Samsung fabs for their new cards as opposed to TSMC.

He can buy 8000 shares for 500 each, and at a cost of 30 per share he makes 80 per share in profit.\n\nThe 80 calls cost 240k, 8000 stock at a 500 purchase price is 4m, and at 625/ share those 8k are worth 5m. So he made $1m in profit, minus the 240k cost, thus a gains of 760k.\n\nAlso note the value has other factors including IV, time to expiry (which I believe is called theta) and some other stuff.",

        "body": "AMD is down today and here's why:\n\nTake a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means hedge funds need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit or else they'll have to cover. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases. Analysts are already saying to buy, and buy aggressively at this price.\n\nI know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  \n\"This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.\"\n\nOne could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% QoQ which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers \"digesting\" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales QoQ saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.\n\nOne could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.\n\nOne could speculate that the \"chip shortage\" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.\n\nAll of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.\n\nWith AMD, there's no need for WSB or individual investors to try to turn it around on the short selling hedge funds, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, diamond hands, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.\n\nAMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022. My price target is $120 which is more conservative than even some analysts.",

Or is there actually something wrong with citing information?  \n\n\nAnd Intel has GPUs.   They sell more than anyone else.  Their integrated GPUs are a giant portion of the market, so their transition to making discrete GPUs should not be crazy.  They also have their own supply of chips that isn't nearly as affected by the shortage as AMD and Nvidia, so they stand to capture as big a piece of the GPU market share as they are able to produce.  I'm betting they are able to release before 2022, it's understandable if you are more skeptical though.  \n\n\nEven without the addition of discrete GPUs, due to the extreme shortage+demand at the moment, people are actively seeking out CPUs with integrated graphics in order to have working systems until supply for discrete GPUs is finally met.  AMD's integrated graphics options in the desktop market are not nearly as desirable - the SKUs are too low end for gamers or power users to use it as a viable upgrade path (buying a 3400g to hold you over until you can find a 3070 or 6700xt creates a CPU bottleneck, buying nearly any intel CPU with an iGPU avoids that scenario by being a way better CPU than the current AMD offerings)  \n\n\nIn any event, go ahead and hate on Intel if you want.  Analysts were already wrong once about their earnings, it won't be the first time.  Eventually the market will figure it out.",

Their processors are just way more price competitive while still offering like 95% of the single core capability of Intel and destroying them on multi core.\n\nGraphics cards are another boat though. Yes, AMD has made great graphics cards, but THE NAME in the game is still Nvidia (though I hate their efforts to make things proprietary). Though AMD is hedging at Nvidia pretty hard too...\n\nHonestly AMD should start manufacturing more PC parts as well, get a RAM and motherboard kit and good to go.",

        "body": "Over/under-valued is supposed to be fundamental. You should keep that separate from your opinion on it.\n\nYou should be psychologically and emotionally able to say, \"I recognize that the stock is currently over-valued, but I think it has a better future than the professionals realize, so I still like it at this price.\"\n\nWhen you're completely honest about your evaluation, you end up with better information about what your opinion actually is. In this case, do you actually have better information about Apple's future than everybody else? Is there some popular idea about Apple that pulls the stock price down, that you think is incorrect? Are they planning to move into some new area of business that you understand, and most people don't realize is important?\n\nFor example, AMD. My day job is firmware engineer. AMD put out a press release earlier this year about two new patents. All the analysis I read, both in the stock market, and on the engineering websites, presumed these are two different, unrelated things, that they just coincidentally talked about on the same day. I disagree; I think they're part of one new future product, that is also related to their Xilinx acquisition, and will bring real advantages to their server products. Right now their server market share is only 10%; the forecasts are that they will increase this to 20% in about 18 months. If they come out with a new product that enhances their competitive position in this area right when they're also already expanding their market share, that could be a huge driver for them and for the stock. So I think the stock is really worth at least 15% more than it can be objectively valued at now. But that doesn't mean it is undervalued now; just that I have a higher price target!\n\nAnother example is if a hedge fund releases research report that bad-mouths a company, and the stock goes down, and you read the report (most people don't even read it, they just sell!) and you think the report doesn't actually accuse them of anything. So then you might reasonably have a different evaluation than others.\n\nAs with all other parts of trading and investing, psychology is the most critical aspect of success. Don't be credulous of your own opinions; and treat your emotions with skepticism. When you love a stock, be nervous about your evaluation. You want to trade on what you rationally think will go up, not what you love.\ud83d\udc7c",
