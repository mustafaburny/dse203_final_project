Were rejected by the buyers or were taken back to get one or more warranty repairs?  What is the value (profit) in each vehicle that is sold, and are we talking about $39,000 Model 3's or the $80K Model S, or the $90K Model X?  \n\n* Fremont factory was shut down by the health department in CA during the COVID crisis.  Can happen again, not by law, but by whim.  \n* There are new factories planned but is there the capability to deliver?\n* Is the factory in China to meet demand (no more car transports out of Oakland to China) or to avoid paying tariffs on imports?\n* Plaid+ Model S pushed out to now middle of 2022, with a $10K price increase\n* CyberTruck, estimates but no deliveries.  \n* Model X will not be getting the newer battery (notice by range) as that's not even an option\n* Tesla body shops are slammed for repairs - either for parts or labor (May 7th or whatever in CA Bay Area)\n* Tesla authorized body shops can have delays in repairing vehicles, due to parts availability and when aluminum parts arrive, can be dented during transport needing it to be sent back and resetting the clock\n* Wholesale (wrecked) price on Teslas are high because battery packs are at a premium, causing insurance to total them prematurely and raising insurance rates\n* Beta FSD is seriously buggy (dangerous) as per the latest AI video shot in Oakland\n* Missteps in telling buyers they'd be able to get a Tesla loaner, then get cheated out of even the Uber credits, when the vehicles are brought in to be serviced\n* Increased difficult in talking to a human via email or phone.  \n* MCU1 NHTSA near-recall forcing Tegra board installs and service scheduling\n* GM and LG Chem teaming up\n* Apple Car competition\n* MCU / software slow failure to adapt (Slack to Spotify, but still no Waze nor CarPlay integration)\n* Large delays (due to warehouse supply chain) in deploying Solar PV installs (approx 2 months in Bay Area)\n* Biden administration push for tax rules which increase corporate taxes (21% to 28%), impacting revenue generated overseas in places like Germany where the other factory is going in to help with sales.  \n\nThere are probably more issues, but when you have other manufacturers starting to offer comparable options (including TACC) it increases the pressure on Tesla.  What does TSLA really have going for them?\n\n* Tesla Gigafactory is still working with Panasonic in Sparks.  Full shifts.  Buses for employees coming from as far south as Carson City NV.  \n* Toyota and TSLA teaming up\n* Leaps on the auto-pilot software ahead of everyone else\n* Sentry mode due to number of cameras\n* Name branding (fancier than a Toyota)\n* Potential tax benefits under the Biden administration for EVs.  States like NJ make it economical to buy a new TSLA due to the $0 sales tax for EV purchases.\n* Electricity costs in CA ($0.25 kW/h) along with outages due to \"wildfire and other threats\" make Solar PV a better option, along with the $10-$15K power wall for consumers\n\nI'd expect chip issues to drive issues in the future.  I followed TSLA since they migrated from Mobil Eye (and subsequent purchase by INTC) into creating their own solution.  This is the difference between AP1, AP2 and ultimately the options going into AP3 with users claiming better (smoother) performance from AP1 for months after AP2 was rolled out.  Anyhow, the NVDA and subsequent their own chips also play a role in terms of growing pains.  \n\nI am long on TSLA with a bit over $165,000 invested.  Current price is an interesting proposition but I have no active orders.",

Its close geographical proximity allows the company to benefit from strong manufacturing activity. It has maintained a strategic alliance with TSMC since 1997, the largest dedicated foundry with a market share of 56% of the foundry market revenues. The alliance has made ASE the preferred provider of packaging and testing services for TSMC clients. This allows ASE to benefit by leveraging TSMC's clients of leading companies including Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, Nvidia (NVDA), MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTKF), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as clients who account for nearly half of ASE's revenues. Apple, Qualcomm and MediaTek are major players in the smartphone processor market and are developing 5G chipsets that require advanced packaging capabilities which ASE can provide. Given the long-standing relationship between TSMC and ASE, we expect the alliance between both companies to continue as it enables them to provide a total semiconductor manufacturing solution and the close geographic advantage between both market leaders. This means that ASE should be able to continue counting on TSMC's clients of leading chipmakers.\u201d",

Additional discussion welcomed on a few tickers in particular:\n\nFWRD - transportation company, solid financials, weathered the covid crash and has been on a strong rebound since last spring.  My first purchase and longest held and largest position. \n\nNVDA - ticker needs no introduction. I was lucky (not good) to hear about it on youtube two years ago. Put some money in and have been letting it run.  Increased my position last month when it slid below $500/share.\n\nF - I am reevaluating continuing to hold this.  I don't see a path to them acquiring a larger market share with most car companies moving toward electric vehicles.  I can get out at a profit and may do so.  There are other car companies (VWAGY, HYMTF, RACE) that have better prospects. \n\nM - I bought Macys on the run up (@$18/share).  Seemed like a good play at the time, retail should do well with things opening back up, but it has slid back down.  Am I looking at things wrong or is it undervalued? $4 billion market cap for a company with 18 billion in revenue and $2 billion in profit during a pandemic? Planning to keep holding for now.  \n\nRKT - I bought and sold during the meme spike last month, got in right as it was taking off, @$24 sold @$38 and made some coin. Reinvested on the way back down, @$25, but it has continued to slide. Am I looking too hard at $2.6 billion market cap on $15 b in revenue/$4 billion in profit?\n\nVACQ/GNPK - these are speculative plays, SPACs that are taking Rocket Labs and Red Wire public. Commercial satellite launch and space infrastructure.  \n\nRounding out the profile a couple ETFs, ONGAX and PRDSX, and some more stocks:\n\nWMT\nLMT\nKBAL\nT\nERIC\nSELB\nLUMN\nBDN\nUNIT\nPLTR \n\nI also have a little in a gold equity, IAU.

People are going to buy back in on Apple and Nvidia while they are down from their tops, as they are seen as safer if we dip more. \n\nOnce those get near the top and don't present such a tempting opportunity, money will flow into more speculative investments that present a better growth opportunity. \n\nPre-loi will lag spacs with a good DA as well. Known element at a discount to ATH is a better opportunity than a pre-loi that could sit for months and/or find a bad target. But once DA spacs get expensive enough then money will again look to go fishing and pre-loi will go up as well, especially on older spacs that are likely closer to a merger. It won't be what it was before due to the sheer number now, but pre-loi do acquire a sort of extrinsic value above nav in a risk-on environment.",

TSM, Samsung and INTC have near-term headwinds in terms of earnings based on semiconductor demand simply because it takes so long to expand capacity. The front-end winners in current semi production efforts are going to be those who supply the tools, products and services that go into these fabs that are planned for construction: AMAT, ASML, TER, LRCX, to name a few. Secondary effects on earnings from this will come 1-2-3 years down the line for the semi manufacturers themselves, depending on whether or not they are expanding/upgrading an existing facility, or building one from the ground up.\n\nThe end-users of these semiconductor products (GM, F, NVDA, AMD, etc.) will be the last ones to benefit from expanded chipmaking capacity, as easing the demand crunch allows them to resume normal sales levels. Note that for auto mfrs, this has a ripple effect on rental car companies, who sold all of their fleets in fire sales last year and now can't replace them because the auto mfrs can't make cars.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is booked up for the foreseeable future; these bookings have prices agreed well in advance, and are almost certainly not subject to TSMC's recent statements that they plan to increase prices; that will happen with new bookings down the line.",

Options trading is most useful when you get the gamma cheap while also calling the direction right.\n\nI'm buying INTC 23Apr 70c because resistance at 65 has kept IV muted. My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr. I hate talking in terms of resistance in general, but looking at the long-term chart as well as price action in the morning after the Intel Unleashed event, it certainly seems like you'd need a big catalyst to justify a breakout beyond 65. I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",

It is actually incredible what this company has been able to achieve.\n\nOn top of just being innovative in the industry and competing with the two biggest names in their industry they have some great leadership. Lisa Su is a visionary and I don't think the company would be where it's at today without her.\n\nThere are some issues in the GPU supply chain atm but the story is the same for Nvidia and not a unique issue for AMD, so although this poses some challenges in the short term I don't see it becoming a huge issue long term. Additionally, unless I've missed something, Apple still uses AMD for their graphics, but like with Intel on the CPU side, they could lose this source of revenue soon. It just depends on how successful Apple is at cutting out the 3rd party processors and replacing them.\n\nThe only issue I see as unique for AMD is that they still lag behind on some of the lower end chips. As high as the tech world is on AMDs new GPU and the higher end Ryzen CPUs, most PC builders don't have a 5-10k budget. For now, Intel still gets you better performance for your dollar on the CPU side but the margin is closing. Nvidia still also has a clear edge on the lower-mid range GPUS.\n\nAll said though, AMD is here to stay and is going to be making noise in their industry for a long time.

        "body": "Some little background on options. \n\nOver simplified: they are a bet that a specific stock will be above (call) or below (put) a certain price (strike price) by a certain day. Each contract/option is for 100 shares. \n\nTo read this: \n\nNVDA - Nvidia \n\nApr 16 2021 - This is the expiration date or deadline (this friday). \n\n500 Call - 500 is the strike price. And if the stock isn't above 500 (call) by April 16 2021, then the options expire worthless. \n\nCost/share: OP paid 30.01 per share to buy these options (not the stock...just the options...more on that later). And remember, each option is a 100 shares and OP bought 80. So....80 contracts* 100 shares per contract * 30.01 cost/share = $240,000 bet. \n\nWho gets that money? The person who is putting up the shares. That is, someone (could be ultiple people) who owned 8,000 shares. That person got a $240,000. \n\nHere's where it gets a little complicated. You can buy and sell the option contracts itself. The value of those contracts is directly related to how much time is left before the expiration date and whether the options already are over the $500 strike price (or \"in the money\"). \n\nAs these options are already in the money (current nvidia price is like $612/share). The value of each contract is $127.20 per share. So, 80 * 100 * 127.20 = 1,017,600.",

Last April, it was left for dead. Predicting an imminent demise for the retailer, hedge funds piled on their bearish bets and the company\u2019s market value sank to a few hundred million dollars. A year later, thanks to big buying from the Reddit crowd, GameStop is worth about $13 billion and is now looking to raise as much as $1 billion in capital to fund internet entrepreneur Ryan Cohen\u2019s turnaround plan. This year\u2019s GameStop stock mania may make its business transformation possible.\n\nThe retail investor frenzy over GameStop shares has been well covered. But the stock\u2019s rally has some fundamental underpinnings. It is not a coincidence that the surge began days after Cohen was appointed to its board on Jan. 11. Since joining in an official capacity, the co-founder and former chief executive officer of online pet-supply retailer Chewy Inc. has moved quickly, taking control of the company\u2019s strategy and pivoting it faster toward e-commerce. He has hired nine executives \u2014 five of whom had experience at Amazon.com Inc. \u2014 including a new chief operating officer and chief technology officer. Several of the additional hires also came from Chewy, a sign of confidence from former colleagues in COhen\u2019s abilities. Now, the company is raising the funds needed to implement his plan.\n\nEarly Monday, the company announced it will sell as much as 3.5 million shares worth as much as $1 billion in an \u201cat-the-market\u201d stock offering. It said the funds will be used to \u201caccelerate its transformation\u201d and strengthen its balance sheet. The video-game retailer also announced that its revenue for the five weeks ended April 2 increased by 18% compared with a year earlier, negating a part of the naysayers\u2019 thesis that it is a declining business. While GameStop shares slumped in early trading Monday on news of the share sale, they recovered a bit as the day wore on, pointing to investor optimism for Cohen\u2019s plan.\n\n It is a prudent and necessary move. With GameStop\u2019s share price up nearly 900% this year, the company will be able to raise significantly more funds to expand its e-commerce capabilities. The turnaround plan outlined in its latest annual report includes building fulfillment operations for faster delivery times, overhauling its website and starting a U.S.-based customer service operation. All these initiatives are needed to improve GameStop\u2019s customer experience and will require significant investments.\n\n GameStop\u2019s latest executive hire may tip off even bigger ambitions. Last week, the retailer said it had appointed Elliott Wilke as its chief growth officer. Wilke spent the last seven years in senior roles at Amazon, including stints at Amazon Fresh, Prime Pantry and Worldwide Private Brands. His experience at the e-commerce giant\u2019s private-label business may mean GameStop intends to some day launch its own branded hardware products such as gaming mice, keyboards and other higher-priced items such as gaming PCs. If successful, this kind of move could generate higher profit margins much the same way as Amazon\u2019s AmazonBasics and Costco\u2019s Kirkland Signature product lines.\n\nIn another noteworthy development, GameStop has ramped up its offerings in the PC gaming hardware market in recent weeks. The retailer is releasing five-page weekly ad circulars focused on this niche, selling items such as $400 gaming monitors and $1,000 Nvidia graphics cards. PC gaming is a large and growing area and is not cyclical like the retailer\u2019s core console-gaming market. On the back of its better-known brand, GameStop should be able to take market share from other PC e-commerce players such as Newegg and Micro Center.\n\nIn just a few months, Cohen has revamped GameStop\u2019s senior management, adding executives with the required relevant technology backgrounds, while setting a clear vision for the company\u2019s future and moving further into attractive product areas. This is an impressive amount of progress in a short time frame. With the coming fund raise, the company will have the capital to fully execute on Cohen\u2019s vision. The so-called smart money should take notice.",

This last series by AMD really has pushed them into a 1-2 punch of top end CPU and GPU combos that can compete on both ends. They are still a bit behind at the ultra top end with server technology and production processes so Nvidia is on lock but with how the market is for GPUs and crypto they will sell regardless. I could see AMD push the boundaries versus Nvidia with server based gaming and other areas with their amazing momentum. I bought at 78 but anything below 100 is an amazing price.",

Its close geographical proximity allows the company to benefit from strong manufacturing activity. It has maintained a strategic alliance with TSMC since 1997, the largest dedicated foundry with a market share of 56% of the foundry market revenues. The alliance has made ASE the preferred provider of packaging and testing services for TSMC clients. This allows ASE to benefit by leveraging TSMC's clients of leading companies including Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, Nvidia (NVDA), MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTKF), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as clients who account for nearly half of ASE's revenues. Apple, Qualcomm and MediaTek are major players in the smartphone processor market and are developing 5G chipsets that require advanced packaging capabilities which ASE can provide. Given the long-standing relationship between TSMC and ASE, we expect the alliance between both companies to continue as it enables them to provide a total semiconductor manufacturing solution and the close geographic advantage between both market leaders. This means that ASE should be able to continue counting on TSMC's clients of leading chipmakers.\u201d",

        "body": " TL:DR - looking for feedback on a simple hi return stock screen and thoughts on how to rank results.\n\nEarly 60's, simple, diversified, buy and hold retirement portfolio approach my whole life. Looking at working probably another 5-10 years and starting to get a lot more active in my portfolio. Nothing crazy and I'm fundamentally a conservative+ investor, but I do not subscribe to moving 100% into ultra safe right before retirement. Portfolio size is low 7 figure for reference.\n\nOver the past few months I subscribed to a couple of authors on Seeking Alpha and have tried out a few strategies with minimal exposure and have a good idea of how to use some of the approaches in my portfolio. I want to develop my own screens because at least on Seeking Alpha, the authors I've found charge a small monthly fee for their updates. It's nothing huge, and for me at least has been worth seeing their approaches, but nothing I want to pay for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm going to put together a dividend screen/strategy and a \"better than cash\" parking lot strategy. Pretty basic and straightforward. I also just got started on putting together a screen to identify a more hi growth strategy - thought being on a monthly basis invest in the top 4 stocks that fall out of the screen. Would love some feedback on the screen (I'm stock knowledgeable, but certainly not an expert). When looking at the screen and giving feedback keep in mind my objective: not looking for the perfect approach or for mega returns, I'm an 80/20 kinda guy so looking for a decent, simple to execute strategy to reliably give back a growth-class return. (And using the Fidelity screener as that's where my portfolio is).\n\nScreen as it stand currently:\n\n* Tagging Energy, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Industrials sectors\n* Market cap down to Medium (as defined by Fidelity: 6-33B)\n* 13 week price performance down to 13%\n* 3 yr annualized Beta of 1.1 and up (conflicted on whether this really helps the screen)\n* Very Bullish or Bullish analyst recommendations (Summary score from StarMine)\n* Forward EPS 3-5 yrs high to very high (16.5% and up)\n* EPS growth Projected year versus last year high to very high (40% and up)\n\nAs an example, running that screen today resulted in a list of 7 stocks (sorry not allowed to link image or would give you a shot of the fundamentals):\n\n1. AMAT - Applied materials\n2. FANG - Diamondback Energy\n3. EOG - EOG Resources\n4. NXPI - NXP SemiConductor\n5. KKR - KKR &amp; Co\n6. LRCX - LAM Research Corp\n7. MU - Micron Technology\n\nSo the thought would be to run this first day of every month and put a set amount in the top 4 stocks in the filter. I would guess some stocks might stay in for months, some might rotate in and out quickly.\n\nMy question is basically around how to rank. So do I just pick a screening metric (or some other metric) and do a simple rank on that metric to determine top 4, or do I create a formula to weight and aggregate multiple metrics into an overall score and rank on that?\n\nSorry for the long post - thank you to those who stuck with it and are willing to share your thoughts.",
