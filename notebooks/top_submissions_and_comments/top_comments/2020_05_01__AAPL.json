So we\u2019re taking a big look- a really serious look- at some of the stuff we\u2019re seeing come out of the Dow. Really remarkable. Thought it was just a chemical company you know, some of the strongest, I mean, really strong disinfectants, like bleach or formaldehyde, and so once Mr. Jones really gets going and we can reopen some states you\u2019ll be able to really attack this virus, and I mean really attack- perhaps kill- this virus. This, invisible enemy. Really that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s invisible. But we\u2019re taking a look at it and a lot of different things and I think the American people are really going to like what they see.",

I'll be going short term calls tomorrow for a quick scalp at open.\n\nPTON Calls: Same as above \\^ bounce back from the $40-41 level\n\nDKNG: FOMO if you want. This thing could pop to $40 or drop to $30. I won't be touching this until at least another week or so. Risky af but mad tendiez if you guess the right direction (calls/puts)\n\nCOTY: Same as above, but I expect this will hold better than DKNG since its already near rock bottom prices. Might throw a few thousand at it tomorrow in calls.\n\nSPY: i personally don't play SPY, but there is mad tendiez to be made if you get in calls at a dip (around the 295-297 range) or puts (around the 301-303 range).\n\nCCL, RCL, NCLH: Easy plays to go long on a dip, Beaten up cruise stocks that have been forming new bottoms. Easy 2x 3x bagger if you get in before a large move up in the premarket. They seem a bit overheated lately though so I would be careful of a pullback soon, in which case go short term puts.\n\nAAL, DAL, UAL, LUV, SAVE: Same as above\n\nAAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA: Tech saw a big hit today, might be a good spot to buy the dip. I'll be watching closely tomorrow if we continue to fall in tech at open, then I'm buying the dip for sure.\n\nBABA, TSM: GYNA stocks if you want i guess\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck making your parents money back you fucking autist.",

Then I looked at BA AAPL NVDA- 3 diff stocks - airplane manufacturer/aerospace stock/tech/semiconductor  all 3 held key support levels so if these 3 hold and SPX held key levels.

        "body": "To put it simply, you are thinking that a dollar is worth a dollar, which is wrong.  A dollar is worth what you can trade for it.\n\nIf we look back into 2017 and 2019 territory we see a strong market, an economy marked by low unemployment and high demand for skilled labor while also increasing GDP, and strong fundamentals from the stars of the market with improving metrics in the lower ends.  In short, a reflection of a golden age for the market that had built up over time.\n\nYet, though the economy is shot and those strong fundamentals are now taking on water, that the gold has turned to lead, the prices are once again high.\n\nThe value of the stocks themselves aren't as high as they were before rather the money you are trading with doesn't have the same value in the market itself.  Central banks buying up high risk assets (junk bonds, corporate bonds, ETFs, at risk mortgages) combined with the restriction on discretionary spending from the closure of entertainment centers driving gamblers into the stock market, the collapse of the bond attraction from Trump promoting negative rates and negate rates appearing on the global scale, and the investors following the federal example of Stonks Only Go Up is pushing a multiple of the spending into the stock exchanges, driving up demand for these equities.\n\nThe value of Apple today is less than what it was years ago, however it's price had recovered because the value of the dollar it is compared against has tanked within the perception driven pocket reality of the exchanges.  This is what economists are talking about when they say these are becoming fake markets, they are acting independent of the governing factors of the economy, the market, and the underlying backing due to outside intervention manipulating the exchange.\n\nIn the short term the damage to the economy will likely cause deflation in the consumer markets regardless of the money dumps into the exchanges but if a correction or stagnation isn't experienced to allow the consumer markets to recover to the same level then we will experience aggressive inflation in the consumer markets in the long term that will dramatically outpace wage increases due to selling of exchange assets moving the money from the exchanges into the consumer markets.\n\nTLDR: I am a literal autist, and things only make sense if you realize that it isn't that a cup of coffee is worth a dollar, it is that a dollar is only worth a cup of coffee.  And tomorrow a dollar will be worth less than a cup of coffee.",

The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I'm not sure what part of China they go to but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago. And that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill, and the quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is.\"\n\nAnd China has an abundance of skilled labor unseen elsewhere, says Cook:\n\n\"The products we do require really advanced tooling, and the precision that you have to have, the tooling and working with the materials that we do are state of the art. And the tooling skill is very deep here. In the US you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China you could fill multiple football fields.\"\n\nCook credits China's vast supply of highly skilled vocational talent:\n\n\"The vocational expertise is very very deep here, and I give the education system a lot of credit for continuing to push on that even when others were de-emphasizing vocational. Now I think many countries in the world have woke up and said this is a key thing and we've got to correct that. China called that right from the beginning.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think this will be hard for India to replicate....",

        "body": "I'm gonna drastically simplify this for you, keep in mind that this isn't the actual definition of IV by any means.\n\nEssentially, Implied Volatility is an options term for how much the underlying stock will move in a given time frame. Since TSLA has much wider swings in stock price than say...AAPL or MSFT, TSLA has higher IV. This higher IV correlates to lower movement in options prices for large moves. For example, a 5% move in TSLA will result in 50-60% gains in TSLA at-the-money options, but a 5% move in MSFT will translate to 150-200% gains in MSFT at-the-money options.\n\nTSLA is expected to move let's say....5 percent per day. It's NOT expected to move 5% in an hour. That's what i meant in that in general, TSLA's stock price was moving a lot more than expected (on high volume) during that timeframe.",
