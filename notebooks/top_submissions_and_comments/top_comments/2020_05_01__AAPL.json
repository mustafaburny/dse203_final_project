Thought it was just a chemical company you know, some of the strongest, I mean, really strong disinfectants, like bleach or formaldehyde, and so once Mr. Jones really gets going and we can reopen some states you\u2019ll be able to really attack this virus, and I mean really attack- perhaps kill- this virus.

        "body": "I'm sorry but this is a gross misunderstanding of what is going on.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is not the economy.  It also is not an equal weighing of all the companies in the S&amp;P.  As long as there's not full blown fear, there should be some differentiation.  Owning MSFT and owning M are not equal.  The stocks like MSFT are helping carry the S&amp;P while M being down a lot is a not a proportionate loss.\n\nDon't forget, we are down.  It's not like we're up YTD.\n\nYou also have to remember that there's no competition to equities.  The 10-year is yielding less than 1%.  Why would I buy that when I can buy AAPL and get a better dividend than that?  After all, it has about $100 billion in cash alone right now so the dividend seems pretty safe.\n\nThere's also this thing called sentiment.  In layman's terms, it's the general belief of what will happen.  So while unemployment may not return to the record pre-crisis levels, the market believes most of these jobs will be back soon.  And that makes a lot of sense if you believe the world will be re-opening soon, which I do.  Since the general belief is that unemployment will be resolved shortly, the market is priced accordingly. \n\nThere's also TRILLIONS of dollars of stimulus being issued in a variety of ways.  I think you might underestimate how much TRILLIONS really is.\n\nEven if you're right and the market is being irrational, these bullish rallies are normal in a bear market.  That means you can be right AND THIS STILL HAPPENS.  These must be accounted for but you're not accounting for them whatsoever.\n\nMost importantly, you're looking at this like an amateur.   Big time investors are capitalists.  They understand ups and downs and all sorts of things I'm sure I don't know.  But markets are functioning.  The big fear in the Great Recession is that markets weren't functioning.  We recovered once it proved the markets functioned.  Knowing this, the Fed went right after this point immediately.  THAT'S WHY THE FED DID WHAT IT DID BECAUSE IT'S THAT IMPORTANT.  The day the Fed announced infinite QE was the bottom on the chart for the reason.  The Fed basically guaranteed markets will work so the worst case scenario is off the table.\n\nLastly \"Things aren't returning to normal anytime soon\" is a massive assumption.  I'm not saying the world will be back to normal on May 15th but a lot of people think the opposite of you, myself included.  Be careful what assumptions you make.\n\nEDIT:  You also have to remember how people think.  Let's say 20% of people thought the world would open again in April, 20% in May, 20% in June, 20% July, and 20% in August.  Well it's May now so the April 20% and the May 20% think re-opening is right around the corning - that's 40%.  In June, you add that 20% to the existing 40% and now we're up to 60%.  Just like you think the market will fall every day, they believe the opening is just around the corning.  You keep thinking \"tomorrow is the day\" forever.  Being stubborn  goes both ways.",

If you straddle it, it will settle a cent or two above your call strike price and you\u2019ll be assigned your shares at a penny discount but the stonk will go down before you can sell it. You\u2019ll decide to run the wheel and sell calls but the losses are greater than your gains. You\u2019ll baghold and the company will claim bankruptcy. Once they claim bankruptcy, they will inevitably wipe out shareholders, you included, so you sell your shares to try and yolo your way back with whatever you have left. When they re-emerge from bankruptcy, they will pay a special dividend to the previous shareholders but you won\u2019t get it because you sold prior to the hold date. Your wife will leave her boyfriend for a man that\u2019s more manly that he could ever be. You\u2019ll jerk off your wife\u2019s ex while you both watch her fuck her new boyfriend. She\u2019ll get pregnant, have the baby, go out for a pack of cigarettes, never come back, divorce you, make you pay alimony AND child support even though you have full custody, just not in the courts eyes. You\u2019ll raise the child, his first words will be \u201cdada\u201d, you\u2019ll teach him to walk, ride a bicycle, throw a baseball, how to ask a girl out, teach him to shave, tie a tie, he will excel in his studies, go to Harvard, graduate at the top of his class. The child, now a man, got an internship after college at Twitter (TWTR) and worked his way up to become CEO, he reorganized the company and it excels beyond your wildest imagination. Every move he makes has the midias touch, he will be featured on every financial news outlet, you\u2019ll see his face plastered all over wall street and main street. Your Tendy alert goes off every day, like clockwork, showing that TWTR has increased more than 5% for the day (it never goes down), the stonk will eclipse the values of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon with retard strength even when the financials don\u2019t make sense. You\u2019ll be proud and everyone around you, no matter where you are, will constantly praise you for his success (which is your success). You alone raised him and he grew up to be everything you wanted, but could never, be. He has always loved you unconditionally, but, since you secretly despised him, you never bought calls, only puts.

        "body": "To put it simply, you are thinking that a dollar is worth a dollar, which is wrong.  A dollar is worth what you can trade for it.\n\nIf we look back into 2017 and 2019 territory we see a strong market, an economy marked by low unemployment and high demand for skilled labor while also increasing GDP, and strong fundamentals from the stars of the market with improving metrics in the lower ends.  In short, a reflection of a golden age for the market that had built up over time.\n\nYet, though the economy is shot and those strong fundamentals are now taking on water, that the gold has turned to lead, the prices are once again high.\n\nThe value of the stocks themselves aren't as high as they were before rather the money you are trading with doesn't have the same value in the market itself.  Central banks buying up high risk assets (junk bonds, corporate bonds, ETFs, at risk mortgages) combined with the restriction on discretionary spending from the closure of entertainment centers driving gamblers into the stock market, the collapse of the bond attraction from Trump promoting negative rates and negate rates appearing on the global scale, and the investors following the federal example of Stonks Only Go Up is pushing a multiple of the spending into the stock exchanges, driving up demand for these equities.\n\nThe value of Apple today is less than what it was years ago, however it's price had recovered because the value of the dollar it is compared against has tanked within the perception driven pocket reality of the exchanges.  This is what economists are talking about when they say these are becoming fake markets, they are acting independent of the governing factors of the economy, the market, and the underlying backing due to outside intervention manipulating the exchange.\n\nIn the short term the damage to the economy will likely cause deflation in the consumer markets regardless of the money dumps into the exchanges but if a correction or stagnation isn't experienced to allow the consumer markets to recover to the same level then we will experience aggressive inflation in the consumer markets in the long term that will dramatically outpace wage increases due to selling of exchange assets moving the money from the exchanges into the consumer markets.\n\nTLDR: I am a literal autist, and things only make sense if you realize that it isn't that a cup of coffee is worth a dollar, it is that a dollar is only worth a cup of coffee.  And tomorrow a dollar will be worth less than a cup of coffee.",
