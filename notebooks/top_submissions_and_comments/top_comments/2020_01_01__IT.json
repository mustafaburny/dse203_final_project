        "body": "Sorry guys, I'm going to be the party pooper here. There are a lot of things wrong with this post. OP didn't actually make any arguments. They just posted a spreadsheet and stated some facts about the numbers with zero analysis, then slapped a clickbait title  on top. Did everyone who upvoted this just smile and nod and say \"Yeah, I recognize some of those words...\"?\n\nFirst off, you have a lot of errors in your spreadsheet, both in data entry (e.g. a lot of the D column) and in your calculations. Why is \"Total Capital Employed\" = \"Net Long Term Debt\" + \"Book Value\"??? A lot of your other formulae have similar errors. Even if the data was correct, Point I still wouldn't make sense or mean anything. How can a company have \"no capital in their business\"? Do you know what capital *is*? You're telling me that Amazon didn't have any capital until 2012? A company can't exist without capital in the same way lemonade can't exist without lemons. Did you mean negative working capital? In that case you'd still be wrong, as Amazon's current assets have exceeded its current liabilities since at least 2004.\n\nPoint II is flat out wrong. Cash flow numbers aren't a valid measure for company growth. Comparing CapEx to D&amp;A in the manner you described would lead you to conclude that Amazon has been \"shrinking\" for the past four years: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/cash-flow-statement?freq=A\n\nTake a look at the balance sheet. Amazon has experienced monotonic growth as far as those tables go back.\n\nPoint III isn't really proving anything either. You're basically saying \"Amazon made money\". Sure, 7 years after it IPO'd. Lots of other companies made money year after year from 2004 onward, what made Amazon so special?\n\nI'm really disappointed that this post hit the top of /r/investing. It's word salad that's trying to draw some sort of revelatory, hyperbolic conclusion. OP is far from an expert here. I recommend everybody here look at a company balance sheet + income statement (Form 10-K) and actually learn what all of the words and numbers mean. Here's a good place to start: https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/financial-statements-example-amazon-case-study/",

        "body": "In super simple terms:   \nA short sell means borrowing a stock in order to sell it - promising the original owner you'll pay them back the original stock at a future date. Imagine Joey thinks Company A's stock is too high at $100. If he wants to short sell the Company A's stock, he could go to a broker and borrow someone else's share (in this case he could borrow Jimmy's stock) and sell it at $100 - promising to give Jimmy back his share in the future. If Joey is right, and the stock drops to $80, then he can buy back Company A's share at $80 (and give it to Jimmy) and keep $20 for himself. If on the other hand Company A's share goes up to $120, Joey is out of luck and will have to pay $120 to give back the share to Jimmy - thereby losing $20. You can see why short selling is dangerous - in this situation, Jimmy at most could have gained $100 (if Company A's price had collapsed to zero), but at most could have lost an infinite amount of money.   \n\n\nSo what do you do if you want to bet against a company, but don't want to short sell? You might instead consider a put option. A put option is buying the right to sell a company's stock (for a premium) at a specific price (known as the strike) on a specific date\\*. So instead of short selling, maybe Joey will buy a put option that says for $1 he can buy the right to sell Company's stock for $100 in one year. If in a year the price of the stock is above $100, then the option will expire worthless - as anyone would rather sell at a higher price than at $100. If the price is below $100 in a year, then Joey will be able to exercise his option and take his earnings. Unlike selling short, now Joey is at most only losing the premium of the option, and at best earning $100.   \n\n\nA call option is the opposite of a put option. A call option is buying the right to buy a stock at a given price on a future date. For $1 Joey might be able to buy the right to buy a shares of Company A for $100 in 1 year. If the shares are above $100 in a year, he'll make money, if they're below his options will expire worthless.   \n\n\nOptions are slightly tricky in that their value is not just comprised of the difference between share price and the exercise price, but also volatility and time value. You can read more about Black Scholes which is how options are priced elsewhere. You can also read about strategies about combining patterns of options to construct more sophisticated trades (like iron condors).\n\n  \n\\* Note - European and American options are different here.",

This counts as a short-term or long-term capital gain (depending on how long you held it) of the amount its price increased by.\n\nFor example, suppose you received a free share of AAPL on July 30, 2019.

If it crashed to $0, you\u2019re not going to exercise your right to buy them at $325, so your contract would expire worthless. You\u2019re only out the $33 you paid for it. \n\nTemper your expectations of what \u201cunlimited\u201d means here, though. Unlimited is technically true as there is no limit to how high a stock can go, but unless there is some major binary event that makes it skyrocket to BRK.A levels in two days, your potential profits will be much less impressive. \n\nWith low volatility (IV is currently the lowest it\u2019s been in the past 52 weeks), making it to your breakeven is a long shot with only two full trading days left. Even if it gets to 327 (roughly double the expected move) by the time your contract ends, you\u2019re looking at a ballpark profit of $167. Nothing to sneeze at, for sure, but the chances are low.",

        "body": "I'll help you out in a non ironic way, because options are actually really simple but can seem confusing if you are looking at this screenshot with ignorance. \n\nOP bought 30 call contracts (+30) for $77K (equity in screen shot of $87K - the gain of $10K experienced since he bought at $77K), at an average cost of $25.78 per share (1 contract = 100 shares, so 30 contracts = 3000 shares, so the $77K checks out.)\n\nThe \"Breakeven Price\" is listed at $1905.78. If we subtract the cost OP spent on each contract, we find the strike price of the calls is $1880. The EXP Date (expiration date) is 1/31, or tomorrow at close. Finally, the current price ($29.23) is the \"current\" price of the contracts. Because option markets are open only during normal trading hours, this cost represents the last price at close and are not updated to reflect after-hours market movement. \n\nIn summary, OP walked up to a roulette table and slapped 77 grand in cash on the \"AMZN stock will be above 1905 by the end of day tomorrow\". Note that is closed at 1870 today. If it's above 1905 by tomorrow, he will gain money overall. And if it's below 1905 he will lose money. If it's below 1880, he will lose ALL 77K.\n\nAMZN absolutely fucking killed earnings, released after hours today. Straight up Trogdor Burninating the peasants type of slaughter. In after hours trading AMZN is now at 2074. OPs call options are now \"in the money\" which means they have intrinsic value, because they allow the owner of the contract (currently OP) to buy 3000 shares of AMZN from someone at a price of $1880, when it's clearly market valued at $2074. What a deal right?! That intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price (1880) and the market price (2074), which is $194. \n\nLet's say OP doesn't have the capital to buy 3000 fucking shares of AMZN ($6 mill+ now) in order to then immediately sell it for a profit. Well, that's fine, because somebody in the market absolutely does, and will buy his contracts off him for at least $194. \n\nThus OP bought 30 contracts, each at a cost of $2,578 ($77K initial cost) and is going to be able to sell them tomorrow for at least $19,400 each ($582K final result). So 582K-77K initial cost = 500K+ profit, as OP stated in title. Another way to look at it is: 194/25.78 = 7.53x multiplier in one night, on a 77K bet.",

        "body": "Iran and the US probably made a deal where Iran had to give up its power in the region in exchange for easing the sanctions. The price? Iran has to give up its Quds leader. In one move, Khamenei has also consolidated his own power by taking out someone who, in the past, has threatened military coups in the event of left-wing movements and relations with the US. By doing this, he has severely reduced Sepah\u2019s power while simultaneously allowing for sanctions to be gradually eased. Most people don\u2019t understand this, but IRGC is getting so powerful that it is actually threatening the very existence of the Iranian government as it is. Soleimani was essentially its key leader, and by giving him up, Khamenei has consolidated his power. This is what most likely has occurred. Otherwise, why did it take so long for the US to kill this guy? He\u2019s been active in Iraq and Syria for the past decade.\n\nAlso, some IRGC hardliners wanted Soleimani to run for president. There\u2019s an internal war between the clerics and the IRGC for power in Iran. While someone like Rouhani or Ahmadinejad could just be puppets for Khamenei, Soleimani would actually not be a puppet president. Given that Rouhani is also in his last term, if Soleimani ran, he could present as a viable candidate. The only way that Khamenei could consolidate power for the clerics was to take him out. Again, if you were in Iran right now or know about how the Iranian government works, this scenario would probably be what you would be thinking right now as well.",

You typically couldn\u2019t buy individual shares, much less fractional shares.  So even a price of $100 would entail a $10,000 commitment. (There were a handful of brokers who would \u201cbreak lots\u201d for an up charge...but that\u2019s not ideal).\n\nOne of the initial advantages of mutual funds were that they allowed people to get around the \u201clot\u201d requirement...the ease of diversification is still a mutual fund feature, but it was even more so when you had to buy 100 stocks at a time. \n\nEventually - starting with the rise of discount brokers - this requirement became more and more relaxed, and the need to have stock prices that weren\u2019t astronomical if multiplied by 100 disappeared.",

It's an insulated, clinical, drug free environment to get clean.\n\nHowever, it's not really a place to address problems.\n\nI am drawn to all sorts of things that are high risk: self-employment, entrepreneurship, drugs, alcohol, crazy women, gambling, options and futures, racing cars, etc. \n\nI'm just a degenerate who has a broken dopamine cycle.\n\nRehab got me clean but changing my behavior was a whole different thing.\n\nThat has taken time and conscious effort on improving my discipline and priorities. I still gamble but I budget for it, for example. I don't drink because I end up going on month long benders.\n\nI do not mean to come off as pessimistic. Getting clean and recovery are very rewarding and rehab can help. But its not what they market it to be.\n\nTake care of yourself, homie.",

The orders from e.g. the hedge fund quant traders are much higher risk for the MM because they're informed: if those quants start buying heavy, they probably know something. The MMs now have much higher risk on their inventory. Because the MMs have this possibility of much higher risk, they have to be compensated for it: **market makers widen their bid-ask spreads where they may be trading against informed adversaries**.\n\nNow, a firm that has a PFOF agreement with a broker such as Robinhood knows exactly what kind of orders to expect: uninformed orders that are as good as a coin flip, from a clueless trader sitting on his couch. This carries much less risk. For this reason, MMs don't need such a wide bid-ask spread as they would need to post on the public exchanges. With the lower risk, they can afford to (1) pay Robinhood for their customers' orders, and (2) trade with narrower bid-ask spreads ultimately giving retail traders better prices than NBBO.\n\nYou can read more on this topic if you search for *adverse selection*.",
