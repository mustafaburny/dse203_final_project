        "body": "Sorry guys, I'm going to be the party pooper here. There are a lot of things wrong with this post. OP didn't actually make any arguments. They just posted a spreadsheet and stated some facts about the numbers with zero analysis, then slapped a clickbait title  on top. Did everyone who upvoted this just smile and nod and say \"Yeah, I recognize some of those words...\"?\n\nFirst off, you have a lot of errors in your spreadsheet, both in data entry (e.g. a lot of the D column) and in your calculations. Why is \"Total Capital Employed\" = \"Net Long Term Debt\" + \"Book Value\"??? A lot of your other formulae have similar errors. Even if the data was correct, Point I still wouldn't make sense or mean anything. How can a company have \"no capital in their business\"? Do you know what capital *is*? You're telling me that Amazon didn't have any capital until 2012? A company can't exist without capital in the same way lemonade can't exist without lemons. Did you mean negative working capital? In that case you'd still be wrong, as Amazon's current assets have exceeded its current liabilities since at least 2004.\n\nPoint II is flat out wrong. Cash flow numbers aren't a valid measure for company growth. Comparing CapEx to D&amp;A in the manner you described would lead you to conclude that Amazon has been \"shrinking\" for the past four years: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/cash-flow-statement?freq=A\n\nTake a look at the balance sheet. Amazon has experienced monotonic growth as far as those tables go back.\n\nPoint III isn't really proving anything either. You're basically saying \"Amazon made money\". Sure, 7 years after it IPO'd. Lots of other companies made money year after year from 2004 onward, what made Amazon so special?\n\nI'm really disappointed that this post hit the top of /r/investing. It's word salad that's trying to draw some sort of revelatory, hyperbolic conclusion. OP is far from an expert here. I recommend everybody here look at a company balance sheet + income statement (Form 10-K) and actually learn what all of the words and numbers mean. Here's a good place to start: https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/financial-statements-example-amazon-case-study/",

        "body": "In super simple terms:   \nA short sell means borrowing a stock in order to sell it - promising the original owner you'll pay them back the original stock at a future date. Imagine Joey thinks Company A's stock is too high at $100. If he wants to short sell the Company A's stock, he could go to a broker and borrow someone else's share (in this case he could borrow Jimmy's stock) and sell it at $100 - promising to give Jimmy back his share in the future. If Joey is right, and the stock drops to $80, then he can buy back Company A's share at $80 (and give it to Jimmy) and keep $20 for himself. If on the other hand Company A's share goes up to $120, Joey is out of luck and will have to pay $120 to give back the share to Jimmy - thereby losing $20. You can see why short selling is dangerous - in this situation, Jimmy at most could have gained $100 (if Company A's price had collapsed to zero), but at most could have lost an infinite amount of money.   \n\n\nSo what do you do if you want to bet against a company, but don't want to short sell? You might instead consider a put option. A put option is buying the right to sell a company's stock (for a premium) at a specific price (known as the strike) on a specific date\\*. So instead of short selling, maybe Joey will buy a put option that says for $1 he can buy the right to sell Company's stock for $100 in one year. If in a year the price of the stock is above $100, then the option will expire worthless - as anyone would rather sell at a higher price than at $100. If the price is below $100 in a year, then Joey will be able to exercise his option and take his earnings. Unlike selling short, now Joey is at most only losing the premium of the option, and at best earning $100.   \n\n\nA call option is the opposite of a put option. A call option is buying the right to buy a stock at a given price on a future date. For $1 Joey might be able to buy the right to buy a shares of Company A for $100 in 1 year. If the shares are above $100 in a year, he'll make money, if they're below his options will expire worthless.   \n\n\nOptions are slightly tricky in that their value is not just comprised of the difference between share price and the exercise price, but also volatility and time value. You can read more about Black Scholes which is how options are priced elsewhere. You can also read about strategies about combining patterns of options to construct more sophisticated trades (like iron condors).\n\n  \n\\* Note - European and American options are different here.",

        "body": "I'll help you out in a non ironic way, because options are actually really simple but can seem confusing if you are looking at this screenshot with ignorance. \n\nOP bought 30 call contracts (+30) for $77K (equity in screen shot of $87K - the gain of $10K experienced since he bought at $77K), at an average cost of $25.78 per share (1 contract = 100 shares, so 30 contracts = 3000 shares, so the $77K checks out.)\n\nThe \"Breakeven Price\" is listed at $1905.78. If we subtract the cost OP spent on each contract, we find the strike price of the calls is $1880. The EXP Date (expiration date) is 1/31, or tomorrow at close. Finally, the current price ($29.23) is the \"current\" price of the contracts. Because option markets are open only during normal trading hours, this cost represents the last price at close and are not updated to reflect after-hours market movement. \n\nIn summary, OP walked up to a roulette table and slapped 77 grand in cash on the \"AMZN stock will be above 1905 by the end of day tomorrow\". Note that is closed at 1870 today. If it's above 1905 by tomorrow, he will gain money overall. And if it's below 1905 he will lose money. If it's below 1880, he will lose ALL 77K.\n\nAMZN absolutely fucking killed earnings, released after hours today. Straight up Trogdor Burninating the peasants type of slaughter. In after hours trading AMZN is now at 2074. OPs call options are now \"in the money\" which means they have intrinsic value, because they allow the owner of the contract (currently OP) to buy 3000 shares of AMZN from someone at a price of $1880, when it's clearly market valued at $2074. What a deal right?! That intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price (1880) and the market price (2074), which is $194. \n\nLet's say OP doesn't have the capital to buy 3000 fucking shares of AMZN ($6 mill+ now) in order to then immediately sell it for a profit. Well, that's fine, because somebody in the market absolutely does, and will buy his contracts off him for at least $194. \n\nThus OP bought 30 contracts, each at a cost of $2,578 ($77K initial cost) and is going to be able to sell them tomorrow for at least $19,400 each ($582K final result). So 582K-77K initial cost = 500K+ profit, as OP stated in title. Another way to look at it is: 194/25.78 = 7.53x multiplier in one night, on a 77K bet.",

In one move, Khamenei has also consolidated his own power by taking out someone who, in the past, has threatened military coups in the event of left-wing movements and relations with the US. By doing this, he has severely reduced Sepah\u2019s power while simultaneously allowing for sanctions to be gradually eased. Most people don\u2019t understand this, but IRGC is getting so powerful that it is actually threatening the very existence of the Iranian government as it is. Soleimani was essentially its key leader, and by giving him up, Khamenei has consolidated his power. This is what most likely has occurred. Otherwise, why did it take so long for the US to kill this guy? He\u2019s been active in Iraq and Syria for the past decade.\n\nAlso, some IRGC hardliners wanted Soleimani to run for president. There\u2019s an internal war between the clerics and the IRGC for power in Iran. While someone like Rouhani or Ahmadinejad could just be puppets for Khamenei, Soleimani would actually not be a puppet president. Given that Rouhani is also in his last term, if Soleimani ran, he could present as a viable candidate. The only way that Khamenei could consolidate power for the clerics was to take him out. Again, if you were in Iran right now or know about how the Iranian government works, this scenario would probably be what you would be thinking right now as well.",

You typically couldn\u2019t buy individual shares, much less fractional shares.  So even a price of $100 would entail a $10,000 commitment. (There were a handful of brokers who would \u201cbreak lots\u201d for an up charge...but that\u2019s not ideal).\n\nOne of the initial advantages of mutual funds were that they allowed people to get around the \u201clot\u201d requirement...the ease of diversification is still a mutual fund feature, but it was even more so when you had to buy 100 stocks at a time. \n\nEventually - starting with the rise of discount brokers - this requirement became more and more relaxed, and the need to have stock prices that weren\u2019t astronomical if multiplied by 100 disappeared.",

However, you have to actually look at the data to determine the probability of P3 clearance yourself. For example, Bitopertin from Roche tried to do similar for schizophrenia but failed in phase III, but you have to note their phase 2 results were not solid to begin with. KarXT has far more robust data in phase 2.\n\n4) It's difficult but the FDA has been quite lenient on CNS drugs. FDA recently just approved calypta for schizophrenia (not approved for psychosis though so can't compete with KarXT at this point) from ITCI even though it had mixed results!  \n\n5) The good thing about xanomeline is it already had phase 2 trials back in the 1990s with Eli Lilly demonstrating efficacy. It's data that added in aggregate should derisk KarXT through phase 3 too. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6741650/pdf/CNS-9-159.pdf",

During a recession certain sectors or industries perform better, these are typically tied to what is viewed as a necessity to the consumer. An example would be utilities. \n\nNow, if you are asking who will survive recessions, a good indicator is the leverage ratio. How much is funded with debt compared to equity? This helps assess financial health of a company. You can look at days cash as well. This answers how many days of operations can the company fund purely off the cash on it's balance sheet. Total assets turnover or TAT can show how well the companies assets are used to produce sales. There are several others, but I think this is sufficient to send you on your path. \n\nDuring a recession you may find it easier to just pick ETFs that track underlying growth indexes and buy them at a cheap entry. Check out the performance of the Nasdaq 100 from 2009 to now. Looks tasty right? Not to say those market conditions will be replicated, but a similar strategy may be easier with lower risk than picking individual stocks. Good luck!",

I also filtered on market cap to avoid penny stocks, and a few other factors.\n\nWith the list I had, I did some research on each and tried to guess which would continue their growth during a recovery. I was focused on growth, but I know plenty of other people who were picking up dividend growth stocks on a steep discount.\n\nMy best two picks were AAPL and ISRG.\n\nThe strategy I used wouldn't have worked well during the dotcom bubble burst because many of those companies never recovered or took ~10 years to eventually recover.
