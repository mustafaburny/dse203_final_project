People here who think the Chinese government is going to let AWS or Microsoft run its software have done no research. A market of 1.4 billion, expecting to reach a greater GDP in 5 or so years is going to open its legs for the US? Let that sink in for a moment, the richest people in the US are owners of large US companies and supported by the US government. Is China dumb enough to let Amazon in and give them a free business that can't be controlled? Huawei failed outside of China but it's going to be building Chinese IoT infrastructure just like Cisco, Salesforce, AWS etc. \n\nChina already has its big tech equivalent, some of them turning volumes higher than their US counterparts. I won't push people to either side, just present some arguments. You bet on what you think will actually make you money given your risk tolerance.",

The rules are constantly changing.\n\nIn my mind, it\u2019s always been far more important to maintain cash flow into my portfolio and invest in super high quality management in expanding markets that should compound quite well for decades. If I believe NET is a 500b company in 15-20 years, there\u2019s little reason to fuss about valuation, especially when it\u2019s such an imprecise art. I understand it being more difficult getting in now, as my cost basis is significantly lower in most of the companies you mentioned (low 40\u2019s in NET for example) but you really just need to commit to it.\n\nI also found it interesting that during the huge growth sell off, stocks like NET and CRWD didn\u2019t pull back as hard as a PTON ROKU or TDOC (all 5 of which I own) and they immediately made new highs, saw huge institutional accumulation, and saw some crazy volume. People want to own these stocks, and valuation can\u2019t reflect the qualitative.\n\nAlso, some of the items in your watchlist are cheaper than your portfolio btw, PINS ETSY CRM all have a fwd PE of 50-60 which is considerably lower than everything in your portfolio aside from the mega caps and probably CLF.\n\nI own CRWD NET ABNB PINS ETSY PTON SQ SOFI TSLA TDOC of everything you mentioned, and like most of the others.",

Founded in 2001 as a provider of backup technology for Microsoft Exchange, the company has since become a major provider of SaaS technology for a wide swath of the Microsoft environment with 2020 revenue of $152 million, of which 75 percent is recurring revenue. The company estimates 2021 revenue to reach $194 million, of which over 80 percent will be recurring. We\u2019re one of those rare SaaS, high-growth, but profitable, companies out there. There\u2019s only seven other public companies like us trading on Wall Street today that have at least $150 million in revenue and at least 25 percent year-over-year growth, and that has at least 10 percent EBITDA profit margins. So that makes us quite unique. [We] have about $258 million cash on the balance sheet with no debt. We\u2019re already multi-cloud. We follow the customer. Most customers today are multi-cloud. So we already have a product for Google Workspace. We have SaaS backup for Salesforce. And we can also already support Box and Dropbox. Customers today are multi-cloud.

They say I\u2019m diversified too much with the added risk of picking stocks. What they fail to ask if what are my holdings in. Currently, nearly 3/4 of my portfolios are in IT, consumer discretionary, and health care. I\u2019m far from diversified. I also only have 29 stocks that are in SPY and 19 that are in QQQ. I am seeking response risk since I plan to be invested for 30+ more years. \n\nJust realized I\u2019m rambling about me lol. In regards to your positions, I\u2019ll stick with what I originally said. Sell anything you don\u2019t have 100% conviction in. It doesn\u2019t have to be a mass selling. You could do it over 6-12 months or something. I have a Sell Watchlist that I occasionally add positions to that I\u2019m wavering on. I\u2019ll pay a bit more attention to them, news around them, their earnings, investor call, etc. to see if my investment thesis still holds. If it doesn\u2019t, I sell. A stock usually sits on that watchlist for 3-6 months before I sell it or decide I still want to be invested. It works for me. Maybe something like that would work for you and help you pare down from 150 to only the companies you really want to own. \n\nI perused your list. I don\u2019t recognize some and don\u2019t have the time to look them up now but my 2 cents on a few that aren\u2019t in your keep section:\n\nI own and wouldn\u2019t consider selling: APPN, CRWD, ETSY, ISRG, MELI, SE, SQ, ZS, AMT, \n\nI own and wouldn\u2019t consider selling but would understand why someone else would: APPH, FSLY, NIO, SNOW, TDOC, \n\nI don\u2019t own CRM but I expect I will soon. \n\nOf the ones I mentioned above, MELI and ISRG are two of my highest conviction holdings. MELI in particular. It\u2019s my 3rd largest position. They are an incredible company growing shockingly fast (hello Mercado Pago!) and they aren\u2019t even an 80B MC company yet.

I don\u2019t mean wait and hold cash for years hoping it drops to a certain price point, but to look for the best opportunities that you believe in is the future and providing you the best possible returns as well. \n\nThere\u2019s just so many companies with great tailwinds for the future, it\u2019s pretty much impossible for me to invest in all of them! So I\u2019m picking a few that I believe with give me the most bang for my buck (I think anyways)\n\nOn the topic of Etsy, I like the two acquisitions that they made but last quarter they also said about 30% of their revenue from sales was from masks. I wanted to get in when it sat at 160 but I didn\u2019t feel strongly enough before it jumped. I\u2019d like to see a few more consistent quarters to get enough conviction to invest in them. \n\nSame thing with PINS, they got a huge bump from COVID but I\u2019m sort of skeptical of how much they can grow, since I believe that it\u2019s a more niche social media platform than say a Facebook. Again I\u2019d like to observe a bit more and see what direction they\u2019re headed before I jump in.\n\nI\u2019ll look into CRM a bit more!

The product itself is pretty good (haven't used it, but read many reviews).\n\nA bonus feature of their software.. when you use it, you get access to their community and AI. So, like, imagine you are sourcing something on your supply chain from XYZ, it'll tell you \"many Coupa members are seeing missed shipments from XYZ, consider using ABC instead\".\n\nBasically a private review/rating/etc platform for the users.. but also AI that tracks orders, dates received, payment info, etc, and can automatically detect patterns from vendors/locations/etc (across ALL Coupa users, not just your company) and notify you.

SO derived it\u2019s monopolistic power through acquisitions of rival refineries and distributors; purely horizontal integration, followed by outright price fixing.\n\nAmazon is absolutely massive, but the growth method and diversity of markets they participate in distinguishes them from old trust oriented monopolies. I\u2019m terms of AWS, the majority of growth was organic, and would not have ran afoul of antitrust law back in its hay day, such as when US v. Aluminum Co. of America was prevailing law.\n\nAn attempt to break up Amazon by business segment would probably fail due to the shift since the 70\u2019s from Per Se Antitrust violations to the Rule of Reason. They aren\u2019t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.\n\nOnline shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.\n\nOverall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren\u2019t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",

Ron Hubbard and Cosby wrote books too. That's a pretty low bar. \n\n&gt;Gold is a old-school store of value by definition and as we saw in 2020 (amongst others) a great asset during times of uncertainty and crashes. Buy it during calm times, sell during fearful times.\n\nYeah, that's not accurate. Gold is not a hedge, its a portfolio diversifier. It's market correlation is 0.02, which is an unattached, positive number...not the large negative correlation you would hope for from a hedge. It did absolutely nothing during the dot-com bubble and probably hurt most investors that held during 2020.",

        "body": "I personally invest heavily in Web3 crypto's and crypto projects that help run and keep these crypto's decentralised. \n\nWhat's a web3 crypto? These aren't to be confused with junk like Bitcoin that thinks it is a store of value or will become the new financial system, web3 crypto is literally creating the next stage in internet where you don't need to worry about your companies information / personal information / classified documents being stored on a server that is owned and managed by other companies. Web3 splits this up between 100's of validators that all talk to each other and keep this decentralised and secure from attacks. \n\nThere's also ones creating the future of finance. No longer do you need to get bent over by huge interest rates and banks fucking people over whenever they feel like it. DEFI is run by liquidity pools, people like you and I who store our money with the service and as a result get a percentage of the interest rates. These rates always remain low and competitive and go to the people rather than the big banks.\n\nThen you have oracles that power the decentralisation. Oracles gain info from many sources and feed it to the protocol to offer decentralised information. For easy laymans terms, if I wanted a weather oracle, it would gather weather data from 1000's weather stations and news outlets, work out the average forecast and feed that to my protocol. This means my protocol is giving the users the most accurate non-biased information. Just as a high-level. \n\nSo how do you make money from this? Well, let's look at Ethereum just as an example. Every single protect that runs on Ethereum has to pay \"gas\" fees on each transaction, this is paid in Ethereum. Ethereum already has 1000's of applications including VISA and MasterCard that constantly have a demand for Ethereum in order to operate and pay these gas fees. You as the investor holds the Ethereum they need and this creates supply and demand. Additionally, each time a company pays their gas fees, the gas is \"burnt\" (meaning Ethereum used to pay for the transaction is burnt) creating deflation. \n\nEthereum is just one project, and not one that I personally even invest in that much, but it's one that I'm sure most people have heard of.   \nIf you want to look at getting some crypto while it's currently on a low and has huge potentially to be the future of a new decentralised internet feel free to use my exchange code. Swyftx is aussie based exchange and you get 20% off fees with my code, plus I get a kick back [https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner](https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessage me if you want to know more",
