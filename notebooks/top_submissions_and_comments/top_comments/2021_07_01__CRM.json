The rules are constantly changing.\n\nIn my mind, it\u2019s always been far more important to maintain cash flow into my portfolio and invest in super high quality management in expanding markets that should compound quite well for decades. If I believe NET is a 500b company in 15-20 years, there\u2019s little reason to fuss about valuation, especially when it\u2019s such an imprecise art. I understand it being more difficult getting in now, as my cost basis is significantly lower in most of the companies you mentioned (low 40\u2019s in NET for example) but you really just need to commit to it.\n\nI also found it interesting that during the huge growth sell off, stocks like NET and CRWD didn\u2019t pull back as hard as a PTON ROKU or TDOC (all 5 of which I own) and they immediately made new highs, saw huge institutional accumulation, and saw some crazy volume. People want to own these stocks, and valuation can\u2019t reflect the qualitative.\n\nAlso, some of the items in your watchlist are cheaper than your portfolio btw, PINS ETSY CRM all have a fwd PE of 50-60 which is considerably lower than everything in your portfolio aside from the mega caps and probably CLF.\n\nI own CRWD NET ABNB PINS ETSY PTON SQ SOFI TSLA TDOC of everything you mentioned, and like most of the others.",

I guess I\u2019m a little worried that jumping in at a rich valuation would result in a lower than average market return - or rather the opportunity cost of not getting on the ground floor of a multibagger(even though it\u2019s a crapshoot)\n\nI also believe that value isn\u2019t dead, of course finding good companies with good business models and management is important, but you can also try to get the best price that you think you can get. I don\u2019t mean wait and hold cash for years hoping it drops to a certain price point, but to look for the best opportunities that you believe in is the future and providing you the best possible returns as well. \n\nThere\u2019s just so many companies with great tailwinds for the future, it\u2019s pretty much impossible for me to invest in all of them! So I\u2019m picking a few that I believe with give me the most bang for my buck (I think anyways)\n\nOn the topic of Etsy, I like the two acquisitions that they made but last quarter they also said about 30% of their revenue from sales was from masks. I wanted to get in when it sat at 160 but I didn\u2019t feel strongly enough before it jumped. I\u2019d like to see a few more consistent quarters to get enough conviction to invest in them. \n\nSame thing with PINS, they got a huge bump from COVID but I\u2019m sort of skeptical of how much they can grow, since I believe that it\u2019s a more niche social media platform than say a Facebook. Again I\u2019d like to observe a bit more and see what direction they\u2019re headed before I jump in.\n\nI\u2019ll look into CRM a bit more!

        "body": "I had some pretty decent results doing leaps call options.\nUsually buy ATM call options expiring 200 days and above.\n\nUsually chose blue chip companies that are stable.\nLike apple, Shopify, amazon, crm, tsmc, xlnx etc....\nMinimum requirement is that the company should be profitable for at least 4 quarters with 15% and above profit margin. These companies tend to rise slowly and steadily with time, so your longer expiration will give it time to play the senerio out \n\nA 10% rise in stock price will usually translate to a 20% options gain for u. And a 30% stick price increase will translate to a 50% gain for u.\n\nTry to avoid meme stocks and new spac companies and volatile companies as their sudden movement downwards will mean much greater depreciation for your options also. Example, a 30% drop in share price will translate to a 50% drop in your options price.\n\nEvery leaps options I have bought till now will be profitable some point in time. U just need to prevent greed and exit accordingly.\nSuggestion is to exit around the 50% profit mark or when the option is near the half way mark. Reason is that there is time decay associated with call options, so keeping it to expiry or keeping it too long is disadvantageous to you.\n\nBest of luck!",
