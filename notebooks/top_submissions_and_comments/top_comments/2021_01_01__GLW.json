I support everything you are doing and wish you luck but please be very careful. What I have seen in all those crisis is very few make money and the majority get burned. Just a word of caution that's all.\n\nMy belief is, the TPTB is behind it all and are doing very deceptive things to pass financial regulations. So they can take more control. There have been many movements that have tried to break TPTB and most have failed. The ones that were successful are because TPTB wanted it that way.\n\nBE STRONG FIGHT ON YOUNG BUCK!!!!",
