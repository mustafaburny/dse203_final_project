It doesn't matter whether Tesla had a bright future, I never denied that they have effective tech, an effective product and solid manufacturing potential. Tesla isn't going to collapse as a business. However, you can have great companies which are massively over-valued (think Cisco in dot-com era) and Tesla is one of these companies.\n\nTesla's current valuation doesn't make sense. In terms of EVs, VW is just a few % points behind Tesla in global market share (and has an equally bright future in this market) but is valued at 1/6 the value **despite having extensive market share in ICE markets**. That is absurd, Tesla made $31.5bn in revenue in 2020 whereas VW made $258bn in 2020. Fundamentally, the current valuation of Tesla is wrong. That's the problem with Tesla.",

The Fidelity indexes are good because their expense ratios are typically 0.01-0.02% since a computer is doing all the work instead of a human investment advisor. Higher expense ratios aren't necessarily bad if the human-operated fund beats the computer-operated fund by a large enough margin, but that happens less often than you might think.\n\nI'm a relatively risk averse person who nonetheless understands that the optimal amount of risk is not zero, so my investing paradigm is to invest more in lower-risk ventures and less in higher-risk ones.\n\nMy retirement savings are roughly:\n\n* 28% target-date fund (pre-tax account)\n* 22% Fidelity 500 (pre-tax account)\n* 17% Fidelity Mid Cap (pre-tax account)\n* 13% Fidelity Small Cap (pre-tax account)\n* 20% speculative investments in a slew of stocks with high growth potential (post-tax account)\n\nYour mix could look different depending on your own risk tolerance, but for my 2c it helps steel my nerves enough to take the bigger swings like in my post-tax account if I'm only swinging with a small percentage of my savings and the majority of it is in a safer place. There's always a trade-off between risk and reward, you will need to find the sweet spot where you feel most comfortable. At some point you may realize you're not comfortable with as much risk as you thought, and at some point you may realize that you'd be comfortable with more risk, and you can change your 401k allocations along the way to match your comfort level.",

It's far more secure and it's even quicker than pulling up an OTP code for sites that support the FIDO protocol directly, such as Coinbase and Gemini. For sites that don't support FIDO and still use OTP (what Authy/Google Auth is), Yubikey can do those too with a Yubico Authenicator app which requires your key to generate the codes.\n\nYubico's site has excellent setup guides and FAQs to get things going. The only downside is the expense, as you want to buy multiple keys to have a backup incase you lose your primary. But, if you've got a decent chunk of money to protect, spending a hundred bucks for a couple Yubikeys is well worth the vastly improved security.\n\nTradFi is so behind crypto on security models, it's insane. For Fidelity, TDA, and my three banks, they *all* only have SMS 2FA as an option, not even OTP. And for my trading platform, ThinkOrSwim, it doesn't have any 2FA at all to login and make trades.

But that\u2019s mostly because they haven\u2019t seen the historical data (hundreds of years of it). And they tend to draw a false equivalency between options trading/gambling and dollar-cost-averaging into VT or VTI\n\nI think a lot of it comes from accessibility and family influence: back in the day it used to cost a bunch of money to trade and it was super hard to do so most didn\u2019t even bother. And if your parents don\u2019t know anything about stocks, they won\u2019t teach you. I was lucky in that I grew up in a very stock-friendly household with CNBC going 24/7. I was aware of the market in elementary school lol but I recognize this isn\u2019t how most people grew up\n\nAnyways, yeah there\u2019s usually no need for financial advisors. Odds are they\u2019ll get complicated, try to get fees out of you and whatever they tell you will probably underperform VT or VTI anyway. Great choice with Fidelity by the way, they\u2019re an excellent broker. And even if you lost money giving into the hype on CLOV, hopefully you can consider it a cheap \u201cintro to the stock market course\u201d because at least it got you more involved\n\nAlso, just want to mention that there\u2019s probably no need to own VTI and VT/VXUS. If you already own all 3, I wouldn\u2019t bother selling though. Basically VTI is total US stock market, VT is total all stock market and VXUS is total non-US stock market so VT is just a combination of VTI/VXUS. Currently it\u2019s about 62% VTI and 38% VXUS because of the size of the US market but it\u2019s up to you how much you want to weight international. I tend to go less as I have a bit of a preference toward US stocks so I like the weighting you currently have\n\nAnd yeah, I still check my brokerage app way too often but oh well. Just don\u2019t ever panic sell even if the market crashes and try not to act on emotion. I remember people selling when the market was down 7-10% per day during March 2020, thinking they\u2019d buy back later, meanwhile I bought the entire time and the market rallied extremely quickly. Some are still waiting on the sidelines hoping they\u2019ll get the correction they were hoping for. Just remember the two key phrases \u201cmore money has been lost trying to anticipate corrections than lost in the corrections themselves\u201d and \u201ctime in the market beats timing the market\u201d",

I had trouble with that, and switched back.\n\nOne other thing I noticed, just in the past week or so, on Android, if I try to adjust the price of an existing limit order, I would consistently get a crash. So instead I just cancel and then submit a new one. Is that what is affecting you? But that is unusual, over the past year or so I can't remember any other problems.\n\nTheir free  desktop trader pro software is way better than the phone app.",

        "body": "Hello, I am 44 living in the US. I have $6,270 available to invest from my SEP-IRA and I am only 44 so I have 20 years for a long-term investment and I would prefer a high yield. I currently have $6,500 split between VOO and VOOV. Based on my amateur research, it seems that for long term gains I should be investing in international, not US, because the US economy isn't looking too great in the long term. Someone on this subreddit suggested VXUS, but Fidelity shows that fund as \"weak\" across the short/mid/long term. Are there any international funds that are a better bet? Thanks!",

I bought a full share of a stock on fidelity which was simple. About $8 is all the cash left in the fidelity account.  Is buying partial the same process?",

Instead of not paying any fees, across the board, as I do, you pay varying fees depending on which stock you buy.\n\nIt also has  $5 one-time investment fee, and a $2.50 recurring fee. Every time you trade there is a surcharge. Plus $.05 per share!\n\nWhat is the case for not \"trusting\" Fidelity? I understand the case for not trusting PFOF and trading apps, but those aren't the only brokerage options.",
