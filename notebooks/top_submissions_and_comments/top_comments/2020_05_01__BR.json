There are a few ways of thinking of it: I now have an asset worth $3.50, and I'd rather keep that than risk losing it for $1.50; I spent $1.50, and it's up by $2.00.  That's the house's money, and I'm going to let it ride, but I'll sell if it goes back to $1.50; I'm greedy and I want more.  The second one usually turns into \"Well, I was at $3.50, so that's what I deserve.  I'll wait for it to go back up.\"  More often than not, it goes the other way, and you lose all of your money.&lt;br /&gt;At some point, the risk is no longer worth the reward.  You have to decide what's right for you.  I'll almost always set a limit order, GTC for a target price.  There are many times when options trade for that price, you aren't watching, and it never comes back.  It's easier with spreads, because you're not sacrificing upside.\n2. Check which is worth more: stock price + put price or strike price.  If the former, sell both.  If the latter, exercise.  Don't forget commissions/exercise fee.",

        "body": "A lot of places were purchased with mortgages and costs too high to turn a profit with long term rentals.  Short term rentals turn much higher rent.  I don't have an exact multiple as it is region dependent.  However, it is pretty normal in the areas I'm familiar with for a rental in a vacation area to charge 1-2k per week, if it is a 2-3 BR townhouse size.  Similar places for long term rentals might yield 2-2.5k per month.  \n\nAlso, renting out single rooms on AirBNB in San Diego is typically around 60 per day.  Assume a 50% fill rate on that room and you are getting $1500 in rent per month off that single room in your house.  A long term rental on that single room is $750 to 1100, depending on area.  The 60 dollar per day rooms align moreso with the 750 per month rental areas.  Essentially, even if you are only filling that room half the time (which I think is reasonable from what I've seen), you are doubling your rent per month by using AirBNB.  \n\nNo factor all this in by saying that a lot of places are selling in San Diego assuming you will be able to use that rent towards your mortgage, jacking up the housing cost.  I'm looking for a place now and it is actually getting somewhat annoying how many 3 or even 2 BR houses are being rehabbed into 4 BR places with small BRs and no dens or family rooms, all so they can be marketed as more BRs for rental income.  Hell a lot of the places even advertise on zillow and realtor.com that the family room is perfectly sized to be converted into another BR and it would make the perfect investment property.  (That is almost word for word on 2 of the listings I recently looked at.)  Take away airBNB and a lot of people cannot afford the mortgages on the places they live in, or on their investment property they bought solely for short term rentals, even by shifting to LTR.",

It's going to represent most of what he does with his time when he retires, because blackberry is Satan's weed. As in, there is an open portal to Hell somewhere on this Earth, but Lucifer's hordes can't get through it because of all the blackberry.\n\nNobody delivers out here. Not within walking distance of any food place. Barely within walking distance of our mailbox (it's about 1/3 of a mile away). Comcast wants about $25K to run cable to the edge of our property, so DSL it is. I can pirate a 4k BR REMUX - it just takes a week. I don't play video games online; I'll probably never buy a video game console as long as I'm here because they are evolving into online-necessary machines. \n\nIn an emergency, our hospital is not fantastic. I have to drive a couple hundred miles to see bands that any of you have ever heard of. Or a play, symphony, stand-up, or major league sporting event. Quality ethnic food. I still haven't found good pizza; my brother literally shipped a pizza from our childhood hang about a thousand miles for my birthday once. It was half cooked there, put on dry ice, and I finished it in the oven. It was the best pizza I have had since moving up here. \n\nI do love it here.

I actually just started a wheel this week and used CSCO, selling a put about $0.50 OTM a week ago, expiring today for $0.63. Being new to this I screwed up and didn't buy to close with premiums at 0.08 on Wed and ended up buying to close today for 0.30 to avoid assignment. While I would've been fine with assignment I had made another mistake on Tues and doubled my exposure with even higher strike puts - I let that lot get assigned.\n\nMy point being, best case the stock didn't drop like 5% in the last two days and the contracts expired worthless and I'm up 1.5%. Safe play would've been to take 87% profits on Wed, good for 1.32% on the week. Was this just a crap week or am I making a fundamental mistake beyond not locking in profits?",

        "body": "This sort of discussion is why r/investing finds WSB a joke. But I still love my WSB memes.\n\n\\- It's clearly overvalued, even a fully retarded understanding of FA will show you that.Even after the recent drop it's valued at around 40x REVENUES (LOL), not EARNINGS. Other tech stocks have nowhere near these valuations. FB has a revenue multiple of around 8. Difference is FB and other stocks actually have a decent chunk of revenue converted ( and will continue to be converted to revenue) to EARNINGS. ZM has almost ZERO prospects of converting even a fraction of this revenue into earnings due to :\n\n\\- Bigger,better competition with massive amounts of capital to invest compared to ZOOM. Google, MSFT, FB, CISCO, ADOBE. Do you really think that if there was that much money to be made in the videoconferencing sector ZM will even have any significant market share a short time from now?  What kind of earnings or margin do you see be made on this small market share, if any? These companies have just cloned what worked for Zoom and offered it for free through their existing interlinked platforms. Offered a similar ( and eventually better) product for FREE, not a great investment thesis for ZM longer term. Video conferencing is NOT a high tech, heavily patented sector, it's essentially freeware longer term. The software development is basic and we wouldn't even be talking about Zoom if it wasn't for beer aids. \n\n\\- Beer aids has peaked, at least fear of it has. People will start going back to offices around the world soon, no long term thesis for zoom's current price. One of the first things struggling businesses and companies cut during downturns is non-essential IT expenses, so like I said, even if you think a recession/possibly depression is likely (I do) you would cut zoom use across the company and move to a free platform.\n\n\\-ZM was clearly a meme stock bought buy poor , first time normies or mum and dad investors that was happily dumped on them shortly after the IPO. Fuck me, to get and idea of the average investor just remember that ZOOM ticker mooned because investors didn't even bother to check the right ticker for this pile of shit and bought the wrong company. ZOOM trading was even suspended lol. Being a med-long investor on ZM is like flying a booking a spaceflight where everyone on the vessel including the flight crew tell you BEFOREHAND that they are mongoloids but you still buy a ticket anyway. \n\n\\- Security issues, zoombombing, shit load of existing tech companies exploiting the shit out of these stuff ups as they ramp up their own products. The power google,FB and others have using their advertising budget and other media platforms to promote their own product shouldn't be underestimated - just look at the propaganda that been put out by big tech the last few days.\n\n\\- Friday was just a tiny dead cat bounce with people taking profits and/or some market makers covering their spreads on expiration, the drop was anticipated but happened a bit quicker than many were expecting imo. That's my retards opinion on the open interest and the put/call ratio activity anyway. There where a shit load of calls on this and still are that are now way OTM and will expiry useless over the next couple of weeks and have already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- How many more reasons do you need? This is WSB, Elon bipolar rant over. Iv'e been short on this dumpster fire since the 7% below the top, mostly unbalanced butterflys and backspreads and I even gone full retard at points and just bought straight puts occasionally. They have been printing but to be honest I feel a bit sorry for the mum and dad investors who bought this cos they saw their kids using the app - they are not stupid, probably smarter than me most of them- but they have been handed this pile of shit by CNBC and analysts who work for the same banks that made fees on the IPO and selling on the spike.",
