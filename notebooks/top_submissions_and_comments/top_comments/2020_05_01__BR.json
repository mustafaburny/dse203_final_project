I would normally say the same thing about it being the same game over and over, but rolling out a strategic, cross platform Battle Royale was brilliant. It\u2019s genuinely incredibly fun, this coming from someone who got sick of playing CoD 10 years ago. I don\u2019t consider Warzone comparable to just another CoD game, and anytime you introduce micro transactions you\u2019re gonna snag some whales. And they offer free weekends for the main game which will convince some to buy that as well. It really was a great move for them to jump into the BR craze, but actually do a damn good job doing it.\n\nI am slightly biased as I am a sucker for battle royales, played early fortnite -&gt; Seasons 1-3 of apex legends -&gt; now Warzone, but this one really has some staying power in my opinion on cross platform alone. And with the lockdowns it just blew up at like the exact right time for them.\n\nI will be setting a stop loss at +10% so I\u2019m just gonna ride it out and see where it goes otherwise.

There are a few ways of thinking of it: I now have an asset worth $3.50, and I'd rather keep that than risk losing it for $1.50; I spent $1.50, and it's up by $2.00.  That's the house's money, and I'm going to let it ride, but I'll sell if it goes back to $1.50; I'm greedy and I want more.  The second one usually turns into \"Well, I was at $3.50, so that's what I deserve.  I'll wait for it to go back up.\"  More often than not, it goes the other way, and you lose all of your money.&lt;br /&gt;At some point, the risk is no longer worth the reward.  You have to decide what's right for you.  I'll almost always set a limit order, GTC for a target price.  There are many times when options trade for that price, you aren't watching, and it never comes back.  It's easier with spreads, because you're not sacrificing upside.\n2. Check which is worth more: stock price + put price or strike price.  If the former, sell both.  If the latter, exercise.  Don't forget commissions/exercise fee.",

        "body": "A lot of places were purchased with mortgages and costs too high to turn a profit with long term rentals.  Short term rentals turn much higher rent.  I don't have an exact multiple as it is region dependent.  However, it is pretty normal in the areas I'm familiar with for a rental in a vacation area to charge 1-2k per week, if it is a 2-3 BR townhouse size.  Similar places for long term rentals might yield 2-2.5k per month.  \n\nAlso, renting out single rooms on AirBNB in San Diego is typically around 60 per day.  Assume a 50% fill rate on that room and you are getting $1500 in rent per month off that single room in your house.  A long term rental on that single room is $750 to 1100, depending on area.  The 60 dollar per day rooms align moreso with the 750 per month rental areas.  Essentially, even if you are only filling that room half the time (which I think is reasonable from what I've seen), you are doubling your rent per month by using AirBNB.  \n\nNo factor all this in by saying that a lot of places are selling in San Diego assuming you will be able to use that rent towards your mortgage, jacking up the housing cost.  I'm looking for a place now and it is actually getting somewhat annoying how many 3 or even 2 BR houses are being rehabbed into 4 BR places with small BRs and no dens or family rooms, all so they can be marketed as more BRs for rental income.  Hell a lot of the places even advertise on zillow and realtor.com that the family room is perfectly sized to be converted into another BR and it would make the perfect investment property.  (That is almost word for word on 2 of the listings I recently looked at.)  Take away airBNB and a lot of people cannot afford the mortgages on the places they live in, or on their investment property they bought solely for short term rentals, even by shifting to LTR.",

Since this is not a liquidation BR, I don't expect the stock value to drop to zero immediately (but my puts would welcome that if it were to happen).\n\nTrading may resume after they figure out how to handle the reorganization. JCP continued to trade after BR. They were delisted from the stock market because it fell out of compliance in August. It was scheduled to be delisted before BR was declared. I believe it still trades either OTC or pink sheets under a different ticker, but I haven't determined that for a fact. \n\nIf the stock does not resume trading, I think it will have to be given a value determined by total assets and liabilities, and the value may be zero. At that point, the options should be \"marked to market\", that is, base the option values on that closing price. So the options would be priced at just their intrinsic value.

I ran a tech startup from unincorporated county; I've also boiled snow for water to flush toilets because the pump failed in a snowstorm. No joke, had to process three baby rabbit deaths yesterday, all within about ten feet of our house. \n\nMy dad and I fight blackberry. It's going to represent most of what he does with his time when he retires, because blackberry is Satan's weed. As in, there is an open portal to Hell somewhere on this Earth, but Lucifer's hordes can't get through it because of all the blackberry.\n\nNobody delivers out here. Not within walking distance of any food place. Barely within walking distance of our mailbox (it's about 1/3 of a mile away). Comcast wants about $25K to run cable to the edge of our property, so DSL it is. I can pirate a 4k BR REMUX - it just takes a week. I don't play video games online; I'll probably never buy a video game console as long as I'm here because they are evolving into online-necessary machines. \n\nIn an emergency, our hospital is not fantastic. I have to drive a couple hundred miles to see bands that any of you have ever heard of. Or a play, symphony, stand-up, or major league sporting event. Quality ethnic food. I still haven't found good pizza; my brother literally shipped a pizza from our childhood hang about a thousand miles for my birthday once. It was half cooked there, put on dry ice, and I finished it in the oven. It was the best pizza I have had since moving up here. \n\nI do love it here.

Oh and I get the SSO using Microsoft/Google security included so don't have to spend another $10 per user per month on an Okta login?
