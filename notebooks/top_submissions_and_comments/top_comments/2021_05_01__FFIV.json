        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC, BTCX or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

That's what got me to trust the process.\n\nI opened a  3915/3940/4065/4090 Iron Condor the Thursday before Easter. Thought the long weekend would help me with theta. Didn't pay attention to the jobs report coming out that Friday. Monday comes and SPX spikes. Rolled up my puts to 4025/4050 for more premium and to try to mitigate losses. Should have bailed earlier in the day at a $2k loss, but waited it out, ended up taking a $3.8k loss. Made it all back through the week and ended up +$300 by that Friday. But that is the only time I would have lost. But only because I didn't pay attention to upcoming market events.\n\nOpened a 0DTE 4100/4120 on 4/14. Was still stinging from the $4k loss a week before. Watched it dropping. Literally spend 2 hours in a gaming setup with fingers on the up/down keys and hand on the mouse adjusting my limits. Rode it from a $4k loss to $60 gain to $2k loss, roller coaster. Closed at a $159 loss with 45 seconds left in the trading day. Closed at 4124, so I would have been fine. But had $20k collateral riding on it and couldn't risk that for a $550 premium.\n\nThen monday, opened a 0DTE  4165/4175 spread. Panicked and sold at a $700 loss. Recovered right after I sold and closed at 4191. So would have been fine. That's what changed my thinking to letting it play out and trusting the deltas.\n\nsince 3/22, I've run 31 credit spreads and 16 iron condors. only had the 3 total losses above and 2 of them would have been gains if i had trusted the process. Even with the losses, I'm still up $8,800 in a month and a half.",

First I need to sleep on time so I can actually be awake to trade \ud83e\udd23\n\nThere are a lot of channels on YouTube, none quite like this guy. I recommend watching his oldest stuff. He mentions his big strategy almost every video. I recommend taking the free \"cycles timing indicator\" seminar too.\n\nAnyway if you can find his entire strategy and learn how to apply it, the pieces are scattered through several videos. Learn to read momentum.\n\nHe likes to find rare indicators for new videos. Honestly he could continue just making videos with the same examples and it would still be a good channel. Just relearning the same few keys over and over.\n\nAgain, mindset. Be humble, but not impatient.\n\nIf I see an entry developing but I'm too early, I often either get stopped out just before profit, or my profit isn't great (like under 1% or under risk). In those cases I've been taking slightly larger risk so I don't get stopped (and I don't place a stop loss, I just watch like a hawk). The thing that helped me here is \"would I enter here if I was going to buy options to take this trade?\" and normally I get a better entry because I want everything to be perfect. Just getting past the options spread can be tough in an hour or two.\n\nSo perfecting the entry makes more money and reduces risk. If a trade isn't going to work out, it should be obvious soon by the indicators, they'll negate the entry relatively soon.\n\nThe PDT rule helps in the beginning because you only get 2 or 3 shots per week. So you're looking for the perfect entry. Or if you have a margin account you can trade with unsettled funds. I like to hold stocks overnight, then sell during the day, and buy back later. This doesn't count as a daytrade so I can take 5 trades per week.\n\nIf everything goes well I should have over 25k in my account within the next 100 trades or so, maybe by the end of the year.

There\u2019s collateral.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know if the bank that\u2019s earning interest is really getting paid in your scenario, but I\u2019m assuming that this debt is just getting kicked down the road.  Eventually, there\u2019s going to be a tipping point where the borrower can\u2019t borrow any more to pay the interest, and the bank is going to want to collect their earnings.\n\nSo, maybe they can roll it for a while, which is what they\u2019re doing.

Last March this thing was a dead horse at 6 bucks then all hell broke loose .\n\n...multiple factors contributed to the greatest run on ammo as long as I have been in the industry ..8 years now. ..national emergency with Covid, Civil Unrest, Police Brutality..looting in Santa Monica, CA of all places, Massive influx of new buyers..the list goes on. \n\nObama was no match for this.  \n\nIt started March 12th 2020 and has been outrageous sales EVERY SINGLE day 417 days in a row!!!!!. Can't keep anyting in stock. Vista has a massive market share(Federal, Blazer, CCI, Speer, American Eagle and now Remington) This is THE ammo stock. They also hold the keys to primer manufacturing which is the reason we are in this mess. The primer shortage caused a backlog and then 10 million new gun buyers wanted to feed their new toys. \n\nSuper Demand City and no Supply easy math. As far as timing..this thing still has some juice left in it I believe and that's because they've had some price increases and recently stated they are behind a billion dollars in orders.\n\nPrice Targets range from 35-49. A consensus buy across the board on most outlets.  I believe all time high was 52 and change..it has a serious shot at beating that.  I have personally spent a year watching and running with this stock.  Seriously hours daily researching this for over a year.\n\nThe negative is there is low volume to move this thing. It's insane. It has taken a big jump, but over 14 months.\n\nThe earnings probably hit 575 million in this report and might break earnings record. It was at 38 not too long ago.  I've owned this since last March at an average of 7.80. I have taken profits twice so far. I now have stock and 35 dollar calls to hit May 21st which are green and also some 40 dollar hail mary calls as well. Those could be dreamers, but I work in this field and it never ends. Phones ringing off the hook..lines all day long.  I can't and won't give you advice on what to do with your hard earned money, but I do believe this company has a serious positive short term outlook.\n\nBest of luck Champ",

This will only continue as more and more serious institutions start to get it and don't want china to control them. \n\n&gt;The ecological impact of running computers to support BTC is insane and currently unsustainable.\n\nEnergy consumption of Bitcoin is lower then our current monetary system (banks, visa etc) in relative terms. There's also a clear trend to sustainable energy usage since mining is location independent and is a way to profit off of otherwise unusable land and wasted energy (deserts/surplus of the power grid etc.)\n\n&gt;Nobody knows the exact origin of BTC, so nobody really knows if there is a back door to hack\n\nKnowing who Satoshi is is irrelevant in terms of hacking. The entire code of the protocol is public since it started. Bitcoin is an open source project and anyone can look at the code if they want to. There are no backdoors and there's no way to build one unless you want the whole world to see it. \n\n&gt;there are a number of early early adopters that hold a huge amount and can tank the market anytime they decide to sell their billions of dollars worth of BTC\n\nOnly point that's fair imo. Although there's something to be said that the market can tank it by now and it won't be the end of Bitcoin. Also I doubt these individuals would voluntarily trigger a market crash by selling billions at once. They obviously believe in Bitcoin's future or lost their keys otherwise they wouldn't have stayed committed to their holdings for this long. \n\n&gt;I think blockchain is a tech that is here to stay, but current versions are basically beta tests.\n\nSmart contract platforms and everything build on them are still in beta/early adopter territory but Bitcoin isn't. Banks and the biggest financial institutions don't adopt technologies that are in \"beta\" Bitcoin is a trillion dollar asset and on it's way to cross the chasm to the early majority.",

Interesting but full of conjecture and vague suppositions, typical for that kind of pitch \"people disagree with me but this is because they are stupid and are part of the machine\"\n\n If VCs where prone to believe every similar line of reason they read like Dan's they would invest after every one of thousands of hockey stick presentations they see. Here is one such gem based on emotional appeal to the outsider:\n\n\"The idea that Satoshi perfectly crafted Bitcoin on the first try is unfathomable for them to consider.\" \n\nTo which the first commentor correctly replies \"Because it's unfathomable that this is true\" and there you have the summary of the two sides of the argument.\n\nEven a brief browse through the Wikipedia entry for Bitcoin will tell you as much based on its history.\n\nThere are so many other problems with BtC but let's just choose one and let's also apply another line if reasoning: how secure is it in a physical sense? People are keeping their keys on physical media in safety deposit boxes at multiple banks because they are rightly concerned people can and would kill them for their Bitcoin or otherwise steal it. Many people who used services for their wallet have been burnt hard. We have laws about the fiet money proceeds of such crimes but people who own BTC do well to be concerned. Whose jurisdiction does solving a theft of Bitcoin actually fall under? Where exactly is Satoshi if he is even a real person? If he is not dead it's pretty dangerous to be him.\n\nThe truth is that BTC is flawed and will be changed/replaced as people solve problems with it. As such it will become obsolete or be updated and when that happens it will be vulnerable and Dans reasoning is flawed on this basis.\n\nI have no doubt there is utility for crypto. I just think investing in any particular technology as an investment asset will be demonstrated to be a huge mistake in 15 years when when we look back on the crypto bubble of 20xx. Many of the Dotcom companies had value there was still a bubble. Except now with crypto we have perfected this bubble. For Dotcom and firms pretended to have value and products or services. \n\nBottom line: Dan is invested",

Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?\n\nOnce you've driven off the fiat ramp, you actually own and control your crypto keys, which can't be said about a centralized bank account. No one needs to verify or check that you're swapping some ETH for another token or buying an NFT to trade. There's no transaction limits. However, there is a varying degree of responsibility (security practices, properly tracking and paying taxes, etc) and a learning curve to get over.\n\nI remember the time it clicked for me: I was able to pay and settle an advertising deal in a few seconds to another country with just their ETH address. No IBAN or SWIFT or adding a payee and waiting for a wire transfer to execute and settle. You can transmit value from one address to another without a middle person and transparency track the transaction. The receiving party can opt to convert their crypto to fiat or a stablecoin, which is pegged to fiat but can be exchanged through various chains and later converted to fiat and into a traditional bank account.\n\nCrypto happened to change my life forever. I got in and out when I did, but there's always someone else who got in earlier or lower than you--you'll rarely sell at the top. Accepting the reality of your decisions is an individualistic emotional exercise. The markets have been working in bull/bear cycles so far; gains are gains after all. Set your goals and try to stick with them or just wait things out until something becomes significant to your situation. Do not take this as investment advice but I would want to see a many month trend of lower prices to buy in long term. Now or anytime is great for short term activity despite the historically high prices.\n\nThe whole thing of crypto having no intrinsic value is a pretty sloppy argument that I've been hearing for years. Crypto isn't traditional finance or regulated as such. I don't believe anything has intrinsic value. An individual and society give value to things. Sometimes you don't need a persistent or objective value to make gains in the short term. If you're getting stuck at this part, maybe crypto isn't for you in this form.\n\nAll of the naysayers out there have their own beliefs and opinions. Some of my friends felt the same 4-5 years ago and I wonder if they ever came around. Not everyone is going to be ready at the same time. You can be scared about something new or not understand it, but that doesn't make anything more or less true. It also doesn't get you closer to exploring a new frontier. I can attest that through the noise, there is enough incentive that everyone should at least hedge a little into crypto. Just owning a little gives an inherent incentive to learn more about what you bought. You may not like it or understand everything, but it's an experience where you will at least come out knowing more than you started with, even if your portfolio goes into the dumps for a while.\n\nObviously 10,000+ coins won't all have value in the future. Many are just clones or created as iterations of other ideas and code. I still dabble with things and own a little of various coins that are both well-known and just for fun as moonshot bets. I believe in a cashless society and crypto is in the frontier of facilitating that eventual transition into the future decades. How big of a part it will play is anyone's guess.",

        "body": "Yes, as a Canadian, there are multiple exchanges available to us such as Newton, ShakePay, NDAX, WealthSimple Crypto, and some Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",
