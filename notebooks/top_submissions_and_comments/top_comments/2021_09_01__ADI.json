        "body": "Oh I see.  I just found another article written this morning. It seems like the Judge is saying Apple would have to re-write their rules and could require the 30% for payments made using alternative payment methods.  But this would have to be worked out by a newly written contract.  \n\n\u201cIn particular, there\u2019s a real threat that Apple will still be able to impose the so-called Apple tax on whatever new payment system is allowed. In theory, the App Store\u2019s commissions are levied to support the entire store, not just the payment system, and in her ruling, the judge considers the idea of Apple allowing alternate payment methods but requiring the same 30 percent cut via audits or other systems. (My colleague Adi explores this in the seventh section of her deep dive on the ruling, under the heading \u201cApple could collect an \u2018Apple Tax\u2019 even without in-app payment charges.\u201d) If that\u2019s borne out in an actual legal order, the door would slam shut on alternate payment systems pretty quickly.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671574/epic-apple-app-store-new-rules-meaning-ruling-decision)",

ASML bought Cymer...  \n\nThe real trick would be if ASML found a means to help with implementation of the tools. Intel held back using EUV b/c they didn't want to take the risk. ASML would have done better if Intel was more confident in the roadmap. \n\nAt the same time, single-digit process nodes may not be the only answer. \n\nThe need for analog-to-digital chips only increases: ADI and TXN would be the primary beneficiaries here. \n\n Specialists will also benefit: eg, those haptic chips in the Sony PlayStation Controller will be in more and more devices in the future too. \n\nNetworking tends to be a bottleneck ... whoever solves latency problems (Tesla?!) at scale might do very well also\n\nSK is splitting in half ... not sure that's the angle since I believe the dram biz will be part of a larger VC-type business going after themes like the metaverse",

They are in the a lot of sectors like the health, automation of factories, EV and automotive, mobile phones and I probably forget something.\n\nIntel -\nThey are getting heavier and heavier into chip production and the CEO's view is that in a few years car prices will mostly be based on chip prices (he pretty much said 80% of the price by 2050 I think). They are making their Irish factory focus on car chips. They are also getting for the first time into the gaming GPU market with a multi-year plan for gaming GPU releases. They are also investing heavily into chip manufacturing by both $90 bil investment in creating factories in Europe and also creating a foundry in the USA with investment from the US government.\n\nImho, Intel is way undervalued for what they have going for the future.",
