Bounces off lower part of channel/holding 50 day MA, then moons to the top of channel cuz shorts get fucked\n\nNo resistance til $16/17 at the top of channel\n\nGonna watch pre market volume. Anything above 50k ish per 5 min candle and it's jumping because that'll give the 50Mil + volume it needs to break resistance around $14-14.5. Huge unusual option activity last week in 10/9 and 10/16 $16C/$17C\n\nI'm already in big but will add more if this plays out like that",

I\u2019m holding that medium term. There is of course msft, Apple, mastercard some of the usual high ROE suspects. Then I have my side projects like KBAL an office furniture company (I know talk about bad growth ops) but that I believe is being unfairly penalized in the market and I believe they\u2019re a good value play right now. Also they have a good debt situation and plenty of cash relative to their size. In addition I invested in NMIH at the bottom which deals with private mortgage insurances. That play has doubled and I\u2019m confident that it will continue to go up. There\u2019s a bunch of others these are just what I came up with top of head.

No sell rule would have me risk averse and wanting to make picks that will pace with, or close to, the market in a worst case scenario with low risk of a major flame out.\n\nThe more fun list:\nLRCX - it\u2019s more and more of a tech driven world, they\u2019re an innovative leader helping enable it to happen.\n\nSQ - if they can become what they\u2019re trying to then they\u2019ll be the fin-tech leader in 10 years.\n\nCRM - not only a current leader in the SaaS space, but they\u2019ve consistently made solid acquisitions and great investments. This just seems to be one of the best run companies right now, and I\u2019d wager on them staying one of the growth leaders over the next 5-10 years.\n\nAMZN - History says their growth will slow, but do you really want to bet against their world takeover given only the knowledge we currently have? \n\nVEEV - I should have bought in years ago, drug trials aren\u2019t stopping and there isn\u2019t currently any meaningful competition for their market. Not only do they have the first mover advantage, I can see it being very sticky even with competitors given the nature of the customer base.",

        "body": "DD: I talked to a veteran of the semiconductor/microchip industry yesterday about the current state of play. Here\u2019s the background. Please chime in if anything seems incorrect or misleading. \n\nAs many know, INTC used to be king and AMD was a hobbled minor competitor. NVDA were the graphics guys. \n\nThere are 3 major manufacturers: INTC (mostly for Intel chips, they do manufacture for others but not significant amounts), TSMC, and Samsung. NVDA uses TSMC, as does AMD. Samsung is mostly memory chips, whereas TSMC and INTC are doing processor chips, so not always direct competitors. \n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is that INTC is losing a ton of market share that has been locked up for decades, causing all other stocks to rise as a reflection of the increased growth potential as they gobble that up. This has been a trend for many years and is now accelerating as INTC continues to shit the bed. \n\nThe other big piece is ARM. INTC wrote the instruction set for PC chips, called x86. All PCs run on x86, so INTC has a big advantage there because they control the instruction set. However, mobile devices, tablets and IOT devices do NOT use x86, they use ARM. So if NVDA buys arm they get that same advantage INTC has for PCs and the mobile side (which is the growing segment ofc)\n\nAMD buying Xilinx is less of a big deal, paying a bunch of money to take out a competitor and fill some gaps in AMD\u2019s product capabilities. \n\nBottom line is that all non-INTC companies are doing well bc computing is growing and INTC is losing market share. Long term, NVDA is poised to be the new intel and AMD\u2019s growth will be more short-lived, unless Bae makes some different moves and changes the trajectory. TSMC kinda wins no matter what, as long as INTC keeps losing. \n\nBears r fuk",

CashApp has bitcoin though so thats nice. PayPal has credit options, banking options, gifting, pay to merchant, and may more protective services. There is a reason Elon Musk made a lot of money selling it lol.\n\nYou also underestimate the number of merchants that have paypal directly integrated which allows me to bypass needing my debit card on me or saved to my browser etc. Its much safer to use a bypass like PayPal as they act as a protected intermediary between you, your merchant, and your bank account. Thats huge - and Apple products are exclusively owned by a very small percentage of the overall market. Same with Chase Pay, google pay etc. They have to rely on people going all in on their products whereas PayPal works with all of them.",

They have so much available capital they can grow into wherever they want to. Also, they continue to vertically integrate aspect of their business, saving millions and millions every year. I wouldn't doubt Amazon is a $10k/share company in 10 years.\n\nNvidia. They lead their share of the market pretty significantly, while I think their growth will slow down as companies like AMD grow more fierce in their competition, Nvidia also has their AI which I think (at least for a period of time) will be highly saught after as we move closer to automation I'm vehicles and everywhere else.\n\nMicrosoft. Great run company, also has capital to expand where they want, they've got completive cloud and they make shareholders happy. It's gonna be hard for them to lose shareholder support.\n\nCoca Cola. They're massive and while they don't dive in the snack industry, they can. And even without it they dominate the Bev industry and usually end up buying out small companies that may be disruptive.\n\nPaypal. This one is a bit more of a stretch but I think eventually cash will be entirely obsilete and companies like Square and PayPal will step in to be dominant forces. But there are other competitors like Apple/Google pay as well.",

        "body": "So I like calendar spreads because they\u2019re risk defined positions; your max loss is the cost of entry. It can be neutral, bullish, or bearish; just depends how you feel about the stock. \n\nYou sell a short call (or put) 4-6 weeks out, and buy the same strike call/put a month further out. If the options are normally priced and IV for the stock is low, it should be a positive (long greater than short) delta (slightly; delta is your option price chance per $1 change in the underlying), theta (time decay per day), and vega (option price change per 1% move in IV, up or down) position. Gamma (change in delta per $1 change in underlying) is usually negative (short is higher than the long) so that\u2019s something to keep an eye on, but the theta decay and vega should more than offset gamma for while. \n\nSo with IV rising as earnings approaches, your short leg should increase in value, but so does your long leg. And as IV increase, theta also increases, much more so on the short leg. That\u2019s where you make your money. \n\nFor earnings, if I\u2019m bullish, I generally pick a strike about 5-10% OTM. My short leg expires the week of earnings; I rarely play monthly positions unless the earnings line up that week. In a perfect world, I\u2019ll hit that strike price the day earnings are announced and I can close around 100%. \n\nIf you\u2019re just playing a stock that\u2019s been stuck in a channel for a while (airlines and banks, recently), you can just open a position at the nearest strike price, call or put, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \n\nLastly, sometimes you\u2019ll get lucky and IV on the short leg will drop. This happened to me on a $PYPL position this week. Friday morning I opened my account and saw my $3-3.50 positions had moved to $5.25. $PYPL doesn\u2019t have earnings for a few more weeks, but my personal rule is 50% gains or better and I close that day. So I took my money and ran. \n\nTheta Gang isn\u2019t sexy. It\u2019s slow. It\u2019s boring. And there sure as shit aren\u2019t any 10 baggers to be bad. But you can almost consistently turn 10-20% profits per month without much effort, and you\u2019ll profit on 70% of your trades. They just take discipline to manage, and you\u2019ve got to do some research before entering a position.",
