Today it was like 79:1 - because it has been suppressed so long.\n\nSilver has industrial uses of \\~2m oz/day.  Silver itself is a pretty thin market anyways, so it tends to be volatile when supply/demand moves it around. Miners aren't really operating at full steam either, so supply is shorting up - and people still need silver for phones/TVs/Medical stuff/etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround March 23, the COMEX started settling Metals with PHYSICAL.  What this means is that the banks (mainly JPM) had to stop shorting (selling) Silvers futures contracts, or else they would have to pull Silver from their vault and actually deliver it to buyers.  JPM can only pull so much physical out of their vault, before they have none.  What you are seeing is Banks slowly unwinding their shorts which is price positive as Silver tries to find a new \"natural\" level compared to gold.  I would expect something like a 40:1 silver/gold ratio initially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Fed is printing by the billions. This causes is inflation.  The Federal Reserve has already said they are going to let inflation run for a bit, and cap interest rates around 2% - we are near record lows for home mortgages again.  This means, that lets say inflation is 3%, well if the bond market is only earning 2%, then the REAL effective interest rate is -1%.  This is MASSIVELY price positive for metals. Metals are 0% assets, you can't eat your pet rock - but it doesn't go at -1% either.  One thing to watch is $TIP - as it goes higher, metals will follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo with all the economic worry of the Fed printing money, and negative REAL interest rates, people are seeking a safe haven for a foundational asset.  This is causing a MASSIVE run on metals - and people can take physical delivery from the COMEX.  Last month, a record # of people are standing for physical delivery at COMEX, and I expect this to continue. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/gold-traders-issue-largest-delivery-notice-on-record-at-comex?sref=kn8A42Ij&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-commodities&amp;utm\\_content=commodities&amp;utm\\_source=twitter&amp;utm\\_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm\\_medium=social](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/gold-traders-issue-largest-delivery-notice-on-record-at-comex?sref=kn8A42Ij&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-commodities&amp;utm_content=commodities&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are in the middle of a massive historic run on metals, and the banks cant short(sell) Silver anymore.  So we have tons of buyers, and no sellers - price goes up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nCraig Hemke is THE Metals guy - he talks about ALL of this in this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EOPKizJ\\_Y4&amp;t=679s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EOPKizJ_Y4&amp;t=679s))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. We are in the middle of a run on metals\n2. There are no metals sellers\n3. Price goes up\n4. This week was super bullish and Thursday night we saw profit taking and a pullback on Friday - MASSIVELY bullish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI expect $75 Silver EOY, $60 around Halloween. Silver is already +127.4% YTD.",

Microsoft eventually redeemed itself, but not after putting its shareholders underwater for 13 years.\n- Chevron reentered Dow on Feb 19 2008, 120% higher than November 1999, replacing **Honeywell**.

You should all know what happened to $BAC over the next year. $MO is up 300% after being booted from the Dow.\n- AIG replaced International Paper in April 2004. $IP is a lousy company indeed and has only gained about 60% since then, but $AIG got obliterated during the GFC and was booted from Dow on September 22 2008 after suffering 95% loss.\n\n------------\n\nDow has also done many things very right, such as:\n\n- Replace Woolworth with Wal-Mart in 1997\n- Replace Sears with Home Depot in 1999, although $HD actually underperformed Sears until at least 2008 \n- Replace Kodak with Pfizer in 2004, Kodak went bankrupt in 2012\n- Replace Kraft with UnitedHealthcare in 2012\n- Replace Alcoa with Nike and Hewlett-Packard with Visa in 2013\n- Replace AT&amp;T with Apple in 2015",

MA is able to easily work with multiple of those companies and they're using their global presence pretty well, that's why they're my pick for the fintech industry.\n\nThey launched Mastercard Accelerate last year, implementing those online paying platforms and letting start-ups take advantage of their global presence to grow and transform very fast. Last year they acquired Ethoca (managing e-commerce fraud) and Vyze (platform to connect merchants with multiple renders, giving them the opportunity to get those financial needs for start-ups). MA is basically helping start-ups to grow faster, which will result in more financial transactions in the future.\n\nLast but not least, they like to focus on expanding to countries where there isn't much competition yet. They are expanding their exposure to Middle East and Africa, working with local networks and e-commerce platforms. They are in a strong position to capitalize those regions in the future and take on market leader Visa even more.\n\nThey get compared a lot to Visa, so I'll expand on that subject a bit as well. While V is focussing on performance and speed, MA plays the cyber security card. They are already working on ways to implement cryptocurrency and Mastercard tend to have more growth potential vs stability from market leader Visa. While V is in the lead, MA is more widely used by fintech companies, which shows potential take-over in the future. Next to their credit services, they also own debit service Maestro, which is widely used in Europe.\n\n**Financial**\n\nReturns as high as 150% (ROE) and 60% (ROIC). Very large margins and perfectly stable balance sheet. High EPS growth YoY, 53% and 42% in the last two years. Quick ratio 1.87. V has more assets and even bigger margins, however MA wins in returns and cash. In terms of more growth, I like to focus on those last numbers more.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIt's a blue chip at a $300B market cap. Their growth potential might be limited, although I see them as one of the better picks between blue chips.",

The losses surmounted from buying high from fomo and panic selling low at the bottom (Flair should be warren buffet)  My portfolio has officially bottomed out, but as an options trader on WSB, that $260 is enough to make a comeback from anything which is where my new journey to 40K will begin. \n\nCurrent positions to begin are BJ 50C 9/18 &amp; 7 BJ 55c 9/18 currently down 45%. Also some worthless deeeeep otm debit spreads on AAPL. From here on out, the only way to go from here is up. Wish me luck everyone",

We have been partially shut down for going on two quarters now yet there has not been massive layoffs that should be expected. Sure a couple small fries fell out but thats to be expected, I dont think many people were surprised when HTZ or JCP decided to throw in the towel.\n\nPrinting is bad for the value of the dollar. For instance if I have a carton of milk and it costs 1 dollar but next month the amount of dollars in circulation double than the price of the carton of milk should therortically double as well. By this theory tangable assets are a hedge during an inflationary period against the devaluation of currency as their value will increase as the value of the currency decreases. The problem with this is that people think \"look at me I'm getting rich\" because they bought $100k in gold and sold a year later for $200k as the currency devalued, when in actuality they are just treading water and have the same amount of purchasing power with their currency at both points in time. The only way to actually turn a \"profit\" during inflation is to properly dump your assets during the future period of deflation during which time you may not find a potential buyer as they have decided the price is to high and will instead wait until the currency has corrected to make their purchase.\n\nWords and stuff, I hope that makes sense. Basically the worst position in a period of inflation is cash the best position is tangible assets and visa versa during deflation.",

Bought nine shares of Amazon and let that ride until July 13th, where I sold it at $3100 because I got scared it would drop. I also bought Delta @$32 (sold that for a loss at $28). Bought 3000 shares of USAS after selling Amazon because someone on another forum said it was a good buy ($2500 profit here was the direct result of luck, I had no knowledge of USAS' business, valuation, etc. - again, I got lucky, and don't want to do that again). Over that time I lost a good bit guessing what Tesla stock would do - I had two different days where I lost like $600 in about 10 minutes...you know, when you buy high and sell low...pretty sure I took years off my life too as my heartbeat was like 200 BPM, lost a little with Visa, and made a trivial amount with AMD.\n\nThere were a fair amount of small plays where I made / lost $100 or less. Over time I imagine all those ended up basically even. I didn't keep the 800 or so emails Robinhood sends you for each transaction.\n\nFar too many of my large buys are all in moves on specific stocks, which is so stupid. Hence why I want to do this properly and diversify. Not even sure if my initial split is diversified enough. I feel like it isn't.",

So you look at the memes to see which one is popular and go from there. Popular stocks are the ones being pushed at the moment so there are other investors out there putting stakes into the companies too. Of course it's dumb to base off your whole investment strategy on that but it helps to start somewhere.\n\nYou can also invest in safe blue chip stocks that you see people use their products daily: amd, nvda, appl, msft, adbe, v, ma etc. Most of the time you wont go wrong because they're all solid.",

        "body": "&gt;This is the perfect setup for a market meltdown. If hedge funds are really positioned like Ackman and Hedgopia describes, the situation could unwind after a liquidity event:The Fed increases QE to bring down the 30 year yield because the economy isn't recovering yet. We've already seen the correlation of QE and USD and QE and bond prices.That causes a giant short squeeze of hedge funds who are very short the 30 year bond. They need to cover their short positions\n\nThis problem is compounded by the hedge funds also being leveraged up on commodities that have had their value driven up by the dollar dropping - this is the part I think will hurt them. The fed is looking for liquidity issues and taking assets as collateral to solve it, that's how they created the V-shaped \"recovery\".\n\nBut if your asset value drops it's less collateral, so those swaps won't work as well if the dollar rebounds causing a **treasury + commodity** liquidity event.",
