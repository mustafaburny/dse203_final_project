        "body": "DD Alert.\n\nMy Positions:\n\nSLV 9/18 24.5C  - 79\n\nSLV 9/30 26C - 30\n\nSLV 12/31 27C - 25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilver has a MASSIVE upside here.\n\nJPM inherited the old metals desk from Bear Stearns. These asshats loved to naked short Silver, and they could do it by stopping actual physical delivery because it was considered a \"hedge\". These shitbags have been MASSIVELY suppressing Silver since around 2011.  The \"Classic\" silver/gold ratio is around 16:1 in price.  Today it was like 79:1 - because it has been suppressed so long.\n\nSilver has industrial uses of \\~2m oz/day.  Silver itself is a pretty thin market anyways, so it tends to be volatile when supply/demand moves it around. Miners aren't really operating at full steam either, so supply is shorting up - and people still need silver for phones/TVs/Medical stuff/etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround March 23, the COMEX started settling Metals with PHYSICAL.  What this means is that the banks (mainly JPM) had to stop shorting (selling) Silvers futures contracts, or else they would have to pull Silver from their vault and actually deliver it to buyers.  JPM can only pull so much physical out of their vault, before they have none.  What you are seeing is Banks slowly unwinding their shorts which is price positive as Silver tries to find a new \"natural\" level compared to gold.  I would expect something like a 40:1 silver/gold ratio initially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Fed is printing by the billions. This causes is inflation.  The Federal Reserve has already said they are going to let inflation run for a bit, and cap interest rates around 2% - we are near record lows for home mortgages again.  This means, that lets say inflation is 3%, well if the bond market is only earning 2%, then the REAL effective interest rate is -1%.  This is MASSIVELY price positive for metals. Metals are 0% assets, you can't eat your pet rock - but it doesn't go at -1% either.  One thing to watch is $TIP - as it goes higher, metals will follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo with all the economic worry of the Fed printing money, and negative REAL interest rates, people are seeking a safe haven for a foundational asset.  This is causing a MASSIVE run on metals - and people can take physical delivery from the COMEX.  Last month, a record # of people are standing for physical delivery at COMEX, and I expect this to continue. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/gold-traders-issue-largest-delivery-notice-on-record-at-comex?sref=kn8A42Ij&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-commodities&amp;utm\\_content=commodities&amp;utm\\_source=twitter&amp;utm\\_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm\\_medium=social](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/gold-traders-issue-largest-delivery-notice-on-record-at-comex?sref=kn8A42Ij&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-commodities&amp;utm_content=commodities&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are in the middle of a massive historic run on metals, and the banks cant short(sell) Silver anymore.  So we have tons of buyers, and no sellers - price goes up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nCraig Hemke is THE Metals guy - he talks about ALL of this in this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EOPKizJ\\_Y4&amp;t=679s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EOPKizJ_Y4&amp;t=679s))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. We are in the middle of a run on metals\n2. There are no metals sellers\n3. Price goes up\n4. This week was super bullish and Thursday night we saw profit taking and a pullback on Friday - MASSIVELY bullish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI expect $75 Silver EOY, $60 around Halloween. Silver is already +127.4% YTD.",

It does have a habit of sell low and buy high though, some examples: \n\n- Microsoft replaced Chevron in November 1999. Over the next 5 years, $MSFT was down 50% and $CVX up 25%. Microsoft eventually redeemed itself, but not after putting its shareholders underwater for 13 years.\n- Chevron reentered Dow on Feb 19 2008, 120% higher than November 1999, replacing **Honeywell**. Since then, $CVX is up ~50%, dividends included; $HON 300% higher. **Honeywell reentered Dow today.**\n- Also on Feb 19 2008, Dow replaced Altria with Bank of America. You should all know what happened to $BAC over the next year. $MO is up 300% after being booted from the Dow.\n- AIG replaced International Paper in April 2004. $IP is a lousy company indeed and has only gained about 60% since then, but $AIG got obliterated during the GFC and was booted from Dow on September 22 2008 after suffering 95% loss.\n\n------------\n\nDow has also done many things very right, such as:\n\n- Replace Woolworth with Wal-Mart in 1997\n- Replace Sears with Home Depot in 1999, although $HD actually underperformed Sears until at least 2008 \n- Replace Kodak with Pfizer in 2004, Kodak went bankrupt in 2012\n- Replace Kraft with UnitedHealthcare in 2012\n- Replace Alcoa with Nike and Hewlett-Packard with Visa in 2013\n- Replace AT&amp;T with Apple in 2015",

MA is able to easily work with multiple of those companies and they're using their global presence pretty well, that's why they're my pick for the fintech industry.\n\nThey launched Mastercard Accelerate last year, implementing those online paying platforms and letting start-ups take advantage of their global presence to grow and transform very fast. Last year they acquired Ethoca (managing e-commerce fraud) and Vyze (platform to connect merchants with multiple renders, giving them the opportunity to get those financial needs for start-ups). MA is basically helping start-ups to grow faster, which will result in more financial transactions in the future.\n\nLast but not least, they like to focus on expanding to countries where there isn't much competition yet. They are expanding their exposure to Middle East and Africa, working with local networks and e-commerce platforms. They are in a strong position to capitalize those regions in the future and take on market leader Visa even more.\n\nThey get compared a lot to Visa, so I'll expand on that subject a bit as well. While V is focussing on performance and speed, MA plays the cyber security card. They are already working on ways to implement cryptocurrency and Mastercard tend to have more growth potential vs stability from market leader Visa. While V is in the lead, MA is more widely used by fintech companies, which shows potential take-over in the future. Next to their credit services, they also own debit service Maestro, which is widely used in Europe.\n\n**Financial**\n\nReturns as high as 150% (ROE) and 60% (ROIC). Very large margins and perfectly stable balance sheet. High EPS growth YoY, 53% and 42% in the last two years. Quick ratio 1.87. V has more assets and even bigger margins, however MA wins in returns and cash. In terms of more growth, I like to focus on those last numbers more.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nIt's a blue chip at a $300B market cap. Their growth potential might be limited, although I see them as one of the better picks between blue chips.",

The losses surmounted from buying high from fomo and panic selling low at the bottom (Flair should be warren buffet)  My portfolio has officially bottomed out, but as an options trader on WSB, that $260 is enough to make a comeback from anything which is where my new journey to 40K will begin. \n\nCurrent positions to begin are BJ 50C 9/18 &amp; 7 BJ 55c 9/18 currently down 45%. Also some worthless deeeeep otm debit spreads on AAPL. From here on out, the only way to go from here is up. Wish me luck everyone",

Like you said tech is becoming more and more a part of our daily lives so you can benefit as an investor from tech without investing directly in tech companies. \n\nRegarding your second point, it actually depends on how you measure largest holdings. You're right that they are outside the top ten in terms of dollar value but they aren't that far out. By your own measure tech companies take up around 50% of his portfolio. It just happens to be concentrated in one stock. But you could also look it from the point of view of the percentage of each company owned. You could argue that this is in some ways a better measure of which companies he believes in the most. By this measure both Sirius and VeriSign are in his top ten. So by both measures he puts a good amount of importance in tech companies. At the very least he puts more importance in them than what is portrayed by the popular media.\n\nAs a sidenote, a lot of people would argue that both Visa and MasterCard are basically tech companies.",
