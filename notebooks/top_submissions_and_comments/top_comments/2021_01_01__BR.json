Fintech is huge and Foley is headlining it so it\u2019s a pretty well full proof. Other one is semiconductors which has a huge market in EV\u2019s and they\u2019re really the first Spac to do so. And then the third is lightning motors which of course any EV is gonna blow up but they actually have a good product just a bit behind with regards to production.",
