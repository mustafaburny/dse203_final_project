        "body": "Tldr: my dumb story of going from trading a little in rh to only going all in in options and making 100% per hour for a couple days to losing out on a potential 2,000% gain for not having the balls needed to hold and then loosing it all on an all in 2 week call option during earning calls.\n\n\nI just recently got into this thread and felt right at home, so im going to share my story. I got into rh post pandemic thinking fuck it. I used to spend a bunch of money in alcohol and now that bars are closed ill just gamble it a little. Started with a couple houndred and being responsible and quickly realized that responsible gains are useless. Even if i went up to 1k and got 2% daily on some magic stock i would not make any real money. After a bit under a month of trading i said fuck it and decided that all ins was the way too go because diversification is just dumb. If your goal is to not lose money, open a bank account. From that point on i only cared abt the top movers category. High risk high reward only. I was only buying stocks that i had never heard but had dropped down 50% or more so my gut said they would go up. I lost 30% some days and made 80% others as you do. Then i found grow generation(grwg). No fucking clue what it did at first but that was the ultimate stock. That shit just goes up. At this point i had put like 2k into rh and i decided to go 50% there and 50% into azul (br airline because why not). After one day of having both azul stayed the same and grow went up like 10% to like 24. So i obviously went all in into grwg as you do. Next day grwg crashes and withing a week i was down around 50% and azul had a 30% rally over the following weeks.  I decided it was time to delete the app for a while and just hold grwg forever. Like a week after i deleted the app, i missed gambling and the rush of loosing all your money and then win a little so i went back. Grwg was starting to raise back slowly so i decided to google what they did. After having put most of my money into it, i found out it was like home depot for weed. So i obviously loved it even more and decided that the only rational thing was to double down to bring down my cost. Fast forward a little and i had put 5k into the stock. Then for like a month this thing just kept on going up and up and up. I did my first buy at 24 then it went down to 14 i doubled down and bought more at 16-18 (dont remember or feel like checking). When it hit like 22 i decided that this stock will go up forever and hit 200 by the end of 2022. So as any good ape here i sold everything and put all my money on a 30 call that expired a month after i bought it. It expired 2 weeks after elections and earning days, so i knew that if biden won and earnings were good i will make a shitload of money. Within the week of me buying the option it went back down to 16-18 amd my 5k became like 200$. At that point i just held  and decided it was all over. Until 1 weeks before the huge election/earnigs week. During that week grwg went from 20 to 25 in a couple days then to 28 and at this point i was making like 1k an hour. I wemt from $200  to almost 20k in like 2 days, but there was no fucking chance i was selling before elections/ earnings so i just held. Elections day came and obviously nothing happened because fuck alabama. Then earnings came and they were beautiful, but the stock somehow went down and i shit my pants as hard as possible. I went from 20k down to like 2k. My heart wanted to double down again but my brain and wallet said no. The monday after the elections results came back grwe started to go up again but at this point i had no more pants left so just wanted to get rid of all my options that were going to expire on friday. I sold most of them by monday afternoon and ended up with 6k so still made 1k profit. Had i not been a weak paper hands idiot. I would have ended up with over 100k profit. By fthe day my options expired grwe was worth 40. I had paid like 60c per option for close to 5k worth of options to hit 30. 5k gave me around 8,300. If i sold the options on thursday when it was trading at around 40 with a massive rally behind it, i would have gotten more than 10$ a share.  If only i had been a part of this sub i am sure the energy of this thread alone would have forced me to hold until the last second. \nI then went all in again in a call that expired 2 weeks after i bought it on wday to increase 10% because i thought it sounded cool and earmings were in 1 week. This allowed me enough time for earnings to come hit it out of the park stock to increase 20% get 1,000% profit then put 50k more grwe options and retire at 26 with 1918625225 million dollars. For the first time in my life i had a clear life plan. I made like 50% the first week as expected earnings came out beating the expected by a lot. Wday was going up like 10% in post market. I was looking up islands for sale, and then at the end of the earnings call they announces that they expect bad earnings for next quarter because of the pandemic just to fuck me over. Next morning the stock was down like 10% and i ended up just letting my options expire. \n\nSince then i retired. Missed the rush. Came back with a 600$ all in call. Lost it all. Stopped. Came back with long call for grwg because that stock just goes up. And recently bought a nokia call to hit 10 by next friday because it was cheap and a couple stocks of gme because fuck wall street and i didnt have any more money. \n\nSo, this is my story and i too treat wallstreet like my own personal casino.",

SocGen's douchebro just got caught on the wrong end of the options and instead of just taking the hit he started to accrue more funds from other accounts to try and make spectacular price moves.  Obviously, it didnt work so right now its going to be interesting to see how badly BR and maybe KKR wants to take out Melvin/Citron.  BR is operating from a position of strength now and only needs to pump in a fraction of what Melvin has to ensure Melvin is FFL'ed.  \n\nJust my recollection from the time i worked in that environment and ran into that event.
