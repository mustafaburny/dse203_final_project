You never know until you try.\n\nReason I say this is I run into so many people under the impression that you need tens of thousands for down payment, and that the mortgage will be more than their rent. \n\nYour loan officer will work with you to configure a loan amount, optimal payments, and with decent credit you can get a home with 1-3% down.\n\nMy buddy is paying $1200 a month for a small, run down, 2br apartment that\u2019s only $300 cheaper than my mortgage + escrow (property tax) on a 3 br 3 bath 2000sq home with a two car garage.",
