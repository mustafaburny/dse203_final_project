This chip is x86 compatible and can run software for Intel CPUs.  For simplicity let\u2019s call this \u201cspeaking English\u201d.\n\nAnd then we have ARM, which Apple and Qualcomm are the largest firms producing those chips.  For our simplistic explication let\u2019s say they speak Spanish.\n\nSoftware for x86 (English) won\u2019t work as is on ARM (Spanish) even if developed against the same operating system.  So it either needs to be recompiled (rewritten in Spanish) or needs to be on the fly translated (which is really slow).\n\nApple has twice now switched CPU architectures that are incompatible with one another and this move to ARM will be switch #3.  It takes a lot of effort to pull off such a major switch and not anger or confuse users in the process.\n\nOnce Apple moves to ARM the only real big use left for Intel is Windows PCs and the data center.  Windows 10 was ported to ARM as well and AMD has a very competitive chip for the data center.\n\nI don\u2019t see Intel having much relevance a few years from now.",

They may digest tomorrow. I do a bit of scrapping when I have the time... For example, at one point I had bought puts on AMZN today and watched it fall 20pts and sold for a profit by watching RSI, VWAP, and when QQQs showed back strength. I then switched over to calls and rode it back up. Ive stayed away from most ETFs and usually just use them as references to look at sector trends (SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLF, XLE, JETS). BETZ is a new ETF that I\u2019m long in once Sports gets back online. It can also use it as a reference for GAN and DKNG. \n\nFor options remaining, I only have GLD and SLV...  I bought them two days ago expecting Powell to cause it to spike once he talks about zero-interest rates. Commodities are tricky so sold 80% at EOD. I\u2019ll likely sell the rest tomorrow since both struggles to break resistance zones.",
