This chip is x86 compatible and can run software for Intel CPUs.  For simplicity let\u2019s call this \u201cspeaking English\u201d.\n\nAnd then we have ARM, which Apple and Qualcomm are the largest firms producing those chips.  For our simplistic explication let\u2019s say they speak Spanish.\n\nSoftware for x86 (English) won\u2019t work as is on ARM (Spanish) even if developed against the same operating system.  So it either needs to be recompiled (rewritten in Spanish) or needs to be on the fly translated (which is really slow).\n\nApple has twice now switched CPU architectures that are incompatible with one another and this move to ARM will be switch #3.  It takes a lot of effort to pull off such a major switch and not anger or confuse users in the process.\n\nOnce Apple moves to ARM the only real big use left for Intel is Windows PCs and the data center.  Windows 10 was ported to ARM as well and AMD has a very competitive chip for the data center.\n\nI don\u2019t see Intel having much relevance a few years from now.",

I then switched over to calls and rode it back up. Ive stayed away from most ETFs and usually just use them as references to look at sector trends (SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLF, XLE, JETS). BETZ is a new ETF that I\u2019m long in once Sports gets back online. It can also use it as a reference for GAN and DKNG. \n\nFor options remaining, I only have GLD and SLV...

I was a car nut and after test driving the roadster I was willing to trade my right nut for one.\n\nI understand Nikola's technology too (I worked on fuel cells for years). That understanding is why I will never invest in them. When you crunch the numbers on the economy of hydrogen it will NEVER beat that of electricity (physics doesn't lie). And that's before I even get into their cringeworthy (for an engineer who understands the technology) and straight up sleezy marketing content.",

So if people can't find much besides a \"short the shit out of this company\" report, it might be more important for management to attempt to keep the stock afloat, whether it's in their own self interest or not.\n\nIf you try to short Intel it's a bit of a different story considering there are 40 analysts covering it and an ungodly amount of brand recognition. If one analyst comes out with a short and 39 say Intel is fine, it's unlikely the short piece actually does anything. But if you have three analysts covering you, which is very common for small-cap companies, one short piece can actually fuck your shit up. \n\nAlso since companies often use their equity as collateral for a loan, the higher stock price could afford more reasonable loan terms, which could help the company's actual business.",
