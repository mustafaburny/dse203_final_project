Called them during a layover and gave them details of where I was staying. Got in late and paid cash to my AirBnB and by 8 am the next morning they had a wire transfered to a nearby WU for enough cash to get me until I could meet up with a new card. They didn\u2019t even charge me a fee (which would have been totally reasonable).\n\nI have no idea if that was standard or some kind of special exemption, but that was probably the most impressive customer service I\u2019ve ever experienced.",
