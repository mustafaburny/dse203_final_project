        "body": "If you're looking for an echo chamber, you'll find it here. This subreddit loves value stocks and dividends, so you're going to get a lot of people who agree with your assertion.\n\nPeople are hoping for the \"bubble\" to pop because things are \"too expensive\" in their minds. Unfortunately, many of these people will not be buyers even as the market is dropping, because they don't have any money. They'll be busy making predictions on how far the market will drop and sitting in cash talking about how cash is amazing. Then when the market goes back up they'll be the first ones complaining about how they missed their opportunity again. People in this sub tend to be extremely risk averse and stubborn. These same people get irritated every day as they see their value stocks doing nothing while growth stocks continue to march forward.\n\nI've posted this portfolio last year, when talking about portfolio construction. I think that you need more than 3 stocks (so don't just buy this blindly), but here is a combination of three stocks that have beaten the SPY for the past 26 years (and yes, I discussed this portfolio last year and it's still winning). (WM,INTU,MSFT): [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=1000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=WM&amp;allocation1\\_1=33&amp;symbol2=INTU&amp;allocation2\\_1=33&amp;symbol3=MSFT&amp;allocation3\\_1=34](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=1000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=WM&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=INTU&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=MSFT&amp;allocation3_1=34)\n\nI'll repeat again because people seem to miss it: You should have more than 3 stocks if you're going to pick stocks. I prefer 8-15 per composite portfolio. The key to this is that you need to keep investing on a consistent basis. That way when the market goes down, sideways, or up, you're accumulating more shares.\n\nInvesting should never be a one-time event. Treat your investments like a bill and make a habit of buying into them on a regular cadence.\n\nIf you're interested in growth stocks, compile a list of the ones that you want to buy into, and then start doing some research. If you would prefer someone else manage the growth (so you can skip the research part), you could buy into an ARK ETF or a ZVN ETF/fund.",

As for timing, with rapidly rising high-flyers like that I've found the best thing is to just buy it if I really want it, without trying to wait for a better entry. They have a strong tendency to just keep shooting up if I sit on the sidelines waiting, and by the time I get that nice entry I wanted, I'm usually paying more, even with a pullback, than I would have paid back at the start. Sure, sometimes it bites you, but the odds seem to favor just going for it. Even if it drops a chunk right afterwards, if it's really growing that fast it'll make it back up pretty quickly. Unless a stock is cycling in a trading range, timing is pretty much pure luck.\n\nMy only exception is if the stock just did a massive one-day spike up, then I wait a couple days to make sure it's not just going to whipsaw back down, and will hold at the new level at least for a while.",

Your evidence for this is \u201ctheir value is incalculable\u201d (random opinion) which would only be true if you think it is impossible for someone else to do anything similar to what they did. Logically, if Elon Musk did not exist at all it would be entirely unsurprising if someone else would come along and spot the same issue and run with it (multiple people had already tried and just been slightly early). Not in the exact same way or cadence, but it would happen cause all the tech and environmental factors are there. Their cars could have been vastly superior for all you know. \n\nAt the end of the day, the fundamental question is whether a billionaire would have still started their company without the promise of quite as much money (fractions less). The obvious answer is yes given that many of them started in garages. They were trying to make money, but you would be hard pressed to find someone who says \u201cif I didn\u2019t make $100 billion I wouldn\u2019t have started my company\u201d. The vast majority of people start companies for much much less. \n\nSo, if you still would get the same level of innovation AND be able to invest more in the country\u2019s infrastructure/education/health to accelerate growth &amp; innovation then that would be an obvious win. However, for some reason, people who are not billionaires, such as yourself, seem to feel compelled to pontificate wildly about why we should save billionaires a few % on their tax for no discernible reason other than the possible delusion that they themselves will be a billionaire some day.",

As for me personally there is some uncertainty with regards to how they will convert most of their free, I believe they will and maybe this has been priced in... who knows.\n\nI also spent time getting some qualitatives. I work in tech but not with CDNs. I asked a bunch of my ex coworkers, current ones and friends about cloudflare and fastly from a product perspective. Almost everyone knew cloudflare and only a few heard of fastly. Everyone who knew fastly and use it , liked it and same with cloudflare. There were few negatives , but nothing concerning since to me  since it felt like personal preferences rather than bad product. But then again I\u2019m not in this field... so. \n\nApart from this I also listened to both their recent shareholder calls, it\u2019s promising to me. Read a bunch of analysis, and viewed some of the management interviews on CNBC and stuff. It looks like Fastly has a very techy management compared to Cloudflare. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Fastly actually ends up being superior in long run but doesn\u2019t mean cloudflare is gonna lag behind, also considering their current stock prices Fastly is getting a kinda expensive and less growth potential compared to couldflare, but this is speculative of me and just something I\u2019m comfortable betting on. Both are long play and I\u2019m just gonne DCA into both and not even consider looking at the stock price next 5 yrs, except looking into 10K and Q to make sure nothing is going terribly bad with the financials.",

Twilio is certainly not a telehealth play, but is powering a number of them (https://www.twilio.com/healthcare.) Testing also continues to improve in terms of the patient experience with things like Exact (EXAS), Guardant Health (GH) and others. I think healthcare is absolutely a place to look for growth and potentially really durable, sustainable growth if it improves aspects of the patient experience, saves money or other improvements.\n\nI think people have to invest in what they're interested in and what I'm interested in someone else may not be, but personally I think digital payments given what is going on is a theme that should be emphasized; I think a lot of the growth of the next few years in digital payments has been pulled forward by what is going on. Paypal's CEO called the current situation a \"tipping point\" (\" and I believe we will look back at this time as a tipping point, where digital payments both offline and online became an essential element of our lives, hastening the demise of cash, enforcing a reimagination of commerce, retailing and the payment system, and we intend to be a driving force as those trends unfold\") in the move away from cash and I don't disagree. Additionally, Venmo and Square Cash have seen increased adoption during this and even Bank of America's CEO said this finally pushed seniors to adopting digital banking.\n\nTech - cyber security (CRWD), identity management (OKTA), communications (RNG, FIVN, BAND, TWLO), data analytics (AYX), healthcare (VEEV), monitoring (DDOG), business spend management (COUP), ad tech (TTD), science (SDGR) and others (MSFT, etc.)  As more people don't want to handle paperwork during this, look at DOCU. EVBG provides crisis management software and likely continues to benefit. \n\nE commerce: along with digital payments, I think years of growth in e-commerce have been pulled forward. Things that offer the building blocks (SHOP, WIX, to a lesser degree SQ), sales tax automation (AVLR) and names both in the US (AMZN, ETSY) and elsewhere (MELI, SE.) There were a number of people skeptical of Kroger's investment and partnership with robotic grocery warehouse operator Ocado (OCDGF), now this happened, lots of people are grocery shopping online and Ocado said during the peak the level of traffic was like a \"denial of service\" attack. The stock is +58% YTD.\n\nFiverr is kind of an interesting marketplace stock as more and more digital freelance work is transacted online, but the stock has ramped considerably already in recent months. Match has done a surprisingly decent job navigating through this crisis and now has been spun off from IAC so IAC becomes something to look at as a Berkshire-esque portfolio company looking at internet brands with money to invest.\n\nEveryone wants into betting stocks and I do think that online betting will be a larger market in the years ahead as more and more states look for revenue. However, I said the other day that when you start seeing ETFs for a hot newer theme, it's probably not a great sign near-term. Delays in sports returning will also probably cause some volatility.  Evolution Gaming (EVVTY) is kind of an interesting name that nobody has discussed that is worth watching on a pullback; they provide a sort of \"Peloton-esque\" casino experience online with dealers and other operators in studios around the world (https://www.evolutiongaming.com/live-casino-studios) They also partner with others (like Draftkings) and can provided branded live experiences online (https://www.evolutiongaming.com/who-we-are/customers)  Has done quite well and perhaps something that hasn't been talked about for those interested in the theme.\n\nI still think Roku is an interesting play if they can continue to work deals to ensure that the apps of interest are included. There has been a few bumps lately, including HBO Max. Still, the company has a bit over 39M active accounts that streamed nearly 14B hours of programming last quarter. The more accounts the more essential Roku becomes to launch a new streaming service, the more engagement that active accounts have with their Roku, the more ads served. They bought their own ad tech company and I think people continue to view Roku as \"that device company\" when really the focus is the advertising business.  The downside of that is ad spending in a downturn but over the long haul more ad dollars are going to continue to flee linear TV. Funny enough at the lows in March, there was an offering of 5.5M shares to sell at slightly lower than the close of the day. That was the literal bottom in the stock and it was Fox selling their stake. \n\nOne more thing that people should look to focus on is internet traffic and what benefits from considerable growth in internet traffic. CDNs have done very well this year - Cloudflare said in the last quarterly call that \"growth in internet traffic has been unprecedented, across our platform. We saw as much growth in traffic in 12 weeks as we have seen in the previous 12 months.\" FSLY has basically become the new ZM and is way overbought after more than tripling in the span of a few months. I think there will be no shortage of demand for data infrastructure REITs - SBAC/EQIX/AMT/CCI (or the SRVR etf) What are pure plays that really benefit (and have demonstrated that they benefit) from increased internet demand? \n\nI'd be very cautious about investing in much at this point; there's growth funds up almost 60% YTD - which is insane - and it's only the beginning of July (https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/zvnbx/performance), but I think it's a good time to really work on a shopping list and think about the next 5 years and where one sees things going. I've said for the last few months there's a lot of growth themes that are accelerating due to this (and you've heard many companies talk about it) and there's a lot of things that were already in decline where that decline will be faster because of this. There's a lot of focus on what to be concerned about on this sub and I think people have to really focus some on where they see things going because there will continue to be opportunities. \n\nEven in something like department stores which has been an absolutely awful sector for a while, who benefits if one or more players go away?  If people move away from cities, who benefits in more rural areas (TSCO), who benefits if there's a lot of close out merchandise from stores closing (OLLI), etc. \n\nSo this is the time IMO to think through where one sees themes in the coming years, where one sees opportunities, create the shopping list and patiently wait for better opportunities.",

So the reason I'm bullish on it more has to do with WASM (web assembly) and the future of web + serverless (bad name, because it's not really serverless).  Essentially the web is (quietly) shifting towards a different structure, in which companies are able to get more of their content to customers using CDNs for cheaper, easier, and way more endpoints than using cloud providers (like AWS, azure, etc).  It is *kind of* a replacement for AWS (though the two work together now, and will still in the future).  Basically you shift what gets done on big servers to the browser.  Companies would want to make this move because it's cheaper for them.  Hence more customers for CDN companies. \n\nCloudflare is pushing for this architecture, fastly supports it but isn't as bullish on it.  I also wouldnt exactly call Fastly and Cloudflare competitors, they appeal to two different types of developers.",

        "body": "\"Wow. These are great insights. Thank you so much! \"\n\nNo problem.\n\n\" I just thought that all ETFs helped mitigate most risk, but that\u2019s not always the case.\"\n\nNope. There are very few actively managed funds that really do attempt to sidestep downturns to some degree and fewer that have a decent track record doing it. One is little-known mutual fund Provident Trust (PROVX, https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2018/12/provident-trust-strategy-fund-provx/, \"Investors remember that this period includes the 2007-09 financial crisis. What they may not know is that in 2008, the fund lost 21.0% compared to the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 37.0% decline. That ranked the fund in the 1st percentile.\n\nWhile paralyzed investors and central banks struggled, the fund held between 61% in cash and fixed income instruments at the end of \u201908 and 70% at the market bottom in March \u201909. That positioning dramatically reduced the fund\u2019s losses compared to the market, while giving it ample \u201cdry powder\u201d for the gains that followed. During Provident\u2019s tenure as portfolio manager to September 30, 2018, PROVX gained +389% cumulatively with a 79.8% average month-end allocation to equities vs. +348% for the always fully invested S&amp;P 500.\")\n\nSo that's an example of a fund where managers will start to move to the sideline if they think it's prudent to do so. Not entirely - you're still going to lose some money - just probably not as much as the market in a downturn. \n\nIf it's a bad year most funds are going to have a bad year and the letter will be basically, \"Hey, sorry it was a bad year.\"\n\nStock index funds are going to go down in a downturn whatever the index does.\n\n\"I remember seeing a video interview of this analyst on Robinhood who said that the tech bubble right now is bigger than the dot com bubble was in the 2000s.\"\n\nI don't think this is the dot com bubble again. I do think that after the bottom in March, you saw a widening of the gap between the performance of the market and the performance of certain growth themes that were either less impacted by this or benefited from it. E-commerce, digital payments, cloud, software, telehealth and the \"stay at home\" names (Peloton, Netflix, etc.) Even the \"buy a home online\" names, as things like Zillow finally started to seem to have a sustained gain for once as people are now apparently comfortable buying houses virtually. People basically ran towards what they thought benefited today and I think what many people thought the future is going to look like post-crisis. I think what's been very frustrating on this sub this year has been this focus on the negative, when I think a compelling topic really is, what are the themes post-crisis that will be big? How does the world change in the next 3-5 years? **I think what's done extraordinarily well this year is in part due to the result of people asking themselves that question and investing accordingly.** The ARKW and ARKF have themes listed on the main pages for those funds and you look at those themes and those have absolutely been the places to be this year.\n\nIn the short-term, I have a hard time believing that the correct answer to concerning statistics will continue to be \"just buy more growth (Zoom, etc) stocks.\" At some point that will either stop working and broad market pullback or there will be a solution to this crisis and when that happens you're going to see a considerable rotation out of the Ark-style growth stocks and into impacted names that have lagged, but I think that is going to be buying opportunity for growth. \n\nYou've saw this sort of \"tale of two markets\" again on Thursday and Friday of last week: Thursday the Dow was down 300 but growth stocks were ramping. There was the Gilead news on Friday and the Dow was up 300 but many of the growth stocks were down.\n\nMuch of my own portfolio is similarly aggressive growth to Ark or Scottish Mortgage and I would not be surprised if at some point in the near-term much of my portfolio lost 20% in a hurry. The problem is when: I thought there was going to be a pullback in May - didn't happen. I have a long-term view on what I own so I may trim a little here, add a little there at times but happy not doing much of anything for long stretches. Additionally, I'm not a major market timer or do I have any desire to be. But after a really fantastic first half of the year, I really don't think that I'm going to have a repeat of that kind of performance in the back half of the year and I'm sitting here fully expecting a considerable pullback. If I manage to get through the second half of the year without a considerable pullback in my portfolio, I will be 1) stunned and 2) have to question whether this time is actually somehow different. I've said recently that I did a lot in March and April and then have since gone back to doing not much and am happy with long stretches of doing little-to-nothing. I'm okay with investing in aggressive growth stocks, but where I'm increasingly cautious is where/how much I add to things. \n\nBut, long story short, I think there are compelling long-term growth themes and growth may continue up for a while, but it is overextended and a considerable correction at some point in the relatively near-term would be so not surprising that it would be pretty remarkable imo if it didn't happen. Broadly, if you're not risk tolerant (and there's nothing wrong with that), then the ARK funds would not be something I'd recommend (great when things are fantastic for growth, going to be rough when it's not - they've had an amazing year, but people have to be cognizant of things capable of having those kinds of gains in that short a time period are also capable of going the wrong direction just as swiftly, if not swifter) or at the most would be a *tiny* bit to have exposure to some themes long-term - but I'd be particularly cautious about where you bought them.",
