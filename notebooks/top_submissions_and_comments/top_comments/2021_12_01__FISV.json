        "body": "Well speaking of indirect crypto exposure\u2014Overstock owns 97% of Medici Ventures, which owns a slew of crypto arms including TZero. TZero is a blockchain platform for a lot of different transactions including housing. There\u2019s no other platform for real estate in blockchain right now. NONE of it is priced into the company because everyone thinks it\u2019s just an online furniture store. \n\nTrailing PE is like 10 right now. I think it could hit $200-$300 over the next couple years. If TZero takes off it could go way higher. That\u2019s why I\u2019m 25% Overstock. \n\nI don\u2019t know enough about Square to refute you but what you\u2019re talking about is a lot of generalized macro stuff. None of it specific to their business. If they aren\u2019t growing fast with a massive valuation like this, I can\u2019t see a reason to own them. Plus, FiServ has Clover, which is equal to or better than the Square retail payment product, and FiServ is way cheaper. I\u2019d much rather be there. That\u2019s just me personally.",
