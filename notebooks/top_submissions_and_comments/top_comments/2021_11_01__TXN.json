        "body": "Sure, this is a complex topic but I'll try to boil it down a little. More importantly, it's critical to understand how zk-rollups (and other scaling technologies in general) integrate into Ethereum's overall long-term strategy.\r  \n\r  \nBasically, Ethereum's development priorities have shifted over the last year or two to a \"rollup-centric\" roadmap. Instead of driving all innovation through the base layer of Ethereum, they have opted to allow for maximum experimentation and decentralization via a multitude of technical teams building \"rollup\" technologies that operate on top of the Ethereum base layer.\r  \n\r  \nThese technologies perform smart contract code execution off-chain, \"roll-up\" the transactions into a single aggregate transaction containing all the state changes of the underlying accounts that transacted, then post the compressed data with a cryptographic proof to the Ethereum base layer for validation. This allows for throughput increases into the thousands of transactions per second depending on the approach, even using Ethereum's existing single sharded chain (more on this later). There are numerous technologies, including state channels (like Bitcoin's Lightning Network), plasma chains, side chains, optimistic rollups, and zk-rollups.\r  \n\r  \nZk-rollups are based on a very new cryptographic primitive, Zero-Knowledge Proofs. ZKPs were first proposed by academics in 1985. In fact Algorand's founder, Silvio Mercali, was one of the authors!\r  \n\r  \nThis novel cryptographic system allows for someone to \"prove\" (the prover) to another party (the verifier), that you possess some kind of knowledge and that is indeed true, without ever revealing the knowledge in question. In effect, it would be like a bartender asking you for your age and you being able to prove to them with total trustworthiness the fact that you are over 21, but without revealing your actual age.\r  \n\r  \nThere are multiple types of ZKPs, each with numerous protocol implementations that are being further optimized by academic and industry-led teams. The key benefits for Ethereum include: high throughput txns at extremely low cost, inherited security of Ethereum's base layer, direct withdrawal to Ethereum base layer if for some reason the provers/rollup sequencers go offline or are compromised (no loss of funds), the ability to withdraw to Ethereum and have control of funds instantly (vs a week-long wait for optimistic rollups), choice of on-chain vs. off-chain data storage (these are called volitions), cross-shard/cross-zk-rollup liquidity (unlike current solutions which fracture Ethereum's liquidity), and more.\r  \n\r  \nEthereum's initial implementation of sharding will only provide data storage for rollups, NOT execution. As demand for rollups grows, Ethereum shards can be added to allow for more txn data to be submitted and stored. Companies like Zksync are also rolling out solutions like Zk-porter (the volition I mentioned above), which stores data off-chain and only posts state changes to Ethereum, reducing fees to a few cents per transaction. This is at the cost of trusting Zksync's own network of data storage \"guardians,\" but is likely worth it for low value, high throughput transactions.\r  \n\r  \nThis is rambling and unorganized, there is so much happening right now in the space, but if you want more information, this is a digestible intro:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://limechain.tech/blog/optimistic-rollups-vs-zk-rollups/\r  \n\r  \nThe OG of rollup thinking is Polynya, who has a medium with a ton of insight into the zk-rollup and blockchain scaling space. I'm not allowed to post any links to medium but if you search polynya you'll find it quickly.\r  \n\r  \nCurrent L2 Fees: https://l2fees.info/\r  \n\r  \nCurrent L2 TVL: https://l2beat.com/\r  \n\r  \n**Key ZKR Companies (underlying platforms/protocols):**\r  \nzkSync (zkSync 2.0 &amp; Zk porter)\r  \n\rStarkware (Starknet, StarkEx)\r  \n\rPolygon ZK Portfolio (Hermez, Miden, and EY Nightfall)\r  \n\r  \n**ZKR Implementations:**\r  \n\rImmutableX\r  \n\rdydx\r  \n\rAztec\r  \n\rLoopring",

Staking returns will attract a shitload of buyers as current miner fees and MEV gets redirected to validators, boosting yields into the mid to high teens. \n\nAs L2 execution environments proliferate (optimistic and zk-rollups), cost per txn will drop and dramatically expand solution space. L1 transactions will continue rising in price as blockspace demand grows exponentially, driving everyone but whales, corporations, and rollups off the base layer. Ethereum is just getting started and will dramatically outpeform the stock market in the next decade as it matures into the most secure global trustless settlement layer for the internet. Will easily be worth tens of trillions.",

If i had to open any other positions i would mostly go to the foundry businesses like TSMC or Samsung. \n\nI feel intel, samsung and tsmc are the more sure bets and have been the only ones able to participate in Moore's law the past few years making the leading edge really a oligoply.\n\nIntel since it is traing really cheap at a sub 10 PE with the companies management expecting the revenue to increase by 10% per year and margins only decreasing only 2-3%. With dividend and buybacks combined they return aboud 7% per year if their revenue of profits wouldn't increase which they almost certainly will.\n\nSamsung makes most of it's money from it's foundy business and retail electronics. If it's foundry business' orders decrease they can fill up the remaining space with their own needs. (same as intel)\n\nTsmc is the real leader in the industry with customers having reserved all capacity for years ahead.\n\nFor price targets i would recomend [this DFCF tool](https://tracktak.com/dashboard). You fill in what revenue growth you expect the comming years, how much the ROIC is and what margins you expect.\n\nNVDA and AMD seem like really good companies but they are priced for perfection.",

        "body": "Great article! Nvidia's sales have shown the sector to be far more resilient to rising costs and prices than anticipated, I think even surprising management themselves if the 10% hike in share price was anything to go off of. \n\nFull disclosure: I have the entirety of my retirement portfolio vested in ASML &amp; SOXX. \n\nA huge concern is government investment which has been put into consideration greatly by many of the giants such as ASML and TSMC, who would both benefit greatly from the supposed $50 Billion investment from Uncle Sam. Other nations around the world are looking to achieve tech sovereignty and are putting forth big bucks to make this happen, all of which will help offset the cost of production and manufacturing. ASML has a few slides about this in their investor presentation, but a really in-depth macro report was done by the Boston Consulting Group with the Semiconductor Industry Association - [you can read it all here](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BCG-x-SIA-Strengthening-the-Global-Semiconductor-Value-Chain-April-2021_1.pdf). \n\nAnother driver that will lower the impact of the rising costs is the semiconductor space race going on between all the massive names. There are record levels of private sector investments from the likes of Intel, Micron, Texas Instruments, etc in an effort to grab market share and secure deals as the consumer facing conglomerates such as Apple begin to consolidate their supply chain. Nvidia is wrangling with the ARM deal, and TSMC has been tasked with supplying Apple's next generation of chips, which is an insane feat given what was showed off in the new series of Macbooks. Intel is under new management and is fighting tooth and nail to get back in the race and into Apple's good graces. All of these events fit into the broader picture of the race to 3nm - 2nm chips as we close in on the twilight years of Moore's Law. \n\nPerhaps I am overly optimistic right now, but there is a great deal to look forward to in the coming years from the semiconductor space. Maybe it won't be all sunshine and flowers, but overall the industry is certainly in an upward trajectory with more attention than ever before. I look forward to seeing how the market reacts to these developments as they mature.",

        "body": "This is partially correct. There is a massive amount of discussion around proper valuation techniques for crypto assets and I dont think there is a definitive answer, but if you are insistent upon using a more traditional valuation method, I believe Eth will soon be able to be fundamentally valued.\n\nWhen the protocol undergoes it's consensus mechanism upgrade next year (moving from PoW to PoS), all transaction fees that are directed to miners will be rerouted to validators. Today, miners generate significant sell pressure due to the inherent inefficiency of PoW mining. They need to sell a significant portion of the Eth issuance (2 Eth/block) in order to pay for opex, taxes etc. Im not sure what the margins are for a large mining operation but its likely less than 50%. \n\nMoving to PoS will result in validators running at 99% margins due to them needing to pay for a small amount of electricity and internet bandwidth. Sure theyll need to pay taxes but sell pressure will still drop dramatically coupled with a drop in issuance under the PoS model (0.2 eth/block) All txn revenues are now directed to staking Eth holders based on their proportional ownership of the total staked Eth pie. You are basically a shareholder of the decentralized entity ethreum and can generate a low risk yield on the asset via staking. \n\nFor those who arent staking, their \"shares\" of Eth still benefit. Witht the recent implementstion of base fee burning under EIP-1559, Eth's inflationary monetary policy is moving into a near term deflationary policy assuming current demand remains consistent. Long term we'll likely see some kind of dynamic equilibrium around a particular eth token count, ive seen some folks speculate as low as 25m Eth, others ~100m. Regardless, this mechanism acts as an effecitve stock buyback and will boost the price over time.\n\nSo now we have an asset that generates yield for shareholders via txn fees, effecitvely buys back its own stock, AND lets you use the stock as an asset to genrate yields in the new world of decentralized finance. Currently Eth is generating something on the order of $20B+ in fees annually, this will only go up. All in all, feels like you can start slapping traditional valuation metrics on Eth, hell its current P/E ratio is lower than many tech companies!",

I do firmware and I use gcc compiler instead of proprietary ones (so I have a consistent toolchain across device vendors) and when I hit a bug in the example code for a T I chip, I posted to their forums and an engineer answered with a fix within 4 hours. And I posted from my personal login and email without disclosing any company information. They're really great. And their example code is all high quality. Very wonderful company.\n\nBut everybody else thinks so too, their stock price is really high... they'll get murdered in a downturn.\n\nI remember when AMD spun theirs fabs off to GFS and people said it was the death of AMD! \ud83e\udd23 But it is hard to know what GFS is worth this early in the filings game.\n\nAMAT is great too, but if not all the anticipated fabs get built they'll get hammered.\n\nON is way up in a couple weeks. I'm hoping they'll come back down. If they do, I'll look for an entry point; though, they're probably undervalued even after the bump, with a P/S under 4. They're sortof a sleeper with the US fabs that will come online, because there will be more board assembly done in the US, and in the US people care about getting the specified part. In China they like substitutions, so almost everything gets generic mosfets and amplifiers. When American Engineers want a good mosfet, ON is one of the shortlist choices. And their prices are good. I normally swing trade, but if I get a good entry on ON I'll probably hold that.",

It\u2019s been consolidating for a big portion of the year oscillating between 120s and high 140s although this feels like the real breakout from that pattern. My guess is with wolf running wild people are starting to appreciate their contribution to SiC manufacturing.\n\nHimax HIMX - Getting hammered because it\u2019s Taiwanese but they are a display driver fabless semiconductor  company with something like 5 quarters of over 15% qoq growth (over 70% yoy). So they are tech growth with very impressive numbers. Yet they are valued at a p/e of 9 with forward p/e of 4.8.\n\nI like Indi semiconductor- INDI Their biggest revenue is from an asic they designed for the multimedia centers in cars that is used in something like 67% of all CarPlay. All new cars want these big fancy displays so moving forward this is a huge market which is why I love himx and Indi. Indi focused purely on automotive ICs, Is making progress in other verticals, has a great leadership team, and an over 1B dollar backlog with tier 1 automotive companies.\n\nI like wolf and navitas also as my SiC and GaN play but not at these prices",

They've got the option to buy back \\~$550 million in stock before the end of the year and last quarter the pace that they were repurchasing picked up a lot at the tail end. The price dropped from $22-$18 since last quarter ended, and I'm guessing they'll be buying a lot more back before the end of the year. That and I feel like they're about at the low end of their valuation, worst case I sell the options early 2022 having burned some theta.  \nAlso that video of a band's singer taking a piss on a guy's face during a concert seems like a pretty bullish indicator to me.

Super undervalued by every metric massive margin expansion. Market has written it off as temporary due to the semi shortage. While I think that's certainly a piece of the equation, it's only a piece. They have shifted product mix away from smartphone chips (low margin) to more tablets and auto industry screens (higher margin). These are growing segments with significantly higher margins. Both segments growing significant double digits YoY while smartphone chip sales decreased single digits.\n\nThey've also secured long term supply agreements for customers (for a fee and guaranteed minimum quantities) in addition to being paid fees to procure/guarantee capacity for non-customers for certain technologies.\n\nThey are also in the VR space and make boatloads on Smart TV stuff (Smart TV industry wide is projected to grow at 16% CAGR) and touchscreen display stuff.\n\nAdditional bear case: Wu brothers don't care about shareholders blah blah blah.\n\nCounter: Historically they pay out 75% of net profit as a dividend as is incentivized in the Taiwan tax structure.\n\nAnother Bear Case: China/Taiwan relations get significantly worse (or China straight goes to shit). Himax is a Taiwanese company with a lot of their customers and suppliers in China.\n\nhttps://www.himax.com.tw/investors/\n\nAs of\u00a0today\u00a0(2021-11-05), Himax Technologies's share price is\u00a0$11.45.

Therefore, Himax Technologies's\u00a0**PE Ratio** without NRI\u00a0for\u00a0**today\u00a0is\u00a09.16**.\nDuring the\u00a0past 13 years, Himax Technologies's\u00a0highest\u00a0PE Ratio without NRI\u00a0was\u00a0270.77. The\u00a0lowest\u00a0was\u00a07.04. And the\u00a0**median\u00a0was\u00a025.11**.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/himx/short-interest\n\nApril 15th, 4m shares short (1 day to cover). Grew steadily as price dropped since May to now (10/15 report date) 24m and 10 days to cover.\n\nPublic owns 81m shares  \nInsiders own 49m shares  \nInstitutions own 34m shares  \nHedge funds own 9m shares\n\nI've been in since well before then, but yeah.

Other Latin American countries are looking into doing the same thing. My fiance is Venezuelan and I travel through Latin America frequently. Many people have bank accounts that hold US dollars and use those bank accounts to use paypal. They also have other services that allow sending money internationally. The revenue for all those services is going to zero within a few years. Something to keep in mind for anyone long on Paypal or similar stocks.",

In my little bubble, I\u2019m a foreigner, but restaurants refused my CC because payments are withheld for a month, and within a month, the meal you just ate might not cover the cost of the uncooked food. Add to that, ATMs costed a massive % of cash deducted. Like 10%.\n\nSo we ended up having someone wire us some cash, and the rate was something impressive, like I could make 33% gains from reselling the cash, but like the true tard that I am, got way too excited by the value trap because Western Union seemed very happy to offload their cash on me. Once the pandemic hit, I couldn\u2019t even spend it, so I\u2019m stuck with $500 worth of Argentine cash that is probably worth $180 right now IF I can find a buyer.",

        "body": "You clearly haven't been paying attention to the amount of institutional money coming into the market. BTC already had a 50% correction this year and bounced right back.\n\nOr the continued adoption worldwide of bitcoin and crypto currency. Smart money follows smart money and all the banks and funds are starting to get into crypto, hence why it's still early. With more money comes more stability, as we're starting to see. You would actually have to follow BTC metrics to understand this though. \n\nThere's going to be a massive supply shock, that's why everyone even the big players are accumulating. This will bring financial freedom to billions of people worldwide who don't have access to bank accounts, let alone appreciable assets. More countries will continue to adopt BTC as legal tender and benefit from it as well. El Salvador has already invested $13M profits into schools, and there are more people with a BTC wallet than a bank account. No longer will people in the 2nd/3rd world be held hostage by Western Union fees, or INSANE inflation rates.\n\nYou're thinking very close mindedly, I of course know it's a volatile space because of the timing but it's also the perfect time for a retail investor to take advantage. I've also been taking profits on the way up just as I would with any stock. Whether you like it or not, I've done my research on crypto, believe in it, found the value, bought low and made my way to amazing gains both realized and unrealized. How are your negative yielding bonds doing? How about gold? Tech is the future, defi will be a huge portion of the tech industry. There's trillions of dollars of negative yielding bonds in the market, that's trillions of dollars looking for the next best store of value and guess what everyone's buying.\n\nNot financial advice, I definitely wouldn't take any advice from anyone on this sub here otherwise I wouldn't have these gains.

He was a Serbian-American engineer, inventor and physicist who made scores of breakthroughs in the development, transmission and application of electric power. He is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.\nNikola invented the first motor with alternating current and developed technology for AC generation. In late 1886, He met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. Based on Nikola's new ideas for electrical equipment, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887.

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",
