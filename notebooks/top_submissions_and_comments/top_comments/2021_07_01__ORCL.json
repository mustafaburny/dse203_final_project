        "body": "I find it odd to consider Amazon like Standard Oil. SO derived it\u2019s monopolistic power through acquisitions of rival refineries and distributors; purely horizontal integration, followed by outright price fixing.\n\nAmazon is absolutely massive, but the growth method and diversity of markets they participate in distinguishes them from old trust oriented monopolies. I\u2019m terms of AWS, the majority of growth was organic, and would not have ran afoul of antitrust law back in its hay day, such as when US v. Aluminum Co. of America was prevailing law.\n\nAn attempt to break up Amazon by business segment would probably fail due to the shift since the 70\u2019s from Per Se Antitrust violations to the Rule of Reason. They aren\u2019t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.\n\nOnline shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.\n\nOverall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren\u2019t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",

That's a pretty low bar. \n\n&gt;Gold is a old-school store of value by definition and as we saw in 2020 (amongst others) a great asset during times of uncertainty and crashes. Buy it during calm times, sell during fearful times.\n\nYeah, that's not accurate. Gold is not a hedge, its a portfolio diversifier. It's market correlation is 0.02, which is an unattached, positive number...not the large negative correlation you would hope for from a hedge. It did absolutely nothing during the dot-com bubble and probably hurt most investors that held during 2020.",

You're correct, the buy zone is  always below regression trend (average) line in the middle, so you'd want to snag it if it goes back down to 75-80. Although its true downward potential is the blue -1 deviation line, so 70-73. Deviations change a little bit day to day as more price data is added but right now you'd be buying into an uptrend which is not very safe. You'd basically be betting to get the cherry on top running up to +1 deviations at 88-91.",

        "body": "I personally invest heavily in Web3 crypto's and crypto projects that help run and keep these crypto's decentralised. \n\nWhat's a web3 crypto? These aren't to be confused with junk like Bitcoin that thinks it is a store of value or will become the new financial system, web3 crypto is literally creating the next stage in internet where you don't need to worry about your companies information / personal information / classified documents being stored on a server that is owned and managed by other companies. Web3 splits this up between 100's of validators that all talk to each other and keep this decentralised and secure from attacks. \n\nThere's also ones creating the future of finance. No longer do you need to get bent over by huge interest rates and banks fucking people over whenever they feel like it. DEFI is run by liquidity pools, people like you and I who store our money with the service and as a result get a percentage of the interest rates. These rates always remain low and competitive and go to the people rather than the big banks.\n\nThen you have oracles that power the decentralisation. Oracles gain info from many sources and feed it to the protocol to offer decentralised information. For easy laymans terms, if I wanted a weather oracle, it would gather weather data from 1000's weather stations and news outlets, work out the average forecast and feed that to my protocol. This means my protocol is giving the users the most accurate non-biased information. Just as a high-level. \n\nSo how do you make money from this? Well, let's look at Ethereum just as an example. Every single protect that runs on Ethereum has to pay \"gas\" fees on each transaction, this is paid in Ethereum. Ethereum already has 1000's of applications including VISA and MasterCard that constantly have a demand for Ethereum in order to operate and pay these gas fees. You as the investor holds the Ethereum they need and this creates supply and demand. Additionally, each time a company pays their gas fees, the gas is \"burnt\" (meaning Ethereum used to pay for the transaction is burnt) creating deflation. \n\nEthereum is just one project, and not one that I personally even invest in that much, but it's one that I'm sure most people have heard of.   \nIf you want to look at getting some crypto while it's currently on a low and has huge potentially to be the future of a new decentralised internet feel free to use my exchange code. Swyftx is aussie based exchange and you get 20% off fees with my code, plus I get a kick back [https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner](https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessage me if you want to know more",

All the DDs written on here continue to ignore how important the Xilinx merger is. It was hated on by many, but Su Bae is no moron, she is strongly positioning AMD to dominate the CPU and Semi-Custom solutions.

        "body": "I totally recommend leaps options.\n\nFirstly, I made most of my money from leaps.\nShare price rises by 25%, my options will have at least 50% profit margin.\n\nSecondly, my holding timeline for stocks is usually 6-12 months. So leaps is great for me \nFor my kids, I will buy stocks as I am leaving it for them for the next 15-20 years.\n\nLastly, don't think u can use margin on options so it prevents me from over leveraging.\n\nPS. I usually sell my options once it get 50% profit margin and move on. Reason is that for me to get 100% profit on options, I will need the stock to rise at least 40-50% which is not really realistic, especially when I have time decay playing against me.\n\nI also buy leaps options on solid companies like Google, amazon, xlnx, baba, jd, Shopify, ttd, crm......etc\nI try not to play with meme stocks or companies that do not show at least 4 quarters of profitability.\n\nBest of luck!",

These companies tend to rise slowly and steadily with time, so your longer expiration will give it time to play the senerio out \n\nA 10% rise in stock price will usually translate to a 20% options gain for u. And a 30% stick price increase will translate to a 50% gain for u.\n\nTry to avoid meme stocks and new spac companies and volatile companies as their sudden movement downwards will mean much greater depreciation for your options also. Example, a 30% drop in share price will translate to a 50% drop in your options price.\n\nEvery leaps options I have bought till now will be profitable some point in time. U just need to prevent greed and exit accordingly.\nSuggestion is to exit around the 50% profit mark or when the option is near the half way mark. Reason is that there is time decay associated with call options, so keeping it to expiry or keeping it too long is disadvantageous to you.\n\nBest of luck!",
