The Gateway is crazy fast, 3x faster than regular VPN that are bulky because they require hardware and licensing. The gateway is cloud based(not a hardware) so can be scaled up to millions of users in seconds unlike regular VPN!! It's also Ai enabled.\n\nThe Blackberry Persona will get rid of OKTA. OKTA is currently leading but they don't have the ai powered solution for Identity Access Mgmt. The persona is ai powered and part of Identity Access Mgmt.\n\nCrowdstrike and Carbon Black and SentenialOne cant stand against Blackberry Cylance(UES). The UES is preventative and acts before payload executes in milliseconds. Over next few months as enterprise and gov realize the power of Prevention, BB will be the leader. Plus all iot like cars, drones, traffic lights, busses, trains, etc require cybersecurity and BB Cylance light weight agent is the only compatible cybersecurity since majority of the iot device run BB QNX. You can't run any of the competition on QNX!!! this is kinda monopoly lol but BB has a reason. lol.\n\nBB has a huge moat and growth coming through in coming years that hasn't been priced. These analyst are trying to manipulate the stock either for personal gains or competition. But game is over for them!!",

When shit is centralized, like at some brokerage, or a bank, and someone breaks into your account, you can sometimes get your assets back by proving your identity.

This is a pro in some sense, as you fully control your assets, but a con when you have things stolen from you. They\u2019re just gone.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced most people will want that reward / responsibility tradeoff.

You can hold it in your TFSA for tax sheltered gains.\n\nIf it's in regards to safety, you're better off holding BTC directly in a hard wallet off the exchange. The saying of \"not your keys not your coins\" is very real in crypto. Look at QuadrigaCX as an example of what can happen when you don't hold your own keys. Hundreds of millions of dollars disappear essentially overnight. It also has the benefit of trading 24/7 vs just during market hours, so in theory if there's a massive crash on a Sunday and you want out quickly you can. \n\nPersonally, I split it and hold both. The appeal of tax free gains is strong enough to at least partially outweigh the risk of not holding the keys. \n\nIf you want to see how closely it tracks BTC in pricing check out bitbo.io",

It's far more secure and it's even quicker than pulling up an OTP code for sites that support the FIDO protocol directly, such as Coinbase and Gemini. For sites that don't support FIDO and still use OTP (what Authy/Google Auth is), Yubikey can do those too with a Yubico Authenicator app which requires your key to generate the codes.\n\nYubico's site has excellent setup guides and FAQs to get things going. The only downside is the expense, as you want to buy multiple keys to have a backup incase you lose your primary. But, if you've got a decent chunk of money to protect, spending a hundred bucks for a couple Yubikeys is well worth the vastly improved security.\n\nTradFi is so behind crypto on security models, it's insane.

        "body": "Well, in my case I was using Authy, right? I am also heavily involved in crypto, where there is no FDIC, no fraud prevention departments, no auto-blocking of transactions for suspected fraud, no 2-5 day processing time for me to call customer service to get my money back before it moves, etc etc. So, for me, \"being my own bank\" is a real thing, with real money, so 2FA is critical.\n\nAlright, so here's what I was doing with Authy. Authy can be used in place of Google Auth, and I was using it because it is tied to your phone number and provides the ability to do encrypted backups on Twilio's servers. I was always paranoid about what happens if I lose my phone, and I need quick access to my accounts, so that's why I used the backup option in Authy. So I had my main phone, and two backup phones that I always updated Authy in tandem with the primary phone. This way, I had quick access backups should I lose my phone. But there's another threat with Authy, since it's tied to my phone number, theoretically there's a risk of SIM swap attacks where someone steals my phone number and accesses my Authy backups through the phone number. They'd have to know the backup password, of course, but I just didn't like that theortically it's possible.\n\nFrom what I've already described, I felt pretty fucking safe. I have great password practices, so I didn't think it was very likely at all for my Authy to be compromised. And that's why I was lazy and never made the switch for years. But... technically... it *could* be remotely compromised. It's non-zero, no matter how small a chance, it's non-zero. And as someone deep in crypto where there is no protection other than my own OPSEC, that bothered me.\n\nWith the security key, there's no way to remotely get at it. None. You need the actual key, in hand. The natural question is, what if someone wrench attacks me and steals the key physically, which is a real possibility. The key also has a password on it, so they'd need to take my key, and know the PIN to unlock the key to use it. This could happen to me with my phone and Authy's PIN as well, so what's the difference? At this point we're at a very similar state of the Authy risk with the critical difference that *remote* attacks are impossible. After using it, after producing mulitple backup keys and storing them in various places (a safe, a bank box, a trusted relative, etc), I now have complete confidence in my security. That super small non-zero chance of a remote compromise is gone, and I like that it's gone. I feel way better no matter how small the chance was.\n\nEven if I'm drunk and fall for a phishing attack, say by hitting a link to coinbasi.com instead of coinbase and entering my OTP code, and then getting my account emptied by the phisher (which is the story posted to a crypto sub that prompted me to make the swithc) -- even if I derped and fucked up that bad, I'm still safe. No phisher can get my 2FA remotely, no matter how dumb I am, no matter if I got phished.\n\nIt's a small difference, but, for me, with a heavy crypto involvement, it's a big increase in peace of mind. It might not be for everyone, but I operate in an industry with no safeguards except my own diligence. And the key helps remove some of the remaining risk. It's that simple. It's an improvement, and I'll gladly take it.",
