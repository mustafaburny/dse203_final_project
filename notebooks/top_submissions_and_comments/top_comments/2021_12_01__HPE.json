You won't know how you'll feel until it happens, and you won't be in the right frame of mind to make decisions after it has. This could very easily turn into a trade where you lose 100%. Pick a point, say 50% or whatever you're comfortable with so you can live to die another day.\n\n-Determine where you're going to take profits. This can go the other way too. You wake up to check on your option and it's up 100% just a couple weeks after opening the position. You're once again in a position where you aren't able to make unbiased decisions, and it can just as well go to zero still. These ones are the most demoralizing.\n\nWrite both your stop loss and take-profit point down on a physical piece of paper. It's more effective when it's staring you in the face. Good luck.",

Gas trucks are very light duty compared to a diesel engine.\n\nMy theory is that gasoline cars and trucks will slowly disappear over the next few decades. Then there will be a predominant amount of semi trucks in warm climates that are battery EV. \n\nBut ice road truckers will be diesel for just about forever until some kind of nuclear or fusion generator takes over all energy sectors. Lithium just doesn't work well in cold temperatures. Perhaps in such a scale as a truck we could see it work but I doubt it. Diesel trucks are just so good and reliable in any condition I doubt we will lose them anytime soon.",

Now that companies are doing better, getting strong revenues... it doesn't really matter if the market does a hard correction. It isn't needed for there to have been a \"mistake.\" They communicate what is necessary to try to keep people calm, until the time comes for a change, and then the change is made. There is nothing in \"promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\" about stonks always going up. If they had tapered a year ago, as you seem to be suggesting, before employment had recovered then companies might not have done the same amount of hiring. That was the goal all along, and they've been saying that all along. If you've been listening to them. A lot of people have been responding with continuous cynicism, instead of listening, and those people are less prepared to rotate their investments on time.\n\nIt is up to each of us, as traders and investors, to be prepared for things like this, and to make sane choices.",

They underpaid their engineers severely when compared to other top semiconductor companies. None of my colleague really wants to work for intel at all. They failed in their process node roadmap. In short, they shot themselves in the foot to bring up some bottom line while having a non technical CEO for a while. New CEO is promising, but they haven\u2019t had any real big breakthrough still. Worse, Apple designed M1 chip and it will eat into their lunches further. Data centers are the only saving grace currently. Even so, it\u2019s been flat recently",

You won't know how you'll feel until it happens, and you won't be in the right frame of mind to make decisions after it has. This could very easily turn into a trade where you lose 100%. Pick a point, say 50% or whatever you're comfortable with so you can live to die another day.\n\n-Determine where you're going to take profits. This can go the other way too. You wake up to check on your option and it's up 100% just a couple weeks after opening the position. You're once again in a position where you aren't able to make unbiased decisions, and it can just as well go to zero still. These ones are the most demoralizing.\n\nWrite both your stop loss and take-profit point down on a physical piece of paper. It's more effective when it's staring you in the face. Good luck.",

You won't know how you'll feel until it happens, and you won't be in the right frame of mind to make decisions after it has. This could very easily turn into a trade where you lose 100%. Pick a point, say 50% or whatever you're comfortable with so you can live to die another day.\n\n-Determine where you're going to take profits. This can go the other way too. You wake up to check on your option and it's up 100% just a couple weeks after opening the position. You're once again in a position where you aren't able to make unbiased decisions, and it can just as well go to zero still. These ones are the most demoralizing.\n\nWrite both your stop loss and take-profit point down on a physical piece of paper. It's more effective when it's staring you in the face. Good luck.",

Also loaded on what was a speculative position last year with higher conviction now - bought quite a few CRSP at what I believe to be the bottom at the 78 range - currently avg at 102+-.{Not even mentioning my stupid PLTR,BB position - gambles going wrong atm, believing in the hype and the reason I bought hasnt changed still hence why i havent sold}\r  \n\r  \nAlthough I have sizeable losses here these positions have elevated my positions amazingly.\r  \n\r  \nHolding a sizeable position with xxx% returns on AMD and NIO and very bullish on SE - recently added to my position at 280\r  \n\r  \nbought into the AMC hype with a 14 avg and sold of 80% at around the 60 mark\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSquare shouldve been scalped and rebought 205-280 range and back is ridiculous but oh well\r  \n\r  \nsold JD into strenght to buy into my weaker positions - had a big position before. still bullish but seeing more upside elsewhere atm.\r  \n\r  \nI dont have any us mega caps- I know winners stay winners usually but I am looking for hopefully bigger returns albeith I run risk of big losses, clearly, as well - such as sizeble position in a clinical trial biotech AGTC - currently at a big loss aswell but that was expected. Lets see what happens here. stock at all time lows.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nfor example although im sitting at a 10avg with my SKLZ position the downside is limited here imo, and potential huge hence why I have been adding to my position lately a lot bellow 10\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI do recommend people look into CPNG and let me know their thoughts. I am torn between adding to this position or keeping it small.",
