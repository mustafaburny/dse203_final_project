The NASDog is finding support on the 50, but this could also be semi-experienced and/or impatient traders \"buying the dip\" after seeing support on the 50-day yesterday. This occurred back on 2/23 with the NASDAQ finding footing on the 50, moving up and trading choppy for a few days before ultimately making final bottom on 3/8. To feel confident in a rally if the NASDAQ does not make lows, I\u2019m looking for price to reclaim the 20-day SMA.\n\nLong Calls on HPE @ 2% of my base capital",

I\u2019m in the long game right now though and not changing positions until I\u2019ve been in them at least a year for tax purposes.  There are some exceptions where I\u2019ve gotten out of losing positions.  I tend to look at what a company is holding or has acquired, what they\u2019re doing with it, and leaning towards things I know something about. One example was seeing that HPE bought out Cray Inc and is using it to get new business. That pick has beat overall market returns but is balanced by positions that have lost.\n\nEven gamblers who make it big have losses. It\u2019s about where you end up over time.",
