You are still illiterate. \n\n&gt;Anyways go ahead and invest in AMD and forget Intel, we can only look back and see so who knows, maybe Intel just shrivels up and disintegrates and AMD becomes a trillion dollar company\u2026\n\nHere's a secret. You can do both at the same time! Although at the moment I see no reason for purchasing additional Intel stock. Intel is the next IBM/Oracle, they won't go anywhere, but they really have limited growth in comparison to others in the market.",
