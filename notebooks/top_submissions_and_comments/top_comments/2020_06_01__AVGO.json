And though it's taking steps to reduce its reliance, their HDD/SDD sales currently account for over half of its revenue. Many of their SSD customers also happen to be their competitors, who are actively developing their own storage controllers. \n\nMRVL faces stiff competition in the networking and SSD hardware sectors, including such heavy hitters as Western Digital, Toshiba, Broadcom, and Intel. Though it recently (2018) acquired Cavium which extends its reach in the networking hardware market.\n\nManagement faced its share of controversy prior to 2016. It has since been replaced, however, and its acquisition of Cavium seems to indicate they're taking positive steps to gain strategic advantages, primarily in the networking market. \n\nI personally wouldn't consider them the \"next Apple stock\". They have a very long uphill battle to establish a secure market foothold, let alone establish market dominance. They don't have much diversity either, so any downturns that affect their product lines will hit them particularly hard. \n\nThey do seem to be poised for long term growth, but with a notable level of uncertainty.",

        "body": "I'm a new investor who started in January 2020 and have been learning while taking a pummeling.  Portfolio strategy: identify 20 good stocks, primarily with strong dividends, and gradually fuel them until I can retire and live on the proceeds in 20-30 years.  I'm looking to invest in huge companies that will remain afloat for the rest of my life, in so far as that is possible.  Initial goal: to fund each of the 20 stocks to $1k (60% complete), then to $3k, then to $5k.  After investing $100k between all 20 stocks, reassess.  All dividends are DRIPing into new shares.  \n\nI plan to invest or have already invested $1k in the following companies: Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD, JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Proctor and Gamble (PG), Tesla (TSLA), Alaska Air (ALK), GM, Intel (INTC), Home Depot (HD), NextEra Energy (NEE), Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), Verizon (VZ), Visa (V), Microsoft (MSFT), Lam Semiconductors (LRCX), Caterpillar (CAT), and 5% into an S&amp;P 500 index (VOO).  \n\nI inherited 6k in Lockheed Martin (LMT) and may also push that on the side.  I have $1k in Disney and will assess whether to add to that later; for now, it's not part of the plan above.  \n\nI would like to avoid selling any stocks for the majority of my time owning them.  I'm interested in solar tech and considering a position in SolarEdge (SEDG).  \n\nThoughts?  I'm a novice and input is welcome.",

So picking based on value metrics initially has inherent benefits.\n\nThe issue with growth stocks is that especially since the dotcom era, they often have no E in P/E or that they are otherwise very expensive. No doubt, the best fast growers are probably always expensive since inception (NVDA or AVGO would have been examples from the past 10-15 years), but I think overall, expensive stocks are primarily not expensive because of their inherent quality or ability to reinvest profits and grow the business, but rather, because of glamour. So in aggregate, expensive (growth) stocks tend to do poorly. I think that the shift since 2010/2015 were the FANGs and there are certain fundamental reasons why/how they contributed to large cap growth performance.",

        "body": "Rate my portfolio: 28  \n\n\n* MSFT - impressive growth with new CEO and who stops them? Leader in the enterprise area as a cloud-service provider, team communications provider, Office 365, data analysis and BI facilities. Missing AI component, but their business is well diversified and very steady. International exposure.\n* AAPL - until revolution in smartphones (like NeuraLink or any other interface which will remove smartphones at all) very decent business. 5G is coming, a diversified business, large pile of the cash in the pocket. Apple Music is eating Spotify pie, new SE &amp; iPhone 12 should be a best-seller during X-Mas time. International exposure.\n* V - leader in the world of payments, slowly entering the crypto area, and its balance-sheet a bit better than Mastercard. In general both are good choices. The only issue is that for Visa default currency is USD, while for MA - EUR, and USD might be weakier soon.\n* INTC - leader in the retail chipset area, right now controls almost the entire CPU area.\n* NVDA - one of the few \"growth\" stocks here. Its P/E is very high, but low leverage, impressive P/S and amazing return on employed capital is making the day. NVDA is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI industry coming, as well as auto-pilot vehicles.\n* CTXS - ok, there is another growth company. Citrix provides capabilities to work from home without buying dedicated hardware. It means you don't need to buy everyone a corporate laptop to enable them to safely join from home. It is held by top index funds, and attracts a lot of S&amp;P 500 clients, who have high hopes in them.\n* BABA - yes, not the AMZN. BABA right now is extremely undervalued. They look absolutely amazing in every financial aspect, and thanks to extreme digitalisation of Asia, their revenue is growing super fast.\n* NKE - from one hand this is a consumer cyclical company, but from another - very strong brand. Their online shopping presens is huge, as well as exposure to a world market including China. I might assume they will stay around for a while thanks to the new trend of being healthy.\n* ACN - top IT consulting company, basically working for every Fortune 500 company. Right now I see 3 factors they will keep growing. At first, companies needed expertise to migrate to new cloud infrastructure. At seconds, companies will reduce their hiring budget for a while, but will instead hire external resources more intensively. At third, ACN made few acquisitions in the cyber-security area.\n* (Disclaimer: I had worked for EPAM for 5 years and might be biased)  EPAM - one of the faster growing IT services companies in the world. They have a very strong expertise in almost every area, like integration of complex IT solutions, cloud migrations, online shopping, etc. I see them a long term winner of the current setup. Also they start expansion to the Asia market.\n* CIEN - another long-term winner of working from home setup providing hardware configurations for organizing IT servers, clusters, telecommunications, etc.\n* LDOS - one more IT services company but working in the aerospace &amp; defense area with governments. One of the key vendors in the area of COVID-19 tracking facilities and digitalisation of government infrastructure to control COVID-19. Currently holds a portfolio of almost $30 bln agreements.\n* AVGO - another 5G chipset producer winner. Very solid diversified portfolio, good fundamentals.\n* TSM - semiconductor manufacturer, one the largest in the world. Produces chipsets for NVDA, INTC, AVGO, AMD and others. In my opinion, if I bet on the chipset industry it would be weird to not bet on TSM who is located in COVID-19 free area now and also has clients not only from the USA.\n* LRCX - yet another semiconductor company, but this time a leader in the area of automatisation of production lines. They produce solutions which help to automate facilities - the thing most factories will look into to reduce risk of COVID or any other pandemic.\n* MRK - one of the biggest healthcare companies. While everyone is watching Moderna, MRK also participates in the race for COVID-19 vaccine and has a very decent fundamentals and portfolio of products.\n* REGN - innovative bio healthcare company, their financial and earnings are skyrocketing with a huge potential to grow.\n* ROG - Swiss based healthcare company, very strong portfolio and financials\n* BAYN - I am not a super big fan of Bayer, but they are definitely undervalued now due to all PR recent PR issues. Expect to grow 50% in upcoming years, with strong fundamentals. \n* VIAC - one of the most undervalued TV companies right now. Very strong portfolio and strong fundamentals, clean balance sheet. Frankly I spent hours trying to find a reason for such a low price and didn't manage to find any except for \"index fund problem\".  \n* CI - insurance industry under the huge hit due to increasing expenses (people suffer from COVID) and reduced payments (people loosing job and might start cutting their spendings), but Cigna looks like one of the best to survive the storm and has a bright future for a long term. Faitly under-valued strong balance-sheet company.\n* SU - European large cap producer of energy, data and sustainability facilities. \n* BN - Another European large cap company: food producer. They position themselves as a healthy food producer, and COVID should not distract them as much as Americans food producers are. \n* HD - One of rare bets on American consumer spending. Leader in the area of organizing houses in sub-urban zones. With growth of WFH setup, more people expected to migrate to the country-side, so in the long term HD might benefit. Their balance sheet is also very solid.\n* VMC - Basic materials bet. Among all other basic materials companies, VMC looks the best. Also, despite I have high doubts about 1 tln infrastructure package to pass the Congress, VMC would benefit from this idea.\n* BRK-B - no introduction is needed. Buffet underperformed S&amp;P for a long time, but his portfolio is decent, he sits on a large pile of the cash and proper timing of deploying this cash would result in a great return later on. Still pretty safe to add BRK into my portfolio, their long term run looks pretty good.\n\nAlso I am considering adding 4 strong dividend companies with still promising futures.  \n\n\n* IBM - it might look like a dying mamont, but IBM for years is a leader of patents. They year by year increase their presence in cloud infrastructure, AI, robotics and other topics. With new CEO targets growth, IBM has a pretty decent future for the moment with a diversified portfolio of technologies &amp; patents. High hopes on IBM AI technologies. As well, IBM pays very huge dividends, so why not hold them for some time?\n* T - the same story but in another segment. Might benefit from 5G, has a diversified portfolio, enters the \"stream wars\" area and pays a huge dividend. As a diversification for stocks who pays small dividends but grow in market cap, good choice. \n* STX - Another high dividend representative from the hardware storage business. This area will stay around for a while, and STX is healthier than their competitors, look like a safe bet for a long term holding. \n* ABBV - And the last high-dividend company from the healthcare segment. There is a lot of analysis of ABBV around, so no reason to repeat it all.\n\nAnd 1 ETF:  \n\n\n* EXV6 - since I am EU resident, I need to invest into UCITS, and this is a basic materials ETF mainly RIO, BHP, GLEN, AAL. This segment supports all manufacturing around the world, why should they have gone?\n\nThat's basically it. I am still playing around numbers to calculate the potential risk of this portfolio and define the proper % allocation of stocks, but what's your thoughts on the companies from the list?",

I'm just curious what conglomerate is looking at them or is someone like Broadcom (who just aquired Symantec Corporation) or Accenture might snap them up as they just took over Symantec's CyberSecurity division.",

        "body": "Hock Tan is one of the most brilliant CEO's in the world and a strong reason on his own to invest in the company.  He came from nothing in Malaysia and forged his own path - moving to America and got two engineering degrees from MIT and an MBA from Harvard.  He worked his way up through several prominent companies before ending up at a small chip-maker that would eventually be acquired and become Avago (now Broadcom).  He has been the CEO throughout Avago's growth into the behemoth it is today.\n\nBroadcom's acquisition strategy has been very successful to date and they generally seem to be ahead of the curve in predicting where the market for tech is shifting while still maintaining a presence in consistent cash streams that let them fund operations and acquisitions.  They hit a road bump in 2018 when the $117 Billion acquisition of Qualcomm got blocked by Trump \"for national security reasons\" but I wouldn't put that on Broadcom.\n\nBroadcom currently has lots of exposure to the cloud and telecom, which are set to see a boon from the pandemic and beyond as companies re-evaluate their strategies.",
