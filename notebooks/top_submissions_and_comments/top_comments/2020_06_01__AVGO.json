Most solid companies have good tickers that people immediately recognize as their brand. A good example of the distinction between good and bad tickers is Broadcom (AVGO??) and QCOM (QCOM). Both are semiconductor manufacturers, but guess which one retail investors prefer. Getting $UTZ would be a HUGE deal, as it\u2019s the entire brand name.",

And though it's taking steps to reduce its reliance, their HDD/SDD sales currently account for over half of its revenue. Many of their SSD customers also happen to be their competitors, who are actively developing their own storage controllers. \n\nMRVL faces stiff competition in the networking and SSD hardware sectors, including such heavy hitters as Western Digital, Toshiba, Broadcom, and Intel. Though it recently (2018) acquired Cavium which extends its reach in the networking hardware market.\n\nManagement faced its share of controversy prior to 2016. It has since been replaced, however, and its acquisition of Cavium seems to indicate they're taking positive steps to gain strategic advantages, primarily in the networking market. \n\nI personally wouldn't consider them the \"next Apple stock\". They have a very long uphill battle to establish a secure market foothold, let alone establish market dominance. They don't have much diversity either, so any downturns that affect their product lines will hit them particularly hard. \n\nThey do seem to be poised for long term growth, but with a notable level of uncertainty.",

        "body": "I'm a new investor who started in January 2020 and have been learning while taking a pummeling.  Portfolio strategy: identify 20 good stocks, primarily with strong dividends, and gradually fuel them until I can retire and live on the proceeds in 20-30 years.  I'm looking to invest in huge companies that will remain afloat for the rest of my life, in so far as that is possible.  Initial goal: to fund each of the 20 stocks to $1k (60% complete), then to $3k, then to $5k.  After investing $100k between all 20 stocks, reassess.  All dividends are DRIPing into new shares.  \n\nI plan to invest or have already invested $1k in the following companies: Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD, JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Proctor and Gamble (PG), Tesla (TSLA), Alaska Air (ALK), GM, Intel (INTC), Home Depot (HD), NextEra Energy (NEE), Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), Verizon (VZ), Visa (V), Microsoft (MSFT), Lam Semiconductors (LRCX), Caterpillar (CAT), and 5% into an S&amp;P 500 index (VOO).  \n\nI inherited 6k in Lockheed Martin (LMT) and may also push that on the side.  I have $1k in Disney and will assess whether to add to that later; for now, it's not part of the plan above.  \n\nI would like to avoid selling any stocks for the majority of my time owning them.  I'm interested in solar tech and considering a position in SolarEdge (SEDG).  \n\nThoughts?  I'm a novice and input is welcome.",

For other financials, check out PRU, BEN (study risks).
