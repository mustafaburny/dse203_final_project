They are still the gold standard in that space which is huge in any cloud based computing platform. But they might not grow as much with AMD looking better.\n\nThat being said a safer long term bet, as well as just a good indicator of the tech industry in general I'd look at the analog semiconductors such as ADI and TXN. Their stock maybe suffering from some overinflation as well, but the last five years both stocks have been generally moving upwards. With more Boomer ran industries such as Industrials/Automotive/and Medical industries are starting to invest heavily in \"electrifying\" their industries so analog semiconductors are now breaking into new markets at high rates. Also in the next couple years ADI will aquire Maxim, which is the combination of the second and third largest analog semiconductor companies. \n\nAlso even the Intel and AMD chips need supporting circuitry which analog semiconductors still use.\n\nAlso because how sales work in that industry, a decrease in semiconductors typically precedes a decrease in the tech market. \n\nFor short term gain I think semiconductors aren't the best play, these industries typically grow but can be hard to pin down in short term.\n\nI'm waiting for a pullback, because I don't think we are out of the woods of a recession yet. And if it does I'm going to try to pick up stock and maybe some longer term options about ATM for a decent chance at profit because a yearly decline in semiconductors is pretty strange (INTC is still above a year ago even though they have done pretty bad as far as semis go in the last few months)\n\nSource: I work in the Semiconductor industry.",

The moves precede the Federal Reserve releasing (today, 2:00pm) minutes of a  July 28-29 committee meeting that may give clues about inflation targeting.\n* the S&amp;P 500 hit its highest level ever, wiping out all the losses from the coronavirus sell-off. \n* In a positive signal for equities, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Democrats might be willing to make more cuts to their stimulus proposal to seal a deal with Republicans and speed Covid-19 relief, then come back after the November elections with additional agenda items.\n* President Donald Trump said he called off last weekend\u2019s trade talks with China, raising questions about the future of a trade deal that is now the most stable point in an increasingly tense relationship.\n   * \u201cI canceled talks with China,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in Yuma, Arizona. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to China right now.\n* Crude oil eased after a report signaled surging U.S. gasoline stockpiles before OPEC and its allies meet to assess its supply agreement.\n* Democrats officially nominated Joe Biden for president.\n\n**Events in the World Today (EDT):**\n\n* DAY - Hong Kong Typhoon Emergency - No Trading\n* 2:00am - UK CPI (YoY-Jul) \\[3/3 Volatility\\]\n   * PPI Input (MoM-Jul) \\[2/3 Volatility\\]\n* 5:00am - Euro Zone CPI (YoY-Jul) \\[3/3 Volatility\\]\n* 6:00am - Euro Zone EU Leaders Summit \\[3/3 Volatility\\]\n* 8:30am - Canada Core CPI (MoM-Jul) \\[3/3 Volatility\\]\n   * Canada Wholesale Sales (MoM-Jun) \\[2/3 Volatility\\]\n* 10:00am - Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee convened by OPEC+\n* 9:30pm - China PBoC Loan Prime Rate \\[3/3 Volatility\\]\n* OPEC oil producers and allies such as Russia, a grouping dubbed OPEC+, meets on Wednesday to review compliance with oil cuts meant to support oil prices amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n   * OPEC+ is unlikely to change its output policy, which currently calls for reducing output by 7.7 million barrels per day (bpd) versus a record high 9.7 million bpd up until this month, according to OPEC+ sources.\n   * They said the meeting instead would focus on compliance by countries such as Iraq, Nigeria and Kazakhstan.\n* Asia stocks were mixed. Sentiment was dampened by lingering questions over the future of the U.S.-China trade pact after President Donald Trump said he called off last weekend\u2019s trade talks. \n   * Adding to the uncertainty, the State Department is asking colleges and universities to divest from Chinese holdings in their endowments.\n* British inflation jumped unexpectedly last month to its highest since March, as clothes shops did not hold their usual summer sales when they reopened after the coronavirus lockdown, but most economists expect it to fall again soon.\n\n**Earnings Before Open:**\n\n* Lowe's (6:00), Target (6:30), TJX, Analog Devices, Sharps, \n\n**Earnings After Close:**\n\n* Nvidia (4:20), Synopsys, LBrands (4:05), Arcimoto, SQM, Nordson, GoHealth\n\n[Earnings This Week](https://i.postimg.cc/PJY8b32m/er1.png)",
