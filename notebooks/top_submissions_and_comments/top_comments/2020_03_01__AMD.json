You gave me 5% premium for a 3 week expiration on that dogshit retard stock I bought when I thought every IPO was going to be Beyond Meat.  And you bought the literal top, and it closed at $0.85.  I don't even care if it gets called away.  You know what, I hope it becomes the AMD of fucking fish flakes, I hope you can use it to buy a Bentley for some Morgan Freeman motherfucker to drive your cat around lower Manhattan.  Because for the entire time I've owned it it's been wilting like an 80-year-old's dick.  Oh hurrrrr here's the Q3 results and we're only marginally less unprofitable.  This is the third time I've sold covered calls on this thing and it's still stuck to my account like goddamn Lyme disease.",

Cloudflare and runner up Fastly are the next generation CDNs taking on plenty of legacy companies and growing rapidly every quarter.\n\nYour post makes it clear that you have zero experience with any of this beyond reading some marketing pages.
