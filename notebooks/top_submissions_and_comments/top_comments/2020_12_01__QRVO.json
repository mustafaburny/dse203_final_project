The Karen's will screech \"$1 compliaaaance\" which anyone that keeps up with pennies know a stock has to clear $0.20 to be compliant, not $1. \n\nThe value in ZOM's BAW technology will have an impact in the veterinary world. QORVO isn't a shit company, they must likely see value in this company if they decided to partner with a penny stock. Patience will reward you.\n\nEdit: I know for shit that this stock will excel past $1 in 2021.",

I told myself I would buy in more if it dipped below .20, still haven't dipped below .20 lol. I'm content with my position and confident ZOM will continue its steady climb as we get closer to Truforma's release date. Their BAW technology that is co-developed with QRVO shows the different applications it can be used for besides veterinary usage. ZOM in my autistic belief is a lowkey golden nut",

And it is!\n\nCommercialization of their bread and butter Truforma machine will be coming in a few months and people are digging in now. \n\nI\u2019m siting on 2.3k. My plan is getting some profit on at least 3 lots early this week and perhaps buying in again next week if it dips some. FOMO is likely to be heavy since it\u2019s so cheap, both now and in a couple months. \n\nQorvo is the big daddy company that makes the acoustic modules for Truforma, so it\u2019s also in play for trading if you\u2019re up for it.",
