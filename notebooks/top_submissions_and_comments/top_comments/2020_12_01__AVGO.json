        "body": "The big successful retailers like HD, WMT, TGT, LOW, DG have been showing great earnings as a whole, but the stocks stay flat (except LOW which tanked).  So I think COST doesn't have much upside from here.  BUT might payoff on the downside IF earnings fail to surpass expectation.  So, for a lottery play, maybe something like a 355/350 put spread could pay off considering how cheap the options are at that level and getting a nice payout.\n\nThe Less successful retailers have been getting big boosts like SNR, TCS, BBBY, JWN, DLTR all because people expected the worst and they weren't so bad.  So GME?!?!  LOL.  This trend, plus all the shorting involved in the stock may actually present some huge upside / limited downside because all the shorters will have to buy back to cover.\n\nLULU - I'd love to bet against this one, but if you look at Nike earnings last Q, they did surprisingly really well.  I'm not sure I want to take a risk here.\n\nDon't expect any surprises with ADBE or AVGO and you can probably sell Iron Condors and make good money from either of those\n\nSHORT COUPA! lol.  We'll see, but there's nothing magical about this company.  It's a tool business use to track how much they spend with third parties.  It works alright and it's better than the IBM tool by miles, but I doubt they can keep up with earnings estimates.\n\nShort CHWY too just because it has run too high.\n\nTLDR: Cheap puts on COST, long shares of GME since options are too expensive, Sell Iron Condor on ADBE and AVGO, Short COUP and CHWY since options too expensive.",

Buy and hold.\n\nIf it was me I would buy 1/4 Apple(AAPL), 1/4 Disney(DIS), 1/4 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), 1/4 SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF.\n\n1. Apple is pretty much vertically integrated.  I hate the company tbh, but the new m1 processors are surprisingly good.  They are going to absolutely dominate with more R&amp;D in the next few years.\n2. Disney owns enough to almost become a monopoly for mainstream entertainment.   Pretty high right now though.  Might want to sub it for others below. \n3. Berkshire Hathaway has a long track record and is not as risky as tech.  Buffets death is already priced in, sorry to get morbid.  Trading for under book value last I checked.   (decrease risk)\n4. General index generally wins over most portfolios.  If not spy then choose which ever balanced index fund ETF you like or sounds good.  (decrease risk)\n\n  If you want more diversity in individual stocks other ones I like: JPM, JETS, BAC, ALLY, ICLN, PBW, AVGO, MSFT, AMZN, LZAGY, V, BABA, WMT.",

I\u2019m sure his kids aren\u2019t hurt hearing the crap people like you say about him. The man put me in early in companies like NVDA, CRM,\nAVGO and AAPL.

        "author": "x2c3v4b5",
        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from a Canadian perspective:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchange platforms in Canada. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but it is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing fees/spreads and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges, platforms, or apps (which costs nothing because they currently do not have any withdraw fees) and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet (i.e. a physical device). In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets while storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet (even though the asset can never truly go offline since it is always on the blockchain). Currently, there are sign-up bonuses for both companies (Newton $25, ShakePay $30) and I can give you referral codes if you are interested in using them in tandem/combination. Interestingly, if you already have accounts with both Newton and Shakepay, but you have never used a referral code, you can still get the bonus money from both companies and unlock the ShakingSats feature of ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin. All you have to do is e-mail their customer service teams and they will manually add my referral codes for you. Time wise, ShakePay usually takes care of this issue within 24 hours while Newton usually takes 3-5 business days. \n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC.U (USD) or QBTC.TO (CAD) in your TFSA. It is certainly expensive in terms of its fees and/or spread; however, if you are super-long and super-bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC because QBTC is a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange, platform, or app which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet to take my Bitcoin off of an exchange. \n\n4. If you are current in financial news, you would know what happened with the exchange/platform and Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is easily verifiable information and a famous story as well as a perfect example about \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". \n\n5. Unfortunately, with both QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchange/platform because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the underlying asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (i.e. Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced spread/fees.\n\n6. With those two options outlined above, there is no reason why you cannot do both (i.e. truly own actual Bitcoin in a cold storage wallet and own shares of the QBTC fund in a TFSA). Just realize that with the first option of truly owning the asset (i.e. Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling, buying, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your adjusted cost base for each transaction (if you want to be a law-abiding, tax-paying Canadian citizen).\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve as well as how you will move yourself towards those goals. \n\n8. Finally, for me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \n\nNow, here are some general points of interests (from a non-financial non-Canadian perspective) with regards to Bitcoin:\n\n1. For a lot of retail investors (such as you and I), there is a huge misconception in that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (i.e. Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people and an example of doing your due diligence. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that physical wallet device, it will never be stored on there, and this is because Bitcoin can NEVER leave the blockchain infrastructure. \n\n2. What does your cold storage wallet device do then? The physical device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (i.e. Bitcoin) on the blockchain infrastructure. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" (in that it is literally 24 words). From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of digits, letters, and characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets (i.e. Bitcoin) on the blockchain infrastructure for all intents and purposes.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) since this is what gives you access to your assets (i.e. Bitcoin). It does not matter if you lose your physical hardware device and it does not matter if your physical hardware device was destroyed physically. Why? Again, your assets (i.e. Bitcoin) are on the blockchain and not on the physical device itself. So, if you lose your physical hardware device for whatever reason, you can simply replace it with another one, set it up with your 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets (i.e. Bitcoin) since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" (i.e. 24-word \"seed phrase\") because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin and never give it out to anyone. So, in the rare event that you got robbed for your physical device, your Bitcoin are still secure under the assumption that the robber never forced you to give up your \"keys\" (i.e. 24-word \"seed phrase\"). They will simply have a useless physical device without the \"keys\" and you can just replace your physical device.\n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs or Dropbox and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase \"offline\" and as private as possible. So, if anyone asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. \n\nGood luck and I hope that it was helpful! I know that this place is probably overwhelmingly American, but Newton and Shakepay is the best combo to use in Canada at the moment in terms of accumulating this alternative asset class. =)",

Essentially if you're not holding your own crypto in a personal wallet, then you're essentially getting an IOU and there is always risk from exchanges (hacks, scams..etc). Also if you believe in the whole decentralization yadada etc...\n\nA fund would just be a stock option that tracks the price of BTC. Examples: QBTC, GBTC...etc. In this case you're not holding the underlying asset itself. Similar to a gold ETF. You don't physically own the gold or bitcoin but it still gives you a way to invest.\n\nNot sure what you mean with the last sentence. Just imagine BTC as digital gold. It has a price that correlates with fiat.",

Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",

Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",
