Regardless of your view on the future correlation being yields and tech/growth, QQQJ actually has a strong and increasing proportion (by market cap) of recovery stocks. With VIAC\u2019s crash, ODFL is the fourth largest holding. GRMN and EXPE are up there too. Biggest risk is from ROKU, CRWD and TTD, but there\u2019s an argument to made that FTNT, ZBRA and even ETSY are actually well positioned for recovery as far as tech stocks go. We will see, should be interesting!",
