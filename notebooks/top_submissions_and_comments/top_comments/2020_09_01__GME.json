It's a slot death. \n\nThey need to change the model. I suggest move away from game sales and become a 1 stop shop for all things video games. Sell third party controllers, hell become a third party company making controllers and peripherals. Gamestop Joycons $20 cheaper then Nintendo's, sell pro controllers for all three consoles and adaptors for PC gaming. Make memory cards, headphones, speakers, seats etc. Make it so gamestop becomes a 1 stop shop to fully set up your gaming room. Make gamestop clothing that gamers want. Sale cosplay stuff. Make going to gamestop an experience where gamers want to go and browse. And try to sale gamestop brand stuff. \n\nIdk if it would work, but it has a chance much better then the model they have now.",

Since Chinese manufacturers can sell generic, unbranded items on Amazon and eBay there's little room for a new third party seller. RetroBit and 8bitdo are more of wireless vintage/retro game peripheral companies that just so happen to make their wares compatible with current gen technology.\n\nI honestly think it's going to be a slow death for GameStop. I believe that even its retro gaming arm is drying up because of a lack of influx of old games. I don't know how GameStop can survive unless it completely divests itself from selling video games and turns into another business format.",

Now those are getting squeezed and the stock rises.\n\nThey have some business models that work well for them. Gamestop in game exclusives for pre-ordering is a good example.\nBrick and Mortar stores for games will still cater better to the hardcore gamer crowd. Getting a game the day it releases by walking into a store will always be popular. And as amazon squeezes out other game retailers like walmart and best buy - gamestop is the only source left for 'in person' game buying.\n\nThey reduced expenses by closing their bad locations\n\nThey are expanding into other things people like to buy in person, such as novelty items and board games.\n\nThe nail in the coffin for gamestop will be a massive increase in the minimum wage though. Too many kids are fighting to work at gamestop as a 'fun' job. If all of those employees got a 3 dollar an hour bump in their pay it would be tough for gamestop to keep turning a profit except in their flagship locations. Id expect the presidential election to impact gamestop stock price very much.",

Why?\n\nThis is the last regular season for Gamestop. They are gonna pump console sales. It's the thing that is going to keep their company moving for now. The plan will be to take advantage of the big brains who will buy disc drive consoles because they don't want to pay $70 a game on Amazon. Then they are going to completely rehaul their business model after the holidays.  \n\"But Ms. Cleo, Amazon...\" - shut your whore mouth. Gamers are impatient 12 year olds. They want to walk into the gamertown store and get their console the second they want it. Obviously Amazon is going to kill them on the gifting side, and will be the retail of choice for neckbeards who wont put 1 cent into gas but will put 20k into options and $14.99 for Prime. But you best believe people are going to want to walk in and smol brain Gamestop&gt;Bestbuy/Walmart because it has the word \"game\" in it.  \n\n\nThey got mofuckin' Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9. He's the friendly smooth shlong that was running Nintendo NA. You bet your ass hes going to work some Mario magic on that company. I'm full of shit you say? We'll see tendie boys. I'm Ms. Cleo not Nostradamus. I charge by the minute, I don't have all the god damn answers.  \n\n\n\"Gamestop is out of options now, no one buys hardcopies.\" THINK LATERAL. What's an in person retail gaming company that could benefit from physical copies of games, consoles, products, and potential online sales? MOTHERFUCKIN DAVE AND BUSTERS. I'm calling it right now, DnB bout to eat this shit up. They are about to double team peg the bears on this. You know what thats like, dont you?  \n\n\nOkay, I'm full of shit but GME 9c 10/30",

It\u2019s like why would you pre order PS5 from GameStop vs. Buy it directly on Sony? GameStop also sold the most Nintendo switches yet you can buy them directly from Nintendo.\n\nGameStop still does $4-6B in annual revenue and $1B of that this year will be digital. The fact is, is that some people still do buy them digitally. Nobody is arguing that the company should be worth tens of billions. Everyone\u2019s just saying it should be worth more than it\u2019s currently at. \n\nJust in cash alone they have $12/share worth of cash on hand. \n\nI\u2019ve been playing consoles for a long time now. And I\u2019d be damned to buy a digital version of a game. I can buy a preowned physical version for like $40 then turn around sell it for most my money back later. The $100 savings on the PS5 for the digital is just not enough for me to even consider it and for the XBOX the specs are just way better on the disc version that even if you wanted to play digital games you\u2019d still buy the disc version. \n\nOn top of all that, GameStop is planning on selling not just games in the near future but anything related to gaming. Computers, peripherals, chairs, etc. \n\nGME is going to be easy money during this console cycle because people doubt it so much that the chance of it being undervalued is still so high.",
