        "body": "No don't put emergency funds into the stock market!  I get your logic, I'm heavy into stocks for dividend these days.  But IME investing your emergency fund only works when you have huge sums of money - large enough that if you lose your job, your dividends are meaningful enough to help pay the bills.  But if we're only talking about a few thousand dollars, that money will be much more valuable in cash.  If you hate the no interest, maybe shop around for a CD that will lock you in and have  a penalty if you take the $$ out early?  Those usually pay actual interest, and you'd probably just need to give up a couple of months' interest if you cash it out for an actual emergency, such as unemployment.\n\nBut investing any new savings in an ETF is great.  Everyone here will tell you to do a tech ETF, but if you invest long enough you'll realize it's best to buy things when they are on sale and wait when they are not.  Right now, tech is overpriced, AATH, or at the very least, most definitely not on sale.\n\nGo for all of the non-tech names on sale.  I highly recommend the Vanguard high dividend ETF symbol VYM which includes all of the companies you'd buy if you were into individual stocks.  And they pay a dividend so you'll get $$$ to reinvest:\n\nVerizon, JNJ, Merck, Intel, JPM, Bank of America, Pepsi, Walmart, McDonalds, Abbvie, Coca Cola, Next Era Energy, Texas Instruments, UPS, IBM, Bristol Meyes Squid, Colgate-Palmolive, Gilead, Raytheon, ADP, Duke Energy, Kimberly Clark, 3M, Lockhead Martin........the list goes on and on\n\nThe more $$$$ I have, the more I'm just putting into this fund since it has all of the solid companies I used to buy individually anyways. Also, it's on sale now, unlike tech!",

        "body": "I've done only a limited amount of companies. One that I've made posts about and have recently doubled down on is Canadian Solar (CSIQ). They seem undervalued even with the risk they bear. They don't have the best ROIC, and they are pretty heavily in debt (even issued 200M in convertible bonds), but with even modest reinvestment and growth, this company is a good buy. I have to probably perfect my WACC with this company (I think it is riskier than it might seem, have to play around with the numbers a bit more), but I like what I see. Q3 will solidify my DD if I am right (I am forecasting more capex). I like management and they have been on since the beginning. CEO has been in the field since th 80s. They have some nice patents. Target is around $40/share, and opened my position at $22.80/share, with now a cost basis at $26.16/share.\n\nAnother company is Anthem (ANTM). I don't know why it is so cheap, but this is one of the best buys I've found so far. I am not completely done, but I feel the reason it is so cheap is because of upcoming US elections that will determine if the private healthcare industry is gonna shrink because of a public option under Biden. If that happens, health insurrers will see their revenues drop. I believe Biden will win (or most likely to win) which is why I am not buying the position.\n\nOne other company I've had my eye on for a while is Texas Instruments (TXN). They have marvelous ROIC (~27%), but they aren't a buy because they aren't reinvesting enough. I really have no idea how they are valued so much. I must be miscalculating their WACC and have it being too risky, but their growth just doesn't make sense even with 10x their current reinvestment rate. Make of that what you will.\n\nI am gonna do some analysis on INTC and AAPL just as an exercise, but have found other companies that might be promising.\n\nAnyway, please do your own DD. I am not a professional nor an expert. I do this in my spare time. If you are interested in this process, I have already linked the Damodaran process in my post. Follow my DD at your own discretion.",

        "body": "&gt;  how do you justify International exposure when those markets have been flat for over a decade? \n\nCapital gains are in the very long run a zero sum game (though it doesn't look that way since people think in terms of broad indexes).  \n  Thee the long term return of a stock is the sum of all future dividends (buybacks included).  The intrinsic value of a share is the discounted value of all future dividends.  The less expensive a stock is the less expensively you are buying that future stream of income for.  If you have a longer term horizon you want to buy assets that are cheap.  Ultimately stock prices normalize at the best estimate for discounted future dividends.\n\n&gt;  I don't see how US Tech juggernauts ever give up their advantage\n\n* Digital Equipment Corporation\n* Eastman Kodak\n* Polaroid\n* Schering-Plough\n* Sears, Roebuck and Company\n* Texas Instruments\n\nCould you have said the same thing 50 years ago about those?\n\n&gt;  It seems to me global diversification has only hurt returns historically speaking vs investing purely in the US.\n\nAbsolutely.  The USA has been the most successful economic society 1900-2000.  If you were an investor in say 1890 and compared the USA to Argentina would you have been certain of that? \n\nBut of course you don't get to invest in the USA prior to WW2.  Mostly the USA stock market isn't unreasonable.  Cap weighted it is rather high because some stocks are very richly priced.  You have to decide if you want to cap weight or hold very growth stocks.  And in 2020 you have to decide if USA outperformance in those growth areas if it happens at all is going to be  enough to justify paying the huge premium.",

        "body": "Broad Market:  That's tough to say.  If your very bullish on Tech stocks, QQQ might be your best bet. If you want a broader fund, then VOO is a good one.  QQQ uses the NASDAQ 100 as its bench mark while VOO uses the S&amp;P 500 as its benchmark. The top five holdings are the same for each of these, but in different percentages.  Another broad market fund I like is IWF. IWF uses the Russell 1000 as its benchmark.  It has a very good track record and seems to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over time. It's very similar to QQQ in its holdings, but again, percentages are slightly different.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices for a broad market fund. \n\nTech:  You'll get lots of opinions on this.  ARKQ and ARKW would be the choice of the ARK funds if you want it to be purely tech.  If you want to invest in disruptive innovative companies, but don't mind expanding beyond tech, consider ARKK. \n\nAnother one I like for tech is XLK. However, you have to keep in mind that XLK is almost 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft.  If you believe in those two companies, consider this one.  (VGT is very similar). \n\nSOXX is a fund that invests in semiconductor technology. One thing I like about this fund is that there will not be a lot of crossover between this one and your broad market fund.  Top holdings include: QCOM (9.5%), NVDA (9.5%), AVGO (8.3%), TXN (8%), INTC (5%). \n\nWCLD:  Cloud computing is a great sector, but be aware that many of these companies will also be in QQQ.  Top holdings include ZM (2.4%), CRM (2.3%), PLAN (2.2%), CRWD (2.1%), WDAY (2.1%). One thing I like about this ETF is that the investments are much more spread out than most ETFs. So, if any one company in the ETF is affected by bad news, it should have little impact on the ETF as a whole. I think WCLD is an excellent choice. \n\nClean Energy ETF:  I like ICLN like many others on this site.  I think the clean/renewable energy sector is really going to blossom over the next 10 years and I think ICLN is one of the better ETFs in the sector. Others you may want to look into include:  PBW, QCLN and TAN.",

AAPL, TXN, and KO for long term growth; NET, ARKF, and BOXL for pure speculation; VNQ and VDC for stability. I\u2019m torn right now between focusing on continuing to load on more speculation (I\u2019m 26), or to rush 100 KO shares to sell covered calls on for passive income and to essentially end up wheeling. Thoughts?",

        "body": "VOO is fairly diverse. It mimics the S&amp;P 500 index. Top holdings are:\n\nAAPL (Apple) - 7%\n\nMSFT (Microsoft) - 5.74%\n\nAMZN (Amazon) - 4.86%\n\nFB (Facebook)  - 2.4%\n\nGOOGL/GOOG - 3.3%\n\nBRK/B (Berkshire Hathaway) - 1.5%\n\nJNJ (Johnson &amp; Johnson( - 1.38%\n\nV (Visa) - 1.22%\n\nPG (Proctor &amp; Gamble) - 1.21%\n\nQQQ is a great ETF. It is likely to outperform VOO/S&amp;P 500 as long as tech continues to outperform the market. That said, there is a lot of crossover between QQQ and VOO.  The top holdings of QQQ include:\n\nAAPL - 14%\n\nAMZN - 11%\n\nMSFT - 11%\n\nFB - 4.5%\n\nGOOGL/GOOG - 7.1%\n\nTSLA - 3.3%\n\nNVDA - 2.6%\n\nSo, you can see that if you invest in both VOO and QQQ your top 5 holdings are the same, just different percentages. That's a fair bit of duplication. There is nothing wrong with doing that as long as you believe in those companies.  Just be aware of what you are doing and why. In fact, if you REALLY believed in some of those companies and wanted to INCREASE your holdings in one or two of those, you could \"enhance\" your holdings by putting some in an ETF that has one or two of those as an even larger percentage of its portfolio. For example, if you like Amazon FDIS is an ETF with 33% Amazon, followed by Tesla (7.4%), Home Depot (7%) and McDonald's (3.8%). Or you could invest in XLY which is 24% Amazon, 12% Home Depot, 6.5% McDonald's, 5.7% Nike and 4.5% Lowe's.  You can do the same with Apple (XLK is 25% Apple, VGT is 23% Apple, FTEC is 22.7% Apple, etc).\n\nNow, I'm not RECOMMENDING enhancing your portfolio in this manner, I'm merely demonstrating that you can really customize your portfolio with ETFs by duplicating your efforts in some companies to get exactly what you want without buying shares in individual companies (if that's what you want to do).\n\nPersonally, for new investors, I like the idea of investing into one broad market ETF (like VOO, for example) and then investing in a few sector ETFs.  You mention SOXX as one. That one specializes in semiconductors.  It's top holdings are QCOM (9.5%), NVDA (9.5%) AVGO (8.3%) TXN (7.9%), INTC, 5.3%, TSM (5.2%), AMD (5%). These are all solid companies. Keep in mind that if you pick VOO or QQQ as your broad market ETF, you are strong in the tech sector already and this is going to tilt your portfolio even more in the tech sector. Again, nothing wrong with that; just be aware of that.  (SMH is in most of the same companies, but different percentages). Both are highly rated ETFs.\n\nYou mentioned ICLN. I really like this ETF. I think clean/renewable energy is a sector that is only going to get stronger over the next 10 years .... well, really into the foreseeable future. It's been on a run the past 2 years and I think that will continue.  I'm very bullish on this ETF and I own quite a few shares in it.  (About 200 or so). A couple of other ETFs in this sector that you should check into are: QCLN, TAN and PBW.  Look at their holdings and their history and decide which one or ones you want to invest in. They are all good.\n\nFinally, you mentioned ARKK.  I'm bullish on all of the ARK funds.  ARKK may be one of the better ones in that group. I think most of the people in this subreddit are also bullish on this group of funds.  ARKK's top holdings include TSLA (10%), NVTA (7.2%), SQ (6.2%), ROKU (5.11%) CRSP (5%).  I'm bullish on all of these companies. This is a diverse set of companies and they are not in any one sector, so it makes the fund more of a broad market fund. That said, there is also quite a bit of Tech in the fund (depending on how you categorize some of these companies - is Tesla a Tech company or a car company?)  I like the approach Cathy Wood takes with her funds, but they can be a bit volatile and should be considered a little bit risky for that reason.\n\nI don't think you can go wrong with the approach you are looking at.  You might want to consider an approach along the lines of:\n\nVOO - 50%\n\nSOXX - 10%\n\nICLN - 20%\n\nARKK - 20%\n\nI think this would make your portfolio reasonably well diversified without being too overloaded in any one sector.  Then, if you wanted to \"enhance\" the portfolio with a few more shares in some company that you really like, you could add a few shares of that company; or put a few shares in an ETF that has a high percentage of that company (if there is one).\n\nBest of luck to you. I hope this helps.",
