        "body": "At this point, GME, AMC et al. are trading with the type of volatility weekly options usually do. Seasoned WSB people freaking out: come on, you're better than this. How many times have you been down 90% on a trade and just said fuck it may as well let it go to 0, something crazy could happen. And if you've been irresponsibly trading options long enough, you know - sometimes it does, and your -90% position goes to +200% in minutes based on a tweet from Trump or Elon or some other random factor. Well get it through your head that these are fucking SHARES. They don't expire, there's no theta decay, and they don't require a perfectly timed miracle to regain value. Remember when shares around here were boring and for pussies and people were openly mocked for even buying them when they could have bought options? Calm your tits and act like the degenerate gamblers you are instead of flipping out because you're losing money on a trade. THAT'S NORMAL HERE REMEMBER??\n\nNewbies, volatility is the bread and butter of WSB. If your portfolio isn't fluctuating wildly in one direction or the other on an hourly basis, or if you don't want it to, go hang with r/investing. Buy into some bonds and mutual funds and retire at 67 with just enough to maintain a living wage until you die. But that's not what this place has ever been about. The endgame has ALWAYS been yacht or food stamps, this isn't new. A few get rich, most go broke. But everyone who goes broke does it with dignity while trying to get rich, and most importantly posts loss porn for us all.\n\nWhat's gonna happen to all these stocks? I have no fucking idea. I'm holding my GME because if there's one thing I've learned over the years it's that no matter what I'm trading the second I sell for a loss, the shit miraculously recovers. Maybe I'm on a sinking ship, but at this point I've ridden enough sinking ships to the bottom of the ocean to not give a fuck.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

Anyone who has traded for  a while has learned an expensive lesson they couldnt afford. I know i have. \n\nnext time WSB will be smarter. And next time can still be around GME, AMC, etc. \n\nThere will be a point in the stock where wall street starts saying \"I told you so\",  let that happen for a few weeks. \n\nThen hit them again, at a broker with the financial strength to never have to shut you off",

        "body": "So, let\u2019s just rewind a few days. \n\nThursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\n\nIn the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!\n\nThe corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!\n\nWhat they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.\n\nPeople, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!\n\nThey will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.\n\nThey are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!\n\nHERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;\n\nNo matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...\n\nTHEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It\u2019s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.\n\nThey can\u2019t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!\n\nEveryone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.\n\nIf everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.\n\nPlease upvote, share etc. Don\u2019t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what\u2019s necessary and finally get ours. We\u2019ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It\u2019s time for change.\n\nGME &amp; AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.\n\nLETS DO THIS!!! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb",

GME is by far the most shorted stock and is 100% the worst of their problems and therefore should be our primary focus, however, we can compound this movement, and apply additional pressure by buying other majorly shorted stocks.

Then went to a coffee shop where they had msnbc on a tv, they were interviewing the co-founder of Reddit and giving him credit for what he unleashed on wallstreet.  So there\u2019s this man in his sixties with his phone out looking at a stock graph while he\u2019s watching the tv.  I mention that it\u2019s odd they are asking the reddit founder what\u2019s next for wsb.   The guy looks at me and smiles, says, \u201cwell now they are moving to silver.\u201d  \n\nI was like, wait, what?  I hadn\u2019t seen even a blip about silver.  I didn\u2019t say anything because maybe I missed it.  So a couple hours later, I\u2019m back on wsb and no... it\u2019s all GME, AMC, BB, NOK.  Nothing about silver.  But then by the next day... silver silver silver..\n\nIt really seemed like the attempt to manipulate wsb into silver got traction outside of wsb first where they believe anything the MM says.  Back here in the actual wsb, the attempted posts about silver were getting downvotes.  \n\nIs it a mystery that we have millions of new subscribers?  They needed to be able to upvote their own narrative here.  So now there\u2019s five times as many bots and sock puppets as real wsb subscribers.",

        "body": " \n\nSo, let\u2019s just rewind a few days. Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\n\nIn the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!\n\nThe corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!\n\nWhat they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.\n\nPeople, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun! They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.\n\nThey are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!\n\nHERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART; No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...\n\nTHEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It\u2019s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.\n\nThey can\u2019t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!\n\nEveryone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.\n\nIf everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.\n\nPlease upvote, share etc. Don\u2019t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what\u2019s necessary and finally get ours. We\u2019ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It\u2019s time for change.\n\nGME &amp; AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.\n\nLETS DO THIS!!! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb",
