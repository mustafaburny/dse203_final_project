You also have to be cognizant of the fact that drops in input costs will increase profitability on orders already contracted through May. Mills will put lower input costs into their pocket and increase gross margin based off sold material already booked. I do think iron ore has been speculatively over heated.  It is due for a bit of a pull back, but there are other derivatives that can be used for steel making like shredded scrap. China planned for this iron ore supply and price issue and changed their stance on importing shredded scrap in October/November. They haven\u2019t imported foreign scrap for years. A signal that they knew this was coming. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t bet on pure iron ore plays.",

He worked for a bunch of companies in management, eventually ending up at ABNB.  He made a bunch of money over the years but his dream was to be in management at a company as it was taken public.  He got frustrated that ABNB wasn't going public, so he left for ANT.  Yeah, so we were all stoked.  Honestly, I was probably a little jealous hater because stuff, but still I was cognizant of that and happy for him when ANT was going to launch into the third orbit with its IPO.  It was really gonna be nutz.  He was gonna be among the richest people in China.  Then the 'regulators' quashed that IPO and ABNB is now going public.  Wow.  It's all good, he's still a millionaire I guess, which is rare in China anyways.  I'll never forget the evil look in his sons eye when he threw the toy car at my face full force.  there was real malicious intent there.  Good thing I'm a jedi.  Lol.",
