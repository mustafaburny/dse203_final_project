Be patient, and realize that it's gambling.  Buy a bunch of a cheap penny stock and hope it takes off.  Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.  If you want safe returns, don't play around with penny stocks.  \n\nMIR might go big, they're making a new class of pain killer that could disrupt the opiod industry.
