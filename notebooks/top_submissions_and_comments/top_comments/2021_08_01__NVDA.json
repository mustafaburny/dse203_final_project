        "body": "When the 30xx line was announced and the stock was at $550, there was a thread here and I'd mentioned I was picking up a ton of it ($10k); that the products were fantastic and that Nvidia had a massive edge over their competition in the software and AI department. A friendly fellow here told me \"thanks for holding the bag for the rest of us,\" which got a lot of upvotes. Well, here we are 9(?) months later and I'm feeling pretty good holding that bag. \n\nAnd the points of my analysis continue to hold true: no other big semiconductor company is invested in software like Nvidia is. They continue to release software to solutions that floor the ur competition. Apple and Google realized long ago that software is at least as important for cameras as is hardware (something the big camera makers *still* haven't figured out), and ravaged the camera market as a result. Nvidia is doing the same with semiconductors.",

        "body": "From [Seeking Alpha](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3724985-xilinx-deal-spread-with-advanced-micro-devices-widens-to-highest-ever):\n\nThe deal spread between Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had widened to $65/share, or about 45%, the highest since the deal was announced in October. Xilinx fell 3.7%, while AMD rose 5.9%. Several other technology deals that also need Chinese antitrust approval also saw their spreads widen today.\n\nOne reason for Xilinx's (XLNX) move down may be that risk arb investors can't handle the potential downside for Xilinx (XLNX) if a deal with AMD (AMD) were to fall apart as AMD's shares continue to rocket higher, according to CNBC's David Faber. CNBC's Jim Cramer also said he believed that AMD (AMD) has become a meme stock at this point. AMD shares have jumped almost 25% in the past two weeks.\n\nIn addition a Dealreporter column from last night may be contributing to weakness in the spreads. The opinion piece points out that China's leaders appear to have changed their tone about the importance of technology in late May and may have put the country on a \"technology war footing.\" The U.S. and South Korean's announcement to fund multi-billion dollar semiconductor factories may also have contributed to China's potential slowdown on approving the U.S. deals.\n\nAs far as Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) planned purchase of Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM), the Dealreporter column says the timing is uncertain. Last month traders circulated a report that the timing for Chinese approval had moved out as some customer have issues with export controls, though the deal was still likely to be approved.\n\nRisk arb investors may also be \"de-risking\" due to heightened antitrust risk after Aon (NYSE:AON) and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) abandoned their $30B deal last week after the U.S. sued to block the deal and after a report from The Information last night that the U.S. DOJ is considering filing a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth's planned $8B purchase of Changed Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG).\n\nLast month MLex reported that the AMD's (AMD) purchase of Xilinx (XLNX) is expect to see a Phase Two review by Chinese antitrust regulators. China's State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR is believed to have reached out to industry participants a few months ago to find out their views on market definitions and market shares.\n\nOther deal spreads that are wider today include Maxim (MXIM)/Analog Devices (ADI) and Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR)/II-VI(NASDAQ:IIVI).\n\nAlso last week it was reported that China's review of Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) planned purchase of Arm Holdings (ARMHF) was said to be delayed. China's antitrust regulatory hasn't started its formal review of the deal for Softbank to sell Arm to Nvidia, according to a report from The Information.",

I'm betting on Qualcomm for this, alongside Apple.\n\nAlso have a stake in TSMC, AMD, NVDA, ASML, AMAT, ON and ACLS. Of those, only ON and TSMC have less than stellar returns (though I bought TSMC at the Jan/Feb peak).\n\nNot so sure I actually want to go in on Intel. Good cash flow, but they're a dinosaur. Maybe they can surprise in the next few years, but I doubt it.",

They haven't yet gained widespread acceptance from the B2B market, so there's no B2B-level support. There's no B2B-level support, so the market hasn't accepted them yet.
