Offerings with intel chips frequently outnumber AMD chips by 4:1 and they hold a significant portion of the market for inexpensive consumer machines and office workstations. They're not going away soon. They're starting to produce GPUs again, which may or may not go anywhere, but it's a consideration on a \\~5 year horizon.\n\nPersonally I don't think  who's going to \"win\" Intel vs AMD is really all that important in the market space. They're both good companies for different reasons. If intel doesn't turn things around design-wise in a couple years and start producing more competitive products (outside of the bargain and top-end ranges) rather than relying on market dominance, then there's reassessment that needs to happen.\n\nPersonally, I think the thing that really needs to be watched in that marketspace is what Nvidia does with ARM. If they can break ARM processors out of the mobile world into the desktop/notebook space then that's a shakeup that could affect the team red/blue balance. We really don't know where that's going yet, and until we do, I still like Intel (it's currently maybe 2% of my portfolio, notwithstanding however much may be held in ETFs).",

        "body": "Lately I've been buying calls 1-3 weeks out on hot stocks that dip  (NVDA was my main moneymaker in June) leading up to or following earnings/split... banking on the following day or two being green enough to get a 25%+ profit. This worked for a little while, but the dips I have been buying lately continue long enough to kill my options. \n\nI've had three calls in the last week that came alive 1 week before expiry... one I ended up losing 100% on because I waited literally a few minutes too long and kept holding onto hope as it kept decreasing, one for a 40% loss and the other for a 60% profit... both of which continued up all week and my options would've been 4x.  \n\nI rolled my NVDA profits into calls that are one quarter out on stocks that dipped following earnings or a big announcement (NFLX, TSM, ETSY). I'm going to be anxious for the next couple months. \n\nAnyway, if you got any hot tips, let me know. :)",

Also, I would love it if you can list several Large Cap Growth companies that pay a 3% or higher dividend. I know of one (BX) that has gone up quite a bit in the last 2+ weeks.\n\nNo one buys AAPL for their .60%, MSFT for their .79% dividend, or NVDA for their .80% dividend. Because you might be able to make more money opening up a Savings/checking account or a CD in a bank. People buy those stocks because of their growth. I own all 3 of those stocks. I've had NVDA for about 4 years and it has grown 415%. I've owned MSFT for a little over a 1 year and I am up 55%. I've owned AAPL since August of last year and I am up 18%. \n\nHowever, people will buy NLY specifically for its 10.37% dividend, or EPD specifically for its 7.98% dividend, or T specifically for its 7.42% dividend. But, none of those companies are considered \"Growth\" companies and of course, they do not grow much either.\n\nGrowth stocks similar to the ones you mentioned will never pay a high dividend, even though they could afford to. IBM pays a good dividend, but its stock never moves. Three years ago it was at a $152 and today, it is down to $140 (It's not a growth company). CVX pays a good dividend, but it grows at a snail's pace. Three years ago it was at $120 and today it is down to $102 (Not a Growth Company). \n\nPlease, share your knowledge/wisdom.",

Thus, will be adding this post here.\n\nI have started investing about approximately 1 month ago, and have picked out these stocks and crypto as long term positions. I would be listing out the main reasons on why I have purchased these stocks and crypto, and would like to get some opinions on my current portfolio.  \n50% Stocks  \n\\- Apple (AAPL) 8%  \nApple products are widely used, many loyalists to its product. Still has room for growth and do not see it dying anytime soon. Picked as tech blue chip.  \n\\- AMD 14%  \nBullish on semiconductors in the long term, picked both AMD and NVDA as forerunners in the industry. Picked for growth potential.  \n\\- Microsoft (MSFT) 3%  \nSimilar to AAPL, both companies are huge and have a large customer base, with further room for growth. Picked as second tech blue chip.  \n\\- Nvidia (NVDA) 5%  \nSimilar to AMD, hard to pick between both companies, and thus have chosen both. Picked for growth potential.  \n\\- SEA LTD (SE) 11%  \nSEA LTD has 3 subsidiaries, Shopee (e-Commerce), GArena (Gaming) and SEA Money (Digital Payment). A long term pick in which I believe has a chance of being a multi-bagger and that its growth potential has not peaked yet.  \n\\- Tesla (TSLA) 9%  \nFuturistic EV company, a favorite pick of certain investors. Similar reasoning to SE, with a certain amount of risk tied to it.  \n20% Cryptocurrency  \n\\- Ethereum (ETH) 16%  \n\\- Chainlink (LINK) 4%  \nPurchased mainly to gain some exposure to cryptocurrency. Currently viewed as a commodity, in which I believe ETH and LINK has high growth potentials to it.  \n30% Cash  \nCurrently untouched and waiting to be used to buy any potential dips or add positions in other sectors, as I am very exposed to tech-related movements. Will gain about 1% every month from salary, which can then be used to purchase more stocks.   \nCurrently red on SE, AAPL and MSFT as most of my positions are new and would be looking to average down on these depending on market conditions. Also looking to diversify out of tech with stocks such as Disney (DIS) and Thermo Fisher (TMO). Not adding more funds into crypto, as I feel 20% is already a high ratio.   \nOpinions for improvement are welcome.",

That, plus increasing competition in payments forms a thesis that PayPal is going below $250 again.  \n\nThere's another school that says the drop was a mistake, a knee jerk response to a surprise dip... but that the dip shouldn't have been a surprise because the EBay breakup was a known known, and just happened slightly earlier than expected.  That school also feels that Venmo is a juggernaut so the existence of competition doesn't bother them.\n\nI've had a small position and my thesis was a bit of each, but I held through earnings with the intent to sell if it popped.  That didn't happen so I had to make a new plan.  I still intend to sell, but now I'm looking to do so into strength when people realize the earnings sell off was a bit much.  Murphy's Law may prevent that, as the story that \"there's lots of competition\" is one that can be told today, whereas \"Venmo is crushing it\" is a story that will more likely be told in slower quarterly instalments.",
