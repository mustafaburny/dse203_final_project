Not too surprising that IBM has lagged the competition.\n\nKrishna is the opposite. Looks like he has spent essentially his entire life in technical positions at IBM. He also has a PhD rather than an MBA, which is generally rare to see for CEOs or high executive positions. This guy has been balls deep in heavy research&amp;development for most of his life and is probably one of the most brilliant people in IBM. He is inline with the current trend of technical based CEOs who have been leading the technology sector in the last 5 years. The previous CEO was not similar to the trend (Tim Cook also is not similar to that trend, for what it's worth). \n\nAlso pointing out the obvious that he is from India and immigrated (was not born in, huge difference in mindset) to the United States. Similar mold to guys like Nadella, Pichai, Musk. This guy literally checks every box and then some for what I imagine you would want as a CEO for a tech company in 2020. IBM might actually dig themselves out of their rut with him leading the vision. Maybe.\n\nI sold some IBM stock recently and this has me intrigued to maybe buy back into it again.",

Then you have probably 20k from SSI benefits,  so 50k salary. Not bad. But how do you get a safe 10% yield? Well, you pick stocks very carefully.

You should get 4-5% paid out in dividends,  and then be able to pull 4-5% off each year in gains. That'll get your 10% and then the money should last if the market holds up in the 2020s.

It\u2019s because they are jealous they didn\u2019t enter and are asking why isn\u2019t their JNJ and IBM going vertical like other growth companies that have weak balance sheets. \n\nTickers of companies that investors find special are going to get FOMOd into hard. Look at how many were quitting and giving up on Apple back in their first decade after IPO. After amazons early struggles where they were constantly dumping capital into expansion with no profit or consistent positive cash flow. \n\nTesla is still young and the future is bright. I\u2019m not predicting it\u2019s going to be a trillion cap company one day but I\u2019ll sure as shit won\u2019t bet against what they are doing . Because they are proving to be that young breakthrough company and investors don\u2019t wanna miss out on that. Their potential is definitely great and 100b market cap is nothing. Decade from now if they are executing on their plan and still showing growth and dominating the field , their Cap is still going to be higher than it is today. $650 a share ain\u2019t nothing unless your short term trading. \n\nJust like when it was $300 a pop years ago...real long term investors didn\u2019t give a shit about entering at such ridiculous highs if they plan to hold for decades what\u2019s it matter if you believe in the companies potential to turn into a giant like an amazon, google, Apple, etc etc....",

They aren't really a bleeding edged tech firm, they're a government consultant for the most part. So, not really relevant here. Yes yes, I know, deep blue, blah blah blah. No, they're not actually a silicon valley tech firm. They're the Sears of the tech world. They're just in it for the contracts.

He thought the Internet was a fad, before he said he predicted that it would be great. 640K should be enough for anybody, he said, and yes, he did say it. His firm was a gang that instituted a \"new computer tax\" and it made him money. Nothing to do with engineering. He didn't get where he was because his company made great software.
