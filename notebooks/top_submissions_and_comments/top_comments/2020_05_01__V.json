We will open too quickly.  \n\nPeople already won't take precaution now.  Once things open a percentage of people will treat it as free and clear.  The other will be buckling down and changing habits. This means less spending and probably a new round isolation.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong and we isolate longer.  In that scenario I think we stay isolated longer than people investing are thinking and results won't match expectations \n\nBut what if I'm wrong about both assumptions, you scoff? Well the funds I sold were off about 12% from ATH. If we hit/exceed that in thr short term I'll eat that loss as I still couldn't trust thst rally until we have good testing, treatment and/or vaccine.\n\nIn my risk/reward calculations, a calculated withdraw from this market seems like it's worth it for me",

Collect your premium\n\n* If the price stays flat or goes up, keep your nice premium and sell another put.\n* If the price drops below your strike, you get assigned and now own the stock.\n\n2: Sell a covered call at a higher strike at a strike that puts you above your basis\n\n* If the Stock stays flat or goes down, keep your premium and sell another call\n* if the stock goes up, get your shares called away and use the money you got from it as collateral to sell another put and go back to step 1.\n\nIt's a good strategy because during no step can you actually lose money (on options). The only risk comes while holding the stock if it tanks, but then thats a risk with just holding stock in any case. You can also miss out on potential gains by having your shares called away if the stock jumps, but still, that's not losing money.\n\nExample:\n\n* SPY is at 300 today, you're willing to buy it for 295. You sell a 295p and collect a $5 premium, putting up $29,500 as collateral\n* By expiration SPY is at 294, so you get assigned and buy the shares at $295 each.\n* Your basis is 290 per share (put strike - premium collected) so you're willing to sell it at anything over that.\n* You immediately sell a covered call 295c putting up your 100 shares for collateral for $5 premium\n* By expiration Spy is at 296, so you get your shares called away, selling them for 295 each\n\nyou now have completed a full revolution of the wheel, and have made $100. Make sure you run it on a stock you feel fairly good about long term, because you are going to be buying and holding it during one step. If it crashes you're gonna be set back.\n\nHere's the video I learned it from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRYBh6dtxjY",

Yes, everyone knows they'll be bad, but if 40% of shale drillers go under, and then 20% of retailers follow J Crew and Neiman Marcus going under, and then 2 of the Big 3 Auto guys need bailouts, and then real estate starts dropping due to unemployment and rent issues cascading, and then 1 of the too-big-to-fail banks needs a bailout...I'm not sure that's all priced in.\n2. Dems and Repubs go back to not agreeing on anything, maybe coupled with deficit hawks remembering about the deficit again.  Powell's hands get tied in hopes of not running up the deficit, inducing a depression-level collapse when QE stops abruptly.\n3. It becomes seen as patriotic in some circles not to wear a mask or socially distance such that Coronavirus cases skyrocket.  We'd be talking about \"NY\" levels of dead throughout vast swaths of the country.  It goes from 9/11 levels of dead Americans per day to 2-3 times that, and the media would be trying to decide if we might get Holocaust levels of dead overall, inducing Trump to blame China even more aggressively such that Xi cuts off export of things like masks to the US, shoots up Hong Kong, and craters the semiconductor industry, just to show who's boss...\n4. Trump's poll numbers suffer so much he decides to shoot up some Iranian speed boats or bomb something in Venezuela or the South China Sea because Fox News flashes Bush poll numbers from the first Gulf War.  But of course it would be so horribly executed that Jared would be put in charge of fixing things...\n5. Trump gets sick and dies (most likely not directly from Coronavirus but rather from the bleach enema someone endorsed at Mara Lago or some Chinese troll talked up on his twitter feed).  Things would definitely drop initially, but this might be the best hope for a V-shaped recovery.\n\nSorry for mixing in some politics, but I honestly think that a whole bunch of the downside stems from politics and reality clashing in ways that spill over into the market.  I can't ever remember a time it was easier to argue for what would have seemed like ridiculous worst-case scenarios just a couple years ago.",
