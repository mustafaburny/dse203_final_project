We will open too quickly.  \n\nPeople already won't take precaution now.  Once things open a percentage of people will treat it as free and clear.  The other will be buckling down and changing habits. This means less spending and probably a new round isolation.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong and we isolate longer.  In that scenario I think we stay isolated longer than people investing are thinking and results won't match expectations \n\nBut what if I'm wrong about both assumptions, you scoff? Well the funds I sold were off about 12% from ATH. If we hit/exceed that in thr short term I'll eat that loss as I still couldn't trust thst rally until we have good testing, treatment and/or vaccine.\n\nIn my risk/reward calculations, a calculated withdraw from this market seems like it's worth it for me",

As thanks for supporting Trump, Pence is in Florida being photographed at local diners to show that the state is safe and tourism is endorsed by the White House. \n\nFlorida allowed theme parks to submit proposals for reopening last Friday.

We will open too quickly.  \n\nPeople already won't take precaution now.  Once things open a percentage of people will treat it as free and clear.  The other will be buckling down and changing habits. This means less spending and probably a new round isolation.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong and we isolate longer.  In that scenario I think we stay isolated longer than people investing are thinking and results won't match expectations \n\nBut what if I'm wrong about both assumptions, you scoff? Well the funds I sold were off about 12% from ATH. If we hit/exceed that in thr short term I'll eat that loss as I still couldn't trust thst rally until we have good testing, treatment and/or vaccine.\n\nIn my risk/reward calculations, a calculated withdraw from this market seems like it's worth it for me",

Collect your premium\n\n* If the price stays flat or goes up, keep your nice premium and sell another put.\n* If the price drops below your strike, you get assigned and now own the stock.\n\n2: Sell a covered call at a higher strike at a strike that puts you above your basis\n\n* If the Stock stays flat or goes down, keep your premium and sell another call\n* if the stock goes up, get your shares called away and use the money you got from it as collateral to sell another put and go back to step 1.\n\nIt's a good strategy because during no step can you actually lose money (on options). The only risk comes while holding the stock if it tanks, but then thats a risk with just holding stock in any case. You can also miss out on potential gains by having your shares called away if the stock jumps, but still, that's not losing money.\n\nExample:\n\n* SPY is at 300 today, you're willing to buy it for 295. You sell a 295p and collect a $5 premium, putting up $29,500 as collateral\n* By expiration SPY is at 294, so you get assigned and buy the shares at $295 each.\n* Your basis is 290 per share (put strike - premium collected) so you're willing to sell it at anything over that.\n* You immediately sell a covered call 295c putting up your 100 shares for collateral for $5 premium\n* By expiration Spy is at 296, so you get your shares called away, selling them for 295 each\n\nyou now have completed a full revolution of the wheel, and have made $100. Make sure you run it on a stock you feel fairly good about long term, because you are going to be buying and holding it during one step. If it crashes you're gonna be set back.\n\nHere's the video I learned it from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRYBh6dtxjY",
