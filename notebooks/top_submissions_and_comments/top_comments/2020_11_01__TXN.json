Why pay someone to chose stocks for you when you can just copy them for free.\n\nWhile that's possible, the other possibility is that those stocks will revert to the mean, while INTC and TXN rise to meet them.  The purpose of an index fund is to provide a lot more spread to the bet , reducing risk via diversification.  They generally do so at a very low rate, so if the purpose is just to invest in the sector it's a much less risky way to do so.",

        "body": "I understand the desire, but those sparse expirations, low volumes, and crazy wide bid/asks are all warning flags to steer clear of options on those ETFs. You're just throwing away money trading those options.\n\nA better idea would be to figure out what the top 3 holdings of each of those funds are and see if any of those companies have highly liquid options. Then trade options on those companies as a sort of proxy.\n\nFor example, the top three holdings of SOXX are AVGO, NVDA, TXN. All three have decent liquidity.\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SOXX/holding\n\nYou can then use an asset correlation app to see which of those individual stocks with liquid options most closely correlates to the fund's performance. For example:\n\n[Portfolio Visualizer asset correlation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&amp;symbols=SOXX+AVGO+NVDA+TXN&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;tradingDays=60&amp;months=36)\n\nTXN is the closest with a .84 correlation to SOXX.\n\n\n\nFWIW, you're paying an obscene expense ratio on ARKK. You'd likely make more money over the long run holding QQQ instead of ARKK.",
