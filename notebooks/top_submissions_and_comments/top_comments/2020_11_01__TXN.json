You're just throwing away money trading those options.\n\nA better idea would be to figure out what the top 3 holdings of each of those funds are and see if any of those companies have highly liquid options. Then trade options on those companies as a sort of proxy.\n\nFor example, the top three holdings of SOXX are AVGO, NVDA, TXN. All three have decent liquidity.\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SOXX/holding\n\nYou can then use an asset correlation app to see which of those individual stocks with liquid options most closely correlates to the fund's performance. For example:\n\n[Portfolio Visualizer asset correlation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&amp;symbols=SOXX+AVGO+NVDA+TXN&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;tradingDays=60&amp;months=36)\n\nTXN is the closest with a .84 correlation to SOXX.\n\n\n\nFWIW, you're paying an obscene expense ratio on ARKK. You'd likely make more money over the long run holding QQQ instead of ARKK.",
