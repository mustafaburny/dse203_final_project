Are you absolutely sure about that?\n\n&gt; Is PayPal sketchy?\n\n\nWell, from my experiencing using it to sell things, hell yes, PayPal is sketchy.  They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it\u2019s easy from there; what task isn\u2019t tough at first?It\u2019s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it\u2019s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",
