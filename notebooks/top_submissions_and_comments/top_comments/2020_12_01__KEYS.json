The fact that they have filed the shelf offering last spike but not exercise it yet from  is a sign it may come. Also look into their last ER to see what is the cash flow. Usually those are keys factor to look into if you want to hold any penny stock coz risk of offering is always minimum 25% stock price drop. \nNo one would know ahead when the offering is out but speculating if there might be one and keep an eye open at all time to self as fast as possible if offering drop.",

Resulting in positive sentiment.- More and more studies by respected institutions/universities are conducted and many have positive outcomes on several serious psychological disorders (ptsd, anxiety, depression etc.). Resulting in positive sentiment.- Because these studies are conducted by professionals, governments seem to open up about legislation of psychedelic medicines. Resulting in positive sentiment.- Lastly, to me it seems that media coverage on the psymed industry is rising. I might be biased here, however, it is very likely that MMED's uplisting on Nasdaq won't come through without some noise. And since the uplisting is positive, it results in additional positive sentiment.\n\nNow, the exact influence of these observations is hard to factor out, but I believe these are the keys to the recent surging market. Can't answer your question (obviously), but I look at it this way:\n\nMMED hype is going on right now and the uplisting is yet to come, so I'm not expecting a major pull back anytime soon. However, Mindmed generating a decent amount of revenue is YEARS away, let alone a decent amount of profit. They will likely encounter some challenges which may push back the positive sentiment quite a bit (and thereby stock price). In the long run though, they will likely get somewhere since MMED has such a diversified product line. Thus: either try to make a quick buck on the current hype cycle or make a shit ton of money in the long run.\n\nIf you want to keep up with Mindmed specific news/updates, you might wanna check out /r/MindMedInvestorsClub. Just sayin\n\nDisclaimer: this is no financial advice, just my view on Mindmed's case. I have a small amount of MMED stocks.",

Are you absolutely sure about that?\n\n&gt; Is PayPal sketchy?\n\n\nWell, from my experiencing using it to sell things, hell yes, PayPal is sketchy.  They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it\u2019s easy from there; what task isn\u2019t tough at first?It\u2019s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it\u2019s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",

I decided that this would be a dramatic moment for me to make my debut. To the amazement of all my friends, I strode confidently over to the keyboard and sat down.\n\n\u201cFoobarGoop  is up to his old tricks,\" somebody chuckled. The crowd laughed. They were all certain that I couldn't make a single tendie.\n\n\"Can he really trade?\u201d I heard a girl whisper to Arthur. \"Heavens, no!\" Arthur exclaimed \"He never bought an FD in all his life... But just you watch him. This is going to be good.\"\n\nI decided to make the most of the situation. With mock dignity I drew out a silk handkerchief and lightly dusted off the keys. Then I rose and gave the revolving credit line a quarter of a turn, just as I had seen an imitator of Shkreli do in a prison stretch.\n\n\"What do you think of his execution?\" called a voice from the rear.\n\"We're in favor of it!\" came back the answer, and the crowd rocked with laughter.\n\nThen I Started to Trade. Instantly a tense silence fell on the guests. The laughter died on their lips as if by magic. I filled the first few calls of Elon\u2019s immortal \u2018Funding Secured\u2019 Shelf Offering. I heard gasps of amazement. My new friends sat breathless -- spellbound!\n\nI traded on and as I my strike hit I forgot the people around me. I forgot the hour, the place, the breathless obsevers The little world I lived in seemed to fade -- seemed to grow dim -- unreal. Only the options were real. Only the weeklies and profits they were going to bring me. \n\nAs the last cents of my account drained away, the room resounded with a sudden roar of laughter. I found myself surrounded by a crowd of retards. How my new friends carried on! Men shook my hand -- wildly congratulated me -- pounded me on the back in their enthusiasm! Everybody was exclaiming with delight -- plying me with rapid questions... \u201cFool! Why didn't you buy them back when you were only 50% down?\u201d\u2026 \u201cAre you insane?\u201d -- \"How much of your savings did you blow?\u201d -- \"Who was your teacher?\"\n\n\u201c*WallStreetBets is my teacher*,\u201d I replied. \"And just a short while ago I couldn't trade a note.\"",
