        "body": "Ok because you guys are actually too stupid to understand how this works, I'm just going to copy and paste from Matt Levine.\n\nTL;DR: Robinhood profits because retail trades are random, so HF traders can actually get a small spread. Your prices will be better than institutional prices (so we're winning at the expense of the big boyz).  \n\n\n&gt;Robinhood\u2019s business model is:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Citadel gives it money.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It uses the money to give you free stock trades.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That really is taking money from the rich (high-frequency traders) to give to the poor, sort of (millennials who want to trade stocks on their phones).\u00a0Who did you *think*\u00a0was giving it money?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Not only that. Payment for order flow really is \u201cone of the most controversial practices on Wall Street,\u201d but [the controversy tends to be confused and obfuscated](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-02-25/-flash-boys-exchange-isn-t-about-the-little-guy). The basic idea of payment for order flow is that electronic market makers want to be left alone to quietly make the spread: They want to buy stock for $99.99 and sell it at $100.01 and clip two cents on each trade. If their orders are random\u2014if sometimes people buy and sometimes they sell, with no pattern\u2014then that works out well for the market makers. But their big risk is what they call \u201cadverse selection\u201d: Sometimes, when a customer buys 100 shares at $100.01, it then buys another 100 shares at $100.02, and another 100 shares at $100.03, and keeps going until it has bought 10,000 shares and pushed the price up dramatically. The market maker who sold it the first 100 shares\u2014and who is probably now short and needs to go out and buy those shares at a higher price\u2014has been run over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is a risk of being a market maker on the public stock exchanges: Sometimes you sell 100 shares to a small retail investor and it\u2019s random noise; other times you sell 100 shares to Fidelity and you get run over. But if a market maker can guarantee that it will\u00a0*only*\u00a0interact with retail customers\u2014if it can filter out big orders from institutional investors\u2014then its risk of adverse selection goes way down. The way the market maker does this is by paying retail brokers to send it their order flow, and promising those brokers that it will execute their orders\u00a0*better*\u00a0than the public markets would. (This is called \u201cprice improvement,\u201d and allows the retail brokers to fulfill their obligation to give their customers \u201cbest execution.\u201d) So if a stock is quoted at $99.99 bid, $100.01 offered on the public exchanges, the market maker might buy it from retail customers for $99.991 or sell it to them at\u00a0$100.009. (It\u2019s not usually\u00a0*much*\u00a0price improvement.) It can offer a tighter spread than the public markets\u2014and have money left over to pay the retail brokers\u2014because it doesn\u2019t have to worry about adverse selection. If the retail broker is, say, one designed to let young people day-trade for free on their phones, then those orders are probably particularly valuable, because they are probably particularly random.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are two objections to this practice. One is that it is bad for investors whose orders *aren\u2019t*\u00a0sold to market makers, the institutional investors who instead trade on\u00a0public stock exchanges. Payment for order flow\u00a0fragments the markets, takes retail order flow away from the public stock exchanges, widens out spreads on those exchanges, and, by segregating retail and institutional orders, makes institutional execution worse. This objection is probably true! If you\u2019re a hedge-fund manager, you should dislike payment for order flow, because it makes public markets worse for you. (If you invest through mutual funds, as I do, you should also dislike it, for the same reason.)\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The other objection is that payment for order flow is bad for investors whose orders\u00a0*are*\u00a0sold to market makers, the retail investors whose orders never touch the stock exchange. If the market makers are paying to get their orders, surely they are doing something nefarious with them, right? Otherwise why would they pay? This objection seems mostly wrong. Very occasionally there is some\u00a0evidence of [market makers doing naughty stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-01/tesla-will-try-to-be-more-normal) with the retail orders that they buy, but for the most part, particularly for simple market orders,\u00a0the result is straightforward: Retail customers are instantly able to buy stock at a price at least as good as, and usually better than, the best price available in the public markets. And the market makers pay their brokers for the privilege, so the brokers can offer cheaper (even free!) stock trades. They are unambiguously better off than they would be if their brokers didn\u2019t sell their orders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So by selling its customers\u2019 orders to market makers, Robinhood is actually stealing from two sets of \u201cthe rich\u201d: Rich market makers like Citadel are paying it directly for the orders, while rich hedge-fund managers are getting worse execution on public stock exchanges so that Robinhood customers can get better executions off those exchanges. Big institutions are paying to subsidize free trades for Robinhood\u2019s customers. It feels pretty Robin-Hood-y! If I were Robinhood I would advertise that!\u00a0\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-16/carl-icahn-wants-to-fight-dell-again?sref=2jPYL79S](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-16/carl-icahn-wants-to-fight-dell-again?sref=2jPYL79S)",

All affected parties have had the same service issues from support. That's all from this past fall, but there are cases gong back it's entire history.\n\nIt shouldn't really come as a surprise that RH has these issues. This is a broker that Reddit's own WSB has found multiple loopholes and system errors to exploit for essentially infinite money. So much so that RH was forced to monitor the subreddit for potential exploits.\n\nI don't have any coding or app development experience, so I couldn't adequately state why RH is more exposed to account breaches. If I were to speculate, though, the difference between them, and say a Schwab or Fidelity, is that the latter are financial companies that built out an online platform, whereas I've always felt like RH is an online platform that grew into finance.
