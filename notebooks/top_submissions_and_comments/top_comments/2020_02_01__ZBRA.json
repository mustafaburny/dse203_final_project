But it seemed like the fall was something that might have happened if an algorithm parsed the ER reporting and saw keywords like miss, soft, corona virus, etc.\n\nIf you read it with human eyes, the \"miss\" was about as small as anything that could ever be called a \"miss\".  We're talking $1.19 billion net instead of $1.20 billion, and $3.00 EPS instead of $3.01\n\nSure that's a \"miss\", but hardly.\n\nEarnings up 15% on sales growth of just 5% speaks to operational strength.  They admit to margins being brushed down because more companies were doing bulk YE orders which carry lower margins.  Bulk orders is a good problem to have.\n\nThey're a quiet powerhouse that always underplays things so soft guide doesn't worry me.\n\nThey probably will have corona virus impact in China, but that doesn't worry me either.  Whoever needs Zebra's stuff might delay but then those sales just just push back to next quarter.  The need doesn't go away.  It's not restaurants or travel where a day of lost sales due to virus impact cannot just be sold next quarter instead.",
