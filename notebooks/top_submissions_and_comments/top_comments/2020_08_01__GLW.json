        "body": "I'll keep posting this until people understand that AMD's rise is deserved. \n\nThis is a post from u/Mintykanesh a couple days ago about AMD. \n\n&gt;TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both.",

There weren't that many revolutionary companies popping from the 40's on up until really Intel and Microsoft took over personal computing in the late 80's/early 90's. Buffet just had to invest in well establish brands that revolutionized their respective industries before he was born. Buffet's slow and steady strategy is generally one that will always work to a degree (note how he spotted Apple's resurgence early), but Kathy and her colleagues are pioneering an new, more comprehensive way of analyzing companies and their place in the future. Ark's strategy of anticipating change and investing in companies best positioned to take advantage of that change is well suited for the new phase of industrialization that we are entering.",

Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.\n\nDivesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP\u2019s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom &amp; will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.\n\nMain downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this &amp; the sky didn't fall.\n\nTLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP",

He also oversaw a huge round of layoffs in 2016 which hit the morale of the company really hard.\n\nThe core issue is that the Intel process is fucking complex with steam engine technology tooling on top of it. It is no wonder it all fell apart. Look at Altera struggling to manufacture on Intel's process.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC and the EDA industry had the benefit of Apple's dollars and collaboration to build out their tools and flows to support the multi layer patterning that started with 14nm and really exploded in 10nm.\n\nManagement does not care about employees and is only focused on empire building and trying to show \"results\".

Look at who their CTO is if you're looking for technical competence.\n\nAMD isn't doing well because Lisu Su somehow engineered a better processor on her own and by far her personal contributions to really improving the company's fundamentals were in pushing the company into the game console market, amending the wafer supply agreement and putting a much needed axe in the Bulldozer line of processors in favor of a new architecture.  I'm sure she's a great engineer too, but that's not the job she was hired for when she was appointed CEO.  She's made great decisions as a CEO, but this whole idea there's any kind of 'wizard' out there is just wrong.\n\nIntel's problem is their fabs and no 'wizard' is going to fix that.  These are extremely complex and expensive processes that take years to set up and are not easily changed or fixed.  That's a big part of why Intel has basically given up on their 10nm process at this point and is focused on their 7nm node.  If you build something that involved and complex that's fundamentally flawed you can't just turn it around and make it work.  Intel's literally been trying for years here and that more than anything else is what's contributed to AMD's meteoric rise.",

Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.\n\nDivesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP\u2019s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom &amp; will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.\n\nMain downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this &amp; the sky didn't fall.\n\nTLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP",

Look at who their CTO is if you're looking for technical competence.\n\nAMD isn't doing well because Lisu Su somehow engineered a better processor on her own and by far her personal contributions to really improving the company's fundamentals were in pushing the company into the game console market, amending the wafer supply agreement and putting a much needed axe in the Bulldozer line of processors in favor of a new architecture.  I'm sure she's a great engineer too, but that's not the job she was hired for when she was appointed CEO.  She's made great decisions as a CEO, but this whole idea there's any kind of 'wizard' out there is just wrong.\n\nIntel's problem is their fabs and no 'wizard' is going to fix that.  These are extremely complex and expensive processes that take years to set up and are not easily changed or fixed.  That's a big part of why Intel has basically given up on their 10nm process at this point and is focused on their 7nm node.  If you build something that involved and complex that's fundamentally flawed you can't just turn it around and make it work.  Intel's literally been trying for years here and that more than anything else is what's contributed to AMD's meteoric rise.",

        "body": "&gt;Inflation hawks will bug out, but we could barely sustain 2% during a long expansion and are faced with major deflationary pressures right now. \n\nThat really depends on what the federal government does with stimulus. \n\nIMO part of the reason why Republicans are very hesitant to push out more stimulus for middle and lower class people is that it'll create high demand for products and push up inflation. That hurts their constituency, rich people and business owners, harder than it hits middle and lower class groups. That's simply because rich people are not huge consumers and don't create a lot of demand (Most people only eat 2 meals per day). Poor and middle class people are big consumers as there are A LOT more of them. \n\nIn other words, big stimulus can cause inflation. One which democrats are pushing for and are likely to get into power in 5.5 months.\n\nThat and a weak dollar can cause inflation. \n\nI know there is a bunch of pressure to keep the dollar from inflating. These are just two market forces that can cause inflation to pass the typical 1.5% rate.",

Getting rid of all low float tickers is more censorship which everyone seems to whine about.\n\nSecondly, covid had a large effect on the user count. A lot of bored people at home decided to try to learn how to trade pennies, which gave us an influx of users. Then, as people became uninterested, many of them stopped checking the subreddit frequently but they are still subscribed to the subreddit. This would explain the decrease in users online.\n\nAlso, when you mention \u201cgambling\u201d, THE WHOLE STOCK MARKET IS A GAMBLE. Whether that be buying Apple or Microsoft or buying a low float penny, it is all gambling and speculation. That is the nature of the stock market. We are all civilized people, and if you\u2019re buying stocks based off of the # of upvotes and the # of posts, THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM. Mods can\u2019t make you buy/not buy stocks. That is your own decision.\n\nIf you lost money on a stock, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. You bought the stock yourself, no one held you at gun point and forced you to buy it. Stop blaming the subreddit and mods for removing spam posts because you \u201cmissed out on a stock\u201d. Many of those posts end up being spam, and if the stock didn\u2019t do well, then the users would praise the mods for removing it. WE DONT KNOW WHICH STOCKS WILL GO UP. We remove all posts equally and do our best to keep bias out. If your post was removed, ask a moderator why it was removed and they will tell you how you can make your post a \u201cnon-spam\u201d post",

Bill Gates, the only guy fighting Malaria and saving poor people from certain death because of an insect 1/1000000th their size...\n\nand people actually believe, without any irony, that he wants to control them and make us into robots.\n\nWhy fucking bother. We need a new country. Let all the self-hating morons who foam at the mouth over the new iPhone buy buy buy and the rest of us can just chill somewhere and innovate.\n\nMachiavellianism blah blah blah who cares.\n\nDepressing fact? A lot of the immigrants coming to this country are Trump voters because they hate their own people/race and want to eliminate any possibility of those people getting in, without realizing they are the fucking problem themselves. The amount of Latinx republican voters who think white racists will accept them if they vote for mango man is pathetic and they have no idea they're contradicting everything the country did to attract them here in the first place.\n\nAnd why wouldn't that be a problem after all? Do they know anything about a fair government in their home country? No. And yet they bring the same horseshit here.\n\nIt didn't use to be like this. I don't know when it changed. Importing people with mental problems from around the world isn't exactly good policy though, regardless of any moral argument. These people are also the easiest to manipulate because they're scared, poor, feel lucky to be here, and are driven very rapidly to hate.\n\nIs there a fix to this overgeneralization I'm making? Better schools maybe, but we don't have that. Thus the epidemic of ignorance grows.",
