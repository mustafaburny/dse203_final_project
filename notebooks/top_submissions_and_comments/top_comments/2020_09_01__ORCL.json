It\u2019s already questionable legally. \n\nIf the administration really cared about Americans data overseas, they would champion a national data protection law, like the EU did with GDPR, and then either curve Bytedance and Tencents operations via fines, or delist the apps via whatever mechanisms would exist in the data protection legislation. It\u2019s a longer route to get there and requires follow through, but it\u2019s the correct way to handle it. \n\nAs a security person, I didn\u2019t think the Oracle deal would be possible to meet the executive order Trump set out without getting the source code and creating a US island for the service, much like China does for video games in their country. China made it clear that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Allowing apps to be banned without substantial threat / evidence is a very slippery slope, and is equivalent to Erdogan in Turkey banning the YouTube app there, or China banning any number of US apps there. This is a dictatorial move that sets dangerous precedents and will hurt the technology sector as a whole, as it will probably become a more common mechanism for governments to utilize. It\u2019s scary when your government starts using the same mechanisms as China (islands and complete bans) that people have rallied so hard against. Probably because Trump has a bone to pick with TikTok\u2019s user base over the rally.",

In 2016, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz served on the president\u2019s transition team, and two years later, dined with him at the White House, where she complained about a government contract she deemed unfair, Bloomberg reported. Vice President Mike Pence visited Oracle\u2019s headquarters in Redwood City, California. Catz has contributed more than $125,000 this year to support Trump\u2019s re-election, according to Federal Election Commission data. And Ellison let Trump use one of his California estates to hold a fund-raiser in February.\n\n&gt;In recent weeks, the U.S. president had publicly endorsed the Oracle bid and called Ellison a \u201ctremendous guy.\u201d Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro, who earlier came out against a potential sale to Microsoft and had at one time advocated banning TikTok completely, echoed that endorsement during an August appearance on Fox News.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-13/oracle-is-said-to-gain-advantage-in-deal-for-tiktok-in-u-s",

It\u2019s a longer route to get there and requires follow through, but it\u2019s the correct way to handle it. \n\nAs a security person, I didn\u2019t think the Oracle deal would be possible to meet the executive order Trump set out without getting the source code and creating a US island for the service, much like China does for video games in their country. China made it clear that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Allowing apps to be banned without substantial threat / evidence is a very slippery slope, and is equivalent to Erdogan in Turkey banning the YouTube app there, or China banning any number of US apps there. This is a dictatorial move that sets dangerous precedents and will hurt the technology sector as a whole, as it will probably become a more common mechanism for governments to utilize. It\u2019s scary when your government starts using the same mechanisms as China (islands and complete bans) that people have rallied so hard against. Probably because Trump has a bone to pick with TikTok\u2019s user base over the rally.",

        "body": "\n&gt;\u201cA deal where Oracle takes over hosting without source code and significant operational changes would not address any of the legitimate concerns about TikTok, and the White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate that this exercise was pure grift,\u201d Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook, said in a post on Twitter. ...\n\n&gt;Oracle, a company with a closer relationship to the U.S. president, emerged as a bidder with the backing of Sequoia Capital, a key ByteDance shareholder. ...\n\n&gt;Oracle has nurtured a relationship with Trump since before his administration began. In 2016, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz served on the president\u2019s transition team, and two years later, dined with him at the White House, where she complained about a government contract she deemed unfair, Bloomberg reported. Vice President Mike Pence visited Oracle\u2019s headquarters in Redwood City, California. Catz has contributed more than $125,000 this year to support Trump\u2019s re-election, according to Federal Election Commission data. And Ellison let Trump use one of his California estates to hold a fund-raiser in February.\n\n&gt;In recent weeks, the U.S. president had publicly endorsed the Oracle bid and called Ellison a \u201ctremendous guy.\u201d Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro, who earlier came out against a potential sale to Microsoft and had at one time advocated banning TikTok completely, echoed that endorsement during an August appearance on Fox News.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-13/oracle-is-said-to-gain-advantage-in-deal-for-tiktok-in-u-s",

The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%. The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 2.7% gain.\n* The gains were broad and steady, with all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finishing in positive territory, including seven that rose at least 1.0%. The information technology sector's 2.1% gain was the most influential, but the real estate sector (+2.2%) eked out the top spot. The communication services sector (+0.1%) underperformed. \n* Starting with the key M&amp;A news, NVIDIA (NVDA 514.89, +28.31, +5.8%) agreed to acquire Arm Holdings from Softbank for $40 bln in cash and stock; Gilead Sciences (GILD 66.34, +1.44, +2.2%) agreed to acquire Immunomedics (IMMU 83.65, +41.40, +98.0%) for about $21 bln, or $88.00 per share, in cash; and Verizon (VZ 60.32, +0.53, +0.9%) agreed to acquire Tracfone for $6.25 bln in cash and stock. \n* Separately, Oracle (ORCL 59.46, +2.46, +4.3%) reportedly formed a partnership with TikToK U.S. after Microsoft's (MSFT 205.41, +1.38, +0.7%) acquisition bid was rejected. Walt Disney's (DIS 131.20, -0.55, -0.4%) ESPN entered into two separate multi-year agreements with Caesars Entertainment (CZR 55.39, +5.28, +10.5%) and DraftKings (DKNG 48.62, +7.16, +17.3%).\n* As for today's dose of vaccine news, AstraZeneca (AZN 54.02, +0.29, +0.5%) resumed its COVID-19 vaccine trials in the UK. Pfizer (PFE 37.01, +0.94, +2.6%) for its part reiterated expectations to have conclusive results from its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial in October while also planning to expand enrollment. \n* Citigroup (C 48.15, -2.85, -5.6%) was a notable laggard after its CFO issued a revenue warning and The Wall Street Journal reported that the company could get reprimanded for failing to improve its risk-management systems. Shares of Citigroup fell 5.6%, versus a 1.3% gain in the S&amp;P 500 financials sector. \n* The U.S. Treasury market was rather quiet today despite the bullish action in the stock market. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 93.06. WTI crude futures decreased 0.3%, or $0.12, to $37.22/bbl.\n* Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday.

        "body": "Article from link:\n\n\"Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (NYSE American: ZOM) announced today that it has agreed with its development partner Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Qorvo US, Inc., to develop three new assays -- Cobalamin, cPL (canine Pancreatic Lipase), and Folate -- to target diagnosis of canine gastrointestinal issues. The new assays are in addition to the initial five assays currently under development, including panels for adrenal and thyroid testing, for TRUFORMA\u2122, Zomedica's point-of-care veterinary diagnostic platform. The agreement to pursue development of the new assays has triggered the final $2 million milestone payment under Zomedica\u2019s Development and Supply Agreement with Qorvo.\n\n\u201cOur intent for TRUFORMA\u2122 always has been to have it serve as a broad diagnostic point-of-care tool for dogs and cats and to continue to expand the diagnostic offerings available on the platform,\" said Robert Cohen, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Zomedica. \"We believe that the combination of the Cobalamin, cPL and Folate assays will enable veterinarians to use TRUFORMA to conduct a thorough testing panel to diagnose dogs in gastrointestinal distress.\"\n\nIf successfully developed, the Cobalamin, cPL, and Folate assays will represent what the Company believes is the first non-infectious gastrointestinal panel optimized for use in canines fully available at the point-of-care to facilitate rapid diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders. Evaluation of the health of different components of the gastrointestinal system is necessary to identify the cause of clinical symptoms. This panel is intended to assay the function of the pancreas, proximal small intestine, and distal small intestine. The Company believes that the ability to conduct testing at the point-of-care will facilitate real-time clinical decision-making, reduce in-patient clinic stay, promote earlier detection and treatment, and increase pet owner satisfaction.\n\nAccording to a DVM360 study*, ASPCA Pet Insurance, Embrace, Nationwide, Pets Best and Trupanion agree that \u201cGI condition\u201d is the most common insurance claim for dogs. Signs of digestive system disease can include excessive drooling, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting or regurgitation, loss of appetite, bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating, straining to defecate, shock, and dehydration. The TRUFORMA diagnostic device, which is smaller than a desktop printer, is anticipated to provide highly sensitive, species-specific assays using Qorvo\u2019s proprietary, non-optical Bulk Acoustic Wave (\"BAW\") sensor technology. The BAW sensor is a proven semiconductor technology used in telecommunications and aerospace markets. The Company believes that BAW technology has the potential to improve veterinary diagnostics by delivering reference laboratory accuracy and test performance to the veterinary clinic at the point-of-care.\"\n\nI bolded the important parts. This is a long hold regardless if r/s happens or does not. IMO the r/s ain't happening.",
