I believe a fair valuation for ChargePoint as a company will be about 8-9 billion in a year, similar to where $ENPH is now. Given that valuation, my price target for $SBE would be around $20 before the merger, which implies a valuation of around 5 billion.\n\nIt's best to just invest now, no reason to try and time it. This is a solid company with products that everyone already loves.",

It\u2019s similar with SEDG and ENPH; good companies, but expensive (SMA/S92 is my pick in the inverter space).  On the other hand, I think there is a strong bull case for solar module manufacturers over the next few years because they are currently profitable even with record low prices/LCOE.  Lower module costs drive demand growth for commercial- and utility-scale solar, and companies like JKS, CSIQ, and FSLR are bulking up capacity to benefit.  I particularly like JKS due to its high growth and market share, but as of this week those are starting to get priced in.\n\nMost of the other companies I\u2019m in are probably overvalued.  Siemens-Gamesa and Vestas are well-positioned for growth, but expensive relative to earnings.  Same with \u00d8rsted, although earnings from asset divestiture are lumpy.  BEP might be a decent buy.  One company I\u2019m currently excited about is the developer/asset owner Neoen, who commissioned that record-breaking [Tesla battery in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsdale_Power_Reserve).  They are growing aggressively, with the kind of vision (and, frankly, leverage) that the climate situation demands, but that makes them risky.  I\u2019m also in a handful of hydrogen companies (NEL/D7G, ITM/IJ8, and BLDP), but those are highly speculative at this point.",

Your time horizon, and if you are playing with stocks; Seems to be 1y+. But since you are on this site, I doubt you were thinking multi-year gains. Volatility will happen. Accept it. You are only down 2k. Ever lose 100k? How about 500k?  If you haven\u2019t. Don\u2019t be complaining. Try managing someone else\u2019s money then having to explain to them why they are down 50% after giving you 25m to manage 3 weeks prior. 2k is small on the grand scale of things. It\u2019s not about how much you lose, it\u2019s about how fast you bounce back. \n\n3) Vol happens, live with it, love it, embrace it, trade it. Vol can be your best friend or worse nightmare. In your case, having some pretty volatile stocks doesn\u2019t help and you\u2019ll be exposed to it more often. Just realize that. Additionally, the market is kinda over extended, SPY and SPX calls are not being rolled up primarily cause we got an election coming and investors feel like we need a 5-10% pullback. It could happen, but historically, trading before an election is usually pretty choppy. So get used to it.\n\nIf you can trade options, use that to offset losses.

        "body": "I'm just going to re-comment what I stated in another $SBE thread. First of all, SPACs never buy a whole company. Most of the shares are held by people in the acquired company. For example, $SHLL only bought 14% of Hyliion, per their investor presentation: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3\\_tortoiseacq.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm)\n\nAnd my personal DD on $SPE from the same thread:\n\n&gt;Just my two cents, but I like to compare $SBE to Enphase Energy ($ENPH) in terms of growth. $ENPH is even listed as a benchmark company for ChargePoint, in terms of public space, in $SBE's investor presentation here: [http://switchback-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChargePoint-New-Investor-Deck-23-Sept-2020-8K.pdf](http://switchback-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChargePoint-New-Investor-Deck-23-Sept-2020-8K.pdf)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ChargePoint had an implied valuation of 2.4 billion when $SBE was $10 per share. I believe a fair valuation for ChargePoint as a company will be about 8-9 billion in a year, similar to where $ENPH is now. Given that valuation, my price target for $SBE would be around $20 before the merger, which implies a valuation of around 5 billion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's best to just invest now, no reason to try and time it. This is a solid company with products that everyone already loves.\n\n$SBE / ChargePoint has great growth potential. I currently have 3,500 common shares @ 12.95.",

I flip through old pictures. It's her. For a moment, I can almost smell her in the room. Lavender, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.\n\nI open a browser and check the S&amp;P futures. 3536. It hasn't moved in decades now, it would seem.

It keeps going on for a  few days for many biotech stocks but there is a certain stock X where  the volume keeps increasing but the price isn't increasing similar to  others.\n\nNow in this case, that is  an anomaly or an unusual pattern. What might be happening is rich folks  getting large positions in X and they are pretty sure that it's gonna  rocket in near future. This is what this tool tries to catch - stocks  that behave abnormal relative to the entire stock market.\n\nThat's all you need to know, the technicals are not necessary.\n\nHope this makes more sense.",

When will it be? I have no idea and nobody on here has a crystal ball. It might be tomorrow, it might be a 10% correction after the market has already gone another 5% higher.

Have a *long-term* plan and stick to it. Don't try and avoid every bit of potential turbulence, don't just sell everything every time there *might* be volatility (periods like March are times when there's great opportunities, they're not something to be completely avoided; if you avoid situations that cause market volatility and only get back in when everything is a-okay again, you're actively choosing to avoid opportunities) and honestly, \"selling everything\" is something that someone should do very, very rarely if ever but it seems to be a more and more common thing on here.\n\nI've posted this what feels hundreds of times on here: \"\u201cFar more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\u201d - Peter Lynch.

        "body": "Hey man. Jumping right into a $4k Tesla OTM call is sort of baptism by fire. If you're willing to lose all of that, then stick with it. Obviously, you can gain quite a bit from it as well. I know you're already locked in to that...but I would highly suggest playing around with \\~$300 or so to get a feel of how options work before diving head first into a large position (as you have.) Find a ticker that has options with low premiums (WORK is a good one, for example) and test the waters there. From there, you'll learn about how all of this works -- what constitutes as high IV, the effect of theta, etc. Once you get a good (if even possible) grasp on all of this...then you are ready to go. That being said, that Tesla call could very well make you a lot of money. It could also very well lose you a lot of money. Godspeed young one.",

        "body": "Daily Market and Options Summary for Sept 1st, 2020\n\nDaily Synopsis\n\n* The S&amp;P 500 (+0.8%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) rallied to fresh record highs on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq getting an added boost from the momentum in the mega-caps and growth stocks. The wealth spread around to the Russell 2000 (+1.1%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%), too.\n* Today's key moves were Apple (AAPL 134.18, +5.14, +4.0%) rising 4% after JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock to $150 from $115, and Zoom Video (ZM 457.69, +132.59, +40.8%) surging 40% after it crushed Q2 earnings expectations.\n* Apple was a major factor in today's index gains given its 7.3% weight in the S&amp;P 500, while Zoom provided the fuel for other growth stocks like Netflix (NFLX 556.55, +26.99, +5.1%) and DocuSign (DOCU 268.80, +45.80, +20.5%). Another supporting factor was the ISM Manufacturing Index for August increasing to 56.0% (consensus 54.5%) from 54.2% in July.\n* The manufacturing data helped lift the S&amp;P 500 materials (+2.8%) and industrials (+1.0%) sectors into positive territory with the information technology (+1.9%), communication services (+1.0%), and consumer discretionary (+1.1%) sectors. Each advanced at least 1.0%.\n* Conversely, the utilities (-1.1%), health care (-1.0%), and energy (-0.9%) sectors underperformed and declined around 1.0%.\n* Recapping some other mega-cap moves, Walmart (WMT 147.59, +8.74, +6.3%) climbed 6% after officially introducing its Walmart+ membership program. Tesla (TSLA 475.05, -23.27, -4.7%), however, was a notable holdout after the company disclosed plans to sell up to $5 billion in stock.\n* U.S. Treasuries ended the day higher after reclaiming overnight losses. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.11%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 92.34 after being down 0.4% in the morning. WTI crude futures increased 0.3%, or $0.14, to $42.76/bbl.\n* Looking ahead, investors will receive the ADP Employment Change Report for August, the Fed's Beige Book, Factory Orders for July, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, and auto and truck sales for August on Wednesday.\n\nIndex Summary\n\n**S&amp;P 500 :** (+0.94%);  **NasDaq :** (+1.72%);  \n**Russell 2000 :**(+1.15%);  **Dow :**(+0.88%);  \n\\*\\*Vix :\\*\\*26.12 -0.29 (-1.1%)\n\nSector Summary -\n\n(1-day %), \\[5-day %\\], {10-day %}\n\n***Currency -***  \n\\*\\*USD Index :\\*\\*92.131 (-0.31%); \\[-1.24%\\]; {-1.5%}; \\*\\*BC :\\*\\*11835 (+1.77%); \\[+4.92%\\]; {+2.99%}\n\n***Precious Metals -***  \n\\*\\*Gold :\\*\\*1978.6 (+0.94%); \\[+2.91%\\]; {+3.23%} ; \\*\\*Silver :\\*\\*28.594 (+1.91%); \\[+6.23%\\]; {+9.1%}\n\n***Farming -***  \n\\*\\*Soybeans :\\*\\*953.5(-0.29%); \\[+1.44%\\]; {+5.55%}; \\*\\*Corn :\\*\\*357.75(-1.12%); \\[-1.12%\\]; {+3.74%};  \n\\*\\*Coffee :\\*\\*129.05(+2.36%); \\[+7.44%\\]; {+9.99%}\n\n***Industrials -***  \n\\*\\*Crude :\\*\\*42.61 (+1.17%); \\[-0.65%\\]; {+1.82%}; \\*\\*Nat Gas :\\*\\*2.63 (-1.03%); \\[+5.77%\\]; {+6.33%}  \n\\*\\*Copper :\\*\\*3.0615 (+0.18%); \\[+3.63%\\]; {+5.27%}\n\nOptions Fast Facts\n\n***CBOE Put/Call Ratio - 0.45***  \n***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** GOGO with 4263x the ADV of 72004.
