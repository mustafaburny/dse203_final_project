Oil isn't going away. It also wasn't going away while XOM went in a slow motion decline from the start of 2014 to the end of 2019 and then got obliterated this year.

I believe a fair valuation for ChargePoint as a company will be about 8-9 billion in a year, similar to where $ENPH is now. Given that valuation, my price target for $SBE would be around $20 before the merger, which implies a valuation of around 5 billion.\n\nIt's best to just invest now, no reason to try and time it.

        "body": "If you\u2019re looking for value in this area, you have to go against the herd to an extent.  TSLA is a great company, but its valuation won\u2019t make sense for another 5 years.  It\u2019s similar with SEDG and ENPH; good companies, but expensive (SMA/S92 is my pick in the inverter space).  On the other hand, I think there is a strong bull case for solar module manufacturers over the next few years because they are currently profitable even with record low prices/LCOE.  Lower module costs drive demand growth for commercial- and utility-scale solar, and companies like JKS, CSIQ, and FSLR are bulking up capacity to benefit.  I particularly like JKS due to its high growth and market share, but as of this week those are starting to get priced in.\n\nMost of the other companies I\u2019m in are probably overvalued.  Siemens-Gamesa and Vestas are well-positioned for growth, but expensive relative to earnings.  Same with \u00d8rsted, although earnings from asset divestiture are lumpy.  BEP might be a decent buy.  One company I\u2019m currently excited about is the developer/asset owner Neoen, who commissioned that record-breaking [Tesla battery in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsdale_Power_Reserve).  They are growing aggressively, with the kind of vision (and, frankly, leverage) that the climate situation demands, but that makes them risky.  I\u2019m also in a handful of hydrogen companies (NEL/D7G, ITM/IJ8, and BLDP), but those are highly speculative at this point.",

TSLA, AAPL, and ENPH will move together since they have overlapping revenues (meaning semiconductors often fuel smartphone and other computer processing companies. \n\n2) SPCE is just getting its footing and Islas a long road ahead of it. Your time horizon, and if you are playing with stocks; Seems to be 1y+. But since you are on this site, I doubt you were thinking multi-year gains. Volatility will happen. Accept it. You are only down 2k. Ever lose 100k? How about 500k?  If you haven\u2019t. Don\u2019t be complaining. Try managing someone else\u2019s money then having to explain to them why they are down 50% after giving you 25m to manage 3 weeks prior. 2k is small on the grand scale of things. It\u2019s not about how much you lose, it\u2019s about how fast you bounce back. \n\n3) Vol happens, live with it, love it, embrace it, trade it. Vol can be your best friend or worse nightmare. In your case, having some pretty volatile stocks doesn\u2019t help and you\u2019ll be exposed to it more often. Just realize that. Additionally, the market is kinda over extended, SPY and SPX calls are not being rolled up primarily cause we got an election coming and investors feel like we need a 5-10% pullback. It could happen, but historically, trading before an election is usually pretty choppy. So get used to it.\n\nIf you can trade options, use that to offset losses.

For example, $SHLL only bought 14% of Hyliion, per their investor presentation: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3\\_tortoiseacq.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm)\n\nAnd my personal DD on $SPE from the same thread:\n\n&gt;Just my two cents, but I like to compare $SBE to Enphase Energy ($ENPH) in terms of growth. $ENPH is even listed as a benchmark company for ChargePoint, in terms of public space, in $SBE's investor presentation here: [http://switchback-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChargePoint-New-Investor-Deck-23-Sept-2020-8K.pdf](http://switchback-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChargePoint-New-Investor-Deck-23-Sept-2020-8K.pdf)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ChargePoint had an implied valuation of 2.4 billion when $SBE was $10 per share. I believe a fair valuation for ChargePoint as a company will be about 8-9 billion in a year, similar to where $ENPH is now. Given that valuation, my price target for $SBE would be around $20 before the merger, which implies a valuation of around 5 billion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's best to just invest now, no reason to try and time it. This is a solid company with products that everyone already loves.\n\n$SBE / ChargePoint has great growth potential. I currently have 3,500 common shares @ 12.95.",

No one intentionally wants to take that big of a loss, i seriously wouldn't have at all especially on maxeon. \n\u0130 actually primarily am invested in core long term value + dividend stocks. i only use to trade short term in high turnover about 200k at any given time . That's made up of about 8-10 names, mostly unpopular plays that are down with the covid crisis like airlines, food service, banks, and industrials. \u0130 mostly just have been playing the swings to try to capture the rips. \n\nAppreciate your inputs though, you got the right idea which i put down on my stock journal too. Which is going long and holding is better. I've missed over five different opportunities this year on the fact i didn't just hold to the stocks long enough. One of them was enph when the stock was trading under 30 a share. Should of just held it out. Won't try do that mistake again.\n\nBut the difference in starting out in middle may(when i started using portfolio margin , so i had access to major leverage) versus if i had started  in early April , a month earlier is big difference to consider as well.",

By looking at the overall profitability? Sure, AWS has a much higher profit margin but that doesn't say anything about whether or not they are subsidizing products on retail. Amazon e-commerce, by design, is reinvesting all the cash back into the business for top-line growth. E-commerce divison itself has so many other businesses within it - profits from TV could be subsidizing shoes or phone cables. We only see the overall profits of the _entire_ e-commerce divison.  Also, the marketplace division is significant chunk of the e-commerce revenue (Amazon only counts the fees they charge 3rd parties as revenue). Profit margins for those will be a lot better than that of the first-party retail business as Amazon doesn't have to carry inventory at all. Also, advertising is another fast growing segment with higher profit-margins.I am not sure if we have enough data to make any comment regarding who is subsidizing what.\n\nAlso, AWS itself faces very serious competition from Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle etc They are releasing a tonne of new features every year. Why will they not want use the cash from AWS for growing AWS but subsidize toilet-paper? Seems odd to me.\n\nFrom what I understand the profitability of AWS is providing a cover for Amazon from a Wall Street standpoint - \"Here have some profits, let us concentrate on growth.\"\n\nI also don't see how breaking up Amazon into AWS and E-commerce creates room for additional innovation. There is very serious competition for both the businesses.",

        "body": "Absolutely brilliant write up. Tech equities became really expensive and I was looking for some value alternatives in tech sector as well. HPE definitely stood out but initially I was quite skeptical as I thought this would be company that sells servers or networking equipment. Upon investigating it I'm super intrigued and will open position next week.  \n\nI love that they detached from legacy PC and printers business, I love that early on they spun off their services &amp; consulting business, I love that they offloaded their legacy software business to Micro Focus (poor guys are struggling to sell it now) and I love that they are not competing with Azure or AWS but instead specialise in their own niche. I think that HPE's hybrid cloud solution is probably the best offering in industry right now. IBM, AWS and Google Cloud offer hybrid solutions but it looks like they are very nascent offerings compared to HPE's.\n\nI also love acquisitions they been making. Like you mentioned Silver Peak and Cray (which were very smart acquisitions) but also BlueData (AI &amp; big data analysis), Plexxi (hybrid networking) and others.\n\nAlso, their focus on the edge and hybrid seems to be very well timed. Edge computing is still in its early stages but will undoubtedly expand in the future. A lot of people talk about hybrid as stepping stone for legacy infrastructures which is true. However, with data privacy and data security regulations becoming stricter hybrid will become way more than just stepping stone to full cloud. In Europe it already matters great deal where are you servers located and who can access them.\n\nFinally, HPE feels like it could be story similar to Microsoft. That is, Microsoft was perceived as this legacy, stagnant organization and it was trading at price reflecting that sentiment. Until their cloud offering changed everything. If all goes well with HPE it could be very similar story and brilliant entry point right now.\n\nP.S.\n\nSpeaking of undervalued tech equities. Do you have any thoughts on Seagate? They are trading at quite low multiples and with growing cloud, data storage will have to grow too. On the  other hand HDDs are legacy hardware and they are not very strong at making SSDs yet.",

        "body": "I bought some stock on June 1st, not the best day price wise but it\u2019s the stock I plan to hold the longest out of my whole portfolio, except for MSFT maybe. I made a DD for myself and made a brief summary around April. Most of it is based on their 10-K last year and their first 10-Q of the year. The key here is that this has been seen as a dinosaur for the past decade, due to lack of innovation, terrible management decisions (crazy high EPS and a buyback program that should have been cut long ago), and recruiting issues. A new CEO (Arvind Krishna) and a switch to the cloud (and quantum computing for the 2030s at least) are the key changes that could drive change. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit messy, was not meant to be posted when I wrote it : \n\nIBM : New CEO Arvid Krishna has my trust, hope he will change top and mid tier management (which did weird accounting tricks like the pseudo Lenovo \u00ab\u00a0sale/buy\u00a0\u00bb, laid off workforce for no reason, did not R&amp;D enough, focused on business services and consulting too much, had the crazy 20$ EPS goal, etc\u2026). Krishna pushed Red Hat acquisition (open source enterprise software, will allow them to become hybrid cloud providers, hybrid cloud is interoperable (BFF example), scalable (ERP switch to 3rd parties), portable, and secure (user data still in private cloud)). Krishna was senior VP for cloud and cognitive software. \nIBM has switched industries several times throughout its life : time clocks, then tabulating machine, then typewriter, then mainframe (good changes), then personal computers (good initially but then poor because used competitors\u2019 chips), etc\u2026 Cloud/AI could be their next successful switch (1/3rd of revenue in 2019, still increasing). Quantum Computing too, as they\u2019ve strongly positioned themselves as industry leaders, but that\u2019s in the very, very long run.\nWhile not the most important aspect, company is a dividend aristocrat (increasing div payout for 25 years), but what matters is that div payment was never removed, even though I think it should have been decreased during the struggles of the 2010s and instead reinvested in R&amp;D, they should have also paused their share buyback program. Financials : P/E around 10 (very good for a tech company), P/BV is 5.5 (good for a tech company, especially one transitioning to less tangible assets), net income slowly increasing, current ratio of nearly 1 at end of 03/31 which is decent given Red Hat acquisition and coronavirus, D/E is 2.62 (that one is indeed bad, but they got cash I guess, still not great).",

        "body": "Bit of a personal anecdote here:\n\nSo I have a degree in IT with a focus on Computer Networking.\n\nI once interviewed for IBM because they had positions open for Network Admins.  Unfortunately, when I sat down and looked over their list of jobs I discovered that they were only looking for senior level positions (something they did not mention in the email they sent to my university).\n\nI decided to interview anyway because I was already there in suit and tie so I wasn't about to get all dressed up for nothing.\n\nThe interview went well, but the guy told me he just didn't have anything for me at the time.\n\nI decided to walk around afterwards and saw a guy interviewing for entry level programmers.  My campus did not offer a Software degree (they offered it at a different campus), but I did have to take 9 credits in basic programming which was Java, C++, and HTML.  I had already taken the Java and C++ classes.\n\nI sit down with the guy and we get to talking.\n\nHe asks my background in coding.  I tell him one intro in Java and C++ so far.\n\nHe asks why am I interviewing if my degree is not focused on coding.  I tell him because those two classes opened my eyes to something that I didn't even know I wanted before.  I love creating stuff with code, I find it cathartic to sit and stare at code, getting lost in it while trying to figure out where my errors are, the absolute joy of finally getting it to compile and run.  I even started to make some basic programs at home in my free time.\n\nHe asks me if I have any of my work to show him.  I did not bring any copies of my code because I wasn't even thinking about the possibility of interviewing for any other positions (let this be a lesson to anyone who's still getting their degree, bring everything!).\n\nI tell him I did have it on a thumb drive that I carry around in my briefcase, but of course he waves his hand and says that's a security issue (totally agreed).\n\nHe asks me what a function is.  I draw a blank.  I ended up stammering out something like, \"it's the part of the code that does stuff\".  Not necessarily wrong, but more of an ELI5 definition.\n\nHe shows me some code and asks what I can decipher from it.  It's a function that takes a variable, runs it through a formula, returns a variable, and then loops 4 more times using the new return variable each time, and finally shows a set of the return variables at the print out.  He confirmed that I was right.\n\nHe asks me what that sets of numbers is called.  Obviously it's an array, and I had heard the term before, but again I did not know at the time.  He frowns and says something along the lines of, \"You really don't know basic terminology.  You should work on that.\"\n\nWe shook hands and parted ways, never got a call back.  Now, I know I messed up by not having some of my work printed out, and not being up on the terminology.  But it really rubbed me raw that this guy was so hung up on terminology, knowing that coding was like 5% of my entire degree, and yet I still had a basic working knowledge of programming to at least be able to read and understand what was going on, and that I was passionate enough about it to go home and write some basic programs of my own.\n\nNow I don't know that the lack of terminology was the ultimate reason I was turned down.  I do know that they were looking to start up a class that would take about 3 years to go through, and they were going to teach a proprietary language that was similar to Java.  Obviously, the terminology would have been brought up again multiple times in that 3 year program.  The only clue I had for why I was turned down was the lack of lingo.\n\nI am now a manager at a FinTech company, and I don't ask \"lingo\" questions of interviewees.  I want to know if they understand the meat and potatoes of what the job entails because, to me, that means so much more.  Lingo will happen over time as they do the job.\n\nI'm not saying that is all the OP was concerned about in their interviews, but they certainly seem to think it's a flaw in an interviewee that makes them unsuitable for hiring.",

AMD is certainly catching up and will carve off some fractions of the market in the AI/ML &amp; datacenter businesses.\n\nThe ARM acquisition, if it happens, will confer a competitive advantage like no other. As an NVDA stockholder I wish this happens. As a Brit working in and loving tech, I am slowly dying on the inside... \n\nSomething to remember is that this is a fast expanding market and not a saturated one, there's room for multiple players to grow and win at the same time. \n\nThat being said, I still think Intel will likely be the next IBM.

I know a lot of people who work there. They\u2019re not going to go under overnight and they don\u2019t ONLY sell chips. They\u2019ll pivot and react accordingly.
