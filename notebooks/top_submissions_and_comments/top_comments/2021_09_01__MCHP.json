My husband is a physician and a lot of his colleagues have purchased one because of the low cost, small size and cloud based storage.  \n\nWhat differentiates this technology is that they\u2019ve taken ultrasound technology which required intricate arrays of something called pisiform crystals and placed it on a microchip embedded in the ultrasound probe itself\u2026 thus allowing the low cost small footprint and long battery life.  My husband bought an ultrasound machine for his practice 4-5 years ago for $48,000\u2026 this unit costs under $4000 with image quality that rivals that of the more expensive machine. \n\nNew med students are being provided these small handheld ultrasound units as well as ultrasound training will likely become part of the med school curriculum.  \n\nAnd bc of the price point and it\u2019s small size many nurses are starting to carry them as well.   \n\nThe TAM is huge bc what used to be only a radiologists\u2019 domain is now being performed by physicians of many different specialities - cardiology, internal medicine, obs/gyne, orthopaedics, sports medicine etc\u2026. And uptake is far from complete so \u2026 TAM is growing \n\nThe fundamentals are probably somewhat overvalued rn on present metrics but with growth potential that this technology has I believe it will grow into its valuation and then some.  I bought in high at $25 and have continued buying all the way down and will keep adding everyone it drops to $10 or lower.  \n\nDo your own DD though\nShared this before on another page but thought I\u2019d post it here as well - see if there are any inversions \ud83d\ude0a",

We're still riding that wave. Add in the rapid technological change of the last 30 years and growth should dominate (its easy to see in hindsight). \n\nThe question we need to ask in the growth vs value debate is: How much longer will the boom last. \n\nAfter WW2 we had a large population, a baby boom, huge amounts of exploitable natural resources, the only functioning industrial base, great educational resources, an unassailable military... Basically the perfect setup to dominate and we did. Add in the microchip revolution, the proliferation of the internet... This is what caused growth to dominate.

But this will one day end as they will reach the physical barrier of an atom or electron. \n- the economical barrier: the EUV machines they make cost around 250 million dollars. Their future High-NA machines even more. However the demand is still there (who would have thought 20 years ago people would now walk around with 1.000+ dollar phones and gadgets).\n- the sustainability (emissions, environmental): one EUV machine uses 9GWh of electricity per year, approximately the power consumption of 3,300 families per year.  For Taiwan (TSMC) this is already a problem. TSMC alone is responsible for 5% of the total electricity consumption of Taiwan.",
