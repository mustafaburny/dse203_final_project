The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase. Why can't we have it globally?",
