But run some screeners. All I can say is Intel is a dying company who were caught resting on their laurels as it were.",

This company is a great pure-play way to get exposure to electrification of autos and shift to autonomous driving (electric and combustible platforms).  While there are big, diversified competitors out there like NXPI and Avago, these guys are nimble with highly experienced management and HYPER growth.  I think this is going to be a winner.",

        "author": "x2c3v4b5",
        "body": "  \n\nWith respect to investing, my overall philosophy, attitude, and position is to simply not give a fuck and not use my brain too much. Trust me, I know how ridiculous, stupid, and counter-intuitive that sounds as well. So, let me elaborate on this stance:\n\n1. Personally, for me, regardless of conditions, there will never be change in plan/strategy (within the foreseeable future). As an individual with a stable income, high job security, DB Pension, and a decent emergency fund, I am always 100% equities and there will never be a change in buying more or less. Simply, I invest on average, half of my pay, every time I get paid (i.e. every two weeks) and I do not give a fuck about government stimulus, wars, low growth times, high growth times, COVID vaccine, no COVID vaccine, \"all time highs\", \"all time lows\" or wherever the fuck we are on the \"graph\". I do not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, I really do not give two shits. Volatility does not mean anything to me since I am a super long-term investor (25-50 years) and I do not respect it or fear it.\n\n2. I realize that I am not an intelligent individual, I recognize that I am not an educated individual (i.e. high school only), I acknowledge that I cannot predict the future, and I certainly cannot time the market over the long-term. I believe that time in the market is superior to timing the market (as per academic studies). Therefore, I will continue to invest on average, half of my pay every two weeks because I am boring, I do not give a fuck about market volatility, and I do not have materialistic wants or needs.\n\n3. Don't try to \"get rich quick\", don't attempt to \"buy low, sell high\", don't buy shit/garbage, don't buy penny stocks, don't buy \"meme stocks\", don't worry about \"missing out\" (i.e. FOMO), don't worry about other people's gains (fuck everyone else), and/or don't try to do some smart shit like \"day trade\". This is not a short-term or medium-term game for me and it should not be for you either. Your mind should be on the future and you should be laser focused on building wealth slowly through the passage of time. Delayed gratification pays off and academic studies have demonstrated that delayed gratification is one of the most effective personal traits of successful people (whatever the fuck \"success\" means in those specific studies).\n\n4. You should consider investing in an \"index exchange traded fund\" or \"index ETF\" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors (such as you and I) will underperform an index ETF over the long-term if we choose to pick individual stocks.\n\n5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people here want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage and as long as you have a long time horizon. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity. The last thing you want to do is panic and sell your investments. It is said that the most important organ in investing is not the brain, but rather, the stomach. Turn your brain off, be disciplined, and \"stomach\" these temporary dips, crashes, recessions, and/or bullshit events. Instead, embrace these times of opportunity since everything goes on sale; and therefore, you get to buy more securities/assets at a discount. Basically, do not fear these times, embrace them with open arms alongside a smile and let the weak minded/stomached people panic sell to you as they shit their pants. You do not even need to rob these folks because they let you rob them and then these people think that you are doing them a favor by giving them money in exchange for their undervalued assets/securities. In the past, there have always been bullshit macroscopic events that are out of our control and we have always gotten through it (less the Japanese Nikkei and perhaps some other markets but this is part of the game as well as the risk you take in investing).\n\n6. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks (i.e. when you get paid) regardless of what happens (even if this time is \"different\" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, strong stomach, long-term minded investor with a high degree of delayed gratification who just doesn't give two fucks). Simply put, just buy as many fucking bricks as you can every two weeks until you retire or die and slowly build your castle's infrastructure as time progresses. There are no guarantees; however, you should have a pretty solid castle in the end.\n\n7. Finally, again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens with the world, economy, politics, monetary policy, fiscal policy, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). These events are things outside of your own control, so fuck it. \"Catastrophic\" events have happened before and they will continue to happen within your lifetime. So, you need to mentally prepare yourself and accept this fact as part of your investing journey until your existence in this universe has ceased. It is absolutely imperative and crucial that you continue with an unshakable discipline and plan to buy globally diversified index-ETFs and/or well-established, high-quality companies with wide economic/competitive moats with complete disregard and disrespect for macroscopic events out of your control.\n\nKeep buying as many bricks as you can when you get paid, stop giving a fuck, stop using your pre-frontal cortex in attempts to do \"smart shit\", strengthen your stomach, and good luck with both personal finance as well as investing! Wishing you all the best! =)",

Tokenization, tap to pay, paying for transit without cash, paying with QR codes etc. I'm not going to list it all so I would suggest checking out that deck if you doubt innovation from Visa.\n\nPrimary reason why I would want to move my $ away from V because of my price target at $200 and I don't see much upside for the stock until travel accelerates, which I believe will be a while once a vaccine is widely distributed. PYPL has some T&amp;E exposure and SQ would assume so on the merchant side. But, look at the results. Any potential T&amp;E headwind has been offset by strong results in other parts of the business. I think PYPL and SQ will keep doing well in 2021 and beyond. V is a hold and is why I haven't done anything, but not a strong buy. Other V bulls disagree and that's healthy debate, but I personally worry about travel.",

If the Kanye effect has any impact on stock price, this could be a huge buying opportunity! Kanye took Adidas stock from $45 in 2013 to its current price at $162.  Home Depot is a solid value company with steady consistent growth in stock price.  Not to mention collecting a nice dividend while holding.  HD has been consolidating and looks prime for a breakout to retest/break all time highs.  great buying opportunity as it dips to $260's.  Opendoor (IPOB) is an excellent growth opportunity to 2-5x your investment.  Backed by  billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya, this company has strong management/leadership with great experience.  It is a great buy in the low 19's or under $18.  watch the full analysis with charts and technical analysis here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs5xQd5tXJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs5xQd5tXJo)",

It's what quitters do.\n\nHere's what I recommend...\n\nIf your source of income comes from working, you should be dedicating a portion of your paycheck to your retirement account - and a portion to your YOLO account (...and a portion towards the essentials, like food and internet service on a phone)\n\nAs money shows up in your YOLO account, you light that fuse and pray for it to be a bottle rocket. If it explodes in your face, you wait until next payday. If it's a bottle rocket - you send 75% of those profits off to pasture (i.e. lock it up in a retirement account). The other 25% is a bonus bet you get to make, instead of having to wait for another paycheck.\n\nYou want to be playing with underlyings that are just stupid, volatile and wild. Super high IV when it's not earnings time. The ones that just make no sense, and they're swinging up and down violently every day. The more drama, the better. If you were betting on a horse, you don't want the big stud horse that everyone is betting on because the payout sucks. You want the horse that stopped in the middle of the last race to eat the shit on the ground from the horses in front of it. The one that has tourette syndrome. You want... the [Becky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFs9jLN4siQ&amp;ab_channel=dnasewell) version of a horse. You will have no damn clue where it's going, but it's going somewhere - and fast. It's the unexpected move.  You don't actually wait for the race to finish.  As soon as your retarded horse bolts into the lead, you sell your ticket - because it's worth a lot of money at that time.  Don't wait until the end of the race, because your horse is retarded.  He won't make it and your ticket will expire worthless.\n\nWhen you buy that cheap OTM, and Becky happens to pop off while she's carrying you in Geralds bucket - you're turning that $100 into $10k. Risk $100 to make $10k? Fuck yes, all day long. Except, you can't do it with just any stock. It needs to be a Becky stock. (Can someone make me a meme of this, please?) How do you find Becky stocks? Wait for someone to post one here, and you wait for everyone to start saying \"[mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-3e0EkvIEM&amp;ab_channel=as0k)\". When that happens, it's go time.",

Super high IV when it's not earnings time. The ones that just make no sense, and they're swinging up and down violently every day. The more drama, the better. If you were betting on a horse, you don't want the big stud horse that everyone is betting on because the payout sucks. You want the horse that stopped in the middle of the last race to eat the shit on the ground from the horses in front of it. The one that has tourette syndrome. You want... the [Becky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFs9jLN4siQ&amp;ab_channel=dnasewell) version of a horse. You will have no damn clue where it's going, but it's going somewhere - and fast. It's the unexpected move.\n\nWhen you buy that cheap OTM, and Becky happens to pop off while she's carrying you in Geralds bucket - you're turning that $100 into $10k. Risk $100 to make $10k? Fuck yes, all day long. Except, you can't do it with just any stock. It needs to be a Becky stock. (Can someone make me a meme of this, please?) How do you find Becky stocks? Wait for someone to post one here, and you wait for everyone to start saying \"[mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-3e0EkvIEM&amp;ab_channel=as0k)\". When that happens, it's go time.",
