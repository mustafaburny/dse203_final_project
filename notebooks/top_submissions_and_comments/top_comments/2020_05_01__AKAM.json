Cloudflare is basically the backbone of the internet for connectivity and content delivery (eating away at competition like AWS\u2019s cloudfront, fastly, Akamai etc). They have an appealing ecosystem that ties in content delivery with cyber defense (real time attack detection and mitigation), to which they are adding identity/access management, virtual enterprise networks (eating away at network equipment manufacturers that make billions a year out of how to link distributed offices) and \u00ab\u00a0easy\u00a0\u00bb compute distributed across the world. Just a few examples of how fast they are expanding their portfolio in a coherent way, in my opinion.\n\nTheir open source projects and blog posts are great quality, showing that they know how to hire. \n\nThat was for the technical side. Business wise they are affordable, know how to entice customers into their ecosystem (especially during these WFH times), and consistently growing revenue faster than operating costs, which means that when they become profitable it\u2019ll be for good.",

I actually like FSLY &amp; NET which are both small/relatively new players to the CDN game. Both companies are showing great YOY Revenue growth, but they have different ways of finding more business to support their high operating expenses. FSLY is already pulling in some bigger names in the travel/social media sector SHOP, SPOT, JBLU for example. Meanwhile NET is about expanding their business from the bottom up, offering free trials to smaller customers banking on that customer growing somewhere down the line. They have 2.8m customers but only 89k of them currently paying. Obviously, all 3 of these names are competing with AWS &amp; Azure to a point. As 5G &amp; Streaming grows, among other areas of Tech I expect all 3 of these companies to grow. I don't expect to see positive cash-flow in the short term, but I'm happy if I see progress without compromising growth. I'll be watching FSLY/NET for 2-3 years.",

Disney owns so many entertainment companies it's pretty much a monopoly. \n\nAKAM (Akamai) - 9%. The largest security company in the world. Their customers are huge corporations like Adobe,  Airbnb, AMD, Audi, best buy, Fiat, Fox, Honda, IBM, Ikea, MSI, Microsoft, NBA, NBC, us air Force, US Department of state, Ubisoft, and Verizon.

With that they\u2019re able to offer various products for different use cases to a wide range of customers.  Because of their diverse offerings, they compete with quite a few companies both large and small.  For example, they have a CDN product that will compete with Akamai;  infrastructure as a service that will compete with AWS/Azure/GCP (only on storage and compute); security solutions that compete with on-prem hardware companies like Juniper Networks.\n\nThey mention in their 10-K they could potentially compete more and more with large cloud vendors (see IaaS) which could be worrisome. However, they angle themselves as an intermediary between providers in that businesses can avoid vendor lock in  by using cloudflare services to move data between AWS and Azure for example.  To me, that last bit is intriguing. \n\nWhat is worrisome, is the already diminishing returns on their spending on sales and advertising. Their revenue is growing fast, but, their losses are growing faster.  Of course, there could an inflection point where that changes, but, that seems like the biggest issue I would worry about for the time being.

Their plans are all fixed cost and most of their customers pay little to nothing for their services. Why does that matter? The reason other CDNs are killing it right now is because internet traffic is way up across the board. More internet traffic = their customers spending more money.

Oh and I get the SSO using Microsoft/Google security included so don't have to spend another $10 per user per month on an Okta login? And so on and so forth.\n\nThere are some awesome software businesses out there but not as many as I would like to see.
