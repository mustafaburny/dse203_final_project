I would only invest in Aphira, as they have the best quality in Canada and didn't go so crazy with expansion that they are bleeding money every quarter.\n\nThe big names (ACB, WEED, APH) all have the potential for US expansion but have been screwed over in my opinion on the governments roll out of weed here in Canada. \n\nThere was a million dispensaries pre-legalization here in BC, and every single one seemed to be absolutely booming in terms of business.  I am a regular user and I've boughten government weed twice, neither time did I feel like I was getting a good price/quality ratio.\n\nIn my opinion Canadian weed companies won't start doing well until the regular users have the option to purchase bulk at a significant discount, something that the government in Canada doesn't seem keen on. \n\nIn terms of US expansion, it comes down to states legalizing and the hope that the big players can offer a better price/quality than their new competitors.",

Keep in mind there are 1000's of flower strains out there. If CGC really wanted to compete, they could purchase a company like Aph did with Broken coast to get that ball rolling again. \n\n1) Gave them assets and brands along the way, but agree the writedowns will be attrocious\n\n2)Buyouts will be extremely important though for both branding and innovation. Industry is still in its infancy and Canopy is tight lipped on their R&amp;D efforts. We dont really know what is happening behind the scenes. Could it be nothing? Maybe, but I highly doubt it.\n\n3) Retail margins aside, brand positioning and shelf space is what needs to be looked at.\n\n4) Canada was never the market to be focused on. Klein basically said Canada is a proof of concept for USA and Germany. Having Consellation own canopy is the biggest advantage canopy has over others.\n\n7) agreed. I do however tip my hat to APH's large pharmacy presence in the EU.\n\n9) Not yet at least.
