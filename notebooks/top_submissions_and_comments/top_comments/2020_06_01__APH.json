I would only invest in Aphira, as they have the best quality in Canada and didn't go so crazy with expansion that they are bleeding money every quarter.\n\nThe big names (ACB, WEED, APH) all have the potential for US expansion but have been screwed over in my opinion on the governments roll out of weed here in Canada. \n\nThere was a million dispensaries pre-legalization here in BC, and every single one seemed to be absolutely booming in terms of business.  I am a regular user and I've boughten government weed twice, neither time did I feel like I was getting a good price/quality ratio.\n\nIn my opinion Canadian weed companies won't start doing well until the regular users have the option to purchase bulk at a significant discount, something that the government in Canada doesn't seem keen on. \n\nIn terms of US expansion, it comes down to states legalizing and the hope that the big players can offer a better price/quality than their new competitors.",

So I really hope Aphria succeeds too for the growth of the industry overall.\n\nI would also like to mention that Canopy might have poo flower in Canada, but have been getting huge praise in the states for their Tweed and twd brands. Keep in mind there are 1000's of flower strains out there. If CGC really wanted to compete, they could purchase a company like Aph did with Broken coast to get that ball rolling again. \n\n1) Gave them assets and brands along the way, but agree the writedowns will be attrocious\n\n2)Buyouts will be extremely important though for both branding and innovation. Industry is still in its infancy and Canopy is tight lipped on their R&amp;D efforts. We dont really know what is happening behind the scenes. Could it be nothing? Maybe, but I highly doubt it.\n\n3) Retail margins aside, brand positioning and shelf space is what needs to be looked at.\n\n4) Canada was never the market to be focused on. Klein basically said Canada is a proof of concept for USA and Germany. Having Consellation own canopy is the biggest advantage canopy has over others.\n\n7) agreed. I do however tip my hat to APH's large pharmacy presence in the EU.\n\n9) Not yet at least.

This is at the top of the tech bubble. I keep buying calls. The Palm roadshow goes great and it\u2019s one of the hottest IPOs ever because Goldman is keeping most of the shares locked in  3Com, probably doing the same play I am.\n\nThe first week in March 2000 my calls rise $200,000 in three days Monday to Wednesday.

It is purely a reseller model...but the company's main focus is converting these clients into more software. \n\nA lot of the targets they acquire are usually product specific - they end up selling a ton of Cisco or a ton of Dell without much overlap. But if they are selling Cisco, it's not as if their clients aren't buying Dell products also. That's the value prop that they pitch when they acquire targets - we are going to give you the tools to sell everything your clients want and need and your clients will love that they will not have multiple vendors. So effectively cross-selling is a huge selling point for the targets. \n\nWith respect to Red Hat, IBM is actually giving Converge market development funds to pursue these markets effectively throwing their full weight behind them. \n\nAnd yes, 700m and still on the Venture...not something you see every day. I am pretty confident they will uplist to the TSX within the year and will aim to go after NASDAQ later this year if not early next year.",

The high price is due to their market penetration, which is unlike any competitor.\n\nI'm not saying it's justified, I honestly have no idea what the true value of this company is, nobody does, but the value in Zoom is so much more than a 'magical expectation'.\n\nTech companies have stickier customers than any other industry in history due to the incredible amounts of data they can collect.\n\nAt a global scale, both on a consumer, business and enterprise level, Zoom has daily analytics on:\n\n- How many video conferences take place\n- Who participates in them\n- Whether they use chat features or just the video/audio\n- How many people are in a meeting\n- How close participants are geographically\n\nHonestly, I could make this list as long as I liked, the data points are endless.\n\nNo other video conference company has such deep penetration across every area of the vidconf market. \n\nThat mix of personal, business and enterprise penetration isn't something anyone else in the market has, and it's so incredibly valuable at a data analytics level. \n\nBeing able to compare and contrast customer behaviours across different contexts unlocks insights that power incredible company growth (see: Facebook)\n\nThis incredible amount of data informs their future product development opportunities, meaning that it's a strong bet that Zoom is going to make better future plays in the technology space than their competitors (e.g. Google, Webex, etc).\n\nNote again that these competitors cover an area of the market each (personal, enterprise), Zoom covers all of it and more.\n\nWhen you combine that with the fact that they have already destroyed every competitor in the space on user experience and customer satisfaction, this puts them at a huge advantage over every other player in the video conference space. \n\nThey came into this space as a startup competing against Microsoft, Cisco and Google, and they're winning by a country mile.\n\nSo when video chats move from 'schedule a call' to an all inclusive platform that handles all communications across audio/video, personal/business, etc, Zoom is going to be the best placed to dominate that huge market.\n\nThis is an equivalent shift in the Telcom industry as the one from dial phones to mobile phones. \n\nIf you're imagining what a shift like that might look like, imagine having cameras from your TV, fridge and various 'IoT enabled' devices around your house that follow you as you talk to people.\n\nImagine having an affordable interactive whiteboard in your house that updates as your video partners write on their own interactive whiteboards.\n\nImagine it get used to plan family trips out as much as it's used to plan corporate strategies.\n\nImagine being able to manipulate AR models on video and share it with the world.\n\nThat all requires a central platform to harness all the data involved and turn it into a user experience. Zoom is better placed to do that than any other company in the world right now.\n\nThat is what it's price is driven by.\n\nAnd all you see is people whining that they had a security breach, as though that can't be fixed (which it has).\n\nEvery company has data breaches, not every company is this well placed to dominate a market that is going to grow like wildfire over the next 20 years.\n\n---------\n\nNow, with all that being said, I still only have 10% of my portfolio in Zoom, even with all this going for it, every company is a 50/50 bet at best. But if I'm gonna pick 10 companies in the world to invest in, Zoom is definitely one of them.",

The high price is due to their market penetration, which is unlike any competitor.\n\nI'm not saying it's justified, I honestly have no idea what the true value of this company is, nobody does, but the value in Zoom is so much more than a 'magical expectation'.\n\nTech companies have stickier customers than any other industry in history due to the incredible amounts of data they can collect.\n\nAt a global scale, both on a consumer, business and enterprise level, Zoom has daily analytics on:\n\n- How many video conferences take place\n- Who participates in them\n- Whether they use chat features or just the video/audio\n- How many people are in a meeting\n- How close participants are geographically\n\nHonestly, I could make this list as long as I liked, the data points are endless.\n\nNo other video conference company has such deep penetration across every area of the vidconf market. \n\nThat mix of personal, business and enterprise penetration isn't something anyone else in the market has, and it's so incredibly valuable at a data analytics level. \n\nBeing able to compare and contrast customer behaviours across different contexts unlocks insights that power incredible company growth (see: Facebook)\n\nThis incredible amount of data informs their future product development opportunities, meaning that it's a strong bet that Zoom is going to make better future plays in the technology space than their competitors (e.g. Google, Webex, etc).\n\nNote again that these competitors cover an area of the market each (personal, enterprise), Zoom covers all of it and more.\n\nWhen you combine that with the fact that they have already destroyed every competitor in the space on user experience and customer satisfaction, this puts them at a huge advantage over every other player in the video conference space. \n\nThey came into this space as a startup competing against Microsoft, Cisco and Google, and they're winning by a country mile.\n\nSo when video chats move from 'schedule a call' to an all inclusive platform that handles all communications across audio/video, personal/business, etc, Zoom is going to be the best placed to dominate that huge market.\n\nThis is an equivalent shift in the Telcom industry as the one from dial phones to mobile phones. \n\nIf you're imagining what a shift like that might look like, imagine having cameras from your TV, fridge and various 'IoT enabled' devices around your house that follow you as you talk to people.\n\nImagine having an affordable interactive whiteboard in your house that updates as your video partners write on their own interactive whiteboards.\n\nImagine it get used to plan family trips out as much as it's used to plan corporate strategies.\n\nImagine being able to manipulate AR models on video and share it with the world.\n\nThat all requires a central platform to harness all the data involved and turn it into a user experience. Zoom is better placed to do that than any other company in the world right now.\n\nThat is what it's price is driven by.\n\nAnd all you see is people whining that they had a security breach, as though that can't be fixed (which it has).\n\nEvery company has data breaches, not every company is this well placed to dominate a market that is going to grow like wildfire over the next 20 years.\n\n---------\n\nNow, with all that being said, I still only have 10% of my portfolio in Zoom, even with all this going for it, every company is a 50/50 bet at best. But if I'm gonna pick 10 companies in the world to invest in, Zoom is definitely one of them.",
