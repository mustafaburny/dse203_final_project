To expand upon it a bit further, I'm trying to fully understand the correlation between the average p/e and the current stock price. I understand there are three different factors to consider which are past, current, and future growth. If you look at Apple and Microsoft they are way above what their average p/e should be. Why would there be such huge percentile increases in these companies? Are people betting on the continued explosive growth of Microsoft with Azure and Apple with their new microchip and new phones coming out? Or is it really hard to say and it's mostly arbitrary? I'm curious to see what your opinion on it is.",

The new assays are in addition to the initial five assays currently under development, including panels for adrenal and thyroid testing, for TRUFORMA\u2122, Zomedica's point-of-care veterinary diagnostic platform. The agreement to pursue development of the new assays has triggered the final $2 million milestone payment under Zomedica\u2019s Development and Supply Agreement with Qorvo.\n\n\u201cOur intent for TRUFORMA\u2122 always has been to have it serve as a broad diagnostic point-of-care tool for dogs and cats and to continue to expand the diagnostic offerings available on the platform,\" said Robert Cohen, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Zomedica. \"We believe that the combination of the Cobalamin, cPL and Folate assays will enable veterinarians to use TRUFORMA to conduct a thorough testing panel to diagnose dogs in gastrointestinal distress.\"\n\nIf successfully developed, the Cobalamin, cPL, and Folate assays will represent what the Company believes is the first non-infectious gastrointestinal panel optimized for use in canines fully available at the point-of-care to facilitate rapid diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders. Evaluation of the health of different components of the gastrointestinal system is necessary to identify the cause of clinical symptoms. This panel is intended to assay the function of the pancreas, proximal small intestine, and distal small intestine. The Company believes that the ability to conduct testing at the point-of-care will facilitate real-time clinical decision-making, reduce in-patient clinic stay, promote earlier detection and treatment, and increase pet owner satisfaction.\n\nAccording to a DVM360 study*, ASPCA Pet Insurance, Embrace, Nationwide, Pets Best and Trupanion agree that \u201cGI condition\u201d is the most common insurance claim for dogs. Signs of digestive system disease can include excessive drooling, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting or regurgitation, loss of appetite, bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating, straining to defecate, shock, and dehydration. The TRUFORMA diagnostic device, which is smaller than a desktop printer, is anticipated to provide highly sensitive, species-specific assays using Qorvo\u2019s proprietary, non-optical Bulk Acoustic Wave (\"BAW\") sensor technology. The BAW sensor is a proven semiconductor technology used in telecommunications and aerospace markets. The Company believes that BAW technology has the potential to improve veterinary diagnostics by delivering reference laboratory accuracy and test performance to the veterinary clinic at the point-of-care.\"\n\nI bolded the important parts.

I believe in the company but people have been burned in the past so they are hesitant to invest in it. They are still restructuring and their products cost more than the other players; however, that should change in 6 or 9 months. Their data center seems promising too and I believe Apple is a customer.  To be honest, it's probably dead money for awhile and it's going to be in this $4 to $5 range. I wouldn't be surprised if it dips under $4.  Maybe pick up 250 shares and sell when it goes up a quarter and wait for pullbacks or hold on for the long term in case they get acquired. Other than that, you are better off with Marvell Technologies, Apple, Qrvo, Qualcomm for a 5G play. Even if you get less shares for $1000, the likelihood of the stock moving up is much greater. Also, if they pay dividends (Apple pays divs but not sure of the others), just reinvest the dividends and you will have more shares in the future. I've been burned by a lot of these cheap stocks that they are almost not worth investing in because they just don't move much.  You can consider having a portfolio of 6 of these under $7 stocks but don't put more than $3k. If one of them pans out, great. Not all will be winners.  \n\nYou may want to consider Ark Invest ETFs as I have a couple of them (ARKK and ARKF). The returns have been tremendous and Cathy (CEO) invests in disruptive companies. Vanguard funds are good too and I am considering getting one of the cloud ETFs and information technology ETFs when the market pulls back again as valuations are still too high. I may also look at the IPO ETF and getting some Snowflake (SNOW) shares for the long term. Good luck and I agree to not day trade with your IRA and take profits when the stocks/ETFs climb as you can buy them back again.

This panel is intended to assay the function of the pancreas, proximal small intestine, and distal small intestine. The Company believes that the ability to conduct testing at the point-of-care will facilitate real-time clinical decision-making, reduce in-patient clinic stay, promote earlier detection and treatment, and increase pet owner satisfaction.\n\nAccording to a DVM360 study*, ASPCA Pet Insurance, Embrace, Nationwide, Pets Best and Trupanion agree that \u201cGI condition\u201d is the most common insurance claim for dogs. Signs of digestive system disease can include excessive drooling, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting or regurgitation, loss of appetite, bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating, straining to defecate, shock, and dehydration. The TRUFORMA diagnostic device, which is smaller than a desktop printer, is anticipated to provide highly sensitive, species-specific assays using Qorvo\u2019s proprietary, non-optical Bulk Acoustic Wave (\"BAW\") sensor technology. The BAW sensor is a proven semiconductor technology used in telecommunications and aerospace markets. The Company believes that BAW technology has the potential to improve veterinary diagnostics by delivering reference laboratory accuracy and test performance to the veterinary clinic at the point-of-care.\"\n\nI bolded the important parts. This is a long hold regardless if r/s happens or does not. IMO the r/s ain't happening.",

I think with wholesale vs retail, especially if you\u2019re dealing with smaller banks, you have to be cognizant that wholesaled can be a much flightier source of capital if there\u2019s a crisis of confidence. I would make sure you understand average deposits/ broker, you don\u2019t want one broker controlling $100s of MM. \n\nOne thing to also focus on is % of revenue that comes from fees - you have some banks in my geography where 60% of the revenues come from account and credit card fees, which is hugely advantageous as you aren\u2019t exposed to rates.
