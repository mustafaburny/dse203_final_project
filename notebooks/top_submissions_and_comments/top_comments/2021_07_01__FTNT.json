Maybe Open Source where at least the community can see under the hood? Not sure on that though\n\nLove to hear if anyone had anything they liked they found that they felt they could recommend.",

        "body": "First, sell side analysts model company financials and try to set expectations for how a company will perform in the future. They create \u201cconsensus\u201d numbers, and there is more than one metric. For example, sometimes people look at the EPS number and think \u201cwow, they beat EPS handily\u201d, but when you dig below the surface into the company\u2019s numbers, they may have had a miss on Billings. There are many other metrics to consider. \n\nAnyway, the consensus numbers are rarely what money managers like hedge funds are expecting. You will never know the expectations of money managers, and therein lies the biggest variable. If money managers hate a company and expect it to do poorly\u2026 and it does poorly, but not AS poorly as expected, it may get bought. If they expect a company to do really well, and they do great but not great enough, the stock will get sold. The guidance for next quarter also plays into this. For example, a company could beat consensus and raise guidance, but if investors were expecting them to beat and raise MORE, it will get sold.\n\nThe other factor that comes into play is how the stock has performed over the past weeks or months. I\u2019ll give you an example- $FTNT is a company I really like, but look at the chart. This thing has been on a huge run. I\u2019m anticipating earnings will be great but not great enough, and it will get sold after the call.\n\nThe truth is, you\u2019re never going to be able to anticipate expectations, so hang in there for the long haul or just pass on trading earnings calls.",
