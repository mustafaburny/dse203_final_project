Why buy a car when you can rent one on demand?\n\nAnd with work from home lowering overall commutes, it will only put more downward pressure on car ownership. \n\nCars will be like cell phones in 20 years.

They will be consumer engagement devices and not just transportation.\n\nThat\u2019s why Apple has been nibbling into autos.

People were laughing at the pathetic sales compared to smartphone and traditional phones. Comments like \u201cwho wants to to swipe things, people want real keyboards\u201d\n\n2) Gas cars are not the future, whatever sales they have today will continue to get reduced because there is a big push from all those countries who want less pollution. So your going to see more claims from countries of by X year no more gas cars. Look at cigarette industry as a perfect example. Back then you can smoke anywhere and now you got to smoke in designated sections. Is anybody saying let\u2019s invest into this giant cigarette industries..they will be gone as soon as marijuana continues to be legalized. It\u2019s not a matter of will, it\u2019s when.\n\n3) anybody who doesn\u2019t think autonomous driving isn\u2019t our future\u2026needs to group with the same people who said Apple iphone was doomed to fail. \n\nPeople who say Tesla is inflated doesn\u2019t understand the multiple revenues it has enabled vs the traditional car companies. When people laughing about \u201cApple App Store\u201d\u2026..well between Google and Apple it enables $32 billion sales revenue just for Apps today and growing. If you understood Tesla multiple possible revenue streams (besides just selling cars and maintenance)\u2026you can see they have multiple business programs that they declare that other car manufacturers can use. For example, maybe everyone may adopt Tesla own App system, autonomous driving in the future. \n\nThe is only competitor who has this same strategy and they are not based in USA. Nio.. However NIO strategy is really copying how Apple did it with the iPhone.\n\nWell you may say, Ford or Volvo or some other traditional car supplier can do the same.\n\nThose traditional car companies are very good at building and maintaining their cars but do you think those car companies can build an ecosystem like how the Iphone turned the phone handset industry upside down? That is why the valuation of Tesla is so high and that is why players like Apple are looking into this industry. They want that eco-system, that\u2019s the meat of the revenues (high margin profits).\n\nAnyway\u2026that\u2019s my view.",
