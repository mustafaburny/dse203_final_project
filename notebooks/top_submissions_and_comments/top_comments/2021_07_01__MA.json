        "body": "Stay away from day trading. It's a nasty habit to pick up and most people aren't cut out for it. Swing tradings a lot less work and typically safer\n\nMy advice is:\n\n* The best trading comes from companies that slowly go up long term, but trade \"flat\" over the medium term with stable tops and bottoms.  Amazon and mastercard are good examples of this right now. It's a common mistake to think that companies have to constantly be going up to make money, when the opposite couldn't be truer. You also can't go wrong with swing trading safer companies with lower volatility, especially when you're new. Those are the companies you can safely hold if things go south.\n\n* Don't get married to a single stock. This is a rookie mistake. There's going to be plenty of moments where stocks just don't make sense to trade, typically when they're outside of a predictable trading range(such as breaking a support or resistance) or if it's just not at a good price within the trading range. Do not force trades that don't make sense because you think you need to trade constantly.\n\n* Following that, sometimes you just have to say fuck it and take a stock out of your watchlist because it's no longer favorable to trade within your strategies. I just did that with HD and FB after their insane runups since I now have no idea what they'll be trading within and speculating that is a complete waste of my time for now. The market is always changing and favorable companies can and will become unfavorable.\n\n* If you're trying to get 10% swings constantly you need to curb your expectations. 3-5% is much more reasonable and can be achieved faster as most stocks have +/- 1-3% volatility. Reliable profits always beat occasional large profits",

NAT SEC determines critical roles, infrastructure, and resources, whether language or minerals, in our home grown knowledge base. That means they may determine there are no native born US citizens who speak a certain language. Imagine our dependence on translators in any conflict environment. They may determine we are fucked on cobalt if we want to build batteries. Their job is not actually to staff current conflicts, but to actually project, as far as reasonable, future conflicts and anticipate the need and staff it. They also will wish to staff folks who sow seeds to *avert conflict* and or stage preparedness for future conflicts, in a manner that shifts said conflict in their favor. Interestingly enough, I am American woman, and I abide by rule of law while promoting it overseas, as a service,very cheaply. It is my honor. Why? They don't pay me enough to be loyal. I am loyal because it is my honor and the fabric of my being. They chose me because they know for a fact that I am loyal. Sure, I'm gonna eat street meat in Beijing, savor Crickets on a stick in Burma fed to me by unemployed physicists, feel tanks in my sternum in Moscow in 1990-1991, get Jack Ma heads up from folks to whom I provided VPNS in 2000 in the PRD, 12 hours before BABA tanks. But, ultimately, I have never ever been told what to tell people on the ground when they drop me in country. I am a free agent with (as you may have noticed) every liberty in my free speech. I was allowed to go places in 'transition,' to help or provide tech and humanitarian aide, and I was taught better facility in languages to do so... NOT because I work for the US Gov, but because they vetted me and knew our interests coincided. I wanted the same things they did. It is fairly random. I have signed many agreements, to secure my language training in the many languages I deploy. Those agreements say I will drop everything and serve, if we ever declare war, as a translator. As long as they use plenty of swear words while at war, we should be ok. ;D lol.. I would have have dropped everything, anyway, to serve, so those agreements never bothered me one bit. Why do I like Ginkgo? Because it is in the best interest of global citizens and the USA to form both a biosecurity protocol, and deploy this new tech. It is simultaneously in the best interest of the planet to harness this technology and to have a measured democratic access to the power and promise Syn Bio holds, while sharing, with bio/cyber/controls for the public good. Ginkgo will never weaponize it. I'm banking on that. In the ecosystem I have studied, Zy, not so much. Ginkgo, yes. They will not weaponize it. I invest accordingly with my own eyes wide open. I think Ginkgo is the way to go. I am not paid to do so, but I do enjoy the favor of tax payer dollars to have become a polyglot and represent this technology in multiple languages in places you would most likely never travel of your volition. I do so willingly and with no coercion. I think it will be a breakthrough the likes of the Marshall Plan, following on the Covid catastrophe. I would like to see American democratic values adapt and once again become the shining light on the hill we once were. This pisses people off who have not traveled as widely as me and seen the poverty and potential in the rest of the world when they met young STEM kids abroad. I have very different reasons for making the Ginkgo play than you. You are a quant, I am a qual.",

Mostly, I keep the balance by contributing to those which are underweight, not selling the overweight winners. I consider virtually all of these as hold forever stocks, but I do occasionally switch them up (if it's a good time to sell, e.g. I can do that without capital gains tax - selling at a loss or after a year of holding in my country).\n\nI reevaluate my portfolio pretty regularly, but my goal is to keep my stocks at \"set it and forget it\" as much as possible. However, if my thesis changes, I don't hesitate much to sell. TTD was one of my biggest winners, for example, but it's no longer in my portfolio. What made me sell in that specific case was mostly Apple's approach to privacy.\n\nI'm only 24, so I tilt towards tech and growth, but I try to keep some balance with stocks like JNJ, LMT, BAC, JPM, and within my ETFs.

I\u2019m terms of AWS, the majority of growth was organic, and would not have ran afoul of antitrust law back in its hay day, such as when US v. Aluminum Co. of America was prevailing law.\n\nAn attempt to break up Amazon by business segment would probably fail due to the shift since the 70\u2019s from Per Se Antitrust violations to the Rule of Reason. They aren\u2019t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.\n\nOnline shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.\n\nOverall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren\u2019t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",

It's market correlation is 0.02, which is an unattached, positive number...not the large negative correlation you would hope for from a hedge. It did absolutely nothing during the dot-com bubble and probably hurt most investors that held during 2020.",

        "body": "I personally invest heavily in Web3 crypto's and crypto projects that help run and keep these crypto's decentralised. \n\nWhat's a web3 crypto? These aren't to be confused with junk like Bitcoin that thinks it is a store of value or will become the new financial system, web3 crypto is literally creating the next stage in internet where you don't need to worry about your companies information / personal information / classified documents being stored on a server that is owned and managed by other companies. Web3 splits this up between 100's of validators that all talk to each other and keep this decentralised and secure from attacks. \n\nThere's also ones creating the future of finance. No longer do you need to get bent over by huge interest rates and banks fucking people over whenever they feel like it. DEFI is run by liquidity pools, people like you and I who store our money with the service and as a result get a percentage of the interest rates. These rates always remain low and competitive and go to the people rather than the big banks.\n\nThen you have oracles that power the decentralisation. Oracles gain info from many sources and feed it to the protocol to offer decentralised information. For easy laymans terms, if I wanted a weather oracle, it would gather weather data from 1000's weather stations and news outlets, work out the average forecast and feed that to my protocol. This means my protocol is giving the users the most accurate non-biased information. Just as a high-level. \n\nSo how do you make money from this? Well, let's look at Ethereum just as an example. Every single protect that runs on Ethereum has to pay \"gas\" fees on each transaction, this is paid in Ethereum. Ethereum already has 1000's of applications including VISA and MasterCard that constantly have a demand for Ethereum in order to operate and pay these gas fees. You as the investor holds the Ethereum they need and this creates supply and demand. Additionally, each time a company pays their gas fees, the gas is \"burnt\" (meaning Ethereum used to pay for the transaction is burnt) creating deflation. \n\nEthereum is just one project, and not one that I personally even invest in that much, but it's one that I'm sure most people have heard of.   \nIf you want to look at getting some crypto while it's currently on a low and has huge potentially to be the future of a new decentralised internet feel free to use my exchange code.
