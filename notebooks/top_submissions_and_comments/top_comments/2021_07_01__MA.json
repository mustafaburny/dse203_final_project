If democrats want to change anti-trust legislation, there is an open debate and investors can gauge the effect on the company themselves.\n\nThe CCP on the other hand operates quite arbitrarily and what rights, if any, individuals and companies are guaranteed is not clear. How these unclear rights change in the future is also unclear. As an example the CCP can stop Jack Ma from appearing in public, without any trial or transparent reason, while such a thing in the US is nearly unheard of.\n\nIn the end it comes down to this.

        "body": "Stay away from day trading. It's a nasty habit to pick up and most people aren't cut out for it. Swing tradings a lot less work and typically safer\n\nMy advice is:\n\n* The best trading comes from companies that slowly go up long term, but trade \"flat\" over the medium term with stable tops and bottoms.  Amazon and mastercard are good examples of this right now. It's a common mistake to think that companies have to constantly be going up to make money, when the opposite couldn't be truer. You also can't go wrong with swing trading safer companies with lower volatility, especially when you're new. Those are the companies you can safely hold if things go south.\n\n* Don't get married to a single stock. This is a rookie mistake. There's going to be plenty of moments where stocks just don't make sense to trade, typically when they're outside of a predictable trading range(such as breaking a support or resistance) or if it's just not at a good price within the trading range. Do not force trades that don't make sense because you think you need to trade constantly.\n\n* Following that, sometimes you just have to say fuck it and take a stock out of your watchlist because it's no longer favorable to trade within your strategies. I just did that with HD and FB after their insane runups since I now have no idea what they'll be trading within and speculating that is a complete waste of my time for now. The market is always changing and favorable companies can and will become unfavorable.\n\n* If you're trying to get 10% swings constantly you need to curb your expectations. 3-5% is much more reasonable and can be achieved faster as most stocks have +/- 1-3% volatility. Reliable profits always beat occasional large profits",

This discussion is for educational purposes only.  \n\nI have been selling puts in BYND over the past year and doing well.  Basically I wait for a dip and sell conservative puts.  A similar strategy would be to just buy the dips.  Like these discussions have said, it is a good strategy. \n\nOK, regarding charts, realize that NO one can tell the future from looking at a chart! With that out of the way, look at this one from BigCharts. \n\n[https://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/advchart/frames/frames.asp?show=&amp;insttype=Stock&amp;symb=BYND&amp;x=36&amp;y=8&amp;time=8&amp;startdate=1%2F4%2F1999&amp;enddate=2%2F20%2F2012&amp;freq=1&amp;compidx=aaaaa%3A0&amp;comptemptext=&amp;comp=none&amp;ma=3&amp;maval=12&amp;uf=7168&amp;lf=256&amp;lf2=268435456&amp;lf3=0&amp;type=2&amp;style=320&amp;size=2&amp;timeFrameToggle=false&amp;compareToToggle=false&amp;indicatorsToggle=false&amp;chartStyleToggle=false&amp;state=10](https://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/advchart/frames/frames.asp?show=&amp;insttype=Stock&amp;symb=BYND&amp;x=36&amp;y=8&amp;time=8&amp;startdate=1%2F4%2F1999&amp;enddate=2%2F20%2F2012&amp;freq=1&amp;compidx=aaaaa%3A0&amp;comptemptext=&amp;comp=none&amp;ma=3&amp;maval=12&amp;uf=7168&amp;lf=256&amp;lf2=268435456&amp;lf3=0&amp;type=2&amp;style=320&amp;size=2&amp;timeFrameToggle=false&amp;compareToToggle=false&amp;indicatorsToggle=false&amp;chartStyleToggle=false&amp;state=10)\n\nLook at the williams % line.  It helps identify dips within a local trading range.  If you buy  when the Williams % is below 75 or 80 and sell when it is above 20 or 25 you can theoretically do very well.  In practice it is not foolproof.  \n\nA better way to look at BYND is to ask if it makes sense.  Do they have a good product? Yes! It is a market disruptor and tastes great too.  Do they have a great market?  Yes, and they are aggressively opening up new channels.  Do they make money? No, so there is risk. But they are a new company with a solid plan.  AMZN didn't make money for decades.  Getting in in the growth phase can be very profitable for the investor. \n\nGood Luck!",

        "body": "Because I get the science and have been a USGOV grantee, or paid techno-evangelist for many years in developing what we call \"transitional\" economies, for twenty years. NAT SEC determines critical roles, infrastructure, and resources, whether language or minerals, in our home grown knowledge base. That means they may determine there are no native born US citizens who speak a certain language. Imagine our dependence on translators in any conflict environment. They may determine we are fucked on cobalt if we want to build batteries. Their job is not actually to staff current conflicts, but to actually project, as far as reasonable, future conflicts and anticipate the need and staff it. They also will wish to staff folks who sow seeds to *avert conflict* and or stage preparedness for future conflicts, in a manner that shifts said conflict in their favor. Interestingly enough, I am American woman, and I abide by rule of law while promoting it overseas, as a service,very cheaply. It is my honor. Why? They don't pay me enough to be loyal. I am loyal because it is my honor and the fabric of my being. They chose me because they know for a fact that I am loyal. Sure, I'm gonna eat street meat in Beijing, savor Crickets on a stick in Burma fed to me by unemployed physicists, feel tanks in my sternum in Moscow in 1990-1991, get Jack Ma heads up from folks to whom I provided VPNS in 2000 in the PRD, 12 hours before BABA tanks. But, ultimately, I have never ever been told what to tell people on the ground when they drop me in country. I am a free agent with (as you may have noticed) every liberty in my free speech. I was allowed to go places in 'transition,' to help or provide tech and humanitarian aide, and I was taught better facility in languages to do so... NOT because I work for the US Gov, but because they vetted me and knew our interests coincided. I wanted the same things they did. It is fairly random. I have signed many agreements, to secure my language training in the many languages I deploy. Those agreements say I will drop everything and serve, if we ever declare war, as a translator. As long as they use plenty of swear words while at war, we should be ok. ;D lol.. I would have have dropped everything, anyway, to serve, so those agreements never bothered me one bit. Why do I like Ginkgo? Because it is in the best interest of global citizens and the USA to form both a biosecurity protocol, and deploy this new tech. It is simultaneously in the best interest of the planet to harness this technology and to have a measured democratic access to the power and promise Syn Bio holds, while sharing, with bio/cyber/controls for the public good. Ginkgo will never weaponize it. I'm banking on that. In the ecosystem I have studied, Zy, not so much. Ginkgo, yes. They will not weaponize it. I invest accordingly with my own eyes wide open. I think Ginkgo is the way to go. I am not paid to do so, but I do enjoy the favor of tax payer dollars to have become a polyglot and represent this technology in multiple languages in places you would most likely never travel of your volition. I do so willingly and with no coercion. I think it will be a breakthrough the likes of the Marshall Plan, following on the Covid catastrophe. I would like to see American democratic values adapt and once again become the shining light on the hill we once were. This pisses people off who have not traveled as widely as me and seen the poverty and potential in the rest of the world when they met young STEM kids abroad. I have very different reasons for making the Ginkgo play than you. You are a quant, I am a qual.",

However, if my thesis changes, I don't hesitate much to sell. TTD was one of my biggest winners, for example, but it's no longer in my portfolio. What made me sell in that specific case was mostly Apple's approach to privacy.\n\nI'm only 24, so I tilt towards tech and growth, but I try to keep some balance with stocks like JNJ, LMT, BAC, JPM, and within my ETFs.

I have my accounts set to automatically reinvest dividends but most of my holdings only pay nominal dividends of 0.5-1.0%.\n\nI prefer investing in companies that pay a dividend because it shows consistent free cash flow and cash management. For example: Apple, Microsoft, Visa and Mastercard all pay small dividends less than 1%.  In general, dividend paying companies have outperformed non dividend paying companies over long time scales.\n\nThat being said, I have plenty of Berkshire Hathaway that never pays dividends. I know Warren Buffet can invest the cash for superior returns in different deals when the time is right.\n\nEvaluate every company differently, with respect to its peers, industry, why they do or do not pay a dividend and why they should or should not continue to pay a dividend. So many more important things than chasing a couple points of yield or DRIP-ing, all depends on your goals and strategy.",

I've been down ever since and had accepted my loss. The price of the option was steadily decreasing, .70, .50, and so on.  \nToday I checked and in my account shows a 100% gain for the same option. The ask is posted at $2.15. Obviously I put an order in trying to exit my position asap.  \nI know that just cause the ask is posted there, does not mean it's the \"real price\" until someone buys it, and the volume on the option is super low.  \nI'm waiting for my order to go through but I'm almost certain it won't. It makes no sense why I would see green in my account if I can't exit my position. I did search the internet to make sense of it but it seems too vague an issue for anyone to provide an answer for me.",

        "body": "Understandable, I\u2019ve been invested for a while but it took me a solid few weeks of research before I actually bought any stock last year. Patent trolls are usually the first thing that comes to mind in these situations but Netlist isn\u2019t some scam company, they\u2019re a real company with real innovation. \n\nA quick, rough breakdown of the Google history: \n\nNetlist that came to Google in 2006-ish trying to license their memory products to Google for their servers. Google said thanks but no thanks but then used their patented technology anyways. Netlist caught wind and sued Google in 2009. Google has been fighting this court case for 12 years now, their first defense was that the patent wasn\u2019t valid, but a USPTO PTAB recently came to the conclusion that the patent is valid. So Google should be on the hook for 12+ years of treble damages as well as court fees and possibly future royalties. Currently the judge in their case ordered both sides to try and talk it out and a joint decision was supposed to be turned into the judge just a few days ago so speculation is running rampant in the Netlist subreddit that an agreement was reach as nothing was filed on the deadline but who tf knows. Google has been fighting this tooth and nail for years and there are also cases against Micron and Samsung for similar infringement. \n\nNetlist has barely been staying above water this past decade, with most of its profits going towards fighting these legal cases and it seems like maybe the most recent win against SK Hynix may be the turning point. I can\u2019t say I know what\u2019s going to happen but things have definitely been trending in the right direction. Shareholders are basically betting that the last 12 years of missed profits from these giant tech companies will be realized very soon in triplicate with additional cash covering legal fees as well as forcing Google and others to pay royalties for future use of the technology. \n\nAs always, do your own research, I\u2019m not a patent lawyer nor an expert in computer memory technology.",
