Other then that do a lot of research. Read a lot. Dont buy and think your going to sell again any time soon. Ive only been actually investing for about 2 years. In that time I have only sold 1 position because I no longer liked the investment long term. Everything else i have bought with the intent to hold for 10+ years baring something extremely unforeseen. I buy a lot of blue chips and companies im somewhat familiar with as well. I work in tech so I own cisco, palo alto, fortinet, netapp because I work with there products a lot. But i probably only own about 30 individual companies and over 50% of my portfolio is in those index funds i mentioned earlier. Is this winning advice, I have no idea but its been working for me.",

The analyst says there is now a \"meaningful disconnect\" between Akamai and other security and CDN stocks, despite its larger scale, higher profitability and \" still solid growth.\" He sees Akamai as an \"attractive way\" to play long-term trends like cloud security and edge computing.\n\nSynesael points out that the stock looks cheap relative to both security plays like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) and to other content- delivery networks, such as Cloudflare (NET), Fastly (FSLY), and Limelight Networks (LLNW). He argues that Covid-19 has served as a catalyst to Akamai's security and CDN businesses.\n\n\"We believe Covid-19 has resulted in increased demand for both its enterprise and internet security product offerings given the increase in the number of attacks across organizations and the internet,\" Synesael writes. \"We believe Akamai's security business is an underappreciated component of its long- term growth opportunity and that as it becomes a larger portion of total revenue more investors are likely to start valuing it on its [sum of the parts] which we believe will result in a significant re-rating of the stock.\"\n\nThe analyst notes that there have been investor concerns about the company losing market share to peers like Fastly, but asserts that \"the growth of competitors is more a function of an expanding opportunity for CDN providers rather than share stealing from Akamai.\"\n\nAkamai shares were up 7%, at $113.78, in recent trading, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9%. The stock is up about 32% year to date, which is impressive growth -- except when compared with Cloudflare, which has more than doubled, and Fastly, which has more than quadrupled",
