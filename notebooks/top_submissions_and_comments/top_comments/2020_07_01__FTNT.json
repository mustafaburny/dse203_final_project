(Cloudflare is #1 only because of the short term higher growth and lower valuation. But since your question is on a 10 year timeline I\u2019d still go with Fortinet).\n\nThey were well ahead of the curve as far as a focus on security for an entire network instead of just the centralized portions of it (ie: security for the employee-user working at home, not just the central system he\u2019s logging into). And they continue to rank at or near the top as far as satisfaction and benchmarks on their end-to-end Security Fabric system. At this point everyone\u2019s doing the same thing but they\u2019re the only ones that seem to excel at it. \n\nThey do lag in a few other areas, but I think in the long run endpoint protection will be the deciding factor for most business customers.",

Other then that do a lot of research. Read a lot. Dont buy and think your going to sell again any time soon. Ive only been actually investing for about 2 years. In that time I have only sold 1 position because I no longer liked the investment long term. Everything else i have bought with the intent to hold for 10+ years baring something extremely unforeseen. I buy a lot of blue chips and companies im somewhat familiar with as well. I work in tech so I own cisco, palo alto, fortinet, netapp because I work with there products a lot.

Proofpoint is only $3bil, FireEye is only $3bil. I feel like Crowdstrike's price is due to market irrationality, as well as Crowdstrike heavily investing in sales and marketing rather than engineering and development.

The analyst says there is now a \"meaningful disconnect\" between Akamai and other security and CDN stocks, despite its larger scale, higher profitability and \" still solid growth.\" He sees Akamai as an \"attractive way\" to play long-term trends like cloud security and edge computing.\n\nSynesael points out that the stock looks cheap relative to both security plays like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) and to other content- delivery networks, such as Cloudflare (NET), Fastly (FSLY), and Limelight Networks (LLNW). He argues that Covid-19 has served as a catalyst to Akamai's security and CDN businesses.\n\n\"We believe Covid-19 has resulted in increased demand for both its enterprise and internet security product offerings given the increase in the number of attacks across organizations and the internet,\" Synesael writes. \"We believe Akamai's security business is an underappreciated component of its long- term growth opportunity and that as it becomes a larger portion of total revenue more investors are likely to start valuing it on its [sum of the parts] which we believe will result in a significant re-rating of the stock.\"\n\nThe analyst notes that there have been investor concerns about the company losing market share to peers like Fastly, but asserts that \"the growth of competitors is more a function of an expanding opportunity for CDN providers rather than share stealing from Akamai.\"\n\nAkamai shares were up 7%, at $113.78, in recent trading, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9%. The stock is up about 32% year to date, which is impressive growth -- except when compared with Cloudflare, which has more than doubled, and Fastly, which has more than quadrupled",

The people hyping up Tesla so much, are arguing that it's a tech company, even though it makes cars.\n\nThe big 5 (MSFT/AAPL/AMZN/FB/GOOG) are definitely solid companies.  That doesn't change the fact that they've gotten overvalued.  Apple has grown 2.5x in value the past few years, but revenues have slowed, and profits really haven't changed much.  \n\nBelow that top tier you have a bunch of unprofitable $100-300M companies that have gotten hyped up.  And simply comparing it to 2000 without reference is ignoring it.  Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel were top 10 companies and weren't the single product late 90's product that you focus on.  Cisco still lost 90% of it's value, and still isn't back up there.  Microsoft still took 16 years to recover it's lost market cap.  \n\nHow am I throwing a tantrum.  It's a fact that the only time that valuation compared to trailing earnings was higher was the dot com bubble, and near right before great depression, the only time that market cap was higher as a percentage of GDP was dot com bubble.  There's tons of comparables that suggest this market is overvalued, and absolutely 0 that it's undervalued compared to history.",

We'll have a more in depth DD post dropping soon, but for now I'll address your partnership comment.\n\nThose companies are listed on the \"Partners\" page of the OSS site and you cannot use the logo of or claim to be a partner of a major tech company without permission. Source, I worked for a start up and we were doing food safety tech through a company that served Google campus so we tried to put the Google logo on our site under partners and we got a serious slap on the wrist.\n\nNow to address the concerns about whether or not they are a partner or just compatible with their technology - yes, they are partners. Specifically using the HPC server technology, which is high performance computing, that is listed on that partners page in the small blurb. This would typically be some type of server rack with the PCIe backbone to have multiple processors or GPUs to do high performance computing of some variety for those companies listed such as Apple, Intel, etc. It may be crunching numbers for Apple Maps or maybe just for how many times the restrooms were cleaned across the Apple campus. We don't know. We just know they use the OSS HPC products at a large enough scale that they have approval to put them on the partners page.\n\nI hope that helps clear things up. Please be on the look out as we continue to publish more information that we find. Thanks and enjoy the rest of your weekend.",

An expanded product line of shiny computers and reality TV-show streaming aren't something to be counted on for unlimited upward stock movements nor is it something to celebrate as the dazibao of 21st century progress.\n\nDo one of those remind me in 6 months things and let's see where we're at.",

A better comparison in the cheaper benchmarks is a 3600X anyways as it has the same 6 cores but more threads at roughly the same clock speed and similar price as a i5 9600K.

        "body": "Lets take this one bite at a time. Please understand this isn't a personal rant of Intel hate or AMD love, just my informed opinion about the companies as investments. \n\nClock speed - Yep. Intel still holds *single core* performance crown, at the cost of incredibly high power draw and all for maybe 5% improvement. Multi-Core AMD still leads and offers more value per $ overall. \n\nMarket Share - Depends on your sources and regions so I won't nitpick on specifically \"who has more % of market share\" but rather, who has momentum and is gaining vs. losing market share. AMD is gaining consistently regardless of data source. \n\nSecurity Flaws - Threat to both, Intel has just had more bad press lately. No telling when these flaws get picked up in the media or how much they will effect. However, the CTS Labs scandal from 2018 shouldn't be ignored. An intel funded \"security\" company based in Israel announces AMD vulnerabilities publicly without contacting AMD (industry standard to give notice so they can fix). Vulnerabilities were practically nothing (diversion from Spectre and Meltdown) and company has faded into the background without answering any questions, deleting their webpage \"[AMDFlaws.com](https://AMDFlaws.com)\"\n\nMarketing Deception - \n\n* 2018 Computex Industrial Chiller incident to distract from Threadripper\n* Principled Technologies funded study, using an Intel funded benchmark, that pitted the i9-9900K  against a 2700X that deliberately had half its cores disabled\n* Threadripper losing to an i5 in same Intel funded benchmark\n* 2019 MDS vulnerability appears, Intel bribes researchers to downplay severity\n* \"Real World Performance\" campaign the moment benchmarks started showing AMD consistently in the lead, trying to devalue long standing benchmark validity. \n* \"Financial Horsepower\" $3 BILLION set aside to persuade anyone considering AMD to stick with Intel.\n* \"Real World Performance\" caught deliberately hiding disclosures, which exist because Intel was previously caught in anti-consumer deceptive practices in 2009. \n* Plethora of vaporware product announcements with rigged benchmarks, but since the product was never released we can't independently test. \n\nAnti-Competitive Practices - See $3Billion bullet above. And dont' recall what their latest margins on CPUs were, but AMD margins are increasing and Intel has been price cutting. Again, momentum in AMDs favor. \n\nNvidia Market Leader - Team Green has long been the GPU market leader and it isn't debatable, but as AMD (hopefully) and Intel both become more competitive Nvidia may be forced to cut into their margin to stay on top. Sources vary again, but typically they sit at about 70% market share +/-. \n\nMy comparison to Ford/Tesla = Intel/Nvidia remains. Intel has the capability/cash to turn the ship around but I'm not buying until I see a defined culture shift there.",

        "body": "&gt;only gaming really uses 1-2 cores ,not most programs, its 2020 software  developers know how to utilize multiple cores, and for gaming GPUs are  where its at anyways. Workstations don't care about clock speed, they  want multi core throughput. \n\nWhat is your technical knowledge? I doubt any average software uses more than 6 cores. Not only that, but multi-cores becomes very ineffecient the more cores you have.\n\nAlso games don't use 1 or 2 cores, games really do use all the cores usually, just at a certain point it doesn't make a difference anymore because of a lot of technical difficulties. And most of modern games barely use the CPU for anything, so the FPS differences between 9600K and 3700X will be almost none except for very CPU-intensive games. \n\nYou should watch this : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5-3MMoA\\_A0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5-3MMoA_A0)\n\n&gt;again I have both AMD and Intel comps, the AMD wins hands down with  price per performance on everything but gaming higher clock speed and I  could still overclock if I absolutely needed more but most games do not  care about CPUs its GPU bottle-necked. \n\nHow did you test that? Sounds like some bullshit you made up with no objective data. As I said before, most programs don't use multiple cores effeciently as they simply can't.\n\nThe only thing a 3700X, which is much more expensive than the 9600k, would beat the 9600K in, would be either specific software utilizing multiple cores to compute independent lines of code or a lot of active programs being ran at once. \n\n&gt;only in single core speed, in multi core processes the 3700X has 2 more  cores and twice the threads it would dominate the i5 9600K. A better  comparison in the cheaper benchmarks is a 3600X anyways as it has the  same 6 cores but more threads at roughly the same clock speed and  similar price as a i5 9600K. Making it a better choice than the i5 9600K  in everything but gaming and in gaming both CPUs would perform just  fine. \n\nSame answer as above. \n\nAnd no, a 9600K should be compared to a 3700X, the 3600X is no match at all. The 9600K outperforms the 3600X even on the 8-core test, lmao. Showing how threads aren't that useful. \n\n**Here are the specific and objective numbers that are relevant :**\n\n3700X is \\~42% more expensive than the 9600K, 170 euros vs 240 euros.\n\nThese are the performance scores, 9600K on the left and 3700X on the right. Non-OC :\n\nMemory speed : 93,3 vs 79\n\nSingle-core : 136 vs 136\n\nTwo-core : 271 vs 269\n\nFour-core : 532 vs 516\n\nEight-core : 761 vs 928\n\nSixty-four core : 905 vs 1499\n\nOC :\n\nMemory speed : 97,4 vs 89,2\n\nSingle-core : 155 vs 141\n\nTwo-core : 308 vs 281\n\nFour-core : 616 vs 548\n\nEight-core : 899 vs 1025\n\nSixty-four core : 768 vs 1418\n\nSource : [https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-9600K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4031vs4043](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-9600K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4031vs4043)\n\nAs you can see, objectively, there's no reason to ever buy the much more expensive 3700X over the 9600K unless you specifically require a very high core count.  Also note that in benchmarks the conditions for multi-core are ideal with minimum memory usage and no overlapping calculations. In real world software, there will always be a lot of memory storage and reading between CPU's, which will make the multi-cores less effective. \n\nIn games that like multi-core CPU's like CS:GO the 9600K still outperforms the 3700X by 20% in fps, this mostly likely caused by the memory latency of the 3700X. \n\nI'm not saying Intel is much better, I'm saying Intel's performance is king, while AMD's price per performance is king.\n\nI believe the Ryzen 5 3600 is the most valuable processor right now. As you can see, many AMD's on the list :\n\n[https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu\\_value\\_available.html](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_value_available.html)",

Android is over 80% of global market, it's open, it's cheaper, and will eventually beat out apple. It will take a very very long time. And apple  has plenty of other niches, but they no longer have Jobs, or a viable halo product to keep there massive growth for a couple decades. I'm not saying they are a bad buy, but you asked for reasons why not. They are no longer a growth company. They are just maximizing existing product life and patents and software etc. But they don't have the opportunity for massive growth like other smaller companies. They have failed before, they still can't get TV done correctly, they are under 20% market share in their walled garden, and they charge premium prices, what could go wrong?",

Zen 3 moving to 7 nm to 7 nm EuV is a relatively big step that should bring 10% performance, they're talking another +15% in architecture so it could solidify AMD at the top. AMD keep saying Q3, I have no idea how they will pull that off, that's like now. \n\nZen 4 will be total market dominance in CPU (if not from Zen 3), Huawei got banned from TSMC and AMD joinked their reserved wafers on 5 nm. The smartphone guys usually launch on the new node in like March, AMD will probably need longer, but not that much longer.

The techtoctopus wage fixing crackdown that happened caused a significant amount of strife in silicon valley. The only thing that would really affect these companies is government regulation or antitrust legislation directed toward them. But as it stands now you are right they are nearly untouchable and are not effected by much in terms of competition or lawsuits of any kind.\n\nI will add this, I think this return to chip making for apple is going to be a massive issue for their bottom line. I personally do not see how they can compete with amd and intel for chip design for desktops. Manufacture is different but the ee specs and development are a different issue that I don't think they will easily be able to compete with.",

There\u2019s plenty of boomer junk like ibm, Disney , intel etc who\u2019s share valuations have been stagnant for years and years now as their innovation and growth has been mediocre\n\nAnd yes nflx is definitely both a platform and content studio. Their competitors is good you say? Who? Hulu? Amazon prime videos ? TiVo ?\n\nCan you list out their competitors growth in academy awards / oscars like nflx OC has been doing these past few years?? If they had \u201cjust ok\u201d content they wouldn\u2019t be growing their list of accolades on the content they keep pumping out\n\nDisney is no doubt an iconic media behemoth. Yet their shares are trading still at values near half a decade ago. Believe whatever you want about their status as a company but the ticker as an investment has been a massive letdown for anyone who bought in the last decade. \n\nAlso - disney is STILL mostly kids/animation stuff. Their adult OC is lacking . Heavily. They have next to nothing produced for adult content , foreign or domestic. While Netflix is a still kicking ass and going hard with production. Also- I firmly believe the marvel avengers saga will not be topped by the next generation of marvel movies...they are doing fuck all with Star Wars .... each new SW movie release got worse (ticket sales and accolades). Love mandolarian but they need way more than living on nostalgia.\nThey hit a grand slam with avengers but that\u2019s the past. The future of it doesn\u2019t look as bright.

Intel is usually more effecient during benchmarks.\n\n&gt;and all for maybe 5% improvement.\n\nAgain not true, the performance difference is up to 10% in perfect single-core benchmarks, while it may be up to 20% in real-world. This is because of AMD lagging with memory latency, RAM and single-core speed.\n\n&gt;Multi-Core AMD still leads\n\nHow exactly? It will lead soon, but not yet.\n\n&gt;and offers more value per $ overall.\n\nI agree.\n\n&gt;AMD is gaining consistently regardless of data source.\n\nWhich I agreed with.\n\nThe rest of your rant on Intel is just opinion, no way to objectively say anything, all I'll say is that AMD only relatively recently gained a the major CPU share, hackers haven't been targeting them for as long.\n\n&gt;Nvidia Market Leader - Team Green has long been the GPU market leader and it isn't debatable\n\nThat is total bullshit. AMD owns more share market of GPU than NVIDIA does. Post sources if you want to be taken seriously.\n\n\"As of the fourth quarter of 2019, Intel was the biggest vendor in the PC **GPU market** worldwide, occupying 63 percent of the **market**. AMD occupied 19 percent of the **market**, whilst **Nvidia** took a **market share** of 18 percent.\"\n\n&gt;but as AMD (hopefully) and Intel both become more competitive\n\nAgain, I don't understand why you're so misinformed about AMD and GPU's, have you been reading too much NVIDIA propaganda lately? AMD is destroying NVIDIA right now with their peformance and prices.\n\n&gt;Sources vary again, but typically they sit at about 70% market share +/-.\n\nPost the sources then, lol. This sounds like the source is your head and your head alone...\n\n&gt;just my informed opinion about the companies as investments.\n\nYour so called \"informed\" opinion actually thinks NVIDIA owns 70% of the market share of GPU's... How \"informed\" is it really?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In fact all I can say is how dare you open your filthy mouth about AMD when the 5700XT, which is cheaper than an RTX 2060, outperformed the RTX 2070! Which forced NVIDIA to release a 2060S with similiar price and performance... Imagine all the mad RTX 2070 owners having less performance than a 110$ cheaper 2060S... Literally fucked over by NVIDIA \\^\\^**\n\n**How dare you open your filthy NVIDIA shill mouth when the new PS5 is going to be ran by AMD Navi...**",

Hopefully other post shows a bit more objectivity on my part. \n\nClarified a few of the points you bring up there, such as market share (momentum vs. actual % lead), vulnerabilities and anti-competitive agreements. \n\nIn my opinion, Intel absolutely rested on their laurels and consciously chose to not innovate and instead grew their margins. To me, it was 4-core 14nm CPUs for all until AMD re-enters the competitive landscape and catches intel with their pants down. \n\nFabs are a vulnerability for AMD as they outsource to TSMC, and I'm aware that Intel 10nm = TSM 7nm. This is the current landscape and if Intel can execute then AMD loses lead. With Intel's size and cash position they could certainly re-capture momentum. \n\nMy buy signs for Intel are: \n\n1. Ability to execute on Moore's law reduction timeline\n2. Culture change away from toxic marketing practices. Build a culture people can believe in/trust.\n\nLike you, I like the sector as a whole and this commentary is debating which of the litter is my favorite and why.",

They had some forays with the Intel Phi in the HPC space. The HPC space is more and more being taken over by the high latency high throughput parallel chips like GPUs. The mobile space is starting to compete with the CPU space. Compounding with the last 20 years seeing the ISA becoming less and less relevant. Intel needs to do something to not become IBM.

With a significant performance increase, you'll be able to get a 2nd tier GPU from the new generation, which will outperform the 1st tier from the previous generation, giving them an even more sizable lead over AMD.\n\nSomeone mentioned in a post here that the future could be APUs - essentially you wouldn't need a GPU becuase the computer's CPU is so powerful it runs all the graphics requirements. And at the moment AMD and Intel do offer some APUs, but right now they are no match for having a dedicated GPU.

For some officials to say, \"we will not go back into lockdown or close businesses\" and then a couple days later close down businesses, they must be receiving enough intel/pressure to know they're going to lose far more tax revenue in the long run if they try and keep everything open through a huge holiday weekend and just shut everything down on Monday 7/6.

        "body": "&gt;Intel has (or had) a very strong moat in terms of agreements with the various large scale OEM manufacturers for PCs. This has started to decay a bit in recent years, but the last time AMD had the better CPUs in the processor space (a couple of decades ago) you still could not buy a PC with an AMD processor because of various contracts Intel had with the PC manufacturers.\n\nThis is no longer an accurate description of the market. AMD and Intel are both widely available in basically every single OEM's product lineups. I'm sure there's a few random OEMs out there that only use one chip manufacturer for accidental reasons - they got a good wholesale deal, or they have a limited lineup of models and it was easier to use a single chipset - but in general AMD is equally available from all the big OEMs.",

Their CPUs are currently smashing Intel in terms of price to performance, and thir GPUs are significantly cheaper than Nvidias, alebeit with less performance.\n\nNvidia is the market leader in terms of GPUs, have just signed a deal with Mercedes and their next generation of GPU is said to be coming out later this year. With a significant performance increase, you'll be able to get a 2nd tier GPU from the new generation, which will outperform the 1st tier from the previous generation, giving them an even more sizable lead over AMD.\n\nSomeone mentioned in a post here that the future could be APUs - essentially you wouldn't need a GPU becuase the computer's CPU is so powerful it runs all the graphics requirements. And at the moment AMD and Intel do offer some APUs, but right now they are no match for having a dedicated GPU. We're probably 10 years or so away from APUs taking over, if they do.\n\nI personally hold a position in Nvidia.",
