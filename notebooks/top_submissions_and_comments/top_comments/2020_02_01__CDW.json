Finding amazing companies that are growing their earnings power equates to superior returns. \n\nIt blows my mind every time I see a value investor lamenting how \"easy\" it has been for tech investors to make money. Yes buying and holding amazon or apple or salesforce has been an amazing strategy for the last 10 years and its been \"easy\" vs scouring through the filings and identifying a cigar butt.. no doubt. But the genius has been in identifying that the Amazons, Apple's, Salesforce's of the world have FAR superior business models compared to brick and mortar traditional businesses. \n\nTL;DR Hard work is important, but it doesn't guarantee returns. Finding great companies and holding on to them guarantees returns.",

The question for me is whether these names deserve to have extreme multiples relative to companies that look just like them historically. \n\nThe answer for me is no. These companies trade at 3-5x higher multiples than companies who were consistently growing  +40% annually. I track software names and have been doing so for personal and professional reasons for 20 years. A high growth name like SHOP could consistently get a 8-12x trailing revenue multiple. Today its 30-40x. \n\nThere is no justification for the multiples we are seeing today. You cannot model out a scenario where these companies grow into their multiples and feel good about betting on that business case. I say this because there are only a handful of precedents who have managed to grow at a high rate and generate cash flow over long (5-7years or more) periods of time. \n\nYou cant hold out hope that a big strategic will take them out at these levels because the price point is too dilutive. Plus there is practically been no strategic M&amp;A for these faster growers in the last year or so. I think the best case you find is Salesforce acquiring Tableau. And DATA in that situation had slowed but CRM didn\u2019t pay 30-40x revenue for it either. Another one could be IBM buying Red Hat but then again IBM paid alot for the business but no where near 25x revenue. \n\nSHOP and others are trading at outrageous multiples but beware these are not sustainable and they leave no room for error.",

So.... if you are talented and live in the US and work for IBM, will the last one turn out the lights?\n\nSeriously. Not much diversity at the head of top tech companies based in the US. This is what India pressure looks like - you get the best deals with India if you have an Indian CEO. Trump is not the only one playing with foreign influence playing with Putin. US tech companies play with foreign influence, because mathematically and otherwise, it is too much of a coincidence that most of the top US tech companies are CEOS from India - barring those companies created by a person. Why are the boards making this non-EEOC decision? Why is it that there is no Asian, no white, no hispanic, no black, no other as CEO of these companies that rely so heavily on Indian labor or sites in India that drive down cost? Hm.....maybe someone can get their AI to crunch the number on the probability of that being wholly without bias.\n\nBut so much for the US being a champion of diversity in tech for their US employees. Really. Tech may be high minded calling out ICE and so forth, but they are not a fan of the EEOC or the idea of diversity on their teams. Except for a couple of photo ops.",

Uninformed people just don't know any better, and it sounds like you had the kind of environment that didnt foster financial learning or stability. Reaching out and trying to better your future sounds pretty smart to me.\n\nOn average the S&amp;P500 increases about 8-10% annually. Look up SPY and VOO ETFs, which track the S&amp;P500 (500 biggest companies on the US stock market). People are usually better off buying and holding those than picking individual stocks. At that rate of return, you might expect between 59-75k if you invest $100/month for 20 years due to compound interest.\n\nAlso, 53 isnt too late for you! You have another 20-30 years left statistically, possibly more with medical advancements. A lot of great people didn't make it big until their 50s. IBM and Home Depot were started by a 61 and 50 year old, you've still got opportunity left! Good luck!",

        "body": "While I would agree with the general thesis that Intel has lost a few notches of their technical superiority, do you think that necessarily translates into stock price?  Such tectonic shifts - if real - can take a very long time.  \n\nThere used to be a saying \"nobody ever got fired for picking IBM\". It took decades for that rule to fade.  The same is true of Intel.  AMD may indeed be crushing it on tech, and winning customers one at a time.  But it will take a long time for Intel to lose their dominance, even if it's warranted.  \n\nKeep in mind the just had a blowout quarter.  Companies pay them $73 billion a year for what is essentially melted sand.  \n\nPerhaps their blowout is due to low analyst expectations.  But that's a condition that can take a quarter or two to rectify as the analysts gradually tweak their recommendations and targets to levels where Intel will struggle or miss.  That means they could beat again next quarter.  \n\nThey now have a permanent CEO who is a numbers guy, who reported is working for peanut salary with a strong incentive to crank those numbers.\n\nYour diagnosis is they've lost their way in product architecture and design and innovation. I won't argue as I wouldn't know and your case sounds plausible.  If so, then they probably have the wrong CEO since he doesn't sound like he'd be the inspiring voice to revive the product innovation.\n\nI sense the author is a die hard AMD fan, which is fine.  But AMD having a cooler product doesn't necessarily put Intel out of business.  Coke and Pepsi continue to punch the clock and fight each other.  And AMD's multiple is so out of whack that they probably need to crank up earnings by cranking up sales but any moves they make on price or competitiveness won't be as a monopoly; they'll be done with Intel fighting them for every inch.\n\nTo me that means even if your theory of AMD taking the crown from Intel is happening, it will be a slow moving coup.",

This is what India pressure looks like - you get the best deals with India if you have an Indian CEO. Trump is not the only one playing with foreign influence playing with Putin. US tech companies play with foreign influence, because mathematically and otherwise, it is too much of a coincidence that most of the top US tech companies are CEOS from India - barring those companies created by a person. Why are the boards making this non-EEOC decision? Why is it that there is no Asian, no white, no hispanic, no black, no other as CEO of these companies that rely so heavily on Indian labor or sites in India that drive down cost?

What has so fundamentally changed that the long-term historic trends are now dead as dinosaurs?\n\nWhile all of those things you listed are advantages, they aren't advantages that weren't available to the large caps of the previous century. There was a time when IBM, T, XOM, GE, GM, JNJ, etc., seemed unstoppable large caps that could never be toppled from their top 10 positions, and yet they eventually were. \n\nMSFT and AAPL started out small to mid caps. Of course, not every small cap is going to turn into an MSFT or AAPL, or even 1 out of a 1000, but if the argument is that we should only buy stocks once they are large and established, isn't that also saying wait until they are more expensive?",

Reaching out and trying to better your future sounds pretty smart to me.\n\nOn average the S&amp;P500 increases about 8-10% annually. Look up SPY and VOO ETFs, which track the S&amp;P500 (500 biggest companies on the US stock market). People are usually better off buying and holding those than picking individual stocks. At that rate of return, you might expect between 59-75k if you invest $100/month for 20 years due to compound interest.\n\nAlso, 53 isnt too late for you! You have another 20-30 years left statistically, possibly more with medical advancements. A lot of great people didn't make it big until their 50s.

Such tectonic shifts - if real - can take a very long time.  \n\nThere used to be a saying \"nobody ever got fired for picking IBM\". It took decades for that rule to fade.  The same is true of Intel.  AMD may indeed be crushing it on tech, and winning customers one at a time.  But it will take a long time for Intel to lose their dominance, even if it's warranted.  \n\nKeep in mind the just had a blowout quarter.  Companies pay them $73 billion a year for what is essentially melted sand.  \n\nPerhaps their blowout is due to low analyst expectations.  But that's a condition that can take a quarter or two to rectify as the analysts gradually tweak their recommendations and targets to levels where Intel will struggle or miss.  That means they could beat again next quarter.  \n\nThey now have a permanent CEO who is a numbers guy, who reported is working for peanut salary with a strong incentive to crank those numbers.\n\nYour diagnosis is they've lost their way in product architecture and design and innovation. I won't argue as I wouldn't know and your case sounds plausible.  If so, then they probably have the wrong CEO since he doesn't sound like he'd be the inspiring voice to revive the product innovation.\n\nI sense the author is a die hard AMD fan, which is fine.  But AMD having a cooler product doesn't necessarily put Intel out of business.  Coke and Pepsi continue to punch the clock and fight each other.  And AMD's multiple is so out of whack that they probably need to crank up earnings by cranking up sales but any moves they make on price or competitiveness won't be as a monopoly; they'll be done with Intel fighting them for every inch.\n\nTo me that means even if your theory of AMD taking the crown from Intel is happening, it will be a slow moving coup.",

My only advice is to cut your losses and don't be ashamed or afraid to ask for help, even if it's reaching out to your fellow autists. I got crushed last fall chasing losses after CRM had their earnings call early and wrecked me. First people to reach out were people here. Messages, comments, all that.

That said, COVID19 is positioned to fuck us all with a Theta crush.

The majority of their contracts are with large corporations that aren't going to stop using their service during a recession.  Many companies have much of their infrastructure built through these platforms. They aren't going to just kill them, unless they are completely closing up shop for good. \n\nThey won't see as many new investments during a recession, but they aren't going to lose much in the way of customers, and some companies may use this time to spend on internal projects. I was surprised they ever were taking much of a hit in this crash to begin with. If you can get them cheap, I would.",

Beyond being annualized contracts (and, in fact, usually 3 year contracts on auto-renewal) the kinds of implementations that use these tech's are generally boutique hand-built custom things. That's the entire point of Square's API in many ways. Most of the companies which use these tech's are the kinds that do major tech upgrades/replatforming every 10-20 years or so. People who bought into Salesforce in 2008 are probably in the market for smth new, but people who bought into Square will probably stay with their current implementations until at least 2030.",

The consensus seems to be that the CDC made some bad decisions early on, including developing their own ineffectual [Coronavirus test](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/01/health-officials-probe-coronavirus-cdc-118523). I am sure that we will see a considerable uptick in cases within the next two weeks across North America. If the Fed lowers interest rates this week, it will be a critical error to do so simply to quell a bearish market.\n\nI think that while investors cry at the Fed and markets rise in the early hours of the 2nd, buy month-long puts in manufacturing and tourism sectors. This bull market is not going down without a fight.\n\nSo...  \nPut - $LVS, 3/20, $57.5  \nCall - $SOXL 3/20, $350\n\nDon\u2019t be like me and cling on to CRM and V calls from last week.\n\n[Positions (and why you should take my thoughts with a grain of salt)](https://imgur.com/gallery/QHNbNrw)",

Furthermore, if you expect the price to go down further you would be good to buy a put contract on Cisco. \n\nIf you want to hang on to your shares of Cisco because you expect them to go up, but want \"insurance\" against that, you could also buy a put contract in case the price goes down.",

Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",
