The worlds gonna need billions of these things, and these are the industry leaders capable of and have already started stockpiling supplies for this surge in demand. \n\nAny thoughts and input?",

Among other things (like gorilla glass for cell phones) they're making vials for the vaccines and more specifically, the standard vials won't work at such low temperatures so they've developed new ones.**\n\nFrom NBC news:\n&gt;\"Standard glass vials will shatter in the extreme cold needed to preserve the doses, so glass manufacturer Corning has partnered with the government to create a special line, for which production is \u201cramping up to address any supply shortages that may emerge,\u201d spokeswoman Gabrielle Bailey told NBC News in an email.\"\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/pfizer-readies-herculean-effort-distribute-coronavirus-vaccine-n1247147\n\nFrom Reuters (back in June):\n&gt;\"Glass maker Corning Inc GLW.N said on Tuesday it would receive $204 million from the U.S. government to boost the manufacturing capacity of its vials that will be used to store coronavirus vaccines and treatments.\"\n\n&gt;\"The funding from BARDA will go towards scaling up production of the company\u2019s \u2018Valor Glass\u2019, which is designed to minimize contamination and could potentially speed up manufacturing processes.\nThe company signed a long-term agreement in May with Pfizer Inc PFE.N, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, for the glass vials. Pfizer said they would be used for some existing sterile injectable drugs and a range of new products.\"\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-corning/corning-wins-u-s-funding-to-boost-vial-output-for-covid-19-vaccines-idUSKBN23G1YY",

They had a backlog of orders during pandemic due to unable to transport stuff from China to here. \n\nThe prime competitors are Lenovo and DELL who are doing better than HPQ.\n\nHp split into HPQ and HPE..

        "body": "If I were you I'd buy HPQ below $15. The consumer market has very small margins for the companies. Given that big corporations are hit with COVID19. They won't spend money on updating the consumer hardware. Previously worked for the big companies and I can tell you they had cycles for updates but when the economy got ugly, people were forced to used their laptops for 4+ years which usually means the laptop have problems but because of funds users were left struggling. Unless HPQ has some ground breaking products out there not sure they are worth all that. AAPL on the other hand might be a better bet as they have the iPhone which basically is still running strong. I would buy AAPL before HPQ.",
