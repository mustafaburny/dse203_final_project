If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not loaned out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting. Here's some information on what I know:\n\nRH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not... Maybe try to contact them, good luck with that...\n\nFidelity - Fully Paid Lending, must have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.\n\nETrade - Fully Paid Lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.\n\nIB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.\n\nWebull - Stock Lending Income Plan, must opt in, they pick stocks to short, you must leave the program to get stocks back unless they are returned. You should probably contact them.\n\nSchwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.\n\nTD - Looks like TD loans your shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares.
