        "body": "One reason is that they aren\u2019t static indexes. They are dynamic survivor bias indexes. What does that mean? \n\nIt means they replace losers with winners. Go look at the Dow or S&amp;P components from 1980 and see how the castoffs have fared. \n\nFor the Dow, changes used to be VERY rare. From 1959-1976 there were ZERO changes. \n\nNow? It changes its components several times\na year. \n\nIf it didn\u2019t keep doing this, it wouldn\u2019t \u201cperform\u201d\nNearly as well.\n\nLook at how shitty GE has done over the past three years. They used to be THE corporate bellwether of the US economy. But GE\u2019s plunge didn\u2019t hurt the Dow at all. It was removed as a component in the middle of 2018. \n\nIn March of 2015 the Dow added Apple to replace AT&amp;T (once so big and fearful it had to be busted up by regulators, but is now a dogshit dividend stock). That one change alone did wonders for the Dow average. \n\nIn Sept 2013, Nike, Goldman Sachs, and Visa replaced such dogs as Hewlett-Packard and Alcoa.\n\nIn 2009, Cisco Systems replaced GM.\n\nAnyways, you get the point. The Dow and S&amp;P, by definition, will always go up over time. They will simply drop dog sticks with no future and replace them with up and coming stalwarts. \n\nI\u2019ve often looked, but have never found, a report that would show how the Dow and S&amp;P would have performed if they didn\u2019t modify their components and always stack the decks. \n\nTLDR: the Dow and S&amp;P change the component stocks to always contain far more winners than losers. They will rise over time. They don\u2019t reflect the more broad stock market as a whole, nor do they reflect how the average American family is doing economically. They just reflect a basket of \u201cwinning\u201d stocks.",

Today's HPQ price is the same as was in April 2000.\n\nHPQ made several ill fated acquisitions over the years including Compaq, EDS, and 3Com.  HPQ always bought companies that looked promising on the surface, but consistently failed to deliver on the bottom line.  That pattern of bad decision making remains to this day.  Look how they failed to create two distinctive company names when they spun off HPE.  Both HPQ and HPE are named Hewlett Packard, LOL.  It is staggering how stupid their leadership is.\n\nHPQ is also married to its desktop, laptop, and printing businesses to the exclusion of almost everything else.  These are mature, low profit product lines.  It is not a growth business.  In short, HPQ has been dead money for 20 years and is going nowhere.",

And when people think of 2000, they think of pets.com being ridiculous. Those shit companies were not in any index and pets.com was 300-400 million market cap at its peak (which it held for a very short time). You can equate pets.com to companies like NKLA which make gravity powered trucks. NKLA was ~ 30B market cap at its peak -- and it's still worth 5B+. Pets.com actually had a business / revenue, tons of SPACs are little more than post series A companies, all of them worth well over a billion.\n\nThe \"real\" megacap tech companies of 2000 were hewlett packard, microsoft, ibm, csco, intel, sun, compaq, etc. Their P/E ratios are much closer to the FAANGs of today. And most of the peak P/E ratios happened after a series of bad earnings.\n\nThe only thing that is legitimately different now than before is low interest rates. Which is why inflation / fed reaction is a genuine serious fear.",

It sounds like you have a relatively conservative investment philosophy and prefer not to make big early stage bets (which is perfectly fine/logical).\n\nMeanwhile, Google, Amazon, Samsung, Lockheed Martin, Bosch, Hewlett Packard, Airbus, Softbank, Bill Gates, Michael Dell and numerous others are playing a different game and not heeding your advice to wait to invest until after such a milestone is met.\n\nThose waiting to buy into Tesla at or below their 2010 IPO-week low never got the chance (Tesla's valuation after the first trading day was $2.22bn...they had sold just 1,063 cars at that point and their critics/doubters were many). The returns for those who waited until they hit certain milestones were still decent, but they were orders of magnitude lower than those who got in during the week after IPO.",

NKLA tanked but it has no correlation to the overall stock market, and the whole stock market went up in fact. Same with the entire SPAC bubble. Yes it was a bubble, but it popped and the market moved on its way without missing a beat. \n\n&gt; The \"real\" megacap tech companies of 2000 were hewlett packard, microsoft, ibm, csco, intel, sun, compaq, etc. Their P/E ratios are much closer to the FAANGs of today.

MSFT in it's peak in 1999 had a PE ratio of ~82, it now has a PE ratio of ~35. \n\nI'm not gonna say that *every* company today is fine. Many are not (including NKLA). But the 2000 was endemic throughout the market (i.e. say \"internet\" and stock 10x'd at ipo). Today the market is much more varied and plenty of companies trading at high multiples do so because they're growth is very real.\n\nSorta unrelated but I personally believe tech got an insane boost from covid which is/will be driving huge digitalization efforts and  accelerate growth for many saas/cloud centric companies.",

By accurately estimating the magnitude of the future tidal wave they can calibrate their CETO device to generate a lot more energy from the wave (I still don\u2019t understand how that works)\n\nFor a micro cap penny stock I think their future outlook is actually pretty good. They have a contract to power one of Australia\u2019s largest naval bases, they got a $50 million grant from Microsoft to help develop the CETO tech (and I think they get help from Microsoft\u2019s ML devs too), and I know they have a contract with Hewlett-Packard. They also are debt free I am pretty sure and recently increased their cash reserves. \n\nI just love the fact I own 109k shares for like 200 dollars lol and the whole predicting future tidal waves thing I think is cool as fuck\n\nIf you wanna learn more about them this sub is very tiny but people talk about the company on r/CarnegieCleanEnergy",
