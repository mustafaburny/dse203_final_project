Bought in back when AMD was trading just under $40.\n\nI have 3 cash secured puts on AMD at $45 exp end of Febuary.\n\n10 QCOM $85 C exp 2021. Bought when QCOM was at $90 a while ago, just letting it ride I'm at a decent loss on them right now, but it'll come back.\n\nI've gotten bitten writing puts on QCOM, but selling calls has worked wonderfully for me. I got exercised a few weeks ago on 200 shares at $90. I'm waiting for a dip to $85 to buy shares back, I'm not bothering to write puts since I make it a point not to play earnings.\n\n20 SPCE $20 C Exp 2021, bought in at $13. I had 30, sold 10 at $18. Planning on selling off another 10 when it bumps to $22 and then ride my remaining out to exp or roll into further leaps.\n\nThat's all I'm doing in options at the moment, I have most of my portfolio in stocks.",
