ASML has a monopoly on the EUV but they are limited by the supplier's capacity (you can't make as many as you'd like). This is the same as the TSM problem. One thing to remember, semiconductor is a cyclical business and won't go up forever. When oversupply/stockage happens, it will last for a few quarters. Most of these stocks will pull back. I don't expect them to have any oversupply until possibly at the earliest, late 2022 however. Watch the capex as usually that indicates expansion in the industry.\n\nFyi, I work for process dev. engineer in a fab for 6 years. If my opinion matters to you.",

It has some volatility but ultimately goes back up and prints (I call it my boring \"shovel\" stock; it saved me during the recent red days, lol). If you're interested in NVDA/AMD etc, you should look into LRCX, AMAT, or ASML (but wait for dips). I also think MSFT and AAPL are still good buys on dip days but can understand the reluctance.",

One thing to remember, semiconductor is a cyclical business and won't go up forever. When oversupply/stockage happens, it will last for a few quarters. Most of these stocks will pull back. I don't expect them to have any oversupply until possibly at the earliest, late 2022 however.

I know the Army swears allegiance to the CCP instead of the nation. That the CCP rules as the please from Zhongnanhai without regard to laws.  They are content to practice hostage diplomacy like they did with the two Michael's to free Meng Wanzhou and they seem confused when western counties can't simply disregard the courts and do as they please like China. That the Belt and Road initiative is just neo colonialism to steal resources and strategic ports from poor nations. That the Uighurs face slave labor and genocide by controlling birth rates and harvesting organs like Falun Gong practitioners. \n\nChina is not a free, fair, or open market. Ask Jack Ma who got disappeared by them. Look at their national security laws, and how they annex neighborhoods and force their will on them. How they alter maps and globes to include the 9 dash line and pretend it is part of Chinese territory like the Scarborough shoal despite court rulings.\n\nSo tell me how elections matter when China can decide who is on the ballot to prevent a true opposition and use the national security law to disappear opposition?\n\nCall me a typical American, but my eyes are open to the actions of the CCP.",

The benefit they have in the long run in owning the hardware, software, and network, is that they can eliminate Visa and MasterCard from the equation.  If someone uses the Cash app to buy directly from a SQ terminal, the could reduce the charge from 2-3% (of which they get a small cut) to 0-5-1% (of which they get all).  SQ wins, merchant wins, but V and MC lose on such a transaction. PayPal is trying to build a similar network, but doesn\u2019t have as much traction with in person terminals.",

You may get lucky and expect the expected and it happens just as planned, but most often, the big players are contrarian to the market itself, meaning that if you think A is likely and a million people think A is likely, then B is almost guaranteed to happen (unless enough contrarians think B will happen, then probably C)\n\nTraders don't play the game fairly. They just harvest money from betting against the most number of people.",

        "body": "Valuing a stock is really difficult and it often boils down to a lot of different assumptions.  Even experts are routinely wrong, so keep that in mind.  What I do for one company normally takes 3-5 hours, and I try to do it quarterly for any company I own.\n\nI will usually start by collecting the company's past, current and future valuation metrics.  Things like price to sales, price to earnings, price to forward earnings, debt ratios, etc.  I compare the 5 year averages to what they currently are.  I also do for their competitors and companies in the same financial space (for example, I'd look at Visa, Mastercard, and other card companies together).  I look at past growth and projected growth to see if I think the valuations are justifiable where they currently are.\n\nI look through the financial statements and try to spot trends in cash flow, debt, margin, and many other things to see how the company is performing yoy and qoq.\n\nI look at how the company is engaging with the industry and where they are projecting their growth to come from.  Are the expanding market share, is the sector growing, etc.  I need the company to justify why it can achieve or surpass their growth estimates.\n\nI listen to their most recent conference calls and look though any articles I can find, but I heavily discount opinion pieces.  I actively seek out reasons why this company will fail.\n\nAfter all of this, I try to put together a balanced view of where the company is valued now vs historically and also vs their competition.  It requires a lot of projection and assumptions and I only do it for companies that I can understand their business model.  You have to go into the process without bias, and to be honest the majority of companies that I do this for aren't buys at the time.",

        "body": "Tesla has insane margins on their EVs and its clear that those margins are growing. The competition needs to sell 3+ EVs for every 1 that Tesla sells. And on top of that, Tesla produces cars in 1/3rd the time. Some OEMs are not profitable at all and each EV sold is a loss.\n\nAlso Tesla has car sales back logged for 6 months!\n\nAnd a simple youtube search of FSD 10.3 shows dozens of reviews and drives of the general public. Meanwhile the competition only reveals company videos of their absolute best drives.\n\nHow about autonomous distribution?\nHow many self driving cars can the competition roll out to with these geofenced cars that need lidar and radar? Compare that to Tesla, which can push an over the air update and sell FSD to millions in an instant.\n\nPeople keep calling Tesla just a car company, but what other car company is the:\n\nMajority part Supplier\nDealership\nFuel provider\nMicrochip maker\nAI developer\nSoftware developer",

        "body": "&gt; in fact im fairly certain all of our parts are manufactured on US soil\n\nDown to what level though? Not many of the basic electronic components everything else is built from are made in the US. American companies like Vishay, Microchip, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx either operate factories in China or contract foundries in China or Taiwan. Other large supplies of ours are not even American such as Yageo and TE Connectivity aren't even headquartered in the US and manufacturer the bulk of their product in their home country. It's been a big issue for my portion of the defense industry the past couple of years because these factories in China are also sourcing a large portion of counterfeit electronic components on the market.\n\nI know we're not the only defense manufacturer using Chinese components because I've seen several news articles and reports from the DOD claiming this is a problem.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/10/us-military-reliance-china-foreign-suppliers-expos/\n\nPanasonic and Murata (Japanese) used to produce critical components of our products, but have since stopped selling to us because they don't want their products used in munitions. When that happened the government fronted a lot of money to a couple American companies to produce an alternative since none existed.",
