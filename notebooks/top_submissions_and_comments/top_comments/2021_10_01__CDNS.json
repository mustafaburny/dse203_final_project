A huge part of acting is how the actors are saying their dialogue - cadence, inflection, etc. Those things carry over for a lot of viewers even if the language being spoken is foreign.\n\nNow if it's a dumb action movie, where explosions and car chases are the point, then I can see dubs being same as subs, maybe even better. But the acting and dialogue are huge part of squid game.\n\nObviously knowing Korean fluently is probably the best way to experience this show. But outside of that, subs with original audio definitely beat dubs experience wise.",
