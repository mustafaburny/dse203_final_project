Most US content platforms are banned in China, including Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, Youtube, Reddit, Netflix; it is more than reasonable to expect trade reciprocity.\n\nDivesting sounds good, but because of Chinese laws, divesting from China is always inherently a two part process in order to be meaningful: a company has to (1) divest from the Chinese parent company AND (2) divest from the CCP's jurisdictional control. In other words, even Tik Tok is now owned by Microsoft, it would need to move its engineering out of China in order for its platform to be divested from the CCP\u2019s jurisdictional control. Otherwise, it will face similar quandary as Zoom &amp; will  be subject to CCP's intel requests.\n\nMain downside is inconveniencing US Tik Tok users. To be clear, POTUS (regardless of who is Prez) does have exec authority to enact a suspension under the IEEPA-- this is no different than precedent on other sanctions. India did this &amp; the sky didn't fall.\n\nTLDR: Tik Tok sale good for CCP",

Date them later if you are concerned. Firstly, the same thing happened after weak Q2 guidance last year and Intel proceeded to skyrocket 30% after bottoming around 45. Secondly, Intel relies on less than 25% of revenue from chip manufacturing. In addition they have double digit YOY growth 10+ years in a row, and they have beaten earnings both quarters this year. Finally, they have 18 BILLION in free cash flow. This company could be a disorganized mess for the next 10 years and still be valued highly just from how strong their financial spreadsheet is.

In addition, a substantial majority of our free customers historically have not converted to paying customers and we expect this will continue in the future.\n2. The term of our current agreement with Baidu expires at the end of 2020. Since the on-going tensions between US and China might have an affect on this agreement.\n3. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\n4. Sales and Marketing Expenses are increasing at a rapid pace\n5. Their competitors are well established and they always pose a threat, see below the list of them in each domain\n   1. On-premise hardware network vendors, such as Cisco Systems Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., FireEye, Inc., Imperva, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., and Riverbed Technology, Inc.;\n   2. Point-cloud solution vendors, including cloud security vendors such as Zscaler, Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. through Umbrella (formerly known as OpenDNS), content delivery network vendors such as Akamai Technologies, Inc., Limelight Networks, Inc., Fastly, Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc. through Edgecast, domain name system vendors services such as Oracle Corporation through DYN, NeuStar, Inc., and UltraDNS Corporation, and cloud SD-WAN vendors\n   3.

Cloudflare and google collectively did a research on Browser Isolation. Even though, the results weren't promising, they are working towards it.   \n\n\nAlso, a key point to note is, Cloudflare leverages the idle network bandwidth to provide the free service to their customers since the highest priority is given to enterprise customers. By doing so, they were able to increase their exposure as well as establish more routes that been said, they want these customers to at least go for pay-as-you-go subscription which might help Cloudflare in terms of revenue.",

        "body": "This was EXACTLY what I was thinking. I was about to post this today in the morning.\n\nWith earnings on August 12 after market, here's the CISCO earnings run-up play for you.\n\nCisco is the biggest network hardware provider of the world, but they've been heavily expanding into software and subscription based services (think continual revenue and high margin). Cisco primarly sells network hardware like those little white boxes (access points) you randomly see on the ceiling in schools. It's so hard to describe what Cisco does because its reach is too far and too wide, but here goes nothing.\n\n1. Networking hardware\n\nMost expensive hardware (network switches, access points, and even office phones). They're also the biggest brand. Competitors include Arista, Juniper, Extreme Networks. They all released earnings and beat expectations. Arista did go down after earnings, but it had a really nice run-up and this is a run-up play. \n\n2. Cisco Webex - Webconferencing\n\nProbably the biggest reason for growth is Cisco's Webex. While Zoom and to a lesser extent Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have taken over webconferencing, there's plenty of pie to go around and that's where Webex has come in. From what I researched, it's not particularly great, but it's better than nothing. They tripled growth in WebEx from February to April according to their last earnings report. It's the most related search topic that's trending for Cisco.\n\n3. Cisco Anyconnect - Connect to work network\n\nWith work from home still very much a thing, workers need a secure way to connect to the hospital, college, or business networks. That's where Cisco Anyconnect VPN comes in. I'd say Honestly, there's not really much competition in this area.\n\n4. Security - Cisco Duo and Umbrella\n\nCisco has MFA (multi-factor authentification) for password security. This is taking over more and more especially in universities as you've probably had to annoyingly authenticate logging in using your phone. Cisco Umbrella helps businesses filter websites that are known to have malware. You probably know it as filtering gambling and porn websites. \n\n5. Institutional Ownership\n\nDidn't dig too deep here but Raymond James and Associates are making a big bet on it.  Cisco is their second biggest bet of the quarter after Apple. In the previous quarter, they held a total of 14,069,764 shares (through shares and calls) and now have 15,048,139 (through shares and calls). Since they've bought it, the price has not increased much so they definitely seem to believe in the growth here.\n\n6. Pricing\n\nCisco is still trading slightly below its pre-covid price of 49. It did well last earnings with 0.79 EPS and now it's expected to do 0.74 EPS this quarter. Comparatively, most of its competitors have already seen pre-covid prices at some point or another. \n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:\\*\\* 48C - Aug 21. Sell before earnings. (Hold through at your own risk.)\n\nDisclaimer: I am the furthest thing from a professional of any kind.",

These were big profitable even mature internet companies and all are still profitable and around doing well, but at much lower stock prices even now.  Yep, Sun Microsystems was trading at 10 times sales when it was at $60 and long term before and after it was a really good profitable company and a solid $3-5 stock.  BTW, if you take a look at how long it was at $60 (about a week), I had a friend that was an exec and sold his entire holdings (1 mm shares) at $60.   So there were people that made a lot of money in the Dot Com era but they were the ones that sold at the top.
