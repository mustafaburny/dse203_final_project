        "body": "If you're investing in dividends for \"reliable\" income, diversification is crucial. Companies can and do cut their dividend, sometimes even when they can still afford to pay it. For example, Western Digital suspended their dividend in March 2020 to focus on reducing debt and investing back in the company, and it remains suspended even as their profits have resumed.\n\nOwning a fund like VYM and/or VIG provides significant diversification. That way during recessions you might see a 25% reduction in dividend income if things are really bad, vs if you invested in a single stock you might see a 100% reduction.",
