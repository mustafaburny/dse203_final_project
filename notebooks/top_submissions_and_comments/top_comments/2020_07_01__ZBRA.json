        "body": "Wanna feel better? Let me help!\n\nI put my nose to the grindstone at 18, graduated with honors from college in 4 years, top 10% of my med school class 4 years after that, completed my residency 4 years after that. Walked out of residency at age 30 as an eye surgeon and started seeing patients at my own practice 3 days out of residency. I was probably no shit the youngest solo practice ophthalmologist in the country for a moment there.\n\nHated it. Wished every day that I hadn't worked so hard the entirety of my 20s. Hated that I was caught in a field that is high stress and has to deal with demanding patients. Hated that I owed a huge sum of money for school and the business loan. Hated that I'll only ever get rich one patient at a time.\n\nA day off costs me about $2k now. I can't outsource or automate anything, can't scale up, just have to see each patient and do each case and take less money as reimbursement gets cut every year. At 35, I still owe six figures on my business loan (though I'll probably clear it next year).\n\nWhat you were doing is my dream. My own hours? No patients or insurance companies to answer to? No surgical complications or bad outcomes! I consistently am putting a huge chunk of my pay into the market hoping to be able to quit this job and do what you did. I'd rather be trading than operating. I'm a top tier cataract surgeon with a high volume, and I'll need to work for 5-10 years to get to where you were. Grass is always greener, friend.\n\nEdit: Buy ZBRA LEAPs. Jan 2022, but they ain't cheap. Thank me later.",

It's important to start early because it's going to feel like 105 degrees in northern Virginia the next few days. I have to weed the dahlia beds. Then the sunflowers and zinnias. The orchard needs pruning, and we need to widen the deer fences because the branches have grown. Then I'm going to stake the tomatoes. They've just started fruiting, and they're the right height. They're late, because even our nights have been hot, and cool nights are vital for nightshade fruiting. But they're beautiful, healthy plants. We have Sweet 100s and Better Boys for hybrids, and Brandywine, Mortgage Lifter, and Green Zebra for heirlooms.\n\nThen, at 3:30, I'm going to open my app and sell my 10 bagger SPY puts.\n\nOr not. At least I have tomatoes to look forward to.",
