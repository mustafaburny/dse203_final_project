Key is looking to what can survive and thrive without a vaccine while avoiding those that need a vaccine to reopen. People will eventually need to get their haircuts for example, but how do we open them safely. Does that mean a microchip or digital ID, or more testing for anti-bodies showing immunity before the vaccine is officially released? What happens we the virus mutates? Think about security issues to get business back up and running. I work from home myself, and likely will for a couple more months. That means I drive less, and grocery shop in bulk to avoid multiple trips. Spending and travel patterns have changed, and will remain for a while. Was planning a trip to California in April, but obviously had to cancel, so will I be able to go on vacation in September? We don't know, and that impacts a lot of business that relies on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe need to start thinking differently since all the old business models are no longer in play. All the trends for 2020 at the beginning, are upset over this black swam event. Look to the web bots who monitor conversations for trending topics. Thoughts become things. First it's thought, then spoken, or written and discussed on the web, and then acted upon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's going to be a crazy year, and my one piece of advice is prepare, and get your house in order.

        "body": "I agree with most of this. Although, It\u2019s skewed to be negative. Businesses expenses being used as a complaint to counter marketshare gains? JCP will be a good stock option for you, as there business expenses will be zero by end of year. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t ever consider buying ZM, but I want to point out that AMZN wasn\u2019t profitable for several years the company existed. I remember in 2012 it had a P/E over 3500. At around 250 it would that would have been a great investment. \n\nCOST just reported 1.5 billion YOY revenue increase for March. I think that this leans in the direction of it\u2019s not merely e-commerce. \n\nDisney+ (DIS) reported recently it has over 50 million subscribers as of 2 months ago being around 20. \n\nWorking from home requires additional security. You are vastly under playing the business required for this. Home based networks can make confidential information more vulnerable. PAWN and CSCO both stand to benefit from this. (Carbonite mcafee, etc). There is also additional companies that help provide a safe portal (NTAP, CSCO, MSFT) to access the infrastructure. The servers networks need built (INTC, AMD, NVDA) and then stored (DLR). Then maintained (JNPR CSCO). \n\nBeyond al of that Stock market is speculative. I speculate this is a great country and we have great people in this country that will pull through and make it a better place to live. \n\nGood luck to you sir, you are your family stay safe.",
