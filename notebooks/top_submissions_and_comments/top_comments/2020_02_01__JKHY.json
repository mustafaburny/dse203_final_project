If everyone went to a school where the schools objective was to make sure kids were prepared to approach problems and people logically and reasonably, and deal with simple common day occurrences, items, and tasks, then the world would be exponentially better. A car is an item you use everyday, you should have basic knowledge of how it works. Microsoft excell is something you have a high probability of using, regardless of what job you do, you should have a basic knowledge of you to use it. To be successful in life you have to interact with other people, you should learn the basics of how people think and react to things, and how to be part of a functioning society. I could go on and on but this kind of thing really gets me riled up cause schools fail at literally everything they should be doing 99% if the time. You can take all the shop classes you want in life but if the goal of the class is not aligned with the goal of the school, then the results will be underwhelming everytime.\n\n\ud83d\ude2aI hope one day society un-fucks itself and decides to start helping the 99% ofkids that are not going to be reading moby dick and doing Boolean calculus everyday.

        "body": "You\u2019ll be fine. The best time to start was yesterday and the next best time is now. At least you\u2019re thinking about investing. \n\nI got into investing early on but didn\u2019t start taking it seriously until later. It took going through the School of Hard Stocks for me to really understand both the importance and benefits of investing. When I first started investing I tried it all. Day trading, penny stocks (also tried day trading these. Hah), stock picking, bio tech, forex, options, etc. I also had unrealistic expectations, and I think this was primarily driven by the fact that when I first started, I didn\u2019t have much money to invest. I remember seeing a 1% drop early on and panicking (which resulted in me selling)! I also remember looking at sector specific penny stocks and thinking, \u201cWell, if Microsoft is trading for $40 per share, surely this other software company that\u2019s trading at $1 per share will eventually get to $40!\u201d For some reason, those stocks never panned out. Hmm.\n\nAs I got a bit wiser (or so I thought), I went to an Edward Jones and talked to one of their investment advisors. He put me in a fund that had an extremely high expense ratio and didn\u2019t generate much in the way of returns. I ended up pulling out my money and firing the advisor, as I didn\u2019t find much value there. Another loss on my end. \n\nThen I thought that hey, I can trade off of candles and indicators. So I went and purchased a bunch of books and started studying. This proved to be fruitful but it still wasn\u2019t getting me to the place I wanted to be. Again, my expectations were that I could just plug in $1,000 into the market and have it turn into $2,000 in a few days. Not thinking about how insane a 100% return in a few days would be. Needless to say, this didn\u2019t work out either.\n\nAs time progressed, I was introduced to bogleheads, where I learned about a 3-fund portfolio. I then read everything I could about index investing and started to get a grasp on the importance of investing in a routine fashion. \n\nFast forward to today and while I still run a 3-fund portfolio for the long term in my retirement accounts, I treat my other investment accounts differently. With the advent of fractional shares (first with motif, and now with M1), I\u2019ve been able to run a portfolio of 8-15 high conviction equities which I weight against each other to generate alpha. This has worked best for me. Presently, my CAGR is over 35% and my drawdowns are less than 15% month-over-month. I change my portfolio around every couple of years, but for the most part I don\u2019t mess with it and I just contribute to it every paycheck. The hardest part about all of this was believing in myself and my ideas. Giving myself room to make mistakes and learning from it all. \nAlso treating investing as a process in which starts slowly but grows over time. \n\nAs securities investing is largely personal, and outside of the echo chamber of \u201c3 fund is the only way to go.\u201d, its hard  to find alternative investment advice. The best thing that I can tell you is to just stay the course and be patient, especially if you\u2019re planning on purchasing individual securities. \n\nPortfolio Visualizer is also an invaluable tool where you can plug in the equities you want and see how they all play with each other. \n\nGood luck! Enjoy the journey. If you ever need help feel free to reach out.",

As others have said, when it\u2019s in a 401K it\u2019s effectively just numbers on a screen.\n\nRobinhood account options, I made 35k from 2k on LK a couple months ago. That was actually life changing as I\u2019m essentially living paycheck to paycheck. I paid off all of my debts and have been shoveling a couple thousand a month profits from additional RH profits into my bank account lately. My day to day life is exactly the same though. I don\u2019t spend any more or any less than I did before. \n\nI do find myself buying options on a whim more often and losing 2 to 3k per play. But then I\u2019ll hit another 8k or 10k option play that works out and I end up a little bit again. It works until it doesn\u2019t. \n\nPart of me really wanted to put the remainder of my RH account on Microsoft earnings calls next week. So, there\u2019s that. Definitely have a gambling problem.

Since your goal is to be in the market for the long term, your safest and simplest way to diversify your portfolio is to invest on ETFs.\n\nThe popular ETFs are SPY and VOO which tracks the S&amp;P500 and the QQQ which is a technology heavy sector that tracks companies like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, and FB. Then you should add ETFs that round out your portfolio with dividends such as VYM: High-Dividend Yield Index Fund and SPHD: Invesco S&amp;P500 High-Dividend Los Volatility ETF.\n\nThis will serve you a good backbone for the foreseeable future. Also you can invest in VTI, VT, VNQ, XLY, BND, SMH, and GLD to have a breadth of ETFs. The only downside of ETF route is the small fees, but other than that it provides you convenience and diversification for the average retail investor. By the power of compounding interest, you should theoretically increase your gains at the market rate of 5-7% per year in the conservative scenario. Since your time horizon is 20 years, I doubt you will have much problem to recover from a recession. I recommend a brokerage that allows you to DRIP and purchase fractional shares such as M1 Finance or Fidelity, you can also choose the retirement path (Roth IRA) if you plan to buy and hold stocks for a long time. Saves you some tax money in the long run but penalizes you if you withdraw before retirement age.",

If you have nerves of steel, then having the mindset of that you'll keep those shares until at least college might help you hold on and not panic when (not if) the price dips 5, maybe 10 percent below whatever you buy it for.  That would give time for the price to recover and hopefully pull ahead to give you a net return.",

Even some permabulls could benefit from puts on companies that rely heavily on China.\n\n* Even if we moon on news of containment/treatment, ER won't justify the numbers we're currently sitting at.

SPXL won\u2019t go to 0 unless the SP500 crashes 33%+. \n\nThere was a guy on investing and WSB who put 100k into SPXL in 2009 and it\u2019s now over 1 million.

However, When things calm down and USD/CNY goes down, I would expect FXI to actually shoot up faster than SPY (percentage wise). Most investment houses seem to expect USD to come down in 2020, which would actually be bullish for FXI.\n\nBUT! While the Coronavirus fears are worsening, FXI puts. There are tons of optimistic news out now about a \u201ccure...\u201d I personally think if you\u2019re not in it already, you\u2019re already a bit late to the party. \n\nIf SPY goes back to the 327/329 area next week (perhaps late Monday/Tuesday), I would buy puts on SPY rather than FXI.\n\nEDIT: I might be totally wrong too.

The price has more than doubled in 6 months. 100% of the time that Tesla\u2019s stock has had upward moves that large it had at the very least a 10-20% decline following. That means if you sold now and price still continued up to $700 and then decline 20% you could buy back at $550. However, imo, since Tesla is now at an all time low of short sellers and is being priced at a 3x multiple of GM stock. It is likely to eventually return to and retest support at $400 before continuing its trend higher. Most will not agree with me but people typically don\u2019t agree with bearish views at tops. Just like when it gets back to $400 everyone will say not to buy even though that\u2019s the best decision to make at that price.",

So, in this instance, the spread actually was more profitable because the move wasn't very big.\n\nHowever, 5 days later on 11/13, they release initial D+ numbers and had a huge jump.

        "body": "\n&gt;I really appreciate you taking the time .....I totally see it now with my MA example. \n\nSure thing, glad you got it. I hate to see people losing money that they shouldn't have to, especially if I can help prevent it by simply helping them work out the numbers! \n\n\n&gt;I could sell the feb 7 $277.5 put and collect Friday\u2019s bid of .85 that would be premium of $850 on 1000 shares. \n\nYup, that's correct (keeping in mind that at Monday's open the prices are likely gonna be different; but you got the idea).\n\nAlso, again, I'd recommend not hitting the bid, but rather trying first at mid price or maybe even a bit better. Eg, I see a 0.85 x 0.90 market on those puts (from Friday). I'd try to sell that put for maybe 0.88 first, and then lower my price penny by penny til I get my fill. I also would lower it all the way to the bid, as I would consider I'm being completely ripped off of I have to go all the way there (unless I had a very strong need to do it, like to close a position to prevent massive losses; but not to open a new one).\n\n\n&gt;And the way to protect myself from a loss would be to close the position early before Im down \n$850 and use my premium to prevent loss ?\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure is clear - and, again, because of Put-Call parity, it applies to both a short put and a covered call trades - is that this premium you receive is not really \"a cushion\", not really a way to protect you from losses.\n\nLooking at the short put trade may actually help to see this thing I'm gonna talk about more clearly, but remember the exact same thing applies to CC, just maybe a bit harder to see as things are a bit less explicit.\n\nOnce you sell that put, you don't \"make 850 USD\". You are making a transaction in which 850 USD are exchanged for something worth 850 USD. You have 0 profits of losses initially. So there isn't really an 850 USD cushion.\n\nYou're effectively getting 850 USD now to assume a liability valued by the market at 850 USD now. \n\nIf AAPL goes down, or if IV increases, the premium of that put is going to increase, meaning that you'll be at a loss: you'll have 850 USD cash, and a liability of more than 850 USD market value. \n\nSay AAPL moves in such a way that the put is now worth 1.00. You're at a loss of 0.15 per share, or 150 USD. You can close everything and take that 150 USD loss. More explicitly, you initially received 850 USD to assume a liability, and then you paid 1000 USD to rid yourself from that liability: a 150 USD loss. Notice that the 150 USD loss doesn't even require you to close your trade: you're at a loss simply because you have 850 USD cash and a liability worth 1000 USD cash. It's an \"unrealized loss\", which doesn't mean \"unreal loss\", it's very real! \n\nIf the position is going against you, you can close it at any time, and take (or realize) the loss. A common threshold people use in short put trades is to not let the loss become bigger than the max profit you were looking at. So in this case, this rule of thumb would lead people to close the short put by buying it back for 1.70, if it starts going that way. People usually talk about this by saying stuff like \"close for a loss at 2x the premium received\". \n\nSo this way of \"protection\" is really just getting out of the position - at a loss! - in order to prevent the losses from possibly getting bigger, much bigger. Sometimes people resist it thinking that they may want to hold longer \"to see if it comes back\": problem is, it may also go further! \n\nThere are many other ways to protect yourself, too.\n\nFor example, you could buy a put at a lower strike. It reduces your profitability, since you'll be spending part of the premium you got to acquire this protection. But it effectively limits the max you can lose. Eg if you buy the 270 put, you'll be paying around 0.62 (mid of 0.60 x 0.64 that I see here), but if AAPL tanks to, say, 250, you'll be forced to buy it for 277.5 (your short put) but you have the right to sell it for 270 (yourong put). The trade off is that now, on 10 contracts, the max profit you're looking at is 230 USD (850 USD from selling the 277.5 usd, 620 USD from buying the 270 put). **This is exactly a vertical spread.**\n\nAlternatively, you could short a bit of stock: this reduces the effect of the put increasing in value (this increasing your losses) as the stock price goes down: the profit on the short balances put some of the losses on the short put. People usually think about doing this kind of stuff when the delta of their short put gets too big and scary. Disadvantage is that if the stock moves up, you lose on the short stock position, and this loss can eventually even get bigger than the profits from shorting the put... so it has to be managed actively. **This is usually referred to as managing or hedging delta (and can be done in other ways, too, like reducing the size of the short put position, or selling OTM calls basically transforming it into a strangle, etc).**\n\nSo many possibilities...\n\nIf you want to explore more about this, check whether your trading platform has some good support for risk analysis for options. You didn't mention what it is, so I'm gonna comment on a few popular ones around here. \n\nToS has an OK tool in the Analyze tab: it works well for simple positions, it's pretty easy to use, but it simply cannot handle a more complex position with many legs without slowing down to the point where it becomes unresponsive for 10s of seconds.\n\nIB has absolutely amazing support for analyzing options portfolios in the Risk Navigator tool: it can handle whatever book of option you throw at it with fantastic performance, and IMO it has an incredibly superior model to ToS's, both in terms of its default settings as well as in terms of offering incredibly powerful ways to tweak it if you want (you probably don't, at least not initially).\n\nRobinhood has nothing. Well, it calculates your \"break even\" for single legs... But frankly, I wouldn't trust even that number without verifying it myself every time as RH is just... well, it's RH. \n\nTastyworks is something I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think this aspect would've changed much, since all I see is they trying to push a \"novel\" risk analysis approach: it sucks in this area. (it emphasizes too much this notion of \"probability of profit\", which is really absurd IMO as it isn't anywhere close to reflecting risk, especially in non-trivial positions). \n\nI'll share a couple of screenshot from IB later when I get to my competition so you can get a sense of what it looks like, and how you can explore ways to possibly protect yourself from big losses.",

Why not sell an extremely otm put with a short expiration date of a stable stock like an index? Let\u2019s say you sell a out of SPY at $30 below market value that expires tomorrow. Now I know it would only be worth like $10 when it expires. But would this nearly guaranteed profit make the risk of unlimited loss worth it? I know I\u2019m probably missing some key aspect, please fill me in.",
