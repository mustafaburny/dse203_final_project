Why buy spreads at all? Why not just sell puts?\n\nA zebra is actually a better option than the spreads. It will negate nearly all extrinsic Value and give you exposure to 100 shares",

I definitely - *in no way* \\- think Dr Seuss was a racist, but the references and imagery are from a time when certain things were portrayed different from what is acceptable today. Blackface just doesn't cut it nowadays.  \n\n\nYou seem to mean well, but you've definitely come to the wrong place. I don't think there's much anyone can do, it's ***Dr. Seuss Enterprises*** decision to do what they want with their own books.",
