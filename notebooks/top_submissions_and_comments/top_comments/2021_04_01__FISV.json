Mostly your usual value names, some older tech companies and there are few currently hated companies. \nValue ones are some defence names like GD or RTX, I think they are still cheap, there are others too. Then old tech companies (but not necessarily bad ones) are HPE, JNPR, CSCO and few others. Finally hated names (I love buying hated but good companies for cheap) are INTC, GM and few others. There are some special situations too (like VRSK still hasn't fully recovered) and internationally there are interesting equities as well priced cheap. Popular names are expensive but they are popular so... But if you look outside of what people talk about on Reddit you can find some value.",

What that means is that say your stock is @100 and you sell now and pay 35% in taxes or hold it and the stock goes down to 70 anyway.  \n\nNow, the example is too simple but that\u2019s the concept.  I like what the other OP said to reset your cost basis every now and then so it becomes more manageable.  It has become a huge problem for me too.   I too have massive long LGTC &gt;500k on a stock that I\u2019m not sure I want to hold for the next 5 years just so I can sell ~100k a year to reduce taxes.\n\nYou say TODAY you want to hold MSFT for a long time but at some point, you will have to pay the taxes.  MSFT might not be around when you retire in 20-30 years.  Just because MSFT has been doing well for the last 5 years doesn\u2019t mean it will do well the next 25.   What if you had massive capital gains in Yahoo, Enron, Xom, Cisco, juniper, ibm, or GME(lol)?   Some are long gone and some have became dead money for years.",
