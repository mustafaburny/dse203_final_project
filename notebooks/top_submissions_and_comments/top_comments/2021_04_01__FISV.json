        "body": "My quick glance analysis: Slower growth than some other payment plays, while still not profitable. Also currently getting drug down along with most smaller tech &amp; anything SPAC of late so it may take a solid earnings or two to turn that sentiment around. I never looked at it closely enough to see how the deal was structured, so depending the terms it could mean some pipe dump risk yet.\n\nWith that said I think it\u2019s trading at a lower multiple now than anything in the general payments space aside from FISV, so you can see it as either undervalued or that everything else is still overvalued.",

        "body": "Love the post by OP, well put together counters, but I have the same quarrel on the comp framing to meet the bullish arguments throughout. Stagnant 2020 revenue, compare to V &amp; MA multiples but leave out that they\u2019re established blue chips who bring in 50% to the bottom line which buffers their valuation. Not profitable, compare to a bucket of companies where many just came off 50% yoy rather than stagnant growth. I\u2019d like to have seen comps, say FOUR, FISV, PayPal, &amp; NVEI, and keep them consistent throughout the counters to show where Paysafe shines and also falls short in comparison right now to truly highlight why money would/should flow in to them rather than the others.",

It all depends what time frame you're looking for.\n\nFor retirement:\n\n\\- Open a roth IRA account and start buying into SPY gradually. SPY tracks the S&amp;P500.

(that's based on an average return of 10%/yr). Be sure to \"reinvest dividends\" each time you buy. This is the beauty of COMPOUND INTEREST. FYI, you can't pull $ from a retirement account until age 59.5 without huge penalties.\n\nIf you just want some tips on which stocks I think will do well over the next decade because you want some cash in 10 years, here are some of my picks:\n\n\\- FISV\n\n\\- FSLY\n\n\\- SKLZ\n\n\\- NVDA\n\nAnd of course you can never go wrong with AAPL and MSFT.\n\nDo not try to \"time the market,\" because \"time in the market beats timing the market.\" Good luck!",
