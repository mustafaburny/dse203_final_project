Suddenly went missing for about 3 weeks in Sept 2018 until China announced that they arrested him after demands from Interpol on his whereabouts.  Was subsequently sentenced in January 2020 to 13.5 years in prison. \n\n\n[Wu Xiaohui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xiaohui) - former chairman and chief executive of Anbang Insurance Group, which in 2016 was the largest insurance company in China. Suddenly disappeared in June 2017. Turned up a few weeks later after China announced that they're charging him with fraud and embezzlement.  Eventually sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2018. \n\n\n[Ren Zhiqiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren_Zhiqiang) - Chinese CCP member and former billionaire real estate tycoon in China.  Known to be critical of China on various issues.  Went missing for about 9 months earlier this year only to turn up later to \"confess\" that he committed crimes for which China sentenced him to 18 years in prison.",
