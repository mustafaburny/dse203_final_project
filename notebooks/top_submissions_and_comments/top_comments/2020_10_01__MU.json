It all seems so easy. \n\nThen you start to look at what could have been. Stayed in AAPL for another day, you could have made 1k instead of 1 hundred. If you had bout 10 calls of UPS instead of 1 you would be sitting on 2 months earnings instead of the measly 350 you got.\n\nIts all been going so well, you've been printing money for weeks. Your GF's boyfriend even called you champ at breakfast this morning. Then it hits you, I'll invest 2k into MU calls and be set for the rest of the year. You watch your profit go up to $500, $ 700 , $1k , you want to sell, but then you remember how sad you felt when you watched your other options ended prematurely so you hold on. It hits 2K, your ready to pull out but then it happens... it dips... Slowly you watch that 2k shrink. 2k to 1k , 1k to 700. . You cant sell now, it has to go back up right? It was at 2k just an hour ago, it'll go back up, you know it...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it doesn't. It keeps going down... 700 to 500, 500 to 0....0 to -2K.

        "body": "I have multiple brokerage accounts and I do have on for just investing in ETFs.  Keeping it simple is a pretty solid approach.  However, I'm not thrilled with your choices.  **VOO** and **QQQ** will have a lot of overlap, so you aren't diversifying as much as you might think. **QQQ** is a great ETF, but the underlying index it uses as a benchmark contains 100 stocks.  (The NASDAQ 100).  **VOO** uses the S&amp;P 500, so it obviously contains 500 stocks. Many of the top holdings are going to be the same in both of those ETFs: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. There are, of course, differences, as well.\n\nI also don't like your choice of **VYM** because of its poor return. It has a 10 year return on investment of just 115%, while VOO is double that and **QQQ** has a return of more than 4 times that of **VYM**. **VYM** will also hold many of the companies you are already investing in with **VOO**.\n\n**QQQ** has one of the highest returns of any ETF, but it is Tech-heavy, so there may be a bit more risk than **VOO**.  \n\nYou don't tell us your age, your financial goals and how averse you are to risk, but assuming you are reasonably young (more than 20 years away from retirement) and don't mind some risk, I might suggest a strategy more along the lines of:\n\n**QQQ**: 25%\n\n**VOO**: 25%   (with the understanding that there is some overlap. The blue chip stocks in VOO will help your portfolio to be a little less volatile than putting 50% into QQQ.)\n\n**SOXX:**  10% - iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF - this is a sector ETF that invests in companies that produce semi-conductors (and related companies). The top holdings of this ETF include Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Taiwan Semiconductor, Analog Devices and NXP Semiconductors.  The might be a little overlap with this one and QQQ, but there shouldn't be much.\n\n**ICLN:**  20% - ICLN is an ETF that invests in green/renewable energy. It is a passively managed index fund that uses the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index as its benchmark. Many of its holdings are outside the US.  (If you prefer a more US focused ETF that invests in renewable energy, consider QCLN instead, but be aware that its top holding is NIO, an electric vehicle maker based in China). \n\n**ARKK:**  10% - The ARK funds are actively managed and they invest in \"disruptive,\" innovative companies, many of which are in the tech sector.  Tesla is the top holding of this fund.\n\n**VXUS**: 10% - This is an investment that tracks the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in developed and emerging markets, excluding the US. The fund tracks the FTSE all Cap ex US Index fund. Top holdings include Alibaba, Tencent Holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor (a little overlap with SOXX) Nestle, Roche Holding, SAP SE, Novartis, Toyota and ASML.  While the long term track record of this fund isn't great, the recent addition of Alibaba, Tencent and other companies signal a likely more profitable future.\n\nI think an approach like this will give you the additional diversity you are looking for and a more aggressive return than the choices you've made in your post. \n\n*I'm not a professional Financial advisor and I didn't sleep in a Holiday Inn Express last night. I do own shares in many of the funds I've listed above.*",

I got into the positions early in the day and had to hold it into earnings as the stock pushed higher,  I made some money, but nothing like I should have because of the crush in volatility. Vols are always highest before the event and that change in volatility can mean the difference between a profit &amp; loss even if you call the direction correctly.",
