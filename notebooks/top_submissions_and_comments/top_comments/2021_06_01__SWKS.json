        "body": "All I have is a Roth IRA and can only put in $6,000 a year. I've been at it for 6 years now and it's doing pretty well. I don't make a whole lot of money so it's a perfect set up for me. I max it out, buy some solid names at good prices and try to hold them.\n\nThe plan is obviously retirement. But if anything comes up before then, I can take out money with no penalties and do what I need to do, maybe a down payment on a house one day.\n\nIf there's one thing I wish I did more, was take some risks for high returns. But I don't think now is the time for that. I hate holding a stock with no dividend and just watching it bounce around so I go with dividend payers. \n\nMy positions are: SWKS, LMT, AAPL, CSCO, QCOM, KLIC, INTC, KMI. A bit tech heavy but I know they will be relevant for years to come.\n\nI also have a problem buying a stock \"early\" and selling it before it really takes off. Broadcom and Align technologies are the two that come to mind.",

Just today INTC delayed another one of their data center chips. Even as someone who used to own INTC and now has AMD you have to realize that you have to pay a premium for growth, in this current market a lot of stocks are way above their deserved premium but AMD is not one of them, they have very strong growth prospects regarding chips and I see it as the best chip play followed up by AVGO, SWKS, and QCOM.",
