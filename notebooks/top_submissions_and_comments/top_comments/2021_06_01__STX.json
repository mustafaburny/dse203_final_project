US could have said we don't use your 5G equipment and that's final. But that's not all they did. They forbid Google licensing Android to them, they forbid everyone from selling chips from them, they even made a big fuss about Seagate selling HDDs to them. It wasn't just about 5G equipment. They destroyed the whole company just to spite China. Now, yes BABA probably don't care about spying on US but say if their cloud business really takes off, and there are these tensions with China and US really wants to damage China in any way they could just say BABA is selling software to Chinese military to enslave muslim minorities or some such bullshit and we would see all sorts of bans and sanctions. Certainly say goodbye to your ADRs. Logical? No. Makes sense to weaken your biggest rival in any way in geopolitical sense? Yea. I would not think something like that is impossible.",

        "body": "I've found I've had best luck with a balance of passive and active investing. I start with a portfolio of index funds based on factor investing(mostly chasing value premium),  and devote a small percentage of my portfolio to at most a few individual stocks where I'm confident they are undervalued.\n\nI've had a lot of luck with this strategy so far. What I've learned from my early mistakes is:\n\n1. Don't own anything unless you have a very good reason for owning it. If your reason is \"their dividend is good\", \"their business is booming\", or \"they seem like a sustainable business\", just stick with index funds. You need a compelling reason the market is not valuing them fairly, something that isn't priced in. When I bought SLV, it was because I knew it was a temporary liquidity crunch and that fed actions would drive inflation fears. When I bought LUMN, it was because I took a deep look into their financials and determined they were undervalued. When I bought Western Digital &amp; Seagate, it was because I saw the potential for Chia to boost their earnings.\n\n2. Buy as if you can't sell for 5 years. It's possible that after you buy, the price starts dropping and doesn't recover. If that happens, will you be comfortable holding it? If the answer is no, then either don't buy, or keep it to a very small position.\n\n3. Don't buy a ton individual stocks to \"diversify\". 1 stock you are confident in accounting for 5% of your portfolio and a broad market index like VTI for the remaining 95% is safer than 40 manually picked stocks each representing 2.5%.",
