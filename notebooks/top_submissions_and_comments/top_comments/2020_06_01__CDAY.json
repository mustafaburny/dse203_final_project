The speed at which it is recovering is also normal because every market participant knows the story of past US recessions and economic downturn - they know if you sell your holdings, you\u2019ll regret it down the road. So what\u2019s the point of selling right now if your actually investing for years, decades? None. Especially when it\u2019s super easy to get a loan for rock bottom rates, cash is very accessible for all the big boy investors and institutions. \n\nEveryone constantly downvoted bulls in March for even thinking that a V shape market recovery was gonna happen, for ever thinking we were gonna see ATHs again this year. Don\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten. There\u2019s a lot of remind me bot posts I got coming due soon from March . \n\nOnce again bears, hold this L . Scoreboard don\u2019t lie.

The service referred to as a \u2018Netflix for kids\u2019 is made even stronger by the distinct fact that it is a free service. There are no subscriptions fees, it is ad-supported. Further, we do not anticipate being impacted by COVID-19. The business of cartoons has historically had an appeal that is timeless, and is a rare asset class which has historically been resistant to typical market forces (e.g., the price of gold, oil, interest rates, elections, etc.). While the rest of Hollywood is grinding to a stop during the COVID-19 crisis, we're creating new products for an audience that is growing now out of the new technologies and streaming services. This is especially true at a time when there are more kids at home and in front of their devices during the pandemic. We believe we will see robust and accelerated revenue growth coming forth in this arena for the foreseeable future.\n* **Our balance sheet is strong** \u2013 We have $9.75 million of debt; in excess of $45 million of cash, significant receivables from a diverse array of companies across our industry with strong credit profiles, and low overhead. Today, Genius Brands has enough cash on our balance sheet to meet our existing obligations and execute on our business plan for at least 60 months, *and still fund continuing new production and content acquisitions each year*. Conveniently, last week when one of the short sellers stated we weren\u2019t at the same revenue point as one of our Canadian-based competitors, he neglected to mention that the other company has *more than 60 times* ($600 million) as much debt as Genius Brands. We think identifying this omission is important to understanding the whole story. Finally, to clear up market confusion that we believe has been generated as a result of one short seller\u2019s report, the shelf registration on form S-3 filed on June 4th was related to our capital raise in March 2020. We registered the resale of shares underlying the warrants we issued in March, and the S-3 filing does not in any way represent a new capital raise, nor is it related to recent changes in our stock price.\n* **The short sellers\u2019 criticisms of our Programs highlight their own industry ignorance** \u2013 *Llama Llama* is an industry-recognized tremendous asset that we have on great terms, which are mutually beneficial with the IP\u2019s author/book publisher and ourselves. We are also confident in the appeal of the soon to be launched *Stan Lee\u2019s Superhero Kindergarten,* one of the last creations of Stan Lee, creator of *Spider-Man, X-Men, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Thor, Fantastic Four, Black Panther, and the Avengers,* among others. Similarly, we are happy with the outlook for *Rainbow Rangers.* The fact is that the show\u2019s airings on Nick Jr. have been scaled back while we are currently producing new episodes, which is a standard industry practice known as \u201cresting.\u201d We expect the airings to ramp back up in August when the new episodes are completed and this will be timed with the launch of toys from Mattel hitting the shelves of Walmart in August. We are confident Nick Jr.\u2019s interests are aligned with ours \u2013 after all, *they have a stake in the consumer products merchandising royalties related to this asset*.\n* **The track record of our leadership team speaks volumes** \u2013 Our senior management comes largely from the Walt Disney Company, DreamWorks Animation, and Hasbro Toys, and has been responsible for many of the biggest and most profitable hits in children's television history, as well as toy and consumer product programs generating Billions of dollars of program sales and royalty income. The management team and board have had creative, licensing, production, broadcasting, and sales roles in some of the biggest animated hits in children\u2019s history, including *Lion King, Toy Story, Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears, Power Rangers, My Little Pony, Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men, Transformers, Muppet Babies, Fraggle Rock, Real Ghostbusters, and Inspector Gadget*. Collectively, w*e have more than 150 years of experience in children\u2019s media*, and have helped generate literally tens of billions of dollars of content and consumer products sales.Further, last Friday, we announced the addition of two of our industry\u2019s most accomplished executives overseeing the new channel: Margaret Loesch as Executive Chairman of *Kartoon Channel!* (former President of Marvel Entertainment, FOX Kids, and Henson Television), and David Neuman as Chief Content Officer of *Kartoon Channel!* (former President of Walt Disney Television). Margaret was founding CEO of FOX Kids, and built it from zero to the most successful and profitable kids program service, and what was eventually sold to the Walt Disney Company for $5.5 billion dollars. None of us claim to be experts at \u2018short selling\u2019. But we also think it\u2019s a stretch for short sellers to claim to know more about this industry than those of us who have been industry leaders and spent decades making money for investors while building some of the sector\u2019s most successful brands and companies.\n* **Genius Brands is a long-term growth story** \u2013 We have a number of hit brands and shows today \u2013 but we are even more excited about what is coming, and the synergies with the newly announced *Kartoon Channel!*. We have over 450 licensed products contracted (with advances and guarantees) to come into the marketplace in the coming months. Our pipeline of new animated products, soon to be announced, is robust and pre-sold with significant brand equity. Our partners, licensees, and retail customers include Alibaba, Amazon, Mattel, Netflix, Target and Walmart, among others. *Rainbow Rangers* toys from Mattel, based on our hit series on Nick Jr., will hit Walmart stores in August beginning with a multipack of *Rainbow Rangers* figures. Over 350 other licensed consumer product SKUs are due as well, including publishing, room d\u00e9cor, bedding, footwear, apparel, health and beauty, bicycles, toothpaste, touring shows, among others, some of which are now already on Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and Target.com.\n\nAbove all else, we are focused on *long-term value*. After working with Warren Buffett for 25 years and producing the children\u2019s animated series with Warren to teach financial literacy (*Warren Buffett\u2019s Secret Millionaires Club*), I've learned to focus on the importance of the basics: asset creation and value-building for our shareholders.\n\nOn a personal note, *I have not sold a single share, and in fact, have materially increased my holdings in the Company in the last two years*. We take the views of all our investors seriously, and we and our board are committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency.\n\nThe Company is not suggesting that any particular trading price for the Company\u2019s securities is appropriate, whether in the short- or long-term. However, we would like to seek to clarify certain facts as it relates to the short seller information that has been put into the marketplace.\n\nFinally, the Company reserves the right to take appropriate legal action against Hindenburg Research and Citron Research, as we will always do what we can to protect our shareholders\u2019 interests.",

Then open a Roth IRA.\n\nIn your brokerage account, make your plays. In your Roth IRA, make the *exact opposite play.*\n\nSince you are retarded, your brokerage account will bleed cash, but your Roth IRA will make that same exact amount of cash.

Meanwhile, the losses in your RH account will allow you to reduce your reported income on your taxes, up to $3k.

        "body": "We can only guess at why WB made the moves he made, but my interpretation is that\n\n1. He sold airlines because he probably believes their existing business models are broken until a vaccine comes. It doesnt matter that he sold at the technical lows and that the airline stocks made a subsequent run. Stock price is largely irrelevant to him if he decides that the business has become a bad one. Similarly, just because the stock has run up does not mean he made a mistake. Little has changed in terms of the airlines business model. Even if some people resume flying again, they will not be very profitable operating a plane at 50% capacity. Most of their costs are not very flexible. You can't just use 1 pilot vs 2, or use half the amount of fuel, or half the attendants, or pay half the slotting fee just b/c your plane is only half full. I think there's still a fairly good chance some airlines will go bankrupt.\n2. I said this before in another thread, but WB's sale of GS should not be interpreted as a bearish call on banks. If you look at the whole picture, and what it telegraphs, I think its saying he is not optimistic about M&amp;A activity but very bullish on traditional deposit &amp; loans banking. He sold a bank that deals heavily in M&amp;A (Goldman), and maintained his heavy exposure to traditional banking (BAC, WFC, USB, BK). I think if you do the math, he's kept 95% of his bank holdings (3B sold vs 75B total at end of 2019). His traditional banking investments are essentially untouched.\n\n\nYou asked about what the vets are doing. I sort of consider myself as a veteran (I started investing in 2006 and manage about 1.7M of an 100% equity portfolio) so perhaps I will share what I have done, and am doing.\n\nDuring mid March, I was buying almost every other day. I use VIX as a primary indicator of when I want to start getting aggressive. Anything over 30 and I will be looking to add. As it moved higher and higher I was basically adding on any big down day and spending most of my evenings reviewing our portfolio. The three main things I was looking for were 1. high-grading opportunities (moving up higher in the quality ladder) 2. opportunities to add to existing holdings, and 3. opportunities to sell companies benefiting from temporary effects and buy ones suffering from temporary effects\n\nHere are some examples of moves I made\n\n* I sold WBA, which has a heavy debt load and is BBB rated , and high-graded into USB, a high quality traditional deposit &amp; loan bank\n* I sold COST, which I felt was (and still is) significantly overvalued at 35-40x TTM earnings and bought beaten down 3M at a 4% div yield, because I felt like the hoarding/pantry-loading was effectively pulling forward future sales at Costco and eventually once this dies down their comps would be tough to beat. I wanted exposure to 3M's cyclicality for when economy turns for the better\n* I sold some SJM and high-graded into UL. UL was beaten down and yielded 4%, while SJM was benefiting from pantry loading trade\n* I sold GIS which was another debt laden pantry loading beneficiary and used the proceeds to buy GD, a high quality long cycle defense contractor at a 3.5% div yield\n* Fearful times also tend to depress CAD and boost USD so I took advantage of that to swap some USD to CAD around 1.45\n* I also added to existing high quality names like CNR, XOM, ENB, CVX, KMI, KO, JNJ, TD, MO, DEO\n\nI also took the opportunity to add more to my 2 year old son's RESP, forgoing future govt match to take advantage of cheap valuations and more time in the market. Both tranches of new money went towards adding CNR\n\nAs for what I am doing now. I am sitting idle, doing nothing. Letting dividends roll in and build up in the accounts. Current valuations in most parts of the market are not as crazy as people are making them out to be. I don't see a lot of buying opportunities, but I also do not see anything that I'm interested in selling either. Most of our holdings are within 15% of what I consider to be fair value, trading at fair multiples vs 2019 earnings (I'm ignoring 2020 because EPS estimates today are meaningless). Energy and Financials are where I still see some value so if you think recovery will continue, I'd look there on a pull back. This week I did take advantage of the abatement of fear to swap some newly deposited CAD back to USD around 1.33.",

I researched the company in depth, while they traded low for awhile and had low stock price this is why it is going up and its not artificial....\n\n1. There is not another offering. The S-3 filed today is the results of LAST WEEKS offering.\n\n2. CEO has a long history of success in the kids production industry. Andy Heyward, look him up. Top employees and content creators came from high profile projects such as \" The Lion King\" and \"Frozen\"....I hear those movies became popular (sarcasm). This team is leading their entire platform of shows!!!!\n\n3. They merged two great market segments into one company, Baby Genius and Kid Genius are now \"Genius Brand\" They own\"llama llama\" which already has a large fan base, on-top of the watchers of their youtube channel.\n\n4. If you look at last years financials compared to last quarter (March 2020), revenues are down BUT when looking at financials you need to understand their capital structure (equity base, capital base, mix) and if they prefer net income or cash flow. While revenues are down they lowered their operating expenses and paid off debts. This raises the value of the company which makes sense since they planned to offer stock, less debt and operating expense means higher value per share.\n\n5. They describe in detail what they are doing with the capital raise from MAY 29, 2020 offering. They are developing content and establishing supply channels.\n\n6. Their platform is set to launch June 15th. This is already agreed to be on EVERY PLATFORM. They paired with a successful company with history of success in the two different revenue models for the platform. Free to watch with ads (generate ad revenue) and paid subscription base (revenue).\n\n7. Their platform already has 4000+episode or hours (cant remember exactly which) of content that they own. They are also working on deals to add other content to their platform.\n\n8. They have a unique offering that no one else does. A \"Netflix/Hulu\" just for kids....not only that but it is quality shows with educational purpose. Some may doable in that market but GNUS has chosen a strategy of focused market segment....educational, positive for kids 2-11 years old. There is nothing else out there and there wont be for at least 1-2 years.\n\n9. The company has been trading low not because of poor performance but because a lot was happening behind the scenes. They were creating content, the fruit was growing and June 15th it will harvest.\n\n10. Revenue streams....I covered their subscription models from the streaming platform itself, they also own the rights and licensing for the toys, the images, the music...all of it. They have already signed a deal with Mattel to create the toys and Amazon and Walmart for distribution. HUGE SOLID distribution of products.\n\n11. Think of the Genius ( no pun intended) timing. Release the platform just as kids are home all day due to summer and COVID. So parents will want to let their kids watch shows, why not the free platform that streams cartoons that enrich your kids? All summer form June to December kids will be getting pumped full of Genius brand shows.....then hits Christmas! The Toy sales alone will be insane.\n\n12. They have the rights to the last product Stan Lee created before his death...and Disney doesn't! That alone has potential to be sold off to Disney so that they can keep the monopoly on Stan Lee items and Marvel universe. The CEO is also tight with Warren Buffet and even has a show based around him mentoring kids on finance and international business.\n\n13. If you still aren't convinced, I cant help you but look at Disney+, Netflix, HULU...for years they had to establish the streaming market so you cannot compare apples to appele per se but they incurred HUGE debts to create content and then they finally started catching on. GNUS has the advantage to enter an established market and eat up market share.  \n\n\nGNUS is going UP UP UP!",

It's to do with warrants between internal investors which was actually agreed in March and the SEC filing today was just paperwork to finalise it.\n\n2) The massive dip was caused by the spread of misinformation (see point one); whales selling and cashing out which in turn led to alot of new investors who bought at $10+ to panic sell.\n\nThe combination of the two factors just set off a chain reaction and caused the stock to tumble down. The fact that's it's recovered so well and comparable to levels from just yesterday makes me feel like there's plenty of gains to be had.\n\nHowever, as a caveat, I don't believe GNUS will rise at astronomical rates now due to the psychological fears behind it and investors selling early to focus on recouping losses rather than investing short/long term. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't be surprised for the stock to slowly rise up until the 15th as it gains more and more momentum and hype behind it again. $10 to $12 seems quite reasonable around launch date.\n\n**Two catalysts at play**\n\n1) 15th June (launch date obviously)\n\n2) And the 'news' promised by the CEO to come out in the next few days (Fingers crossed the SEC filing wasn't the 'news') \n\n***Anyway at the end of day do your own DD and don't listen to a random stranger on the internet for financial advice (especially a pleb like me)***",

        "body": "What's with all the hate on TA here recently?  All the posts about it are *fundamentally* flawed.  It's like you see ads for the, \"When you see this pattern buy and become a millionaire like me, give me $4k and I'll tell you the pattern,\" and assume that is a majority of TA traders.  That's such a false take.\n\nTA isn't about hindsight or guaranteeing returns, it's about *predicting* potential movements.  It's probability analysis to reduce risk.  When you study a certain movement type like resistance or support, you can better predict possible movements afterwards and thereby have less risk.  If a pattern does XYZ \\~75% of the time, you're now at 25% risk instead of 100% risk.  That's all it is.\n\nAn ample comparison is sports betting, and weather.  Meteorology uses probability and patterns to predict weather.  It can be wrong, but it's way more advanced and is right way more often than not.  When they see certain patterns, they can predict tornadoes and send out warnings for example.\n\nIn sports betting fundamental analysis is like betting on the whole game, technical analysis is like betting on events within the game.  A fundamental analyst would say that the Yankees at 100-10 are likely to beat the Orioles who are 10-100.  A technical analyst would say that a home run hitter is likely to hit a home run on the next pitch because the count is 3-1.  They aren't saying a home run is GUARANTEED, just likely based on past patterns.  On 3rd and 20 a person could reasonably assume that a football team will pass instead of run.  A person could bet on a player making free-throws in basketball based on their past free throw percent.\n\nThat's what TA is.  If someone says, \"This pattern means there will be a breakout so I'm all in,\" they are bad at TA.  Someone properly using TA would wait on the trend, or get in on their prediction (Incurring more risk), and possibly lose if the predicted pattern doesn't hold.  \n\n  \n\nThat's TA.  Predictive modelling to mitigate risk.  It's as much an educated guess as FA, that's just simply how stocks work, but to continuously see all of these posts shitting on TA and call it astrology is silly to me.",

Then open a Roth IRA.\n\nIn your brokerage account, make your plays. In your Roth IRA, make the *exact opposite play.*\n\nSince you are retarded, your brokerage account will bleed cash, but your Roth IRA will make that same exact amount of cash. Basically, you'll break even, but your robinhood account will be going down and your Roth IRA will be going up.\n\nNow, your Roth IRA has no capital gains tax and no income tax upon withdrawal. Meanwhile, the losses in your RH account will allow you to reduce your reported income on your taxes, up to $3k/yr. And, capital gains losses can rollover indefinitely.\n\nIf you do this with enough cash, you'll basically get a free pass to reduce your taxable income by $3k/yr, forever, without actually losing any money.\n\nIt literally can't go tits up.",

Anyone can stream nearly anything for free or very cheap subscriptions. 30 years ago you had to spend 10-20 dollars to buy one album, nowadays that seems like an absurdity to the average consumer. Ease of access means there is now a panoply of genres and bands. Artists have bypassed large studios and large labels because technology now allows them to record at home with a little investment in equipment, self-publish and promote their work through sites like bandcamp, soundcloud and social media in general. Labels used to be the great gatekeepers and help fund recording sessions; that's not how the industry works anymore.

Anyone can stream nearly anything for free or very cheap subscriptions. 30 years ago you had to spend 10-20 dollars to buy one album, nowadays that seems like an absurdity to the average consumer. Ease of access means there is now a panoply of genres and bands. Artists have bypassed large studios and large labels because technology now allows them to record at home with a little investment in equipment, self-publish and promote their work through sites like bandcamp, soundcloud and social media in general. Labels used to be the great gatekeepers and help fund recording sessions; that's not how the industry works anymore. I love music, but I don't think the future of the industry will be as profitable as it used to be, by a long shot.",

        "body": "A company splits its stock to increase liquidity.\n\nConsider Berkshire Hathaway, with a share price north of $250K. If a shareholder needs to liquidate enough stock to raise $100K, they can't do it without selling more than twice that value of BRK-A. So maybe they'll pick something else to sell instead that's more right-sized for the amount of money they need. Now consider an individual investor with \"only\" $100K to invest. That person can't buy even one share of BRK-A. In both cases, the high share price discouraged investors from trading the stock -- it inhibits liquidity. If BRK-A did a 3-for-1 stock split then those two investors could work out a trade with each other.\n\nThere are three reasons companies don't split stock:\n\n1. They feel it's prestigious to have a high per-share stock price.\n2. They prefer having lower liquidity because it causes the population of investors holding your shares to trend toward being wealthier and trading less frequently. That can provide greater stability for the stock price in normal times.\n3. Splitting the stock isn't free. It requires you to pay lawyers, publish notifications to shareholders, and so on. Companies prefer not to incur expenses without a clear payoff.\n\nEDIT: I guess I'll also explain why a company might like a more liquid stock. A more liquid stock will track more closely to its true market value. A low-liquidity stock can drop in price very sharply if it's hard for buyers to purchase it. Go back to that investor who needed to raise $100K. Now suppose that guy **ONLY** has BRK-A and he **HAS** to sell it. Because of the high share price, there's a smaller pool of investors who have the money to buy it from him. Desperate seller + small buyer pool means that seller can get screwed. Maybe in desperation he'll sell for $200K instead of the $250K+ the stock is worth... well then the market sees **ALL** of those shares as worth only $200K and the share price plummets. Now of course the price isn't really determined by what one guy does, but in a crisis a lot of sellers can find themselves in the same boat and it can happen.\n\nThis kind of liquidity problem is why the US Fed recently started buying up bond ETFs -- desperate sellers + small buyer pool would have put the price of those bonds through the floor *even though the bonds are actually still valuable* had the Fed not stepped in. Because the Fed has the money to buy anything, it can buy those bonds at a normal market price from anyone and let the price decline in a less terrifying way for everyone involved. When analysts talk about the Fed \"providing liquidity,\" this is what they mean.",

Had a smoothie for breakfast then went and got free Popeyes because when I went yesterday they gave me 2 French fries. That\u2019s not an exaggeration, my meal contained two French fries. Like one, two. After that I came home and hung out. Then I went to qdoba, which is significantly better than chipotle. Now I\u2019m just hanging out.\n\nEDIT: sold 3 Tesla calls at 7.15 today. Call me a pussy, but my average was 1.42. Holding 2 $315 AAPL puts",
