TPIC and BWEN share this narrative. I also hold INDS which fits into this, as well as COVID recovery which is another broad trend that I hold, if you'd call it a trend.\n\nLIDAR is another interesting sub-trend of autonomy. I honestly do not like discussing it on Reddit because it immediately dovetails into discussion of lvl 4/5 self driving autos (which is a small subset of LIDAR TAM) and Tesla (which as a ticker grossly overdiscussed and therefore not interesting), and then additionally the companies involved went public through SPAC and are have the typical absurd valuation and penny stock retail crowd. Rough all around. That said, worth reading the actual investor presentations and projections, and the Luminar investor day presentation is especially great with over an hour of technical Q&amp;A at the end. Due to the extreme volatility of SPACs, average in over a very long period to build a position and cut volatility exposure. We're talking build out a position over a year+. It is what it is.\n\nMaterials used in the green transition is almost a trend in and of itself. Of course everyone knows Lithium, but the numbers and projections behind copper and some other materials are quite interesting as well.",

Based on that information, I predicted a price of $75 for AMD at that time. Today, AMD is ~$90.\n\nI don't look at PE ratio much. I look at the company website, how they represent themselves to themselves, what products they sell, who do they work with, and revenue over time. Then I look at their competition and see if there is a market they're dominating in, is their competition capable of competing? Who's their customer?\n\nBased on that I purchased AMD. Intel seemed incompetent and incapable of competing. AMD is, and realizes that they can't run their own fab, so they relied on outside sources for that and they did excellent. Engineering leadership led them to success. Now they're going to continue to dominate and lead.\n\nI did this exact search over this past week on Lam Research and ASML, along with their competition. I have a strong belief in both of these companies, and I bought even though they are now at an all time high. In my mind, these companies are able to compete and will dominate this EUV market for a VERY long time. There used to be an argument for Lam Research to not be able to help in EUV, but they recently made a dry method to make things faster. That's innovative and competitive, they introduced themselves as a need in a market they were once recognized as not being able to penetrate.\n\nI stop investing when I see better opportunities elsewhere, I sense a worrisome market and need to keep cash aside, or I reach the price target and sense that the company is no longer able to compete. Again, doing the same research I did above but periodically and keep up with the news for the companies I'm invested in, and in their competition.\n\nIt requires time and energy to do all of this. I hope this helps.",

It helps to have good outlets of information like twitter, or reading the various stock subreddits, or talking to other investors  to lead you in the right direction. \n\nBuying opportunities aren\u2019t always there, sometimes you have to wait for a good opportunity, and capitalize before the window closes and the stock runs up.\n\nIm assuming based on your reply, you believe that to make more money requires taking on more risk...which isn\u2019t always true and is a logical fallacy in the stock market. There are plenty of decent floor, huge upside stock prices out there. You just have to hope you end up finding the right information that lets you figure out where the stock market is wrong (and no, it doesn\u2019t have to be insider trading because the market sucks at pricing intuition). \n\nA Great recent example is CVS. CVS has continued to generate 15%ish net income growth over the last 5 years, yet the stock price keeps falling despite solid financials, because of both fears: that amazon will overtake pharma retail, and Medicare for all will be legislated by the government causing CVS\u2019 Medicare Part D subscriptions to be wiped out. CVS delivers drugs via mail orders, and is transitioning to healthcare with its Aetna acquisition so thinking amazon will run CVS out of business is a joke. Also if you\u2019ve followed politics and looked at voter data, it\u2019s obvious Medicare for all is not a popular government program by politicians and citizens.\n\nThere are other great examples like back in 2018 when Facebook crashed -40% in July because their operating costs were going up 40% as they were throwing more money into security after the Cambridge analytica scandal in April of that year. Yet anyone that followed Facebook closely knew that targeted ad growth was much higher than 40% which makes up for the cyber security costs. \n\nAnother great example was the September-December 2018 time period when the Trump tariff war with China was going on. There were irrational fears that we would stop doing business with China and companies such as semi conductors were screwed... Obviously Trump wouldn\u2019t damage our economy since that wouldn\u2019t get him re-elected so the fears were non-existent. There were several companies with great financials that had their stock price tank like Apple and Lam Research, that have 4x\u2019ed their stock price in the 2 years since then.",

        "body": "The issue with investing in individual stocks for their dividend is that you will never beat the market this way while taking on the general risk of investing in individual companies.\n\nThe Stock Market will generally price a stock with a good paying dividend really high to limit your returns. Coke is the most staple dividend stock out there, and it only returns a dividend that's 5% of its stock price (5% dividend yield). The S&amp;P500 historically has returned 9% on average. The dividends have less volatility since it's a consistent 5% meanwhile the S&amp;P500 could have 5 years where the annual return is -1%, 3%, 30%, 15%, -2% (comes out to 9% on average over 5 year time span). But if you're just buying and holding then it makes sense just to buy the S&amp;P500.\n\nThe risk with dividends is that during tough times the first thing a company will cut to save money is the dividend. Typically the stock price falls along with the dividend. So if Coke were to suddenly crumble (let's say news/studies came out suggesting Coke causes cancer) and people stopped buying Coke then not only does the 5% dividend go away, but the stock price will probably fall 20+%.\n\nThere are instances where a company has financially plateu'd or been in a minor decline, but they have not slashed their dividend because they know investors will jump ship the moment their dividend is slashed. So a stock price drop but a maintained dividend causes the dividend yield to shoot up which makes it really attractive...the issue is that assuming the stock price drop is well deserved and not an overreaction by the market. If the company's financials continue to crumble then the dividends will be getting slashed eventually. Gamestop and General electric the past several years are great examples of why investing just for a company's dividend is not a good strategy.\n\nThe trick to beating the market is to not focus on dividends, but instead focus on how a company's net income growth % annually is performing relative to changes in the stock price. If a company's net income growth yearly is 20% on average...and the stock price is only growing 5% on average then you will probably make more money investing there because the stock price will eventually catch up and grow at a 20% rate as well (15% net gain which beats out a 5% dividend). Apple and Lam Research in late 2018, and CVS this past year are great examples of great buying opportunities where the stock price was way lower relative to the company's net income growth %, and eventually the stock prices shot up to reflect the financial growth.",

I hadn't planned on getting in originally, but those two things together I think have amplified this dip a bit, and the XLNX purchase is a long-term win for sure. \n\nIf you can stomach the idea that it could be down 5 or 7 percent six weeks from now (no specific reason to say that, just acknowledging the possibility), and your response to that would be to buy a little more if it happens, then yeah, I think AMD has some solid long-term potential. Just make sure that you plan on sticking around until the XLNX purchase goes through (end of 2021), plus a few more months. That will be the way to maximize your value, assuming the timeline and risk profile fit your investment strategy.",

But they're also spending a hell of a lot of money to get all this other crap done. I have January calls it'll probably expire worthless. I've come to accept that unless Microsoft or the government or somebody buys a company which unfortunately is not for sale. But then again everything has its price. Including me because I've been giving $5 blow jobs behind the Wendy's dumpster near my house just to make ends meet.\nI've already lost my half my portfolio which is about $80,000 thank you AMD for moving your earnings date without telling anyone and buying xilinx. And now dunkin' donuts is going private and I knew about it and I didn't buy any calls or puts or any goddamn thing.\nThe only advice I can give you is stay out of this for a while or buy leaps for 2022. Nokia doesn't move enough to day trade you're better off investing in Erickson or Comcast or T-Mobile. Even Qualcomm I stay away from AT&amp;T though period well good luck with your investment you can always buy Tesla. I just bought Amazon and the price went down even though earnings were through the roof. The stock market is just not stable right now it's almost as if Trump is running that also as well as the country period both are in very sad state. Put your money in the bank and leave it there for a while you're better off period again this is only my opinion or is everyone says the mad ravings of a madman Good luck Chuck. Cheers",

With the acquisition of Xilinx, AMD becomes more of a threat to its rivals (Intel &amp; NVIDIA) in the data center sector.

If this merge works in AMD\u2019s favor, in time data centers will begin to adopt AMD architecture over NVIDIA (if price:performance is reasonable) thus increasing overall profit.",

Remember due to Intel process woes they will continue to lag behind certainly till 2023. AMD has 10% of data center market share and around 20% in desktop and we are no way near to saturation. AMD will continue to market share at Intel expense.\n\nComing to GPUs. LOL what can I say? It just took one attempt to match or surpass NVIDIA and people were very pessimistic about GPU prospects. AMD has &lt;10% of dedicated laptop market and around 25-30% of desktop market. Coming to data center (growing rapidly) I think its fair to say its below 5% if you compare against NVIDIA. \n\nNVIDIA is going to feel the pain now. Jensen is already sweating in his leather jackets. News of NVIDIA testing and cancelling of various Ampere SKUs is all over Twitter. First 3080 20GB, then 3070 16GB then 3070Ti. NVIDIA is poised to lose big chunk of market share especially in the notebook market as Ampere perf/watt is worse than RDNA2 and with superior efficiency of Ryzen 4000 and upcoming 5000 APU, AMD Ryzen+Radeon combo will sell like hot cakes in comparison to power hog Intel Skylake and Ampere.\n\nComing to Xilinx deal, shorts have no clue. If the deal closes, AMD will become a computing powerhouse with presence in 5G, automotive, AI, IOT, networking. Coming to dilution as they always bring, this dilution will bring $3b in annual revenue and $1b in profit\n\nPessimistic can sale and shorts can short. AMD has long term growth prospects.

        "body": "&gt;When something like snap or zoom happens and you happen to be on the winning side of that ... it\u2019s luck.\n\nI've been doing this for a little longer than this year and nothing I've said doesn't apply to other years. M&amp;A plays and such are all the same every year with the same results and rewards and sometimes even greater ones.\n\nI called Zoom 3 months before it happened based entirely on the Corona Virus Pandemic and it's use in my workplace going up ridiculous amounts. It wasn't luck. In fact that's the problem here; Zoom was not luck. The uncertainty didn't lie in whether it was being used but instead by how much it would profit from it's use during the pandemic. Apparently everyone was blown away with massive increase in value because in this environment it really is just that useful. \n\nThe part I am trying to get across is that it isn't luck at all. At least not in this case. If something has a strong correlation with the SP500 for instance and that is tanking it is very unlikely that any news is going to outrun the beta on the stock so it isn't really as shocking as it might seem that earnings in the past week, even on things we already knew would go up from a comparative view, were still not producing strong calls or positive prices. They simply fell with the market as a whole at the time. The same had to be true of the things that fell with their earnings in Feb / Mar into April. \n\n&gt;It is a relatively new phenom with know real rhyme or reason behind it.\n\nThis is not new. You can go back to any bubble, any bust and any memetic behavior and see the same thing over and over. This is incredibly profitable hence all the sentiment concepts and scraping of forums and such; the data is profitable for certain. If it were new and no one knew what was happening there'd be no money in it.\n\n&gt;You could argue that currently,the possibility of newbie traders stumbling upon massive gains from meme stock culture is elevated .. Id argue that the probability is still low.\n\nYou don't \"stumble\" across companies you know. That's my point. No one \"stumbles across\" Snapchat. We all know what Snapchat is. You \"stumble across\" Regeneron. You \"stumble across\" Xilinx. You don't stumble across AMD.\n\n&gt;Is it possible to hit a 5k lotto ticket .. sure But in all probability it will be a while before you have a trade that successful.\n\nAgain this strongly depends on what your cost basis is. To get a trade that hits 5k from 2.5k is ... actually really common. Very. It was before this. It will be after. It even happens on just the stocks and not even the derivatives; a lot of people think that these market moves are rare but they aren't, and instead, they are heavily spaced out and complex to track so making 100% across 9 months in a year isn't what anyone is looking for but that is exactly how it tends to work out.\n\nI personally think that your first 20k is the hardest because it's easy to get the 1 that takes you to even 10k buy 20+ in one go is very rare so you do have to actually string together trades and that lowers the probability of success substantially. This is especially true because capital sensitivity worsens as you get wealthier; the same amount of money you need to achieve a return is not the absolute value of a cashflow anymore so when you worked at Wendy's (whose earnings are this week ;) ) your making 30k was huge but if you work at your own firm or a bank or something like that your making 30k is sometimes a pittance.\n\n&gt;I think it\u2019s dangerous to spread a narrative that suggests Snap like plays happen so consistently that all you have to do is be familiar with these types of cult companies to secure large profits.\n\nI cannot stress enough that this stuff happens all the time. It is so common in fact that there is no one talking about it. I mean the Fastly puts thing with a 392x value? *That* is rare. From 2 ~ 18 based on the contract within a year is not astronomically rare because remember it's all leverage so the bet itself doesn't move linearly like the base might presuming the basis isn't an option itself. Heh. Options on options are freaking crazy.",
