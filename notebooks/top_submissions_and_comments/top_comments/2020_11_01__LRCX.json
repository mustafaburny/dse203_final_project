        "body": "I noticed AMD around 2017, I think a year after Lisa Su came in. I saw the Ryzen product and looked into the company as a whole, then looked into their competitors. Based on that information, I predicted a price of $75 for AMD at that time. Today, AMD is ~$90.\n\nI don't look at PE ratio much. I look at the company website, how they represent themselves to themselves, what products they sell, who do they work with, and revenue over time. Then I look at their competition and see if there is a market they're dominating in, is their competition capable of competing? Who's their customer?\n\nBased on that I purchased AMD. Intel seemed incompetent and incapable of competing. AMD is, and realizes that they can't run their own fab, so they relied on outside sources for that and they did excellent. Engineering leadership led them to success. Now they're going to continue to dominate and lead.\n\nI did this exact search over this past week on Lam Research and ASML, along with their competition. I have a strong belief in both of these companies, and I bought even though they are now at an all time high. In my mind, these companies are able to compete and will dominate this EUV market for a VERY long time. There used to be an argument for Lam Research to not be able to help in EUV, but they recently made a dry method to make things faster. That's innovative and competitive, they introduced themselves as a need in a market they were once recognized as not being able to penetrate.\n\nI stop investing when I see better opportunities elsewhere, I sense a worrisome market and need to keep cash aside, or I reach the price target and sense that the company is no longer able to compete. Again, doing the same research I did above but periodically and keep up with the news for the companies I'm invested in, and in their competition.\n\nIt requires time and energy to do all of this. I hope this helps.",
