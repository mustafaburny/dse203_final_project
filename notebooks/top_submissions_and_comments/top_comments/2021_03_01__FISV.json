        "body": "Sounds very close to a report my firm writes for investment managers every month.\n\nThe biggest difference is rather than buying momentum in terms of price (which also has great academic support as a factor), we are looking for longer-term solutions for clients, so focus on business growth measured by asset growth.\n\nWe also follow a scorecard approach, scoring on a company\u2019s ROA, asset growth, and P/E, rather than just screening alone. We\u2019ve seen that using this scorecard actually works in the long-run. The screen of the top 50 names measured by the Quality, Growth, and Valuation (QGV) scorecard has outperformed the market over the last twenty years. It highlights the value of looking at these kinds of metrics when doing idea generation - they can provide powerful signals.\n\nI can\u2019t give out the full 50, but wanted to share the top 5 from the most recent month:\n\nCompany Name|Ticker|ROA|Asset Growth|Earnings Yield\n:--|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:\nTexas Pacific Land Trust|TPL|139%|94%|7.0%\nPrestige Consumer Healthcare|PBH|46%|192%|6.6%\nFederated Hermes|FHI|66%|29%|10.6%\nCommScope|COMM|49%|42%|7.0%\nFiserv|FISV|86%|129%|4.5%\n\nThe one important thing to point out on the above is that our firm is focused on accounting adjustments, and cleaning up bad traditional accounting under GAAP (listen to anything Buffett, Klarman, etc. have to say on the matter\u2026) so the factors we look at are different than what is found on something like Yahoo Finance. I just wanted to point that out since the numbers above won\u2019t quite match something from Bloomberg etc.\n\nThese names are also less covered (or at least some are less covered) than the traditional names one sees as hot stocks today.\n\nGreat idea to start having discussions about how to find great undiscovered names, and what screens/ratios/scorecards/factors are the best for finding alpha.",
