        "body": "Sounds very close to a report my firm writes for investment managers every month.\n\nThe biggest difference is rather than buying momentum in terms of price (which also has great academic support as a factor), we are looking for longer-term solutions for clients, so focus on business growth measured by asset growth.\n\nWe also follow a scorecard approach, scoring on a company\u2019s ROA, asset growth, and P/E, rather than just screening alone. We\u2019ve seen that using this scorecard actually works in the long-run. The screen of the top 50 names measured by the Quality, Growth, and Valuation (QGV) scorecard has outperformed the market over the last twenty years. It highlights the value of looking at these kinds of metrics when doing idea generation - they can provide powerful signals.\n\nI can\u2019t give out the full 50, but wanted to share the top 5 from the most recent month:\n\nCompany Name|Ticker|ROA|Asset Growth|Earnings Yield\n:--|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:\nTexas Pacific Land Trust|TPL|139%|94%|7.0%\nPrestige Consumer Healthcare|PBH|46%|192%|6.6%\nFederated Hermes|FHI|66%|29%|10.6%\nCommScope|COMM|49%|42%|7.0%\nFiserv|FISV|86%|129%|4.5%\n\nThe one important thing to point out on the above is that our firm is focused on accounting adjustments, and cleaning up bad traditional accounting under GAAP (listen to anything Buffett, Klarman, etc. have to say on the matter\u2026) so the factors we look at are different than what is found on something like Yahoo Finance. I just wanted to point that out since the numbers above won\u2019t quite match something from Bloomberg etc.\n\nThese names are also less covered (or at least some are less covered) than the traditional names one sees as hot stocks today.\n\nGreat idea to start having discussions about how to find great undiscovered names, and what screens/ratios/scorecards/factors are the best for finding alpha.",

He continues scrolling through WSB reading every retarded post about him he can find.  He begins to feel sadness and a lump in his throat and he thinks about his 401k being down 2.5 points on the day.

Jimmy knows he will never be able to satisfy his wife the way her boyfriend can.  He closes WSB as the tears of disappointment and rage roll down his face.  How dare these selfish retail traders, who know nothing about investing, question me and CNBC!  How dare they make money! MONEY IS FOR HEDGIES ONLY! he exclaims. He navigates to his bookmarks to find his favorite cuck porn help him relieve the swelling rage, anger, and fear that have been building within him over the past two months.  How much more of this can I take he wonders and he manually stimulates himself to cuck porn while his wife and her boyfriend begin round six in the next room over, all the while tears streaming down his face.  Finally after several hours he achieves a sweet release however his anger still remains balled up inside him.  In a fit of rage he throws his $IBM toughbook to the floor and pulls out his $T $AAPL iPhone and heads over to $TWTR where he goes on an 18 tweet rant about the retards on WSB before he finally passes out after his 9th $BUD.",

So if IBM keeps the dividend at $1.63 for every quarter, that means you get $6.52 ($1.63 * 4) a year for every share you own. \n\nSo if you want to get $20k a year from IBM alone, you would need to have about 3,067 shares. You get $6.52 a year for every share times 3,067 which equals about $20k. IBM currently trades for about $120 a share, so it would require you to $368,040 worth of stock in order to get $20k a year. \n\nHope this helps!",

He believed in their model of selling PCs they built to business customers.  He followed the company religiously.  \n\nThen years later, all of a sudden the company decided to get on the low margin business of selling TVs to retail customers.  Dell never built their own TVs sonthey were just another reseller.\n\nThis caused my client to decide to sell his now $1 million in Dell.
