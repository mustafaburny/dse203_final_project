        "body": "**tl;dr -** Took out a $50k loan from a LOC and credit card cash advance and yolo'd it into GME call options back in Nov/Dec at $17. Peaked at \\~$7.5M (incl. withdrawals), almost $8M if I include my wife's $5k investment. Cashed out some for a house. Diamond handing the rest for future generations. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm no DFV, but I created a new throwaway to post my proudest (financial) achievement. I had to wait 2 months for submission requirements, then this keeps getting removed because \"A Gain/Loss/YOLO should be a picture of a closed gain, a closed loss, or an open position &gt; $2,500.\" which I think this clearly qualifies for. Maybe it's because it has to be a picture submission? Let's see if this works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:** I wasn't a trust fund baby, we grew up relatively poor and I was always hungry. I started working in high school to support my family, and worked 3-5 jobs through college, graduating with loads of student debt. While I have a steady job now, there's no way I would be able to grind my way to financial freedom. The system is too broken for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**At the Beginning:** I read DFV's DD on GME after their last Nov earnings. I told everyone about GME when it was at $17, and at $14, but as many apes here know, it's hard to convince people even when the DD and facts are out in plain sight. I recognized it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, so I dumped the rest of my gambling money (roughly $15k from an original $30k borrowed from a LOC) into GME options. Lost most of it over the next month or so, but then saw this $1.4B company make $1.7B in profit, so I took a $20k credit card cash advance and kept playing. At my lowest, I was down from $50k to $15k, and then the money started raining.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Rollercoaster:** Like everyone else, I checked the price constantly. Post-market until 8pm, read DD until midnight, and watching the German / pre-market prices a few hours later (Thank you German apes!). I saw the price go up to $480+ and \\*knew\\* it was going up to $1k. Then the manipulation started. I held on at first, but then even IB restricted purchasing (options). Even though my heart told me to hold, I knew rationally the momentum had been stopped. With a heavy heart, I sold around $330 and told my wife to do the same. Better to accept defeat in battle and to fight another day.Over the next few weeks, we saw the price crash. I bought at $150 in premarket a few days later, and again at $120, $100, $80, $60, $50. Before I knew it, I was (almost) all in again. The price was wrong, and naturally, it shot back up over $300. I had peaked around $2.5M before dipping back down to under $1.5M. At the $340 peak, I saw my account surpass $5M, and felt that was \"good enough\". I sent the screenshot to my wife, and followed the very wise adage of \"Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell\" and cashed out 1/3 of my holdings. I was lucky because within 5 minutes, it started crashing hard, to below $200. What a deal, I jumped back in the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Performance Summary:** I've stopped going all-in with FDs after learning from the brave souls who have gone before me here on WSB (and from my own previous bankruptcies). Instead, I've been selling calls to reduce my risk, while providing a solid income that I can use to buy more shares (and sometimes more FDs, because who can resist tendies?). I cashed out on June 19th to buy a house at $7.2M + $300k previously withdrawn, at peak wealth at around $7.5M, which is why the graph stops here. My wife's initial $5k investment went up to around $350k at its peak.The remaining is still in GME shares/options. I've been bleeding out, down over $1M (again) since then, but that doesn't matter. Shorts have to cover, and I'm already buckled in. I'm holding for my grandchildren and their grandchildren. To the moon. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bonus Graph:** We Canadian apes get a TFSA where profits don't get taxed. While I played various option strategies on my margin account, I mainly bought and held long term options and shares in this account. My double down of $19k in January went here, which eventually grew to $6.5M. Tax free. Come at me, CRA (jk, plz don't).",

Then the stock was fully frozen. When there is no liquidity the order matching algorithm of the exchange will match a new order to the first available liquidity no matter the price. \n\nWhat I\u2019m guessing happened is that they got an order in precisely at the exact millisecond that liquidity was literally 0 and before the stub quote and the full stock freeze. Then it opened, he received the order fill, the stub quotes were withdrawn and everything moved on.\n\nA similar phenomenon happened during the 2010 flash crash when several S&amp;P stocks briefly traded at $0.01.",

That\u2019s easy to say after they missed earnings. But it could have gone differently. \n\nWhat you should do is learn from this. If this is a big loss, next time diversify more or put in a stop loss or do a put/call strategy to limit losses. Also $16 was an aggressive break even, maybe be less aggressive and buy lower strikes closer to ITM. \n\nMost important, you can\u2019t go back. Accept the losses, learn, change future behaviors, and don\u2019t dwell. Easier said than done. \n\nSource: fellow WISH bag holder but also have had many large losses throughout the years.",

It's very normal for the S&amp;P to have &gt; 25% or even 30% yearly returns because crashes happen and it reverts eventually. \n\nI can't say if there is or isn't a bubble, but looking at this chart is definitely not the way to figure that out.",

        "body": "**tl;dr -** Took out a $50k loan from a LOC and credit card cash advance and yolo'd it into GME call options back in Nov/Dec at $17. Peaked at \\~$7.5M (incl. withdrawals), almost $8M if I include my wife's $5k investment. Cashed out some for a house. Diamond handing the rest for future generations. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm no DFV, but I created a new throwaway to post my proudest (financial) achievement. I had to wait 2 months for submission requirements, then this keeps getting removed because \"A Gain/Loss/YOLO should be a picture of a closed gain, a closed loss, or an open position &gt; $2,500.\" which I think this clearly qualifies for. Maybe it's because it has to be a picture submission? Let's see if this works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:** I wasn't a trust fund baby, we grew up relatively poor and I was always hungry. I started working in high school to support my family, and worked 3-5 jobs through college, graduating with loads of student debt. While I have a steady job now, there's no way I would be able to grind my way to financial freedom. The system is too broken for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**At the Beginning:** I read DFV's DD on GME after their last Nov earnings. I told everyone about GME when it was at $17, and at $14, but as many apes here know, it's hard to convince people even when the DD and facts are out in plain sight. I recognized it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, so I dumped the rest of my gambling money (roughly $15k from an original $30k borrowed from a LOC) into GME options. Lost most of it over the next month or so, but then saw this $1.4B company make $1.7B in profit, so I took a $20k credit card cash advance and kept playing. At my lowest, I was down from $50k to $15k, and then the money started raining.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Rollercoaster:** Like everyone else, I checked the price constantly. Post-market until 8pm, read DD until midnight, and watching the German / pre-market prices a few hours later (Thank you German apes!). I saw the price go up to $480+ and \\*knew\\* it was going up to $1k. Then the manipulation started. I held on at first, but then even IB restricted purchasing (options). Even though my heart told me to hold, I knew rationally the momentum had been stopped. With a heavy heart, I sold around $330 and told my wife to do the same. Better to accept defeat in battle and to fight another day.Over the next few weeks, we saw the price crash. I bought at $150 in premarket a few days later, and again at $120, $100, $80, $60, $50. Before I knew it, I was (almost) all in again. The price was wrong, and naturally, it shot back up over $300. I had peaked around $2.5M before dipping back down to under $1.5M. At the $340 peak, I saw my account surpass $5M, and felt that was \"good enough\". I sent the screenshot to my wife, and followed the very wise adage of \"Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell\" and cashed out 1/3 of my holdings. I was lucky because within 5 minutes, it started crashing hard, to below $200. What a deal, I jumped back in the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Performance Summary:** I've stopped going all-in with FDs after learning from the brave souls who have gone before me here on WSB (and from my own previous bankruptcies). Instead, I've been selling calls to reduce my risk, while providing a solid income that I can use to buy more shares (and sometimes more FDs, because who can resist tendies?). I cashed out on June 19th to buy a house at $7.2M + $300k previously withdrawn, at peak wealth at around $7.5M, which is why the graph stops here. My wife's initial $5k investment went up to around $350k at its peak.The remaining is still in GME shares/options. I've been bleeding out, down over $1M (again) since then, but that doesn't matter. Shorts have to cover, and I'm already buckled in. I'm holding for my grandchildren and their grandchildren. To the moon. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bonus Graph:** We Canadian apes get a TFSA where profits don't get taxed. While I played various option strategies on my margin account, I mainly bought and held long term options and shares in this account. My double down of $19k in January went here, which eventually grew to $6.5M. Tax free. Come at me, CRA (jk, plz don't).",

Then the stock was fully frozen. When there is no liquidity the order matching algorithm of the exchange will match a new order to the first available liquidity no matter the price. \n\nWhat I\u2019m guessing happened is that they got an order in precisely at the exact millisecond that liquidity was literally 0 and before the stub quote and the full stock freeze.

You\u2019re already concerned with selling options on your \u201csafer\u201d risky investments. You don\u2019t even know if ETFs pay dividends. And you\u2019re looking into leveraged ETFs without much knowledge of what differentiates them. \n\nAll of this tells me that you\u2019ve been gambling and you want to feel like you\u2019re being safer while still gambling. \n\nThat\u2019s your prerogative, but I\u2019ll share the counter argument. Being young doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should be risky, and 29 isn\u2019t that young. \n\nIf you out $5k away this year in something considered as safe as possible, like the SP500, by the time you\u2019re 65, that\u2019s about $75k. \n\nOn the other hand, with riskier stocks, it could be $500k or it could be $2k. I think most young people see that and say well, I\u2019m young and I\u2019m open to risk. The reality is that the chance of the bad outcome and good outcome are closer to equal than you think. Are you really okay with putting money away week after week for 35 years and it being worth way less than you thought?\n\nMost people think they are considering risk but they really are just cognitively glancing over the negative risk and focusing on the emotional pleasure of the potential upside.",

You're killing it right now but trust me when I say that you can lose the money just as rapidly as you made it if you continue playing options and concentrating everything in one bet. I've had periods where I was down 80% of my entire net worth because highly concentrated high risk investments that run up thousands of percent in a year can also run downwards just like that.\n\nTake it from someone who's managed to have multi-million dollar swings multiple times in his life-you really don't want to feel like the asshole who threw away his family's retirement because he didn't take some serious profits. You don't have to sell it all, but if you're not setting aside 2-3 million right now you're a  moron. Will you be able to look your wife and/or kids in the eye and realize that you pissed an awesome life for them away because you couldn't stop gambling?\n\nDiversify out enough that you and your wife will be fucking fine forever. That means $2 million on the low end and more like $3-4 million to be on the safer side, especially if the two of you don't have high paying careers where you could make that money back in a few years. Then gamble with whatever else and if it blows up so what, you could both work part time and still be comfortable as fuck if you have $2-3 million paying out dividends every year and still growing.\n\nDo what you want, but trust me that you're gonna feel like an asshole and an utter failure to your family if you fuck this up gambling. I've fucked up enough to learn to take profits.\n\nAlso, I did most of my GME gambling in our Roth IRAs so totally tax free ftw. Too bad I can't touch that money for another couple of decades lol",

        "body": "ADRs are where an American bank holds 1 foreign share and issues 1 share on an American exchange, denominated in American dollars, paying foreign taxes and making filings on your behalf, receiving foreign dividends in foreign currency and forwarding them to you in USD. \n\nThe \u201cnormal\u201d ADR shares are fully backed by fully owned ordinary shares. The ADR exists to make it convenient, because the ADR Sponsor will open a brokerage account in Japan, UK, Germany, France, Singapore, etc, fill out the paperwork in Japanese, buy shares in JPY, make appropriate regulatory filings on your behalf. However, the **actual foreign share** is held **in America** by an **American bank**. ADR holders can still vote as if they were shareholders. It\u2019s almost like the old days where $1 was backed by $1 of gold in a bank. \n\nChinese stocks are ADRs. But they aren\u2019t backed by shares of the underlying security. They\u2019re shares of a shell company called a VIE. VIE stands for variable interest entity. \n\nThe VIE is an ostensibly independent company that has negotiated **a contract** with a Chinese company for a share of ALL future profits. The VIE then sells shares **of itself** and these become listed in the USA as ADRs. Someone who owns an ADR of a VIE does not own a share of a Alibaba. They own a slice of a company in the Bahamas contractually \u201cguaranteed\u201d payments by Chinese companies. It\u2019s more like an annuities contract to future profits, but written to break Chinese law. \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the entire structure of VIEs was invented explicitly ~~break~~ *circumvent* Chinese laws prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies. \n\nFinally\u2026 contracts are only as good as the legal systems that govern them. \n\nI have strong faith that neither American nor Japanese courts want to fuck up ADRs of Toyota. They may tinker at the margins, maybe with taxes or disclosure. But they won\u2019t invalidate the structure leaving you with nothing.  \n\nI have approximately 0 faith that China\u2019s courts will respect the legal structure of VIE ADRs when it becomes inconvenient for them. The linchpin of a VIE is just a contract governed by Chinese law, circumventing Chinese law, between a Chinese company and a barely nonfictional \u201ccompany\u201d in the Cayman Islands.\n\nEdit: note as well that many Hong Kong listings of mainland companies are also the VIE structure. Hong Kongers are not allowed to own Chinese A shares either.",

The announcement puts significantly more pressure on MSFT to acquire the NED vertical, especially considering the national security risks associated with this critical IP being vital to the $22B US Army IVAS contract. The Department of Defense has conducted a thorough review and I\u2019m sure they have identified that Microsoft not owning the rights to the \u201cMiracle *MicroVision* Display Engine\u201d represents a national security threat. It would make sense for the DoD to put pressure on MSFT to acquire this IP to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.\n\nor\n\nB) Microsoft gave MicroVision the green light to announce the relationship because MSFT is about to announce acquiring the NED vertical.\n\nEither way it is BAFF (*Bullish as F#cking F#ck*).\n\nAlso, MVIS is positioning itself to be a global leader in automotive LiDAR with best-in-class tech in terms of resolution, specs, and scalability.

Well the people already positioned in good places hold large 401ks or stocks or and inventory of homes made soo much money. Im 32 and my 401k went from 100k to 220k last year. This market proping has made the well off, better off. So now they are putting all the newly earned money in assets, stocks, homes. Over paying for homes and property isnt a big deal when you made a ton of money against a struggling middle/lower class. This has created alot of inflation for assets which has made it even harder to break out of your current situation. The divide is growing, Shit I think there will be a huge wealth inequality in the younger generation based off home owners before 2020 and after the pandemic. My peers are buying homes they may be able to afford, on 2 incomes over a 30 year period. But people arent afforded the extra slack or cash to deal with all the obstacles life comes with. This will likely lead to a lower birth rate, higher mental illness, higher divorce rates and likely a growing of inequality. Just my opinion. Im currently looking to buy some land in New England around the White Mountains. Maybe im paranoid but land and homes seems to be the new asset to horde. I think the repercussions of global warming will be exponential and can see many wealthy east coasters slowly moving more north over the next 50 years.",
