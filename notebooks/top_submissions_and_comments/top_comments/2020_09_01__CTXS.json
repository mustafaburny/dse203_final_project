About an hour after market opened my alerts all blew up. I bought in on many, averaged down on a few, and ended today green. I have $12,000 allocated to averaging down on current positions if necessary and nearly 1/3rd of my portfolio available for new positions. Today was awesome! I now own SUM, CTXS, NET, IMOS, SIMO, &amp; IVC. Even took a small position of DFFN for a short squeeze and very small position in BKYI because ... well ... freaking because!",

I was checking it out earlier last month. \n\nI took some AMD and NVDA stock a while back no regrets. I like the idea of investing on the innovators and future tech for my mains. TSLA comes to mind but its really hyped, i think it is overvalued right now even though I like what the company is doing. Opted for some AAPL instead.",
