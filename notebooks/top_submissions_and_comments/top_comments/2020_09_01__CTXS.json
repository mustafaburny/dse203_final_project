About an hour after market opened my alerts all blew up. I bought in on many, averaged down on a few, and ended today green. I have $12,000 allocated to averaging down on current positions if necessary and nearly 1/3rd of my portfolio available for new positions. Today was awesome! I now own SUM, CTXS, NET, IMOS, SIMO, &amp; IVC. Even took a small position of DFFN for a short squeeze and very small position in BKYI because ... well ... freaking because!",

        "body": "Speaking for a PE shop as well as a friend's FICC Sales and Trading experience. One of us works out of NY and the other out of Toronto.\n\nLike many of the others mentioned here, we using citrix to remote into our desktops at the office or on the trade floor. They also sent us a couple of extra monitors and gave us $500 to buy whatever we need to work from home.\n\nTheoretically, this should get us up to speed, but it's a complete quagmire. First, there is always going to be latency from using a remote connection. When the internet is slow, it might take a good 2-3 seconds before what you type actually appears. When you're dealing with a million emails a day, that adds up quickly. Also, there are tons of bugs with our software. I've lost track of the number of times my mic/webcam wasn't detected or our stupid screen share stopped working. Also, even 6 months into WFH, not everyone has all the privileges yet (screen share, file transfer over webex, etc).\n\nThe problems go beyond the technical issues. Things that took 10 min to resolve face to face now take 30 min to solve using WebEx (assuming no technical issues, which are common. If you have some technical issue, good luck). It is damn near impossible to read the room or read between the lines of what is being said on the call. It's just a slew of ppl taking at once followed by silence followed by \"go ahead\", etc, etc ,etc. My calendar is such a clusterfuck right now from all the calls. Our hours were already long before COVID (not as long as IB, but he works from 6AM - 7PM. My hours are about 8AM - 7PM), and now they are even longer. To make matters worse, having remote access means people are more likely to send you emails on the weekends.\n\nTLDR: It fucking sucks. Happy to answer any questions",

        "body": "It's quite bad that a company in 2020 is so unprepared for sudden work from home change; You mentioned a lot of technical issues, which aren't necessarily due to remote access, but more like CTO/COO not stepping up to 2020. I mean mic/camera issues, come on (buy **decent** camera+mic; hard enforce stable driver versions, make IT check each laptop before shipping to employee,etc.). Dealing with the lag with the likes of citrix is more complex, but 3 seconds delay is unacceptable and can be deal with. \n\nThe disruption in communications is more difficult to deal with, however most companies flat out suck donkey balls in their efforts to handle this. Let's take the \"random\" team huddles, which happen in the morning near the coffee machines or in the smoking area. Anyone would agree those were extremely useful. Yet not single company I know implemented a solution to mimic those. The solution is simple - have a voice chat rooms in which people can just join and chit-chat, they always open, like discord channels; name those \"smoking break\", \"coffee corner\", \"chitchat\" - etc. Yet nothing like that is present in any company I know and have friends working in. There are the only Teams meetings, which are definitely not the same thing. Because it's a meeting, you need to join exactly at some hour and it just sucks. Have you heard of a company which implemented such discord-like voice-chat rooms to re-create team-bonding over coffee/smoke, where one can join at like 10am and already find 2 people talking over a cigarette, then another girl might join at 10:07 when she has done her coffee and wc duties, no meeting deadlines, no official start and end time? I haven't. and that's a pretty simple solution. \n\nMy point is that I believe that with right attitude towards technology and organizational practices working in the office 2 days a week and from home 3 days a week can be a real win-win.",

Those are *not* my recommendations, just my top performing holdings.\n\nI'm self taught and ignorant about a lot, but try to learn. But I do have an investing philosophy. One of the big investing mistakes I think we all make is believing that how things are now is how they will always be, so I try to buy for a better future. And along with fundamentals I buy what I believe in, and what I've seen and used.\n\nI do socially responsible self-directed investing. So I try not to buy anything that makes money directly from fossil fuels, war, harming people or animals,, prisons, poor treatment of immigrants, refugees, or asylum seekers, or, predatory financial industries, or any other industries that cause people, animals, or the environment harm. I think there's a fair argument to make that I'm breaking this rule to include tech companies like Facebook and some biotech, so that's my failure to work on. But my investments since the early 2000s have beat all the markets, and all the funds, just by choosing to have principles and trying to invest in companies that do good.\n\nI also own other green energy, tech, grocery, railroads, data/commercial real estate, biotech. In the early 2000s I bought the companies that have become big tech, right now I'm buying transportation, biotech, 5G, AR, VR, and green energy companies along with companies I think will do well during the upcoming COVID-19 repeat.

They just hired Tom Eacobacci as President in June after he lead sales for Citrix for over 20 years and he gets to crank start the sales engine exactly how he wants. BlackBerry trades at 2-3x sales when CRWD trades at 30x. I am very confident they are gonna get a massive beat Thursday BMO.",
