        "body": "A good example is probably the hard drive industry. Back in 2012, there were [massive floods in Thailand](https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/24/2729692/western-digital-prices-thailand-floods) that badly disrupted the production of hard drives. This led to an almost 50% increase in hard drive prices for about a year or so. It was really annoying, and set the industry back for about 2 years (the pace of hard drive size increases just ground to a halt for a while). However, the big data center/cloud players were just spinning up and kept buying at any price. Eventually, markets do what they do, and the prices started going down, while the storage space started going back up.\n\nSo more than likely, you'll see a few quarters of higher prices, where enterprises will keep buying what they need because they have no other option. Consumer purchases will decrease for a while, but eventually things will sort back out because...what's the alternative?",

So I let recent positions of BABA, AMD, WDC, MSFT, AAPL go up in profits in the 4 figures, and I sit there, like a moron, waiting. For the winners to run. Then Iran. Then Virus. Recovery. Virus again. Recovery. Virus, virus. We'll all those 4 figures are gone now. Should've closed waaaaay earlier.\n\nValuable lessons I'm learning :-)",

Also $2k is not nearly enough unless you want to hold a single risky and downtrodden stock that don\u2019t generate much premium. With that little an amount you also won\u2019t be able to diversify. It\u2019s best not to hold more than 5-10% of your account in any one stock. If you can get margin on your account, skip the put phase and buy the stock and sell an ITM (I like around 70 delta) call. That\u2019s the same trade as a short put but you can leverage 4x usually. You can find stocks that can average between 0.5-1.0% a week. Going out farther than one week reduces risk and return. Some of my go-to lower price stocks are SFIX, MU, SNAP, TWTR, BAC, CIEN, CSCO, LK, MU, T, WDC, and XLNX. Beware of earnings!",

        "body": "The flu/cold is something is that widely known with lots of information/statistics; e.g. recovery times, symptoms, etc. While the coronavirus is completely NEW; uncharted territory. \n\nThis outbreak is something I followed very closely since it was announced a few weeks ago. As I have some relatives in China, I've had status updates from them. Even in ShangDong north east coast, there was frantic over buying/hoarding of supplies leading to the built up of official announcements. People were stocking up pretty much everything: Water filters, masks, sanitizers, gloves, dried foods, spices, butane canisters for cooking, propane tanks, you name it. You've even had speculative \"investors\" buying tons of higher end drones and cameras (e.g. DJI drones) - presumably to sell or to be used to monitor streets from a safe distance. As this was the most unprecedented \u201cquarantine\u201d lockdown in the history of mankind - this tell me that the CCP was spooked\u2026 their reaction which speaks volumes on the situation. \n\nIn no particular order:\n\nWhat we know:\n\n=&gt; Factories closed until Feb 10 - it will be decided if production/lockdown will be extended   \n=&gt; Schools closed &amp; don\u2019t resume until mid Feb   \n=&gt; Flights limited/blocked to over 15 countries as of Feb 6th / Russian border closed to China   \n=&gt; Production/Supply chains will feel the squeeze shortly   \n=&gt; Examples include many electronic production lines in ShenZhen china; where work is outsourced 3-8 runs down the ladder; when production at the top have NO idea who to contact beyond 3-4 rungs down. Essentially, we're going to a massive price spike on electronics in the coming months from TVs, computer hardware, etc due to limited supply and rising shipping costs.   \n=&gt; Hyundai stopped domestic productions over parts shortage - few days ago.   \n=&gt; Toyota looking for new suppliers for car parts at of Feb 6th, 2020.   \n=&gt; Domino effect in play here; a \u201ccheap\u201d low cost part shortage (e.g. say specialized screw) can easily halt production of much higher value products (e.g. Medical devices, iPhones, Cars, Tvs etc)   \n=&gt; Retail to suffer due to store closures and/or operating on shorter hours. (e.g. Starbucks, McDonalds, Nicke, all domestic restaurants in lockdown zone, etc)   \n=&gt; International tourism to reduce significantly - due to fear, xenophobia/racism. This outbreak WILL change consumer spending/traveling habits - (something tells me e-commerce will be the biggest winner here - online grocery will get a nice boost from this). \n\nX Factors (Unknown):   \n=&gt; Spread of wildfire misinformation (the bigger pandemic imo) - rise of xenophobia/racism towards individuals of Asian descent. - which also makes it harder to contain &amp; combat this outbreak.   \n=&gt; Based on available information from official sources (WHO), NCoV has a \u201csimilar\u201d fatality rate closer to the flu than say SARS - but not much more than that due to limited sample size outside of China.  \n=&gt; How it spreads is still not yet fully understood.   \n=&gt; Viruses are known to exchange genetic information with each other in their host; due to how contagious nCoV is, it CAN create new strains by combining with other viruses or something entirely new capable starting an real \u201cpandemic\u201d   \n=&gt; Actual infected cases TBD (due to bottleneck in lab verifying cases) - same goes for total death toll. Topped off by the assumption that \u201cactual\u201d numbers are downplayed by CCP officials.   \n=&gt; 2020 Olympics in Japan...\n\nDespite being new (2.5 years) in investing, I\u2019ve always followed my gut/instincts with a logical foundation - pick long term table companies with a history of good management (e.g. MSFT, Visa, Mastercard, McD, Dis) which tends to translate to growth - I\u2019ve also taken calculated risks with my knowledge of PC hardware (e.g. AMD, Western Digital, TSMC). With all the up/downs I\u2019ve experienced, I quickly realized that buying stocks is easy - but waiting (time) is hard. And in this long bull run we\u2019ve had this past decade, it\u2019s easy to get carried away and lose sight of the bigger picture. I\u2019ve felt that the current market is over extended and treading on thin ice; but between global growth slow down, record low interest rates and \u201ctrader euphoria\u201d there is limited room forward and is a disaster waiting to happen. Even Dr Michael Burry himself said passive investing is an \u201cbubble\u201d. You may not agree but I\u2019ve felt that traditional analysis in general no longer reflects \u201creal stock value\u201d anymore; due to the ease and accessibility to the market today. I remember dropping off an inhaler (asthma) for a friend\u2019s brother in high school about an year ago, and saw him with a bunch of friends playing stocks on their smartphones at lunch CASUALLY; these are 14-17 year olds dabbling in stocks with budgets between $100-$2,500. Legalities aside, the investment landscape is changing. I\u2019m quite cautions of the market at this time and have cashed out 80% about an week ago. I\u2019m going to take a little break and observe where nCoV/Markets are headed. Choppy waters ahead...",

IE, it never has had any real capability of being a pandemic because the transmissability of it is far too low in any country with a westernized medicine system.\n\nBird flu never picked up human to human contagion in any meaningful way.\n\nAids? Aids is definitely a real and problematic disease, and it did become a pandemic essentially. But the 10 year incubation period makes it such that it's not  so immediately economically disruptive. It also isn't nearly as transmissible as the new coronavirus still.\n\nSars was a very real risk and threat no doubt, but you can look at the data and see how much more terrifying the Wuhan Coronavirus is already... The #'s blow away Sars already.\n\n**Just being logical here, the Wu-Flu has...**\n\n* Contagion levels on par with most major pandemics across history (most models give it a r0 within the range of 2-4, but data is not great right now). \n* Mortality rate enough to cause a lot of serious damage. Data is tough to figure out here, but the ratio of deaths to recoveries from the data we do have is a bit worrying.\n* No known cure or vaccine right now. \n* Potential of being spreadable from people with mild symptoms.\n\nFWIW, r0 and mortality rate right now are both believed to be higher than what the spanish flu of 1918 was which killed millions. \n\n**Could this Peter Out?**\n\nYup, of course it could. I'm not saying we are 100% going to be facing a global catastrophe here or anything. But at the same point, markets shooting to new all time highs to me points out that people are 100% overlooking this, meanwhile China is in full-blown panic mode. Somewhere, risk is not being priced in effectively. Even if the disease never becomes problematic, the measures that are needed to prevent its spread will be highly damaging economically.",

But, yes you're right there hundreds like datapath, just as there are hundreds like Cloudflare. If you're not willing to pay for AWS, GCP, or Azure, itmeans you're going the cheapest route possible, which might land you with Cloudflare, or much more likely, you'll piece together a bunch of the cheaper services and free services out there to do whatever specific thing you want.

Always log in early so your availability (Skype, Teams, etc) shows green \n2.) Reply to emails and messages quickly \n3.) If workload is low, make sure your deliverables are on fucking point \n4.) Never confide in coworkers (even friends) how little work you actually do\n5.) Ask boss if he/she needs help\n6.) Stay logged on later than your peers. Even if you\u2019re just moving your trackpad every 5 minutes it\u2019ll show that you\u2019re available - e.g. \u201cthat dedicated motherfucker is STILL online?\u201d Meanwhile you\u2019re doing blow and drinking beer while appearing productive \n7.) If your calendar is empty, create false meetings for yourself with no invitees. \n8.) If you MUST do cocaine on the job, be sure the cadence of your voice is not atypical \n\nIf you have any additional questions, check my calendar for availability (spoiler alert - it\u2019s fucking full).",

Then, you seeming intentionally misconstrue my meanings for Netlify and Datapath. [Netlify Edge](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/) and Datapath's cloud-to-cloud are advancements upon CDNs. I was saying that if you're going to pay for something like Cloudflare, you should be doing something more specific or something better that ties in with AWS, GCP, and Azure CDNs. But, yes you're right there hundreds like datapath, just as there are hundreds like Cloudflare. If you're not willing to pay for AWS, GCP, or Azure, itmeans you're going the cheapest route possible, which might land you with Cloudflare, or much more likely, you'll piece together a bunch of the cheaper services and free services out there to do whatever specific thing you want. From what I can tell, Cloudflare is picking up scraps at best, and is getting squeezed in a race to the bottom.",
