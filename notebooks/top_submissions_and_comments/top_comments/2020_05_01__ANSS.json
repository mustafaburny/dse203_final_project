There is a reason why Walmart is yet to realize any benefit despite significant investments. \n\nIndia is going through significant structural issues and the country's current leadership doesn't seem to have a clue on how to shore up its economy and has resorted to divide and discrimination based on religion, region and caste to keep their subjects distracted. There is significant pain in their banking, real state and automobile sectors  which drive bulk of their GDP. There is hardly any growth in India for the last 3-4 years.\n\nEven with COVID, India has hardly done any mass testing for COVID and yet the infection rates are spiking by the day. There is hardly any movement of goods or people across state border and all citizens are quarantined in their homes. The government has done nothing to supplement incomes for their citizens despite a huge population not having a steady job. The last time the government got some money in its coffers, it spend most of it building huge statues of political leaders.\n\nUS and other importers will need to be more cognizant of where they want to shift their supply chains.  India has its own set of major issues and non-inclusive policies by Modi are definitely not helping their case.",

My use of the word casual really means those who *do not really care to become experts at finance and investing on a trading platform*. I feel like it has the potential to be a robust platform for time-sensitive trading, but it feels a bit too infant for that. I love using it for holding, DRIP, or longer term swing trades. Honestly, I give RH 5 stars for my personal use. But, if you're in that boat of people who has $25k+ and don't want to get marked as a pattern day trader, I'd try to be cognizant of the tech and culture behind the platform as well.

Many companies had increased their AWS platforms and expanded their infrastructure to support work from home and home users.    Big players like Netflix expanded their infrastructure on AWS in large numbers to accommodate the increased traffic.    Thinking that Amazon stock was going to tank isn't good sense.  \n\nWhat I expect is that tech companies will start to drop when more layoffs occur in the big business sector.  Small business isn't where tech is making money, they are making it off of the big corporations.   I bought up F5 (FFIV) as much a week or two before their earnings.   Not because of them selling more hardware (more expense, less margin) but based solely of how many corporations had to increase their VPN licenses (minimal overhead and high margin).   This was  a good tech play.   I made off pretty with that one.  I also expect their earnings to tank in Q2 because people will expect them to be high again, but corporations have already purchased licenses to accommodate.   Now they are screwed for probably the next year for licenses alone.   Stock will start to drop because of that.   \n\nTech sector is an interesting one.   Unless I know about the technology and what drives it up/down I don't play in it.   I understood AWS and FFIV working in IT.   Just my two cents.",

I actually had some extra income due to this situation as I work for some wealthy individuals and they asked for some extra help right when the issue hit, but I have to pay off a credit card with 0% interest until November. So I have 10k in assets right now, and 10k that needs to be paid off in November. I am 35 with a family, and we expect to be able to save $1400 per month moving forward as well which includes paying my car payment at 3%, but I live rent free (so I will be able to have another $8.4k to pay off the card). I also have retirement already and put enough in there, so I am not too worried about that. I placed a bit of money in Tesla for 1 week (a friend of mine got in really low talks about it all the time) and I removed it after making some money, just at the right time. I realize I was lucky and want to make the right decisions moving forward. Being as I can make enough to pay off most of my debt, I feel I could be a bit risky. I was contemplating placing about 1k or 2k into the market as I could still double down another 2k if the market goes way down, and then again if it goes down further. Is this the right strategy? 10-20% now knowing I could make that money back by investing more if it crashes? What else should I know? Should I do a Roth IRA now for 2k, or wait until my finances settle....\n\nLastly, I have been using Fidelity as they are already my bank. I like their website, hate their app. I am not locked in to using their services. I tried using Uplift on my phone just to track stocks... hated it. I have heard good things about Sigfig, but did not realize it was not more than a stock tracker and they wanted all my info. Any suggestions on the best app to possibly invest, but at least track stocks would be amazing. I want to do my research. I want to be able to see ratings, graphs,",

It's popular with people just getting started, but it has had a lot of bugs and outages and lacks good features for long term investing (like support for IRAs). Robinhood has been popular for a while because they popularized free trades and a good app. While the latter is subjective, most major brokerages have free trades and apps now. Fidelity is my choice which works well for index funds or individual stocks.",

RH seems great for relatively low stakes and experimenting with day trading in their nice looking app, whereas Fidelity (and Vanguard, and many other brokers) are more meant to be for long term investing and saving for retirement, rather than for day trading.",
