Also a little bit of Bristol Myers.",

Petroteq has achieved net zero pollution in its field almost 30 years ahead of government climate agreements and as far as I know the only one to achieve it. They\u2019ve proven to keep production costs the same as now if they don\u2019t sell the clean sand byproduct, around half of current cost if they do sell the sand. The oil extracted is also viable for Quadrise Fuel MSAR and bioMSAR. Personally, I think these guys are going to be dug into the sector ( much like Apple to PC ) in the future.",

Another company on my list is $INTC (P/E 9.75), their new Alder Lake chips really makes Intel competitive again (as Linus Tech Tips\u2019 review/tests). I really like how Pat (New-ish CEO) is an engineer and is ready to invest in becoming the market leader again. Intel also has a leg up because it designs AND fabs chips, unlike many others. Just for reference, right now $AMD has a P/E of 45.6, $QCOM 20.9, $NXPI 39, and $NVDA at a whopping 108.85. I\u2019m actually in on $MU, who has a P/E of 15",
