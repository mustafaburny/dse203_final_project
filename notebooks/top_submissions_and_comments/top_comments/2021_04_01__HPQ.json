I sold out of PYR at higher prices than current, not going back in unless I see actual revenue announcements.  You can look at my post history for things I hold, I have alot of different stuff.  My fundamental play for EV is playing copper - I own Copper Mountain ([CMMC.TO](https://CMMC.TO)) which had excellent earnings today - I also have my eye on [ARG.TO](https://ARG.TO) and [TKO.TO](https://TKO.TO) to diversify into copper but haven't dived into those as much to see how they compare to CMMC, on the surface they also look good.  I think CMMC is gonna run to around 7 bucks at least in next 3-6 months and is ultimately worth 10 or more next year, but copper prices can take it much higher.  I also have a speculative position in Lordstown Motors but time will tell if I'm right on that one.  I have a few dozen stocks total though in different industries.  Have my eye on Cielo Waste as well for an alternative to Pyrogenesis, might get into that at some point for another environmental play.  Also have looked at Martinrea recently - its cheap, makes alot of money with core business of auto parts/manufacturing and working on batteries using graphene that could be big in the future and if it works could be the play over HPQ Silicon.",

Of course, the point is that the company is best up PLUS there is change happening. That's crucial. Another great things about those type of companies is that they are cheap. And it's really great, I love the hunt, I love the cheapness, I love the dividend, I love big margin of safety. Anyway, my few pics that worked out very well:\n\n**HPE.** People think that this is dying PC and printer company. It is not, that's HPQ. HPE makes hybrid cloud infra and freaking supercomputers. It was scary but I loaded up majorly at $9 a share. Can't complain.\n\n**GM.** You honestly could not mention GM here without being downvoted. You fool, it's all about Tesla, all that. Ok, that peaked my interest. I looked into it. Profitable business, amazing CEO, hard transition to EV only by 2030 and they announced that before it was trendy, making their own batteries, owns leading autonomous driving company, P/E ratio of 5. I mean, I was seriously thinking big I was insane or it everyone else. Been doing great so far.\n\n**HAS.** It's toys company, it's all about video games, it's stupid Boomer toys, yada yada. What I say was portfolio of amazing and loved IP, 3% dividend and P/E ratio of 15 (back then). Plus they own D&amp;D IP which is really hot right, licensing their IP to make video games and bought films studio to produce shows based on their IP. I'm very excited about Hasbro future and top up every time I they pay dividend.\n\n**GD.** Ok nobody said anything bad about GD. Well, nobody gave a shit about GD here ever. I've noticed it when share price was $130 and could not pass that kind of opportunity.\n\nAlright, I'll stop now. To be honest picks above have already played out by now so I'm just bragging at this point. I have a long list of other hated but profitable companies that I'm slowly building position in and I hope they will work out as well as the ones above.",

I remember the one where he refuted Rob McWhirter's comments on BNN even though Rob turned out to be 100% right haha.  I'm more than happy to see this drop in the short term since I've already sold off all my holdings at a higher price - price to revenue too rich for my blood with my rules that ignore emotion -  no firm contracts announced in over 6 months, just hype pressers.  This is the type of stock that will run super hot if they can show one of those many lines of business taking off with actual signed contracts or revenue projections.  Until then you get a lumpy business selling at a huge premium with Peter spending alot of time trying to manage the stock price.  I figure its more likely than not that I jump back in again but companies in hype sectors no longer can maintain their stock price based on faith, need to see some revenue and real profitability (ie. not just appreciation of their holdings in HPQ/Beauce which are not contributing revenues either).",
