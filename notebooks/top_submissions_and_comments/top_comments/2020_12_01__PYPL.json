But it\u2019s also become a meme stock on wallstreetbets.\n\n\u201cHere's the deal. PLTR is a solid, growth company helmed by Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal) and also other billionaires. The company is not hurting for cash, but is still in its early years even though it was founded 15+ years ago. There is tremendous upside in government contracts, and other sectors.\n\nIMO, this stock will be $100+ in a couple of years, but it won't happen overnight. Still a 500% gain in 2-3 years beats the avg 8-10% annual gain of index funds or 2% for savings accounts.\n\nThis is a simple correction due to the recent run from $12 to $30 in a matter of weeks.\n\nNothing fundamentally changed with this business. \n\nHowever, \n\n1) you should ONLY invest money in the stock market that you won't need for any reason for the next 5+ years\n\n2) you should always expect 10-20% pullback in a new position and should have additional funds at your disposal to buy on dips to average down\n\n3) ONLY invest in stocks on which you did your own research and you fundamentally believe in the company's LONG TERM trajectory. This will help you weather short term pull backs and correction and you won't panic sell at the worst time\u201d",

However, some add on information EV is not market cap that\u2019s why the debt is not showing up in mostly income statement based assessment - also this does not show global coverage of PayPal vs Paysafe eg Xoom is big money earner for PayPal and as is their deal with Synchrony for deferred payment etc. these are all critical for valuation purposes and the most important is that Paysafe is not in the most mature market ie US barriers to entry include competition PayPal, Square Affirm and coming up SOFi the markets will get saturated here leaving very little for Paysafe similarly in India and China there are large payment processing companies.\n\nI may be biased but I don\u2019t see Paysafe becoming relevant outside of UK and the challenge is PayPal or Square or others can enter UK a lot more easily meaning Paysafe\u2019s ability to counter will be limited and growth challenges will drive this business into oblivion! Drastic but just to drive the point that these guys will keep showing good margins while eroding market share and become irrelevant in 5 years!\n\nAgain guys I am making a bear case for these guys feel free to challenge my assertions.",

Buying and selling pre-owned games is not a new venture for them.\n  \n&gt;  1  People can (and do) just sell their shit on ebay/craigslist for more, and if you're buying there, you're paying way less.\n\nPeople have been doing that for decades, too.\n\nDon't know about you, but it's not worth my time to bother with taking photos, creating a listing, waiting for the auction to sell, waiting for buyer to pay, finding a box, packing the box, figuring out shipping costs, printing a shipping label, driving to the post office to get it shipped, and then hoping the seller doesn't make a claim with PayPal or eBay and get their money back for no reason, just to score an extra $5.\n\nI'm just going to take this game that I finished to GameStop, and maybe get $10 credit towards the next thing I'm going to grab.  It's instant, and zero extra effort.  \n\n&gt; 2  Digital games are kind of hard to sell at the counter in GameStop.\n\nYet, GameStop is still making money off of Xbox digital game sales.  Without the overhead of retail locations, employees, and other brick and mortar costs.  One of their highest profit percentage categories actually, and something that they are trying to aggressively expand for FY21.",

        "body": "Listen, you have no debt and enough savings to survive if your job disappears (which sounds very unlikely) and you have money doing nothing in savings assuming you have funds being pumped into 401k aND HSA Account also from your paychecks. Since you\u2019re young and time in the market is most important I recommend you play a long term game. Dont worry about price of a stock if you think they still have room to grow so identify a list of your top 5 stock picks (hopefully some are in different sectors) and keep pumping money into them every 2 weeks just like your 401k is being pumped by your paychecks. If a stock you chose dumps significantly go double down on it to drop your average (Lookup dollar cost averaging or DCA). Now that you understand this strategy what stocks?\n\nWell you seem to work for a cyber company so lets invest in some cyber companies since you know how they operate and with latest cyber attacks which will continue. \n\nMy cyber pick is $NET, sitting at $25B I think in 5 years we can see $125b to $150b. \n\nOnline gambling with sports due to new covid restrictions will make DKNG and Penn huge\n\nNow covid opened a gateway to health and bio research boost. \nMy online health growth stock is $TDOC which my company uses and is cheaper and efficient for all your medical needs and as a virtual health tech platform and especially as companies shift to using it. Easily a $250 stock in 5 years. \n\nTechnology is huge with software and data, with AI being a growth engine. \nMy stock picks are more than just 1 since prices of some are either too overpriced or revenue isn\u2019t there yet; SNOW, AI, PLTR, WDAY\n\nSocial media stock choices and streaming since we all know these platforms are great for company growth and marketing; SNAP, ROKU, and PINS. Disney is cheap to because they will find a way out of their amusement park hole from covid. \n\nCurrency related platforms through which money securely transfers from one user to the next; $SQ (owns cash app) and also invest in Bitcoin when it dips, throw in paypal if you think they have room still. \n\n\nThen of course meme stocks throw in a few stacks at EV stocks (TSLA, nio, etc) and bio stocks. \n\nSafe plays could be banks since they are cheap but your risk is low since you are young so dont throw much at safe plays but hold some to balance portfolio\n\nI know i threw a whole bunch of stocks but choose whichever sectors you understand and use and are bullish on for long term. The goal is to hold and buy more and double down if there ever is a significant dip (10%+)",
