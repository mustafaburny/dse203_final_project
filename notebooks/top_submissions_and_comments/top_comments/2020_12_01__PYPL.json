But it\u2019s also become a meme stock on wallstreetbets.\n\n\u201cHere's the deal. PLTR is a solid, growth company helmed by Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal) and also other billionaires. The company is not hurting for cash, but is still in its early years even though it was founded 15+ years ago. There is tremendous upside in government contracts, and other sectors.\n\nIMO, this stock will be $100+ in a couple of years, but it won't happen overnight. Still a 500% gain in 2-3 years beats the avg 8-10% annual gain of index funds or 2% for savings accounts.\n\nThis is a simple correction due to the recent run from $12 to $30 in a matter of weeks.\n\nNothing fundamentally changed with this business. \n\nHowever, \n\n1) you should ONLY invest money in the stock market that you won't need for any reason for the next 5+ years\n\n2) you should always expect 10-20% pullback in a new position and should have additional funds at your disposal to buy on dips to average down\n\n3) ONLY invest in stocks on which you did your own research and you fundamentally believe in the company's LONG TERM trajectory. This will help you weather short term pull backs and correction and you won't panic sell at the worst time\u201d",

The leader in AI, which I expect will be further monetized in the next 10 years\n4. Alibaba - Chinese Amazon. Invested heavily in EVs\n5. Apple - Apple products not going away. Huge potential to gain market share across the globe\n6. Visa/Mastercard - FinTech will be huge. Could even see them acquiring PayPal/Square\n7. Tesla - If this turns out to be true it won't be because of the cars\n8. Johnson &amp; Johnson\n9. Walmart \n10. NVIDIA",

Stock picking is mostly a speculation, a speculation on the companies performance moving forward in the next 3 - 12 months and beyond depending on where your goals lie and how much you believe in said company based on historical data and investor sentiment. In short you are betting the company will perform or continue to innovate within its sector in some way in the coming years, with that you also have to be aware a lot of costs are priced in way ahead of time. I would not purchase cdprojekt, instead I would personally look and assess where the world is moving towards or has potential to. Personally I would recommend researching fintech stocks such as stone co, paypal, Square which stand to gain during this period, and beyond due to continued bitcoin pressure. And if not then an ETF might be best for you. The amount of money you have also isn't very much so I would be very careful. An etf likely is the safest option long term and at a cheaper entry point in most cases",

However, some add on information EV is not market cap that\u2019s why the debt is not showing up in mostly income statement based assessment - also this does not show global coverage of PayPal vs Paysafe eg Xoom is big money earner for PayPal and as is their deal with Synchrony for deferred payment etc. these are all critical for valuation purposes and the most important is that Paysafe is not in the most mature market ie US barriers to entry include competition PayPal, Square Affirm and coming up SOFi the markets will get saturated here leaving very little for Paysafe similarly in India and China there are large payment processing companies.\n\nI may be biased but I don\u2019t see Paysafe becoming relevant outside of UK and the challenge is PayPal or Square or others can enter UK a lot more easily meaning Paysafe\u2019s ability to counter will be limited and growth challenges will drive this business into oblivion! Drastic but just to drive the point that these guys will keep showing good margins while eroding market share and become irrelevant in 5 years!\n\nAgain guys I am making a bear case for these guys feel free to challenge my assertions.",

But it\u2019s also become a meme stock on wallstreetbets.\n\n\u201cHere's the deal. PLTR is a solid, growth company helmed by Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal) and also other billionaires. The company is not hurting for cash, but is still in its early years even though it was founded 15+ years ago. There is tremendous upside in government contracts, and other sectors.\n\nIMO, this stock will be $100+ in a couple of years, but it won't happen overnight. Still a 500% gain in 2-3 years beats the avg 8-10% annual gain of index funds or 2% for savings accounts.\n\nThis is a simple correction due to the recent run from $12 to $30 in a matter of weeks.\n\nNothing fundamentally changed with this business. \n\nHowever, \n\n1) you should ONLY invest money in the stock market that you won't need for any reason for the next 5+ years\n\n2) you should always expect 10-20% pullback in a new position and should have additional funds at your disposal to buy on dips to average down\n\n3) ONLY invest in stocks on which you did your own research and you fundamentally believe in the company's LONG TERM trajectory. This will help you weather short term pull backs and correction and you won't panic sell at the worst time\u201d",

Huge potential to gain market share across the globe\n6. Visa/Mastercard - FinTech will be huge. Could even see them acquiring PayPal/Square\n7.

PYPL has some T&amp;E exposure and SQ would assume so on the merchant side. But, look at the results. Any potential T&amp;E headwind has been offset by strong results in other parts of the business. I think PYPL and SQ will keep doing well in 2021 and beyond. V is a hold and is why I haven't done anything, but not a strong buy. Other V bulls disagree and that's healthy debate, but I personally worry about travel.",

SQ, I might trade in and out of.\n\nPYPL - I use their services every once in a while, but never looked at them from investing point of view.\n\nThere are also some new entrants.

The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase.

        "body": "&gt; Second, the majority of exchanges these days aren\u2019t sketchy. They are regulated \n\nFor real?  I understood Bitcoin is still unregulated.  Are you absolutely sure about that?\n\n&gt; Is PayPal sketchy?\n\n\nWell, from my experiencing using it to sell things, hell yes, PayPal is sketchy.  They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it\u2019s easy from there; what task isn\u2019t tough at first?It\u2019s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it\u2019s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",

And people willing to take risks. And connections. \n\nInvestors don\u2019t sit passively by - they help start ups have the funds to pay employees, they make introductions to prospective clients, they can help advise how to navigate the market.\n\nBill ackman and other public investors in more boring ways do this by providing funds.\n\nLet\u2019s take Warren buffet - a standard thing he does is help companies that are struggling get financing (I.e money to fund future operations and pay employees) by taking a stake and lending cash.

The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase. Why can't we have it globally?",

        "body": "&gt; Second, the majority of exchanges these days aren\u2019t sketchy. They are regulated \n\nFor real?  I understood Bitcoin is still unregulated.  Are you absolutely sure about that?\n\n&gt; Is PayPal sketchy?\n\n\nWell, from my experiencing using it to sell things, hell yes, PayPal is sketchy.  They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it\u2019s easy from there; what task isn\u2019t tough at first?It\u2019s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it\u2019s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",

        "body": "&gt; why someone would want to use Bitcoin as opposed to cash on PayPal?\n\nYou're asking the wrong question. The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase. Why can't we have it globally?",
