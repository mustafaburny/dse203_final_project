But most are no longer around. The list is long. Very few companies in America will not be taken over or bought out garage sale style, stripped and became a total different company.  Google sits where Silicon Graphics sat. It went bankrupt. Apple had all kinds of problems trying to survive as a computer company.\n\nThere are brick and mortar companies you need everyday, Clorox, coffee, diapers that pays you dividend unstopped for 30-40 years. Clorox is a 120 year old company. They are predicable and you can hold them another 30 years if you want. Good luck.",

I hold mostly nvda and AMD both in my robinhood and my IRA in td and rarely sell. I have a little msft and wdc in the mix. That's it. I doubt anyone with more knowledge would approve of my allocations. It makes me money, but is probably on the risky side. Hopefully someone with more knowledge will step in and answer for you.",

In my builds I used AMD processors, nvda graphic cards, wdc hard drives, and msft os.  Those companies are still going strong today so I figured I'd do pretty well with those companies in my portfolio. I was correct. I'm doing way better than I would have ever expected.
