I usually BTFD much more than I did yesterday, but getting harder to do when you already have done that and your all in and got to leave some margin space. \n\nDid pick up a little more SOFI CRSR BAC GOOG SWKS and NVDA. Sold a couple CSPs and 2 $TTCF $20 2023 LEAPS and now consider that a fully built out position. \n\nLooking forward to a big green ass Friday before PTO ends and back to the office Monday\n\n\u270c\ufe0f\n\nEdit I was checking trending on Yahoo and came across a fun ticker.

The sector of semiconductors has a lot of companies but they can all be successful and have huge business due to the size of the market. Semiconductors/microchips whatever you wanna call them are literally in everything we buy now except food/water (hopefully? Lol). \n\n\n\nI'm long Gas/Oil (XOM, COP) and Semiconductors the next couple years. Steel is a great play too, my favorite being CLF or NUE. I know the hype with electric vehicles but there are so many more aspects to oil/gas than cars. Gas/oil is going to be needed in large quantities for a decent amount of time ahead of us.",
