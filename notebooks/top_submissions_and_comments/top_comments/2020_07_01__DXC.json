        "body": "Great stuff. Thanks for sharing.\n\nOn DXC, I think the investor has low conviction on where shares trade a month from now. So investor buys puts tight to current trading price and sells call a corresponding amount of calls to make it costless. Ideally shares go up and investor makes 10% or $15 mil plus any dividends. If shares go down, investor keeps dividends and tries again in August.\n\nJust out of curiosity, how did you know the investor is holding $150 mil in shares? And is there a good way to screen for unusual option activity? Great finds tho",

Things have been opening up again, so Q3 earnings will start to confirm whether this really is looking like a \"V-shaped\" recovery or not.\n\nYes, I know people already have their opinions.  I'm just saying that if you want to have actual numbers for a hypothetical V-shaped economic change, you need the upslope of the V and not just the downslope.  People are buying stocks based on what they think the future holds, not the present.  It won't be until that future starts to get revealed that their behavior is confirmed or refuted.\n\nIf 3Q is bad then I could see a big correction, but we're talking October at that point.\n\nAny likely bad news in 2Q is largely already old news in the minds of investors.",

For all we know airlines will continue lower. It's pretty certain that airlines will simply be smaller companies for the next 3-5 years.\n* Tech/growth stocks have bounced back quickly in a V shape since the market crash. Are you going to let a few weeks of volatile market data be the deciding factor with regard to a long-term investment decision? What if tech/growth stocks crash next week?\n* Dominion fell on the news of their divestiture to Buffet. This tells me that Buffet had the better end of that deal.\n* If you're only 50% weighted into BRK, you should still have decent diversification if the rest of your portfolio is invested in broad index funds. VTI or VUG would compliment BRK well.",

Looks like your E/V weighting is calculated using book value of equity instead of market value. Fama-French and CAPM are designed to estimate the returns public investors require given the risk they're taking on, so if you're using one of those for CoE, you should use market cap for your E/V calculation. This should give you a WACC much closer to 12%, which might bring the intrinsic value per share down around the actual price. \n\nWords, yo. How do they work?",

In a world where everything is built on credit and money is being printed like crazy, it shouldn't be considered crazy to invest in btc as an insurance.\n\nI get a lot of people mention gold. I love and hold quite a bit of precious metals as well, however seeing how the future generations are much more in tune with technology, they may be more inclined to stick with digital currencies instead of gold. My biggest paranoid with gold sometimes is buying fakes.... This issue doesn't really occur with bitcoin as long as you're not buying bitcoin gold or something stupid.\n\nAnother reason why bitcoin may be worthwhile to consider is the market cap at where it's at right now. Currently bitcoins market cap is almost half the size of Tesla. Sure it looks expensive at 13k CAD each but in the grand scheme of things, it could actually be extremely undervalued.\n\nThere are around 44 million millionaires in the world right now and there will only be a fixed cap of 21 million bitcoins. So in reality there isn't enough bitcoins to go around for every millionaire there is. Not to mention much of the original bitcoins have been lost in the early days. \n\nAnother thing I look at is the direction of how governments are treating crypto. PayPal, Goldman Sachs and visa are all looking to hire ethereum developers. The US federal reserve is endorsing an eth-backed alternative to LIBOR. I think these news are a positive tailwind for this asset class.\n\nEdit: corrected number of millionaires",
