        "body": "Great stuff. Thanks for sharing.\n\nOn DXC, I think the investor has low conviction on where shares trade a month from now. So investor buys puts tight to current trading price and sells call a corresponding amount of calls to make it costless. Ideally shares go up and investor makes 10% or $15 mil plus any dividends. If shares go down, investor keeps dividends and tries again in August.\n\nJust out of curiosity, how did you know the investor is holding $150 mil in shares? And is there a good way to screen for unusual option activity? Great finds tho",
