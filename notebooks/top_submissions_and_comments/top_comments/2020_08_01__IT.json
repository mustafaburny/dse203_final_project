That hurts their constituency, rich people and business owners, harder than it hits middle and lower class groups. That's simply because rich people are not huge consumers and don't create a lot of demand (Most people only eat 2 meals per day). Poor and middle class people are big consumers as there are A LOT more of them. \n\nIn other words, big stimulus can cause inflation. One which democrats are pushing for and are likely to get into power in 5.5 months.\n\nThat and a weak dollar can cause inflation. \n\nI know there is a bunch of pressure to keep the dollar from inflating. These are just two market forces that can cause inflation to pass the typical 1.5% rate.",

Getting rid of all low float tickers is more censorship which everyone seems to whine about.\n\nSecondly, covid had a large effect on the user count. A lot of bored people at home decided to try to learn how to trade pennies, which gave us an influx of users. Then, as people became uninterested, many of them stopped checking the subreddit frequently but they are still subscribed to the subreddit. This would explain the decrease in users online.\n\nAlso, when you mention \u201cgambling\u201d, THE WHOLE STOCK MARKET IS A GAMBLE. Whether that be buying Apple or Microsoft or buying a low float penny, it is all gambling and speculation. That is the nature of the stock market.

Stop blaming the subreddit and mods for removing spam posts because you \u201cmissed out on a stock\u201d.

When everyone is expecting the worst, even a mediocre Q3 guidance will beat expectations.  Both EURN and DHT should let us know what % of Q3 has been booked and at what rates.\n\nCompare the August $5 DHT calls delta to your typical YOLO.  A delta of 1.0 means you own 100% of the upside.  I also like the potential upside of EURNs $10 calls for the run up to exdividend.  I\u2019d be hesitant to have a EURN calls all the way out to November.  The dividend should be paid in September.
