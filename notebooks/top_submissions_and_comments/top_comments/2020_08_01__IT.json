At the age of 22, you've made a wise decision to discuss the state you're in, and seek some advice. \nYes, you've lost a decent amount of money and it's spoiled some plans. You've made and saved that money in the past, and you can save it again.  \nSimple answer, I think you need a break from trading. Let's discuss together what you're currently in (GNUS and XSPA only?), and as a community, let's give this guy some GOOD advice as to sell, or hold.  \nCan we do this right please guys.  Reddit can help here, as a collective community.  \nThis is a bit of a dark cloud here, but things will get brighter no matter what. If you've got family, you're healthy, and you've got a job to call in sick for, you're a leg up on half the world.  You seem level headed enough to acknowledge these mistakes, so I'd hedge a bet you can rely on family if need be. You've got options, so please don't be doing anything extreme here.  Tomorrow will be a new day, and we'll use that day to improve your standing.  \nKeep your head up friend.",

        "body": "Eh, I hear you, but this isn't an honest accounting of it.\n\nTesla's pulling some strings with accounting, but it's not like they can't pull the strings the other way, and they have plenty of time to do so. They're going through rapid, rapid expansion right now, and the potential for them from pivots is very real.\n\n\\- Their battery tech is way ahead. Right now they're supply constrained, but ramping up quickly. I would fully expect them to make an almost 1:1 switch from revenue from green credits to being a battery *supplier* as other car manufacturers get into EVs.\n\n\\- They already operate the largest public charging network in the world. This actually *benefits* them as other manufacturers move into EV.\n\n\\- They also benefit from [the Starbucks effect](https://aipcommercialrealestate.com/the-starbucks-effect) as other companies move into the EV market and drive EV acceptance.\n\n\\- They're making a heavy, heavy bet on autonomous driving. Right now, I put them behind Waymo, but ahead of most other players in the market. And they're absolutely 100% ahead when it comes to eventually building fleet-scale autonomous, and financially way, way ahead as they pursue doing it with lease returns. (Waymo will get to an autonomous fleet quicker, but Tesla will do it cheaper.)\n\nAll of this means you can't evaluate Tesla as if it's an automaker running in the red. It's an automaker, *plus* a battery supplier, *plus* a fueling station operator, *plus* a potential rideshare operator. Plus like five other things.\n\nMeanwhile, car revenue for them is constrained from the supply side, not the demand side. They have **four** factories under construction at this very moment\u2014 Nevada, Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin \u2014 with yet another one on the way. \n\nAnd those green credits? Cadillac isn't even coming out with the Lyriq until 2022. Volkswagen is having production issues and hasn't delivered a single ID3 yet, despite promising 100,000 this year. That's how far behind everyone else is.\n\nYes, everything you've said is completely valid. But it's an incomplete picture.\n\nThat said, are they still overvalued? Yes, absolutely.",

That means after revenue, expenses, shipping, staffing, warehouses, operations, etc etc etc, he was almost 100% correct by the time we get to Operating Income. \n\nSo how did he screw up so badly in the next few lines of the earnings when we got to EPS?  How did we swing from essentially his estimate of 76c/share (or his later $1.21 estimate) down to a significant loss? \n\nThe answer lies in the warrants. So long as the warrants exist, the company must mark-to-market them as a type of liability against the company. The company sold these options, basically, to the market. As PRPL stock price goes up, those options go up in value, which means the income statement has to value the change in value of those warrants as a loss (or gain, if their value falls). The higher PRPL goes, the more those warrants / options are worth, and the more PRPL owes to whoever holds them. \n\nSo that autist was mostly right, the company is literally printing money, they're running a tight streamlined ship, cutting expenses, making the most out of every sale, and more. But he totally lost the ball when it came to the warrants and how they'd affect the balance sheet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuckily when the stock stays above $24 for a month, I \\*think\\* they can basically force people to trade them in for shares (??) and can stop booking a loss and instead just increase their share count.

In addition, a substantial majority of our free customers historically have not converted to paying customers and we expect this will continue in the future.\n2. The term of our current agreement with Baidu expires at the end of 2020. Since the on-going tensions between US and China might have an affect on this agreement.\n3. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\n4. Sales and Marketing Expenses are increasing at a rapid pace\n5. Their competitors are well established and they always pose a threat, see below the list of them in each domain\n   1. On-premise hardware network vendors, such as Cisco Systems Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., FireEye, Inc., Imperva, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., and Riverbed Technology, Inc.;\n   2. Point-cloud solution vendors, including cloud security vendors such as Zscaler, Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. through Umbrella (formerly known as OpenDNS), content delivery network vendors such as Akamai Technologies, Inc., Limelight Networks, Inc., Fastly, Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc. through Edgecast, domain name system vendors services such as Oracle Corporation through DYN, NeuStar, Inc., and UltraDNS Corporation, and cloud SD-WAN vendors\n   3.

Cloudflare and google collectively did a research on Browser Isolation. Even though, the results weren't promising, they are working towards it.   \n\n\nAlso, a key point to note is, Cloudflare leverages the idle network bandwidth to provide the free service to their customers since the highest priority is given to enterprise customers. By doing so, they were able to increase their exposure as well as establish more routes that been said, they want these customers to at least go for pay-as-you-go subscription which might help Cloudflare in terms of revenue.",

        "body": "This was EXACTLY what I was thinking. I was about to post this today in the morning.\n\nWith earnings on August 12 after market, here's the CISCO earnings run-up play for you.\n\nCisco is the biggest network hardware provider of the world, but they've been heavily expanding into software and subscription based services (think continual revenue and high margin). Cisco primarly sells network hardware like those little white boxes (access points) you randomly see on the ceiling in schools. It's so hard to describe what Cisco does because its reach is too far and too wide, but here goes nothing.\n\n1. Networking hardware\n\nMost expensive hardware (network switches, access points, and even office phones). They're also the biggest brand. Competitors include Arista, Juniper, Extreme Networks. They all released earnings and beat expectations. Arista did go down after earnings, but it had a really nice run-up and this is a run-up play. \n\n2. Cisco Webex - Webconferencing\n\nProbably the biggest reason for growth is Cisco's Webex. While Zoom and to a lesser extent Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have taken over webconferencing, there's plenty of pie to go around and that's where Webex has come in. From what I researched, it's not particularly great, but it's better than nothing. They tripled growth in WebEx from February to April according to their last earnings report. It's the most related search topic that's trending for Cisco.\n\n3. Cisco Anyconnect - Connect to work network\n\nWith work from home still very much a thing, workers need a secure way to connect to the hospital, college, or business networks. That's where Cisco Anyconnect VPN comes in. I'd say Honestly, there's not really much competition in this area.\n\n4. Security - Cisco Duo and Umbrella\n\nCisco has MFA (multi-factor authentification) for password security. This is taking over more and more especially in universities as you've probably had to annoyingly authenticate logging in using your phone. Cisco Umbrella helps businesses filter websites that are known to have malware. You probably know it as filtering gambling and porn websites. \n\n5. Institutional Ownership\n\nDidn't dig too deep here but Raymond James and Associates are making a big bet on it.  Cisco is their second biggest bet of the quarter after Apple. In the previous quarter, they held a total of 14,069,764 shares (through shares and calls) and now have 15,048,139 (through shares and calls). Since they've bought it, the price has not increased much so they definitely seem to believe in the growth here.\n\n6. Pricing\n\nCisco is still trading slightly below its pre-covid price of 49. It did well last earnings with 0.79 EPS and now it's expected to do 0.74 EPS this quarter. Comparatively, most of its competitors have already seen pre-covid prices at some point or another. \n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:\\*\\* 48C - Aug 21. Sell before earnings. (Hold through at your own risk.)\n\nDisclaimer: I am the furthest thing from a professional of any kind.",
