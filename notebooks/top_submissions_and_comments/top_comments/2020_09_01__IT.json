So in theory, if you were to exercise this call, the shares would have to be at least $39.79 for you to \"break even\" considering the premium you paid.\n\nHowever, since you've got like 4 months until expiry, the value of the contract is more than the difference between the strike and the market price. That difference is called \"extrinsic value.\"\n\nFor whatever reason, your contracts are worth more now (market forces, speculation, etc.). Someone who pays $5.03 for that call breaks even at $41.03 for the same reason as what I outlined above.\n\nHope this clarifies for you. Think of it this way - a plate of chicken wings cost $10, but you have a coupon to buy them for $8. That coupon is intrinsically worth $2. The right to buy wings at $8 when they cost $10 is worth $2 intrinsically.\n\nEdit: Holy karma and awards. Thank you, all!",

        "body": "Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people.",

They didn't rebut shit, lmao. For the hydrogen cell tech, they just reiterated their position that a \"leading academic institution\" is developing it for them, which is EXACTLY what Hindenburg pointed out as being sus. \n\n3. They also just confirmed that their Head of Hydrogen Infrastructure Development, Dave Prowl, and his Director, Travis Milton, are glue-sniffers with EXACTLY the same shit qualifications that Hindenburg accused them of having. And although they tried to spin it as these two being experts in logistics or something, and NKLA bravely stepping up to their defense, that failed miserably.\n\nOverall, reading this shit made me think of how I used to write my resumes and job applications when I was in uni.

It started about 6 months before the giant dot-com crash... platforms like E-Trade and Ameritrade were popping up, giving new, unsophisticated investors access to the market... People threw around words like \"The new economy\", and \"fundamentals no longer matter\"... And they were right....... Until they weren't.\n\nI remember Warren  Buffet standing there scratching his head, telling people the rules hadn't changed, and to be careful.  He said he refused to invest in companies if he didn't understand why they had crazy valuations. Everyone said he was an irrelevant dinosaur. They told him to sit down, because this was no longer his expertise. It was a giant party.. stonks only going up.. POTENTIAL was the only thing that mattered.. Nobody cared about earnings anymore as long as the company was involved with cool shit. Buy Buy Buy!!!! \n\nThe hedge funds were already positioned to play the crash, and ended up being the ones to laugh all the way to the bank when the dust finally settled. They took everyone's money.\n\nAnd Warren Buffet? That crazy son of a bitch who said it was all bullshit and told people to be careful, while literally EVERYONE laughed?  Yeah.. that guy didn't get wiped out.\n\nI know you kids were all in diapers when that happened... But I've seen this movie before. You won't be able to time it.. and you won't even recognize the crash when it starts.  But you WILL get wiped out by the big money pulling the strings. They'll take every dime you've got, while you try to time it, and fail to recognize it for what it is.\n\nFundamentals are the only thing that matters, except during a bubble.",

        "body": "i was born and raised in south phoenix and lived here my whole life, almost 30 years. while i love this neighborhood and i wouldn't live anywhere else, i understand that it is the ugliest, dirtiest, poorest and most ghetto part of metropolitan phoenix (maybe Maryvalle is worse now that i think about it). nothing good has ever came from this neighborhood except maybe some rapper in laveen that got shot and killed a few years ago, idk if he was any good, rap isn't my thing. anyway, my point is that that the schools suck, crime sucks, the houses are all old and the rare new construction is cheaply made.\n\nso when i hear a friend of mine made 5 figures on NKLA calls i investigate the company. and lo and behold it's headquarters are right here in my neck of the woods. 40th street and broadway. when i tell you that this industrial park is in one of the worst parts of town i mean that there are hookers walking up and down this area of broadway road every night, boarded up houses with shot up facades, vacant lots behind tagged alleys with burned cactus that some poor tweaker tried to light up to stay warm during winter.\n\ni drove by a few weeks ago on a random wednesday afternoon and the parking lot was less than a quarter full of cars. a \"delivery entrance\" that was taped off for some reason, and no real sign of life. \n\ni'm not some huge shortseller like hindenburg i'm just their neighbor, and no multi-billion dollar tech startup is gonna be here no matter how cheap the real estate is.\n\n10 upvotes and i'll go walk into their front office and ask for a job application and say \"i want to be the guy that pushes the cars down the hill\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNKLA  **9/18/20 25P**",
