I flip through old pictures. It's her. For a moment, I can almost smell her in the room. Lavender, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.\n\nI open a browser and check the S&amp;P futures. 3536. It hasn't moved in decades now, it would seem. But I keep checking. I don't know why. Maybe the repetition takes my mind off things, or maybe it just reminds me of the old days.

It keeps going on for a  few days for many biotech stocks but there is a certain stock X where  the volume keeps increasing but the price isn't increasing similar to  others.\n\nNow in this case, that is  an anomaly or an unusual pattern. What might be happening is rich folks  getting large positions in X and they are pretty sure that it's gonna  rocket in near future. This is what this tool tries to catch - stocks  that behave abnormal relative to the entire stock market.\n\nThat's all you need to know, the technicals are not necessary.\n\nHope this makes more sense.",

Now it's like \"DEFCON-1\" or something. \n\nHonestly, understand your risk tolerance and the risk in your portfolio, don't invest more than you're comfortable with, don't get complacent, take *some* profit into strength at times and patiently wait to redeploy. Have a *long-term* plan and stick to it. Don't try and avoid every bit of potential turbulence, don't just sell everything every time there *might* be volatility (periods like March are times when there's great opportunities, they're not something to be completely avoided; if you avoid situations that cause market volatility and only get back in when everything is a-okay again, you're actively choosing to avoid opportunities) and honestly, \"selling everything\" is something that someone should do very, very rarely if ever but it seems to be a more and more common thing on here.\n\nI've posted this what feels hundreds of times on here: \"\u201cFar more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\u201d - Peter Lynch. It's really, *really* true and this sub over the last 5 years has often been a fantastic example of it.",

Obviously, you can gain quite a bit from it as well. I know you're already locked in to that...but I would highly suggest playing around with \\~$300 or so to get a feel of how options work before diving head first into a large position (as you have.) Find a ticker that has options with low premiums (WORK is a good one, for example) and test the waters there. From there, you'll learn about how all of this works -- what constitutes as high IV, the effect of theta, etc. Once you get a good (if even possible) grasp on all of this...then you are ready to go. That being said, that Tesla call could very well make you a lot of money. It could also very well lose you a lot of money. Godspeed young one.",

        "body": "Daily Market and Options Summary for Sept 1st, 2020\n\nDaily Synopsis\n\n* The S&amp;P 500 (+0.8%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) rallied to fresh record highs on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq getting an added boost from the momentum in the mega-caps and growth stocks. The wealth spread around to the Russell 2000 (+1.1%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%), too.\n* Today's key moves were Apple (AAPL 134.18, +5.14, +4.0%) rising 4% after JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock to $150 from $115, and Zoom Video (ZM 457.69, +132.59, +40.8%) surging 40% after it crushed Q2 earnings expectations.\n* Apple was a major factor in today's index gains given its 7.3% weight in the S&amp;P 500, while Zoom provided the fuel for other growth stocks like Netflix (NFLX 556.55, +26.99, +5.1%) and DocuSign (DOCU 268.80, +45.80, +20.5%). Another supporting factor was the ISM Manufacturing Index for August increasing to 56.0% (consensus 54.5%) from 54.2% in July.\n* The manufacturing data helped lift the S&amp;P 500 materials (+2.8%) and industrials (+1.0%) sectors into positive territory with the information technology (+1.9%), communication services (+1.0%), and consumer discretionary (+1.1%) sectors. Each advanced at least 1.0%.\n* Conversely, the utilities (-1.1%), health care (-1.0%), and energy (-0.9%) sectors underperformed and declined around 1.0%.\n* Recapping some other mega-cap moves, Walmart (WMT 147.59, +8.74, +6.3%) climbed 6% after officially introducing its Walmart+ membership program. Tesla (TSLA 475.05, -23.27, -4.7%), however, was a notable holdout after the company disclosed plans to sell up to $5 billion in stock.\n* U.S. Treasuries ended the day higher after reclaiming overnight losses. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.11%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 92.34 after being down 0.4% in the morning. WTI crude futures increased 0.3%, or $0.14, to $42.76/bbl.\n* Looking ahead, investors will receive the ADP Employment Change Report for August, the Fed's Beige Book, Factory Orders for July, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, and auto and truck sales for August on Wednesday.\n\nIndex Summary\n\n**S&amp;P 500 :** (+0.94%);  **NasDaq :** (+1.72%);  \n**Russell 2000 :**(+1.15%);  **Dow :**(+0.88%);  \n\\*\\*Vix :\\*\\*26.12 -0.29 (-1.1%)\n\nSector Summary -\n\n(1-day %), \\[5-day %\\], {10-day %}\n\n***Currency -***  \n\\*\\*USD Index :\\*\\*92.131 (-0.31%); \\[-1.24%\\]; {-1.5%}; \\*\\*BC :\\*\\*11835 (+1.77%); \\[+4.92%\\]; {+2.99%}\n\n***Precious Metals -***  \n\\*\\*Gold :\\*\\*1978.6 (+0.94%); \\[+2.91%\\]; {+3.23%} ; \\*\\*Silver :\\*\\*28.594 (+1.91%); \\[+6.23%\\]; {+9.1%}\n\n***Farming -***  \n\\*\\*Soybeans :\\*\\*953.5(-0.29%); \\[+1.44%\\]; {+5.55%}; \\*\\*Corn :\\*\\*357.75(-1.12%); \\[-1.12%\\]; {+3.74%};  \n\\*\\*Coffee :\\*\\*129.05(+2.36%); \\[+7.44%\\]; {+9.99%}\n\n***Industrials -***  \n\\*\\*Crude :\\*\\*42.61 (+1.17%); \\[-0.65%\\]; {+1.82%}; \\*\\*Nat Gas :\\*\\*2.63 (-1.03%); \\[+5.77%\\]; {+6.33%}  \n\\*\\*Copper :\\*\\*3.0615 (+0.18%); \\[+3.63%\\]; {+5.27%}\n\nOptions Fast Facts\n\n***CBOE Put/Call Ratio - 0.45***  \n***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** GOGO with 4263x the ADV of 72004.
