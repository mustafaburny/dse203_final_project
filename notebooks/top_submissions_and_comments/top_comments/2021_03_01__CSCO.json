        "body": "When comparing RKT and UWMC, people are overlooking the ridiculously strong seller's market that is happening now.  Buyers will jump through hoops to get a house right now, and sellers want to close as quickly as possible.  UWMC is known for getting through underwriting faster and is easier to work with for agents.  With houses selling over listing price due to competition between buyers, there is now a lot of pressure on buyers to make escrow as fast and smooth as possible.  While increased revenue from this change will happen next quarter, the March 15th deadline for brokers to pledge fidelity to UWMC will allow UWMC to forecast increased revenue at the upcoming Earnings Report.  \n\n15 $9C for 5/21",

To the moon!!\u201d\n\nNo. This is idiotic. Some of the largest asset managers in the world are Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity, State Street, Schwab, and T. Rowe. A huge percentage of their businesses are passive funds and ETFs. They buy whatever the index creator tells them to. If their ETF gets inflows they buy more. If it gets outflows they sell. They don\u2019t \u201clike the stock,\u201d they don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t make more money if the stock goes up or down. They own EVERY SINGLE STOCK IN THE MARKET. \n\nMost of these firms also have ACTIVE funds, which are actively managed and trying to beat an index. If an actively managed fund buys a stock, they like it. These are a smaller part of most of their businesses (T. Rowe and Fido still have big active businesses) Cathie Wood runs active funds. When she buys or sells, it matters! \n\nGenerally speaking active funds buying stocks is a \u201cgood sign\u201d (although they\u2019re obviously not always right). Passive investors buying or selling stock is no sign unless they\u2019re doing it because of new index inclusion which are well known in advance (see TSLA). \n\nA lot of passive investors in a low float stock actually IS a hypothetical good set up for a gamma or short squeeze. This is because they are indifferent to price. If Vanguard owns 95% of a stock in its passive funds and it goes up 1000% they... do nothing. The more passive investors in a smaller market cap stock the more retail trading effects pricing because there are few natural sellers (it is price inelastic) \nGood thread here: https://twitter.com/macrocephalopod/status/1362758036188758016?s=20\n\nHowever! This may only be the case between rebalances. XRT is an \u201cequal weighted ETF\u201d for example that rebalances every quarter. It will sell some of the best performers and buy some of the worst performers. \nOn the other hand S&amp;P 500 is market cap weighted index. It\u2019s rebalances are more about additions/exclusions. \n\nAnyway, generally speaking, stop saying sht like \u201cBlackrock (a multi *trillion* dollar manager) bought $3 *million* dollars of this stock\u201d and stop thinking it means anything unless you want to lose all of your money.",

People need to go to jail for this. \n\nI just emptied all my cash reserves into Fidelity, because even at $270, it's a bargain and I want to watch the fucking HF's burn. Burn.\n\nFull disclosure, part of why I'm pissed is that I was trying to do market buy for 135 shares when it got close to 200, but Fidelity glitched, and when I refreshed I forgot to set it back to \"buy\". I fucked it up and hit market sell. And even though the price was at $203, they sold for $180.00 for some goddamn reason. By the time I realized my mistake it was back up to $223 and I bought back in, but I essentially just jizzed $7k into the wind. I know this is my own fucking fault, but I was trying to do my part, and I fucked it up. I think I may have been the literal lowest sale price of the day.",

        "body": "To play devil\u2019s advocate here: Many people don\u2019t get excited about dips because they don\u2019t have any money, or very much money sitting on the sidelines. I see advice on here all the time telling people to not attempt timing the market. People point to studies saying \u201clump sum investing beats trying to time the market\u201d. So lots of people buy ETFs or index funds of various sorts and \u201clump sum\u201d invest. If they don\u2019t have years of experience behind them, then they start to panic and think they\u2019re doing it wrong when their numbers turn all red. A lot of subreddits are filled with people sharing how much money they\u2019ve made from whatever strategy they employed. It makes sense that these new investors feel disheartened from their efforts. \n\nI know someone who just invested a ton of money in the past few months and are now seeing lots of red. One example is they bought 100 shares of Apple at $139 and this morning realized they were down about $2,100. Now all they talk about is selling it. \n\nI encourage people to take emotions out of investing (including feeling excited about dips) because it is an event to understand rather than have emotional reactions to. Dips are a time to re-evaluate their holdings. If they are good holdings and the outlook is good continue to hold or buy more. If they are uncomfortable holding it further then move the money into something else. If you get excited about every dip then you are prone to buying irrationally which just as bad as selling irrationally. \n\nContinuously buying dips is potentially a great strategy and also potentially dangerous. I know people who bought tons of GE back in the year 2000. It was the biggest company in the world. It was \u201cApple\u201d back then. As it dipped they kept buying more and more and to this day they are still down (20+ years later) over 70% in that holding. This is dangerous. If that money were invested in the S&amp;P 500 for example they would\u2019ve come out much better. Same thing happened with Qualcom, Hewlett-Packard, AOL, Merck, Ericsson and so on and so on. In the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s people bought the dips endlessly on these stocks and never recovered or waited like 20 years before it finally recovered. These were not small unheard of companies. These companies were heavily traded and hotly talked about stocks back then. They were big deals back in their day. Microsoft and Google turned out to be great long term holds but Yahoo and AOL did not. It\u2019s easy to look back in time and judge it all, but back then people made very convincing cases for why AOL and YHOO would be the best.  They were convincing at the time but history proved them wrong. \n\nThis is why I encourage ETF investing, especially if you are a novice investor. Betting on AOL and Yahoo would\u2019ve lost a person a lot of money but investing on the whole rise of the internet/PC is great because Microsoft and Google more than made up for it. It\u2019s also why I encourage people to re-evaluate their holdings regularly (monthly is probably best). I also encourage dividend investing but that\u2019s a slightly different thing from this discussion. \n\nYes, dips can be a time to buy more, but they are also an invitation to re-evaluate one\u2019s holdings without emotions. I often buy during dips but I caution people about buying everything during every dip. In my 25 years of investing I\u2019ve become a fairly conservative investor (very boring portfolio) so take my old man advice for whatever you think it\u2019s worth, I guess.",

I diversified in DAL, HPE, HPQ, WFC, and BRK.b and got a loss on all of them because I got bored of waiting.\n\nNow I opted to split my account, have $2k in a long-term automatic portfolio and $1k I mess around with day trading. My strategy is to look for big market caps taking a sudden drop for a very reactionary reason (earnings a few % below expectation but generally considered a good company still) and buy at those prices and sell at 5-10% return.",

The average pilot has more training than the average driver, and (hopefully) none of them are intoxicated.\n\nI think autonomous driving is a serious technology.  It seems crazy now but I think only because it\u2019s not widely adopted.  The more autonomous cars there are on the road, the better autonomous driving becomes.  More human drivers = more variables and unpredictability for computer to take into account.  If all or most cars are autonomous and talking to each other in real-time though, it\u2019s a lot easier to react to road conditions and adapt accordingly.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that cars nowadays are analog, but the perception is that they are.  The first iPhone technically didn\u2019t do anything technologically revolutionary, but it did bundle all these existing digital technologies into one UI (tablets, MP3 players, GPS, etc), and off of that Apple was able to leverage their software capabilities.  I think saying Tesla = Ford = GM is like saying Apple = Nokia = Motorola.  No technology is new and we all stand on the shoulders of giants, but we need to look at how these existing technologies are being utilized or sold in new ways.",
