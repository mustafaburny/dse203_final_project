For instance, Lam Research (LRCX) is an amazing company, a leader in its industry and ridiculously profitable. However, Trump taking aim at China in the trade war has pushed them into attempting to replicate the California based LRCX platform. Theres very little chance that they will be able to reach LRCX technical ability but it scared investors enough to drop the stock price from $386 to $293 at one point.\n\nI wonder if investors are under the impression that PRDO is a \"covid\" stock, and wont do as well in a return to normal.",

        "body": "Pretty much everyone will list off some of the household names in big tech, like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, ADBE, GOOGL, etc. All of these are industry leaders with solid financials, so they\u2019re probably a safe bet for long-term growth. Though they may be overvalued right now (pretty much everything is). \n\nOther than those, within tech I tend to like semiconductors. I figure that cloud computing, AI, AR/VR, self-driving cars, fintech, bitcoin mining, smart phones and computers, etc. are just going to become a bigger and bigger part of the economy. And computer chips (CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, those chips in your credit card, etc.) are at the heart of all of these technologies. It\u2019s pretty clear that technological progress here isn\u2019t slowing, and demand for chips is just going to continue to grow. If you want to go with individual companies, NVDA, AMD, TSM, AMAT, MU, LRCX are all at the forefront right now, and have solid balance sheets. If you don\u2019t want to put all your money on one horse, a non-diversified, semiconductor-focused ETF like SMH or SOXX will give you exposure here while mitigating some of the risk. \n\nGreen/clean energy is a promising market, but it\u2019s a really young industry so there\u2019s a lot of risk in trying to pick a winner. TSLA is ahead of the pack for now, but it\u2019ll have competitors nipping at it\u2019s heals soon enough, and the stock is currently way overvalued. There are also other sectors of this market that TSLA hasn\u2019t tapped into, and could see massive growth in the next 5-15 years as we begin to wean off of fossil fuels. Again, a focused ETF like PBW or QCLN is a good way to mitigate risk and broaden exposure without having to pick a single winner. That said, this sector may be overvalued right now because oil/gas have taken a big hit during COVID and green energy isn\u2019t quite ready for prime time. In other words, oil/gas are currently cheap and will probably rebound a bit Post-COVID, so you could make money with fossil fuels, but I\u2019d stay out of them long-term and bet on clean energy/vehicles instead. \n\nI also like biotech and genomic medicine. TMO is a blue chip that basically has a monopoly and is a go-to for all biological research. Pretty safe bet on a well run company that\u2019ll be around for years. LZAGY, RHHBY, and TECH are similar, but tend to have their hands in more clinical trials and drug development, mainly with small molecules and other \u2018classic\u2019 treatment methods. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good ETF in this sector, but I haven\u2019t really looked as it\u2019s my field. CRISPR, gene therapy, etc. are all starting to show promise in the clinic, but is a really nascent industry. MRNA and BNTX are probably overvalued right now due to COVID speculation, but if they can get their delivery mechanisms to work (and they\u2019re showing promise), they\u2019ll basically revolutionize medicine. Again, if you don\u2019t want to bet on a single horse, ARKG is a good ETF for genomic medicine. TNX is a very young company that\u2019s showing a lot of promise for sequencing technology, so high risk but potentially very high reward. \n\nOther than that, it\u2019s always a good idea to put money into \u2018boring\u2019 non-risky, non-tech stocks. COST, WMT will probably be good picks during the coming economic crisis, and may actually be able to compete with AMZN if they shore up their online interface. V and MC are solid standbys (can\u2019t go wrong with credit cards). Also probably a safe bet to go with health insurance companies. SPY is also a broadly diversified ETF (basically the tracks the S&amp;P) that will be a safe bet long-term.\n\nMy suggestion would be to pick industries you think will grow long-term, and select a few stocks or an ETF within them. Set up a rather diversified portfolio so you aren\u2019t overexposed on any one front (I\u2019ve lost more than the market with this last slump, for instance, since I\u2019m overexposed in tech; I could probably use more \u2018boring\u2019 stocks like WMT). One or two shares apiece from 50 promising companies is a much safer bet than 500 shares in one or two very promising companies. Keep each at a smallish percentage of your total (I get really uncomfortable if a single stock goes above 10% of my total, even if it began as 1%, so I sell to bring it back down and use the profit to diversify). Generally speaking, the riskier the industry/company is, the lower percentage of your total it should be. \n\nHope this helps!",

Guess what... \u201ctech\u201d is literally a part of our daily lives now. \n\nIn the dotcom times it was all about lofty valuation on the possibility that tech would be the next big sector. Turns out many years later to actually be true and everyone is pissed off that they were wrong about doubting it. \n\nNow Apple, and Microsoft are literally at the top of the S&amp;P500 yet some people still cannot accept them because of P/E valuations and it\u2019s logical but I think its hilarious how contradictory some of the statements can be. \n\nThese people talk about how its impossible to time the market or that past performance doesn\u2019t indicate future performance yet there is one thing they are certain of. A tech bubble because of the tech bubble that happened 20 years ago. How can everyone be so certain these companies are overvalued when the sector has lead the market for the last 10 years. Maybe tech will fall back or maybe it will continue to outperform for another 10 years. We just don\u2019t know. What\u2019s certain is tech is not what it was 20 years ago and it will be interesting to see how it grows going forward. Those who say techs outperformance isn\u2019t relevant just want to rationalize their bearish stance on tech IMO.  \n\nAll this said the tech sector is  broad and there are fairly valued solid companies out there with good balance sheets. TSM(P/E 27.4) and LRCX(P/E 20.9) are some I am interested in.",

(If it's even a bubble). I\u2019m holding my calls because it keeps going up no matter what. When we have a red day or negative news I tell myself: \"Stonks go up\" and either by EOD or the next day, it goes green without fail.\n\nBut at the same time I\u2019m starting to get worried about a bubble- but what will trigger it? \nMoney is practically free, poor people who are getting devastated by the virus with no stimulus never invested in the market anyways. If anything the average person with spare change can now throw their money into the market easier than ever before with RH.\n\nI understand the subprime crisis was undetected, so what could possibly be undetected now? \nWhat will pop this? Am I missing something? Give me a reason not to hold my tech calls.\nSometimes I feel like the market will pop is because doubling my money in months doesn't sound right, this isn't supposed to happen. But maybe we're just smarter than the rest and making as much as we can while the printer is on (this doesn't sound right either).  \n\n**Positions:**\n\nFB 300c 3/19\n\nMSFT 230c 4/16\n\n2x MSFT 220c 6/18\n\nNVDA 600c 3/19\n\nORCL 60c 9/11 (somehow up 14%)\n\n2x PYPL 200c 1/15\n\nPYPL 210c 3/19\n\n2x SPY 360c 9/21 (2021) \n\n5 shares of AMZN (sold after making $10K on 3600c 1/15)\n\n25 shares of MSFT\n\n30 Shares of PYPL",

Yes I'm happy they've had a huge run up for the past couple years. Yes I'm sad that I sold half of my position when I had 100% return. No, I do not plan on selling more. Yes SQ is fantastic, and yes I hold a similar amount in PYPL as well. \n\nNo, I do not think SQ or PYPL will surpass visa as the king of payment processing. Visa is a giant, and could simply reveal their own p2p lending platform if any of the minor banks manages to cross their moat....it still hasn't been crossed yet.",

Will it come back down. Potentially not.  \n\n\nThe reality is, we are in a hyper unique period of digital transformation. PayPal, Shopify, amazon have all seen their best quarters and largest growth cycles in history. More than any of them predicted.  \n\n\nWe have accelerated the shift from physical to digital, and in the business world, communication is happing on the back of Zoom. Against all odds they are the clear market leader in a growing industry and service that will not be dropped when the pandemic ends. Will video calling slow? Sure. But customers won\u2019t cancel their service.  \n\n\nPer the Boeing comp... how many of you have flown on a plane recently? How many have a trip booked? I work in sales at a top 5 tech company in San Francisco. They have already told us we will not be having business travel the way we did before due to companies like zoom and the opportunity to work better and engage remotely.  \n\n\nThat industry is changing rapidly as well and not in the direction of Boeing. A company with MASSIVE overhead costs that literally cannot stop burning cash and will need to revamp its revenue models moving fwd.  \n\n\nAre they undervalued. Probably. But it\u2019s in line with the risk involved in that industry. Did you guys see today that United got rid of all change fees? Desperate much?  \n\n\nPoint being, these are unique times. And you certainly can\u2019t comp a hyper growth, perfect positioned saas company against a legacy company in an industry that is at risk of bankruptcy with an uncertain future.",

Nice sugar rush, but they're still sitting on $35 billion of real estate that's probably overvalued. Like walmart, the pivot to e-tail isn't cheap and sidelines years of expensive investments.\n\nCVS has a negative current ratio, and is completely upside down if you eliminate goodwill.

For NFIN think they explained this / it makes logical sense - the parent company started Triterras and were its first customers giving it critical mass of traders at launch and their share of revenues has fallen from 100% to 11% today (in 14 months) with it being no more than 15% for the full year and falling meaningfully thereafter....as long as its falling and is single digit number in a year or so i dont think this is cause for concern.... Point noted re no PIPE though - potentially its a bad signal....but maybe they just didnt need one (business is net cash, cash generative and profitable).... not seen anyone flag no external (ie non-sponsor) PIPE as an issue at LCA or Utz.",
