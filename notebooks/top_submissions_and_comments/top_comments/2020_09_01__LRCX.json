        "body": "Pretty much everyone will list off some of the household names in big tech, like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, ADBE, GOOGL, etc. All of these are industry leaders with solid financials, so they\u2019re probably a safe bet for long-term growth. Though they may be overvalued right now (pretty much everything is). \n\nOther than those, within tech I tend to like semiconductors. I figure that cloud computing, AI, AR/VR, self-driving cars, fintech, bitcoin mining, smart phones and computers, etc. are just going to become a bigger and bigger part of the economy. And computer chips (CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, those chips in your credit card, etc.) are at the heart of all of these technologies. It\u2019s pretty clear that technological progress here isn\u2019t slowing, and demand for chips is just going to continue to grow. If you want to go with individual companies, NVDA, AMD, TSM, AMAT, MU, LRCX are all at the forefront right now, and have solid balance sheets. If you don\u2019t want to put all your money on one horse, a non-diversified, semiconductor-focused ETF like SMH or SOXX will give you exposure here while mitigating some of the risk. \n\nGreen/clean energy is a promising market, but it\u2019s a really young industry so there\u2019s a lot of risk in trying to pick a winner. TSLA is ahead of the pack for now, but it\u2019ll have competitors nipping at it\u2019s heals soon enough, and the stock is currently way overvalued. There are also other sectors of this market that TSLA hasn\u2019t tapped into, and could see massive growth in the next 5-15 years as we begin to wean off of fossil fuels. Again, a focused ETF like PBW or QCLN is a good way to mitigate risk and broaden exposure without having to pick a single winner. That said, this sector may be overvalued right now because oil/gas have taken a big hit during COVID and green energy isn\u2019t quite ready for prime time. In other words, oil/gas are currently cheap and will probably rebound a bit Post-COVID, so you could make money with fossil fuels, but I\u2019d stay out of them long-term and bet on clean energy/vehicles instead. \n\nI also like biotech and genomic medicine. TMO is a blue chip that basically has a monopoly and is a go-to for all biological research. Pretty safe bet on a well run company that\u2019ll be around for years. LZAGY, RHHBY, and TECH are similar, but tend to have their hands in more clinical trials and drug development, mainly with small molecules and other \u2018classic\u2019 treatment methods. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good ETF in this sector, but I haven\u2019t really looked as it\u2019s my field. CRISPR, gene therapy, etc. are all starting to show promise in the clinic, but is a really nascent industry. MRNA and BNTX are probably overvalued right now due to COVID speculation, but if they can get their delivery mechanisms to work (and they\u2019re showing promise), they\u2019ll basically revolutionize medicine. Again, if you don\u2019t want to bet on a single horse, ARKG is a good ETF for genomic medicine. TNX is a very young company that\u2019s showing a lot of promise for sequencing technology, so high risk but potentially very high reward. \n\nOther than that, it\u2019s always a good idea to put money into \u2018boring\u2019 non-risky, non-tech stocks. COST, WMT will probably be good picks during the coming economic crisis, and may actually be able to compete with AMZN if they shore up their online interface. V and MC are solid standbys (can\u2019t go wrong with credit cards). Also probably a safe bet to go with health insurance companies. SPY is also a broadly diversified ETF (basically the tracks the S&amp;P) that will be a safe bet long-term.\n\nMy suggestion would be to pick industries you think will grow long-term, and select a few stocks or an ETF within them. Set up a rather diversified portfolio so you aren\u2019t overexposed on any one front (I\u2019ve lost more than the market with this last slump, for instance, since I\u2019m overexposed in tech; I could probably use more \u2018boring\u2019 stocks like WMT). One or two shares apiece from 50 promising companies is a much safer bet than 500 shares in one or two very promising companies. Keep each at a smallish percentage of your total (I get really uncomfortable if a single stock goes above 10% of my total, even if it began as 1%, so I sell to bring it back down and use the profit to diversify). Generally speaking, the riskier the industry/company is, the lower percentage of your total it should be. \n\nHope this helps!",

I think you could possibly see this happen with Amazon and Facebook, but I think it\u2019s unlikely to happen to the others. Anyway, this action was not catastrophic for the telecom sector. If anything, the breakup of the monopoly enabled innovation and increased the TAM of telecom companies. If it was just Ma Bell in town, think how long they would\u2019ve resisted DSL or cable internet and tried to keep us all on dialup.\n\n\nWith IE, the problem was that they used their platform (Windows) to monopolize the browser space. I think there\u2019s an extremely compelling case to argue that Google and Apple will be in trouble with this and be forced to spin off their app stores, but this will not cripple them \u2014 the vast majority of revenue does not come from App Store monopolies. Microsoft stock has been on a rampage since then, as well.\n\nTLDR: long term investors should not fear antitrust action under current regulations.",

I think you could possibly see this happen with Amazon and Facebook, but I think it\u2019s unlikely to happen to the others. Anyway, this action was not catastrophic for the telecom sector. If anything, the breakup of the monopoly enabled innovation and increased the TAM of telecom companies. If it was just Ma Bell in town, think how long they would\u2019ve resisted DSL or cable internet and tried to keep us all on dialup.\n\n\nWith IE, the problem was that they used their platform (Windows) to monopolize the browser space. I think there\u2019s an extremely compelling case to argue that Google and Apple will be in trouble with this and be forced to spin off their app stores, but this will not cripple them \u2014 the vast majority of revenue does not come from App Store monopolies. Microsoft stock has been on a rampage since then, as well.\n\nTLDR: long term investors should not fear antitrust action under current regulations.",

As one of the unlucky people who bought into the TSLA hype too late, I'm kicking myself.\n\nCan't hurt to throw some ETFs in there to mitigate risk and further diversify.

I think you could possibly see this happen with Amazon and Facebook, but I think it\u2019s unlikely to happen to the others. Anyway, this action was not catastrophic for the telecom sector. If anything, the breakup of the monopoly enabled innovation and increased the TAM of telecom companies. If it was just Ma Bell in town, think how long they would\u2019ve resisted DSL or cable internet and tried to keep us all on dialup.\n\n\nWith IE, the problem was that they used their platform (Windows) to monopolize the browser space. I think there\u2019s an extremely compelling case to argue that Google and Apple will be in trouble with this and be forced to spin off their app stores, but this will not cripple them \u2014 the vast majority of revenue does not come from App Store monopolies. Microsoft stock has been on a rampage since then, as well.\n\nTLDR: long term investors should not fear antitrust action under current regulations.",
