It would have taken 5-7 days (according to another DD) for the shares to be sellable. \n\nSoros promised to divest their 18.5M shares (as of Jan) on principle. Those should be hitting the market by now. \n\nThe tech selloff has also contributed to keeping PLTR depressed. Cathie, however, has been gobbling up the shares at every dip. \n\nFinally, unless you are an insider and know more than the rest of us, Palantir's software claims are pretty standard for enterprise software. Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Siemens, etc., make those claims regularly. I don't think Palantir is special but they do have momentum and high profile clients. \n\nOverall I think PLTR is getting ready to take off, but they might find some resistance along the way.

Nothing is changing for Costco, and they don't seem to want to embrace their online ordering.\n\nI haven't done my dd on Walmart but they're positioned well, maybe the market didn't like the idea of $15 wage?\n\nI just bought target at $178 so I wish I had waited a little more today but I'm still happy to hold on to them. They had a great earnings report, and I'm excited to see what bringing in Apple stores will do for them. In a time where b&amp;m are sinking they found an excellent idea to bring in even more traffic\n\nRedfin- the market hates real estate but redfin has the potential to rival zillow which is obviously trading much much higher. Personally, I like the idea they're going with of getting away from the need for a real estate agent for quite as many things. Many people are afraid that this year was literally the best anyone could do though. Low interest rates and most $ coming from refinancing that won't be there when rates continue to climb.\n\nSalesforce I haven't done enough dd on but they seem to have a decent moat, not sure why they stayed low when everything climbed yesterday",

Any money that is tied into a stock that is not doing well is opportunity cost for something that might do well.

For example, I got into $WORK at $30 avg price, it went down to almost $25. I didn't care because I knew the company will grow (I use their product) and is not going anywhere, so sooner or later my investment will pay off.  A few months later CRM announced a acquisition deal and the stock jumped to $42. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically it's really important to understand what level of risk are you carrying.
