I just chose MSFT to be one of my heavyweight cores, because its valuations have curved upward and has proven to be remarkably steady. I don't know how far back you can go, but I'm pretty sure any point since the end of the housing crash, you can see what MSFT's price was, and two years later, it's double. I want that stability holding heavier weight in my portfolio. \n\nI have positions in 5 chipmakers (AMD, MRVL, NXPI, QRVO, SWKS) as well as the SOXX ETF. Those combine to be about as heavy as MSFT. \n\nI have AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL, and TSLA. Those combine to be a little heavier than MSFT. \n\nBABA, MSFT, chipmakers, FAANGs, TSLA = about 60%. The rest is Chinese EV, clean energy, recovery stocks, and smaller-cap longshots and speculative plays. \n\nI consider today a bad day, because I'm only up 0.5% right now while the S&amp;P is up 0.7 and Nasdaq is over 1.5. I'm underperforming for now. But over the last six weeks, having that balance has outpaced the big three indexes by over 5%, so when I underperform by a percent one day, I figure that means I have my balance about right.",

Once the majority of shares are owned by funds (retirement, hedge, etc.) instead of owners and founders, the focus shifts to quarterly returns, innovation dies, growth rates slow, and the value of the company is \u201cmonetized\u201d back to the funds until it is worthless.   Salesforce just turned that corner.  Typical patterns include heavy advertising, annual or twice annual layoffs (Jack Welch style), cuts in R&amp;D funding, tight delivery schedules, service failures,  attempts to turn support into consulting (a poorly built product now needs you to pay for support), higher product complexity (it becomes a complicated mess due to rushing the delivery schedule, and saying yes to every possible customer, who basically turn your solution into garbage).  Fully monetized companies then show up in bankruptcy after years of neglect and lack of innovation.  Think Sears and JCPenney.   Oracle is on it\u2019s way, as well as most \u201cold tech\u201d.
