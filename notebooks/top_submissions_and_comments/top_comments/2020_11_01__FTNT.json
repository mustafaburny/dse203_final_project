For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out. I've replaced them with Pinterest in my portfolio as my new search/advertising stock. Social search is the future and I now see the genius advertising potential of the Pinterest platform; I see them stealing advertising dollars away from Google and growing much better than Google over the next 5 years.",

        "body": "One way I like to visualize dividend growth investing is by using Visa as an example. A lot of people might look at its current yield of 0.70% and think it would be a terrible dividend stock to own because they yield is so low. But when you look at the actual dividend amounts things start to become a lot more clear.\n\nIn 2009, Visa paid a dividend of $0.10 a share. In 2019 they paid a dividend of $1.00 a share. Visa's stock price was around $20 in 2009, so if we use that as our cost basis, the current dividend yield we'd be receiving from shares purchased in 2009 would be 5% (known as yield on cost). So basically even though Visa currently yields 0.70% to anyone buying today, that doesn't mean everyone holding shares is making 0.70% on their investment. \n\nThis is one of the reasons Warren Buffet has been so successful over the years. For example, his cost basis on Coca Cola is $3.25 per share, and the stock currently pays a dividend of $1.64 per share. This means Buffet's yield on cost is over 50%. He invested $1.3B in KO back in the late 80s and early 90s, and will now collect $654 million in income from the stock this year alone.",

For a while now, I've heard some people say that Jack Dorsey is \"the next Steve Jobs\"; well, I did not see anything close to \"the next Steve Jobs\" in that interview; Steve Jobs would have handled that situation far better. Dorsey didn't even come across as an average CEO; he came across as \"THIS bum is the CEO of multi-billion dollar companies? WTF?\" Dorsey looked like he was drugged out of his mind during the interview and did not come across as the intelligent leader that I want to see in companies that I invest in.\n\nFrom what I've seen in YouTube comments of those interviews, many other people got the same bad impression of Jack Dorsey from those interviews that I did, so I can definitely see how this would negatively effect the stocks of his companies. It has certainly kept me from buying.",

        "body": "&gt;that if we\u2019re faced with low growth and inflation expectations then this is where assets should be priced.\n\nBased on what model? Low growth + inflation implies higher real rates, which imply strong tightening of financial conditions. You think in that scenario stocks are priced rationally?\n\nThe whole narrative that stocks are expensive because yields are low should work both ways. If yields rise (due to inflation) stocks should then see a lot of selling, especially in longer duration exposures.\n\nLow growth + inflation expectations, if that were to actually occur, implies heavy P/E contraction in the coming years. That's assuming those expectations are actually discounting the correct things which they very well may not be.\n\nThat either gives you a 1970's type scenario, in which bonds get wrecked and stocks tread water relative to inflation, or more of a depression type deflationary scenario, in which case stocks **surely** are not priced properly.\n\nThe issue with any inflationary scenario is that if it truly gets going in any form (scenario 1 here where we see something similar to the 70's), we're in for a lot more trouble than we can handle. There is far too much debt for the economy to handle inflation pressures, and any increase in bond yields will result in massive tightening of financial conditions. That scenario likely ends up leading into a deflationary spiral in the end. There is a reason we saw a 20% drawdown in 2018. The global economy simply can't handle rate increases which inflation would cause.\n\nAs for any comparison to the the 1970's, the macro environment then was far different than now - they had very strong demographics, very low non-public debt, and the inflation was largely based on **demand** along with a few supply shocks\\*\\*.\\*\\* Globally, we couldn't be more opposite of that right now.\n\nOverall, the only particularly great argument for valuations right now is that there simply are no other great alternatives, and there has been no need to de-leverage due to the ability to lower rates and keep yields at or below zero globally. This, and the fact that unlike 08', governments are doing their best to not allow defaults of major companies, which has kept the market at least relatively orderly and prevented forced de-leveraging.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the trigger for any real longer-term recession or depression of any sort will come from inflation rising past an ever-falling threshold of growth. The \"level\" of financial tightening represented by yields has been falling for 40 years.\n\n* In 08', they over-tightened to the point where 5% caused the debt overburden to blow things up.\n* In 2018, 2.5% was getting far too tight, mandating emergency rate cuts going into 2019.\n\nNow? Debt burdens have expanded drastically post-covid, and banks are not lending very much at all. This causes a drawdown in supply, which increases overall inflation on a longer-term basis. So you get a scenario where the economy likely couldn't handle bond rates much past 1% (and that's being incredibly generous), yet the conditions for future inflation **relative to real growth** are growing.\n\nI certainly don't think the financial system is going to blow up tomorrow by any means, but we are getting close to the boundaries of the financial system to keep operating in the same way it has over the last 40 years, and any significant change, which becomes more likely the closer we get to those boundaries implies strong turbulence in the next 3-5 years.",

        "body": "The way I see it, the only real risk is opportunity cost, but there are several aspects to that. \n\nIf you have money in PIC, and the market crashes, the common shares might drop by only 5% to $9.50 while the market drops 30%. That\u2019s good news, but what do you do now? \n\nIf you think the market is set for a quick recovery, you probably pull the SPAC money out and put it into AAPL or AMZN, hoping for a 35% bounce. \n\nSo, in that case, you would have been better off in cash when the market was shaky. The SPAC (eg PIC) will recover, to at least $10 and probably more. But it won\u2019t give you a 35% recovery. So you\u2019ve essentially given up 5% for your capital for no reason. \n\n Now, if you think the market will be consistently bad, you might stick it out and try to play the quasi arbitrage game. The SPACs you purchase below their trust value might earn you 2-5% if a) the share price recovers, or b) you redeem your shares at the merger vote. \n\nIf the latter, that could be a long wait. If the former, the overall market is likely to recover more quickly than PIC. PIC will bounce back to $10 right away, but AAPL is likely to hit $120 before PIC hits $11. \n\nSo, that\u2019s sort of the paradox of SPACs as I see it. I\u2019m currently parked in QELL, DGNR, IPOF, CCIV, RBAC, RTP, and SOAC. \n\nIf the market stays choppy for a few for months, which is likely (I don\u2019t think we get any stimulus until Feb or so after a long drawn-out battle)... then SPACs might be a decent play... CCIV, SOAC, etc could announce a target and the price could jump 20% or more while the overall market is ranging. That\u2019s a win. \n\nBut if the market is really bad, they\u2019ll probably wait to announce an agreement, so you don\u2019t gain much there. And if the market does bounce back (eg sooner than expected stimulus), you\u2019re probably better off in AMZN.\n\nThe best SPAC play IMO is to be in cash in choppy market, and if/when the market plummets, scoop up warrants and units of the better SPACs at discounted prices (eg $9.50 for tier one units; sub $1 warrants for the best management team SPACs). \n\nBut then again, if you\u2019re able to time the market that well, you could buy SHOP or LULU at deep discounts and do just as well.",

You can look at things like P/E ratios and that but there is another elephant in the room right now people are ignoring.  Most of the world's population is getting older and there will be a significantly smaller number of people working per retiree and wages have been flat or going down.  Then you have increased expenses for housing and healthcare (US only).  There already is negative outflows for years and no one is talking about what happens as it accelerates as boomers retire.  The stock market started to go up significantly when the US switched from pension funds to 401k.  Granted there are other factors driving the economy but you now have a significant flow of new money into the market. \n\nBTW, bonds are sold in markets and auctions so if the rate is low that means a significant portion of the investment world thinks the economy isn't in great shape.  Have to ask yourself why are willing to lend money so cheaply.  The bond market is something like 3x bigger than the stock market.  So the bonds are saying we don't believe the current rally and why would they when corporate profits have been nearly flat since 2012 before COVID and now have decreased significantly.",
