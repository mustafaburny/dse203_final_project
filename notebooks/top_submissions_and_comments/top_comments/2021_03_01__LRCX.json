MP Materials is the only US based company REM company. \n\nThis all looks so obvious as a long term play. I forget where I read it, but the global semiconductor usage is going to 10x or something insane like that in the next 10 years.\n\nI don\u2019t know why all of these companies are down recently, I haven\u2019t looked into it. I bought $10 worth of every stock listed above so I could keep tabs on them. All of them have followed the same negative trajectory the last month or so. If you zoom out to 5 year though, almost every single company shows insane growth. I imagine that growth will only compound long term.

MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC. Samsung is still in the game and SMIC is trying to catch up. But basically TSM takes the majority of the market. \n\nDisclosure: I have been holding TSM for a couple of years.

I forgot if it's dry or wet, I think it was drying it to ensure the product stays up (based on images, I'm not a lithography engineer) so maybe we'll see it be used to enhance yields.

Paid something stupid like $10 for a GME $50C when GME was trading at $35.  And bought some AMC and BB.  Then GME hit $300 something.  Not knowing what I was doing I exercised and then sold off at like $300, $290 and $270.\n\nEnded up with 30 grand and decided to make it my options play money.  Lost a good chunk on NVDA when it shit but stayed about even overall cause I was playing MU LRCX AMAT DKNG and AMC.  Because you know like silicone chips and shortages.  Figured buy the guys that make silicone chip equipment.  Atleast I think some of those stocks do that shit.  And DKNG because like sin stocks are a good hedge for market down turns or some shit.\n\nSo I didn't make money for a while.  And I also learned how those stocks move.  I also learned if when the dip comes if you don't have any cash well then you are fucked.\n\nSo I waited for most of my calls to go back green and took barely any profit but got back to my original 30k.\n\nThen I did some ground breaking shit.  I didn't buy anything until the shit dipped for a few days.  And when it did I just bought a little and kept buying all the way down.  I also started buying calls 90 to 60 days out with strikes around the most recent high.\n\nSo when MU tanked I bought it all the way down to $82.  Same thing with AMAT and LRCX.  Also KLAC which doesn't run like those.  DKNG is hella cheap now, so is UWMC, and some of the cruise stocks.\n\nSo I did that and now Friday happened.\n\nAnd now I think I'm smarter than Warren Buffet.\n\nSo now I'm going to hold this shit for way to long until it goes red and expires.\n\nAnd then I'll listen to my wife banging her boyfriend while I figure out if I have anything of value to pawn other than my mouth.",

He was one of the og engineers on one of their first hit products (80486 seriously read about it, a similar crisis), so if anyone has the cultural capital to do a turnaround... it\u2019s him. Lots of wood to chop but expectations are so low. \n\n2) I\u2019m confused about your LRCX comment. They are clearly not the only ones making themselves useful. Multiple parts of the supply chain has to turn over, like masks, foup cleaners, all kinds of other stuff. It\u2019s complicated and EUV is far from the only step. You should look up ALD &amp; 3D etch because that\u2019s really what LRCX does. There\u2019s also a Japanese mask company that\u2019s a beneficiary of EUV\n\n3) I mean, when I last talked to ASML mgmt they def wanted to sell tools! All things being equal it really doesn\u2019t matter to the tool companies. Most American companies want to sell tools, it\u2019s pretty hard to figure them out. And even when they do there is a lot of lock in and installed base management. \n\n\n4) so problem is this is the tightest screw we have on them and any kind of normalization starts with selling tools / EDA again. It depends on your view on nationalism. If you\u2019re a US citizen and don\u2019t like China sure, if you\u2019re a cold hearted investor I think it\u2019s in your interest for the tool companies to sell to China. They are struggling to use the tools not even make them. I think this risk is... a bit overblown. The success in this industry is very cumulative and there are maybe 2 real tool companies in China and both are tier 2 if not 3 companies. Anyways that\u2019s all for today.",

EUV is specifically stated for 7nm and below, but DUB for 10nm+ I haven't seen anything about DUV doing 7nm at TSMC.\n\nEither way, it's previous gen. Idk what Intel is doing because they don't really delve into it too much. ASML publishes videos and presentations discussing in detail how EUV and their machines work. Even LRCX does that. Haven't seen as much detail with Intel or TSMC, but maybe I'll look deeper later.",

Idk how the new CEO is supposed to fix that, it's not easy to innovate in this space and they waited to be cornered to decide to innovate.\n\nYes, that. Interesting. I bought LRCX because they're the only ones who made themselves useful in EUV. I looked at others and didn't find them offering anything there. Do you know otherwise?\n\nI didn't see anything from Europe/ASML that's indicating they're unhappy with not being able to sell to China, but I also know Europe as a whole seems to be okay with that and buying too. A few years ago there was a massive selling of German companies to Chinese owners to move manufacturing there. I think if it wasn't for having a massive backlog at ASML they'd have been unhappy, but they don't have any shortage of customers and are barely keeping up.\n\nI completely understand, but giving the tools is the start for them to understand it, I'm not saying they do now. If it was Russia I'd say okay we got time. They don't have that expertise. China has some of that expertise though and are hell bent on being fully independent in this field. We're definitely years ahead, but that won't be forever.",

Those should be hitting the market by now. \n\nThe tech selloff has also contributed to keeping PLTR depressed. Cathie, however, has been gobbling up the shares at every dip. \n\nFinally, unless you are an insider and know more than the rest of us, Palantir's software claims are pretty standard for enterprise software. Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Siemens, etc., make those claims regularly. I don't think Palantir is special but they do have momentum and high profile clients. \n\nOverall I think PLTR is getting ready to take off, but they might find some resistance along the way.

        "body": "I have experience in setting up Snowflake in a Fortune 100 company. And I have also worked on Google Bigquery, AWS Redshift, and Azure DWH in the past. Here are my thoughts on its potentials.\n\n1. Snowflake is a way better product than Bigquery, Redshift, or Azure DWH. It automatically handles all legal database SQL syntax(Oracle, SQL Server, etc.). So data migration from the legacy database is less complex with a minimum learning curve. This is true not just for developers but for all the end-users like Analysts.   \n\n2. Multi-Cloud: It can be hosted in AWS, GCP, or  Azure. This might sound irrelevant. Here is why it's important. Let's say a company started using Bigquery because Google is the preferred partner. After a couple of years, things have changed, and the company decided to make Azure the company's preferred Cloud vendor. Now it's not that easy to migrate your Data warehouse from Bigquery to Azure DHW. With Snowflake, you are not tied up to a particular vendor. The point here is Snowflake gives flexibility, and enterprise companies love this flexibility. \n\n3. Snowflake integration is pretty neat. It integrates with GCS, AWS S3, etc., and with other APIs natively.  Sample use case. Running an ML model(API) on top of Snowflake data using SQL. You don't need to be an ML expert to run a model. Anyone with basic SQL can do this.  This is one example, Applications are endless.\n\n4. Data sharing and Data marketplace. They are building a data catalog complemented by the data sharing feature\u2014essentially data as a service. More data demand -&gt; More data listed in catalog -&gt;  Network effect growth through sharing-&gt; Customer exponential growth-&gt;More money. I believe this will be huge, which is the main reason I'm bullish on Snowflake. Because snowflake supports multi-cloud,  it's not easy for other companies like Google/AWS to replicate this.\n\n5. Snowflake Customer retention is really high, and I strongly believe this will continue to remain so. Most of Snowflake's customers are Enterprises.  In my experience, companies switch or change databases for 3 main reasons. 1. Scaling or maintenance issue 2. License or hardware end of life or no longer supports 3\u2014cost savings. Snowflake is highly scalable and utilizes cloud infrastructure with zero maintenance. So issues 1 and 2 do not exist. For the cost, it is charged per usage. It's way cheaper than any other legacy database like Oracle, HANA, etc. Basically, once an enterprise adopts Snowflake as their data warehouse, I don't see any reason for switching unless something terrible goes wrong.  Many companies still bear Oracle because of the complexity and cost of migration even though they really want to.\n\n6. They have some unique features. One that stands out for me is the feature called Time travel. ( Read about it https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html. This is mind-blowing. They also have the ability to create, schedule, run data pipelines without the need for any ELT/ETL tools. ( Including setting up dependencies). For enterprise companies, this may not be valid but definitely useful for startups.",

I would say it doesn't actually fall under most current anti-trust legislation which is related to price competition and its revenue area is actually advertising where there is lots of competition BUT I agree that practically it is enough of a monopoly that it will likely get dragged into it.  I sold my Google and FB a few months ago, both just to take profits and because I think there's a solid chance they spend the next 2-4 years in continuous litigation and hearings over how to manage data more responsibly and how they should be regulated.  Doubt anyone can agree to anything, but it will put a damper on their acquisition and expansion sprees.\n\nAmazon is a very different case as Amazon isn't really a monopoly in any way, they just compete in SO MANY categories that it feels that way.  But when you look at it...in e-commerce, its hard to call someone a monopoly when Walmart, Target, Costco Best Buy and every other big box compete with them; AWS is fighting tooth and nail with Microsoft Azure, Google could, IBM, Oracle etc.; \n\nWe can keep going down the list - Prime video competes with Netflix and Hulu; Amazon logistics competes with UPS and Fedex and Uber Cargo...so while their everpresence in our lives makes it feel like it MUST be a monopoly, its actually hard to identify anywhere specifically that Amazon isn't subject to pretty intense competition by big players, thus hard to make a case for anti-competitive behavior or anti-trust violations.",

However that's not what matters for that part of the business: Everything's plumbed together with ETL stages, and queries that feed into other tools as needed. It's all about crunching TB or PB of data to make complicated correlations. The user interfaces are just there to prototype and run one-of queries, not run a business.\n\nFor data scientists the data would be fed into 3rd party, like python, R or GUI tools like Tableau to generate charts, via existing \"connectors\".\n\nThe things I consider is there's a vast amount of legacy data and processes in companies that are all databases and SQL scripts that need to be migrated. You can't move any of that without the compatibility.\n\nI think that's why there's no direct comparison to PLTR which offers tools to build from scratch your analytics. Furthermore I don't believe a small business would be the target customer for Palantir either. If anything Palantir will pull data from Snowflake as one of its many inputs.\n\nIf anything  small businesses would buy integrated solutions. These solutions can be implemented on top of Snowflake. In fact companies are created on top of Snowflake's infrastructure now. Would you expect a small business to run Oracle. no. A fortune 500 company? yes.",
