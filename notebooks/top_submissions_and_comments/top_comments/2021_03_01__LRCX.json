I\u2019m keeping tabs on AMAT, TSM, LRCX, NXPI, FORM, UMC).\n\nThen finally the rare earth metals.. companies like MP, AMAT, VALE (I was long on these guys then they got a fucking $7B fine for killing 300 people in a dam explosion.... oops).\n\nLook into Biden\u2019s recent executive order, not only does he address the global semiconductor shortage, but plans to bring jobs back to the states and invest in American companies. MP Materials is the only US based company REM company. \n\nThis all looks so obvious as a long term play. I forget where I read it, but the global semiconductor usage is going to 10x or something insane like that in the next 10 years.\n\nI don\u2019t know why all of these companies are down recently, I haven\u2019t looked into it. I bought $10 worth of every stock listed above so I could keep tabs on them. All of them have followed the same negative trajectory the last month or so. If you zoom out to 5 year though, almost every single company shows insane growth. I imagine that growth will only compound long term. Do you have any thoughts on the reason for this recent downward trend? \n\nI\u2019m considering making a pretty massive 5-10 year long play on semiconductors.",

MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC. Samsung is still in the game and SMIC is trying to catch up. But basically TSM takes the majority of the market. \n\nDisclosure: I have been holding TSM for a couple of years.

I forgot if it's dry or wet, I think it was drying it to ensure the product stays up (based on images, I'm not a lithography engineer) so maybe we'll see it be used to enhance yields. It should already be in use in 5nm, but I don't have that info.\n\nI've read the link you posted above.

Took the money, bought a sub to Motley Fool (I know) and started buying their monthly picks $2500 at a time.  18 months later I was frustrated because I had like 2 winners, a handful of dogs and a majority of a portfolio that was decidedly down, a lot. So I sold out, and shifted everything into VTSAX. Fast forward to today, and I am literally kicking myself: I was holding MSFT at 50, SBUX at 30, MELI at 120, LRCX at 100 and a bunch of others that tripled. And they were pushing SHOP, AMZN, NFLX, and CMG and I refused to buy based on my track record with their picks. If I'd stayed the course and waited it out I would literally be retired as a multi-millionaire.\n\nAs others have said: learn from your mistakes, be patient, and seek out learning opportunities.

Paid something stupid like $10 for a GME $50C when GME was trading at $35.  And bought some AMC and BB.  Then GME hit $300 something.  Not knowing what I was doing I exercised and then sold off at like $300, $290 and $270.\n\nEnded up with 30 grand and decided to make it my options play money.  Lost a good chunk on NVDA when it shit but stayed about even overall cause I was playing MU LRCX AMAT DKNG and AMC.  Because you know like silicone chips and shortages.  Figured buy the guys that make silicone chip equipment.  Atleast I think some of those stocks do that shit.  And DKNG because like sin stocks are a good hedge for market down turns or some shit.\n\nSo I didn't make money for a while.  And I also learned how those stocks move.  I also learned if when the dip comes if you don't have any cash well then you are fucked.\n\nSo I waited for most of my calls to go back green and took barely any profit but got back to my original 30k.\n\nThen I did some ground breaking shit.  I didn't buy anything until the shit dipped for a few days.  And when it did I just bought a little and kept buying all the way down.  I also started buying calls 90 to 60 days out with strikes around the most recent high.\n\nSo when MU tanked I bought it all the way down to $82.  Same thing with AMAT and LRCX.  Also KLAC which doesn't run like those.  DKNG is hella cheap now, so is UWMC, and some of the cruise stocks.\n\nSo I did that and now Friday happened.\n\nAnd now I think I'm smarter than Warren Buffet.\n\nSo now I'm going to hold this shit for way to long until it goes red and expires.\n\nAnd then I'll listen to my wife banging her boyfriend while I figure out if I have anything of value to pawn other than my mouth.",

He was one of the og engineers on one of their first hit products (80486 seriously read about it, a similar crisis), so if anyone has the cultural capital to do a turnaround... it\u2019s him. Lots of wood to chop but expectations are so low. \n\n2) I\u2019m confused about your LRCX comment. They are clearly not the only ones making themselves useful. Multiple parts of the supply chain has to turn over, like masks, foup cleaners, all kinds of other stuff. It\u2019s complicated and EUV is far from the only step. You should look up ALD &amp; 3D etch because that\u2019s really what LRCX does. There\u2019s also a Japanese mask company that\u2019s a beneficiary of EUV\n\n3) I mean, when I last talked to ASML mgmt they def wanted to sell tools! All things being equal it really doesn\u2019t matter to the tool companies. Most American companies want to sell tools, it\u2019s pretty hard to figure them out. And even when they do there is a lot of lock in and installed base management. \n\n\n4) so problem is this is the tightest screw we have on them and any kind of normalization starts with selling tools / EDA again. It depends on your view on nationalism. If you\u2019re a US citizen and don\u2019t like China sure, if you\u2019re a cold hearted investor I think it\u2019s in your interest for the tool companies to sell to China. They are struggling to use the tools not even make them. I think this risk is... a bit overblown. The success in this industry is very cumulative and there are maybe 2 real tool companies in China and both are tier 2 if not 3 companies. Anyways that\u2019s all for today.",
