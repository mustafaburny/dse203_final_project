Increasingly\u2026 what we may see as a chip is actually a \u2018package\u2019 of multiple pieces of silicon that were individually manufactured separately and attached them together.  \n\nInfrastructure will involve chips.  Our bridges, EV chargers, Solar Panels, and especially cars will all require more and more chips which only further pushes the need for leading edge chips at the heart of data centers or \u201cat the edge\u201d (fully autonomous driving for example).  \n\nThe companies I mention all have market leading positions in steps along the production process for leading edge chips especially ASML who has a literal monopoly.  ASML\u2019s earnings showcased how active the CapEx spend was amongst their clients including in the memory side. \n\nThey will build the upcoming Fabs in which AMD and NVDA can finally get the scale needed to become as big as we all know they should be.",

You might be getting the \u201cif purchased before this date\u201d confused with the dividend payment and not the split. Whether or not to buy before or after the split is a debate that someone else will know a lot more about. I\u2019ve heard it will spike as the lower price raises the value, then will drop immediately after as people sell to capture their profits. But that\u2019s a whole lot of timing the market and if you\u2019re looking for a long term hold just buy on the next red day you see. Hopefully someone who knows more will respond and really explain it but that\u2019s what I can offer you.\n\nP.S. I\u2019ve only been in the market for about 20 months so my knowledge is very small but maybe I can finally provide a bit of help to someone else. Thanks for the opportunity.",

The issue which has made Intel un-competitive is they're mismanaged their development of their 10nm architecture. This out them far behind the competition for reference AMD is on 7nm reportedly going to 5nm next generation , Nvidia is on 8nm, apple whom has recently entered the chip manufacturing game is on 5nm, and Nvidia has just announced a hybrid x86 gpu + ARM CPU APU combo that is supposed to bring gaming to thinner notebooks. Intel's issue requires them to fix their fab process issues. It would literally give them a minimum 20% IPC increase making them competitive again.

SO derived it\u2019s monopolistic power through acquisitions of rival refineries and distributors; purely horizontal integration, followed by outright price fixing.\n\nAmazon is absolutely massive, but the growth method and diversity of markets they participate in distinguishes them from old trust oriented monopolies. I\u2019m terms of AWS, the majority of growth was organic, and would not have ran afoul of antitrust law back in its hay day, such as when US v. Aluminum Co. of America was prevailing law.\n\nAn attempt to break up Amazon by business segment would probably fail due to the shift since the 70\u2019s from Per Se Antitrust violations to the Rule of Reason. They aren\u2019t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.\n\nOnline shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.\n\nOverall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren\u2019t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",

It's market correlation is 0.02, which is an unattached, positive number...not the large negative correlation you would hope for from a hedge. It did absolutely nothing during the dot-com bubble and probably hurt most investors that held during 2020.",

Although its true downward potential is the blue -1 deviation line, so 70-73.

        "body": "I personally invest heavily in Web3 crypto's and crypto projects that help run and keep these crypto's decentralised. \n\nWhat's a web3 crypto? These aren't to be confused with junk like Bitcoin that thinks it is a store of value or will become the new financial system, web3 crypto is literally creating the next stage in internet where you don't need to worry about your companies information / personal information / classified documents being stored on a server that is owned and managed by other companies. Web3 splits this up between 100's of validators that all talk to each other and keep this decentralised and secure from attacks. \n\nThere's also ones creating the future of finance. No longer do you need to get bent over by huge interest rates and banks fucking people over whenever they feel like it. DEFI is run by liquidity pools, people like you and I who store our money with the service and as a result get a percentage of the interest rates. These rates always remain low and competitive and go to the people rather than the big banks.\n\nThen you have oracles that power the decentralisation. Oracles gain info from many sources and feed it to the protocol to offer decentralised information. For easy laymans terms, if I wanted a weather oracle, it would gather weather data from 1000's weather stations and news outlets, work out the average forecast and feed that to my protocol. This means my protocol is giving the users the most accurate non-biased information. Just as a high-level. \n\nSo how do you make money from this? Well, let's look at Ethereum just as an example. Every single protect that runs on Ethereum has to pay \"gas\" fees on each transaction, this is paid in Ethereum. Ethereum already has 1000's of applications including VISA and MasterCard that constantly have a demand for Ethereum in order to operate and pay these gas fees. You as the investor holds the Ethereum they need and this creates supply and demand. Additionally, each time a company pays their gas fees, the gas is \"burnt\" (meaning Ethereum used to pay for the transaction is burnt) creating deflation. \n\nEthereum is just one project, and not one that I personally even invest in that much, but it's one that I'm sure most people have heard of.   \nIf you want to look at getting some crypto while it's currently on a low and has huge potentially to be the future of a new decentralised internet feel free to use my exchange code. Swyftx is aussie based exchange and you get 20% off fees with my code, plus I get a kick back [https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner](https://trade.swyftx.com.au/register/?ref=brentboydskinner)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessage me if you want to know more",
