Increasingly\u2026 what we may see as a chip is actually a \u2018package\u2019 of multiple pieces of silicon that were individually manufactured separately and attached them together.  \n\nInfrastructure will involve chips.  Our bridges, EV chargers, Solar Panels, and especially cars will all require more and more chips which only further pushes the need for leading edge chips at the heart of data centers or \u201cat the edge\u201d (fully autonomous driving for example).  \n\nThe companies I mention all have market leading positions in steps along the production process for leading edge chips especially ASML who has a literal monopoly.  ASML\u2019s earnings showcased how active the CapEx spend was amongst their clients including in the memory side. \n\nThey will build the upcoming Fabs in which AMD and NVDA can finally get the scale needed to become as big as we all know they should be.",

I was seriously going to sell this morning and buy $SPY puts and more $PLTR puts. \nKeep this in mind everyone - if the $SPY fell to $429 twice this week, don't be surprised if we touch $425 tomorrow. I'd wait till around 2:00 before buying shit. And then see how tomorrow afternoon goes. Too much instability after a fall like that. Bears are licking their lips, loving the fear, and want that $425. \n\nIf Tesla touches $590, I'm in for calls. \nAlso eyeing $NVDA. \n$SPCE calls are a go. \n$X calls are a go. \n$SOFI puts are a go.\nEverything else is questionable.",

So say you buy at $812(for easy maths) you will get 4 shares at $203 in your portfolio at market open on the day of the split. That\u2019s the message I got from my broker. You might be getting the \u201cif purchased before this date\u201d confused with the dividend payment and not the split. Whether or not to buy before or after the split is a debate that someone else will know a lot more about. I\u2019ve heard it will spike as the lower price raises the value, then will drop immediately after as people sell to capture their profits. But that\u2019s a whole lot of timing the market and if you\u2019re looking for a long term hold just buy on the next red day you see. Hopefully someone who knows more will respond and really explain it but that\u2019s what I can offer you.\n\nP.S.

Now she is overweight on TSLA and underweight on AAPL and NVDA, so she would sell TSLA shares and use the proceeds to buy AAPL and NVDA shares in order to maintain her original 50/30/20 allocation.\n\nOn top of that, you have investors buying and selling shares of her ETF, so she would either buy or sell shares of her underlying stocks to invest the funds for people who bought her ETF or pay the traders who sold her etf.

This out them far behind the competition for reference AMD is on 7nm reportedly going to 5nm next generation , Nvidia is on 8nm, apple whom has recently entered the chip manufacturing game is on 5nm, and Nvidia has just announced a hybrid x86 gpu + ARM CPU APU combo that is supposed to bring gaming to thinner notebooks.
