For example I'm sure the OI of TSLA is spread out all the way from 300 to 1000.  At different times there was a different part of that range that was in play.\n\nI'd start by thinking more in terms of volume.  Volume is what's happening now.

That's why people are closing down travel and there's something like 50 million people in quarantine. Do you know how much money is gonna be lost? China is the second biggest economy in the world and is central to the entire economy of Asia. Now it's gonna be on lockdown for at least a month meaning the entire world will be disrupted. Businesses will have to halt and adjust everything. At least the trade war was only between America - China and prices could be adjusted. \n\nIf this shit spreads to India or Africa it'll be even more of a catastrophe. It doesn't matter if the mortality rate is \"low\" if thousands or millions of people become infected. That puts a massive strain on any country's healthcare system and economy. I couldn't care less about the mortality rate. It's about the fear of infection. \n\nNow add all this to the fact that Brexit is happening and the presidential race is probably gonna end up between trump and a socialist that'll spook the economy. \n\nI'm not saying a recession is gonna happen -- even tho we have been at risk of one for a while I'd say.

Company is worth 100 dollars, and 20 of those dollars are cash on the balance sheet. They buy back 20 shares.

If the stock does in fact move farther OTM of the spread I opened ( could be that day or a few days later) THEN I open the opposing credit spread making sure I have a delta on that spread getting me at least to the halfway point of the spread.\n\nQuick example: XYZ is trading at $98 Monday morning and has earning the following week. It seems it will make a run up going into earnings. I'll open a bull put spread (95/90) for something like $2.60 per contract. If all goes to plan and it does make a nice run to, let's say, $118 during the next few days, now I open a bear call spread (110/115) for a premium of \\~$2.60 per contract.\n\nIn this example, I have collected $0.20 premium on what is effectively a short strangle (95P/110C) that will pay me a minimum of $0.20 per contract regardless of which direction the stock goes. If I'm lucky and the underlying is between 95 and 110 at expiration, I now get to keep the full $5.20 per contract of the original spreads.",

It\u2019s very hard to determine how to value them, because they are brand new. \n\nThey are digital bearer assets that allow for various utilities. For example, if you had some wealth that you wanted to protect and hide, how could you do that? Hold cash? Well, cash could get destroyed by inflation or outright banned. Hold gold? That\u2019s fine, but you can\u2019t travel with it and it\u2019s expensive to hold. Or buy a privacy coin like Monero that literally no one can track and has a fixed rate of inflation. Other crypto\u2019s have other utilities. EOS is a network resource coin that you can lend out to developers and receive a yield at the protocol level. There are casino and exchange tokens that pay their holders from company profits. They aren\u2019t equity, but a reward token that pays a benefit from the platform (buybacks and/or dividends). \n\nSo, there\u2019s real fundamental value there that is growing exponentially if you look at the charts, and right now it\u2019s a poorly understood, forgotten, and hated market to be invested in.

        "body": "Some actual DD (long post) for all those who think the Coronavirus is priced in... \n\nThere are different levels of \u201cpriced in.\u201d Some of you guys are thinking only at the 1D chess level. New cases being reported everyday in the USA now, and these are just primary infections (besides the Chicago case). Can you imagine if we start getting secondary and tertiary infections? BTFD doesn\u2019t work in the early stages of extreme fear. In other words, don\u2019t shoot your load too early.\n\nTiming is everything. Friday\u2019s price action is possibly exaggerated and likely priced in a 5%+ crash in China on Monday along with more terrible news over the weekend. If China, somehow, only goes down 1-2% and there are no significant developments in the USA today and tomorrow, SPY may even rally on Monday. Personally, I see SPY going through some sort of relief rally early next week, possibly Monday (big dip first then rally) or Tuesday. Then, just to screw with us option buyers, it might only end up at 323-324 and all of your 2/3 OTM options will expire worthless. Any rally over 326 I will sell into. \n\nNow, given the proven timeline of the Coronavirus, there will likely be more secondary infections in the USA and European countries reported towards the middle to end of next week. At that point, calls on volatility and precious metals should pay off. I hosted a real estate investment seminar in San Jose yesterday and out of 60 attendees, NO ONE was wearing a mask. Please note that the first virus case in Santa Clara (20 minutes away) was confirmed earlier in the day. I asked if anyone had bought masks and 80% said \u201cno.\u201d No one is worried!!! Now, if the market reacted negatively when no one in the USA is panicking, what will it do if we have people wearing masks in the streets here?\n\nSome considerations about this virus. Incubation time is between 5-14 days, which is freaking long. Some scientists have claimed that asymptomatic patients may infect others (a game changer). The first symptoms showed up in China on 12/9/2019. However, the first death wasn\u2019t reported till January 2020. The first 41 patients had 6 that died, which is a significantly higher mortality rate compared to the reported 2-3%. Current R0 value is 2.8 (it can change as new data comes in). Yes, I know 30k people die each year from the flu, but keep in mind the flu\u2019s mortality rate is 0.1%. If nCoV-2019 has an infection rate higher than the flu... just do the math. Lastly, all these numbers are based on the original strain of the virus. Those of us with a micro/virology background understand that viruses mutate all the time (though mostly in benign ways). Should there be a reported mutation that makes it like MERS (34.4 fatality rate), watch out below.\n\nI had posted about the market reactions to this virus since last Tuesday and traded accordingly. Aside from Thursday\u2019s action, my SPY puts and UVXY calls have paid off handsomely. Unfortunately, I pulled out a bit too early when SPY hit 324... With that said, I now have FD 0 day SPY lotto calls for Monday, but long term calls on UVXY, GDXJ, and SLV. If somehow SPY rallies to 328-329 (a gift), I will buy puts 2-3 weeks out. \n\nOutside of trading, please stay safe out there. Good luck.",

SPXL won\u2019t go to 0 unless the SP500 crashes 33%+. \n\nThere was a guy on investing and WSB who put 100k into SPXL in 2009 and it\u2019s now over 1 million.

You will never over save, the cool thing about an HSA is there is so much you can use it for and it sounds like you dont know about (but check it out there seriously is a lot) . you can also save receipts forever (literally forever or at least as long as you live) and reimburse your self later in life\n3. it can be invested, and the gains are not taxable if used for healthcare\n4. no in an HSA you get the tax savings of putting it in growing at the market rate using the same ETF where gains are nontaxable\n5. i have one, its no hassle. just keep the card in your wallet? and its not designed to make healthcare cheaper, its designed to get people to save for healthcare as many healthy adults dont see the benefit at young age, but they realize that some remain healthy even at old age so the gov gives you a way out as income during retirement paying only normal taxes just like a traditional IRA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is one of the best investment vehicles for retirement and/or healthcare",

The price has more than doubled in 6 months. 100% of the time that Tesla\u2019s stock has had upward moves that large it had at the very least a 10-20% decline following. That means if you sold now and price still continued up to $700 and then decline 20% you could buy back at $550. However, imo, since Tesla is now at an all time low of short sellers and is being priced at a 3x multiple of GM stock. It is likely to eventually return to and retest support at $400 before continuing its trend higher. Most will not agree with me but people typically don\u2019t agree with bearish views at tops. Just like when it gets back to $400 everyone will say not to buy even though that\u2019s the best decision to make at that price.",

In this case, the IV crush got the short leg which you sold. So, in this instance, the spread actually was more profitable because the move wasn't very big.\n\nHowever, 5 days later on 11/13, they release initial D+ numbers and had a huge jump. The naked 132 calls now returned 360% whereas the 132/136 spread returned 125%.\n\nWith a big move, you are hampered by the short leg you sold.

        "body": "\n&gt;I really appreciate you taking the time .....I totally see it now with my MA example. \n\nSure thing, glad you got it. I hate to see people losing money that they shouldn't have to, especially if I can help prevent it by simply helping them work out the numbers! \n\n\n&gt;I could sell the feb 7 $277.5 put and collect Friday\u2019s bid of .85 that would be premium of $850 on 1000 shares. \n\nYup, that's correct (keeping in mind that at Monday's open the prices are likely gonna be different; but you got the idea).\n\nAlso, again, I'd recommend not hitting the bid, but rather trying first at mid price or maybe even a bit better. Eg, I see a 0.85 x 0.90 market on those puts (from Friday). I'd try to sell that put for maybe 0.88 first, and then lower my price penny by penny til I get my fill. I also would lower it all the way to the bid, as I would consider I'm being completely ripped off of I have to go all the way there (unless I had a very strong need to do it, like to close a position to prevent massive losses; but not to open a new one).\n\n\n&gt;And the way to protect myself from a loss would be to close the position early before Im down \n$850 and use my premium to prevent loss ?\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure is clear - and, again, because of Put-Call parity, it applies to both a short put and a covered call trades - is that this premium you receive is not really \"a cushion\", not really a way to protect you from losses.\n\nLooking at the short put trade may actually help to see this thing I'm gonna talk about more clearly, but remember the exact same thing applies to CC, just maybe a bit harder to see as things are a bit less explicit.\n\nOnce you sell that put, you don't \"make 850 USD\". You are making a transaction in which 850 USD are exchanged for something worth 850 USD. You have 0 profits of losses initially. So there isn't really an 850 USD cushion.\n\nYou're effectively getting 850 USD now to assume a liability valued by the market at 850 USD now. \n\nIf AAPL goes down, or if IV increases, the premium of that put is going to increase, meaning that you'll be at a loss: you'll have 850 USD cash, and a liability of more than 850 USD market value. \n\nSay AAPL moves in such a way that the put is now worth 1.00. You're at a loss of 0.15 per share, or 150 USD. You can close everything and take that 150 USD loss. More explicitly, you initially received 850 USD to assume a liability, and then you paid 1000 USD to rid yourself from that liability: a 150 USD loss. Notice that the 150 USD loss doesn't even require you to close your trade: you're at a loss simply because you have 850 USD cash and a liability worth 1000 USD cash. It's an \"unrealized loss\", which doesn't mean \"unreal loss\", it's very real! \n\nIf the position is going against you, you can close it at any time, and take (or realize) the loss. A common threshold people use in short put trades is to not let the loss become bigger than the max profit you were looking at. So in this case, this rule of thumb would lead people to close the short put by buying it back for 1.70, if it starts going that way. People usually talk about this by saying stuff like \"close for a loss at 2x the premium received\". \n\nSo this way of \"protection\" is really just getting out of the position - at a loss! - in order to prevent the losses from possibly getting bigger, much bigger. Sometimes people resist it thinking that they may want to hold longer \"to see if it comes back\": problem is, it may also go further! \n\nThere are many other ways to protect yourself, too.\n\nFor example, you could buy a put at a lower strike. It reduces your profitability, since you'll be spending part of the premium you got to acquire this protection. But it effectively limits the max you can lose. Eg if you buy the 270 put, you'll be paying around 0.62 (mid of 0.60 x 0.64 that I see here), but if AAPL tanks to, say, 250, you'll be forced to buy it for 277.5 (your short put) but you have the right to sell it for 270 (yourong put). The trade off is that now, on 10 contracts, the max profit you're looking at is 230 USD (850 USD from selling the 277.5 usd, 620 USD from buying the 270 put). **This is exactly a vertical spread.**\n\nAlternatively, you could short a bit of stock: this reduces the effect of the put increasing in value (this increasing your losses) as the stock price goes down: the profit on the short balances put some of the losses on the short put. People usually think about doing this kind of stuff when the delta of their short put gets too big and scary. Disadvantage is that if the stock moves up, you lose on the short stock position, and this loss can eventually even get bigger than the profits from shorting the put... so it has to be managed actively. **This is usually referred to as managing or hedging delta (and can be done in other ways, too, like reducing the size of the short put position, or selling OTM calls basically transforming it into a strangle, etc).**\n\nSo many possibilities...\n\nIf you want to explore more about this, check whether your trading platform has some good support for risk analysis for options. You didn't mention what it is, so I'm gonna comment on a few popular ones around here. \n\nToS has an OK tool in the Analyze tab: it works well for simple positions, it's pretty easy to use, but it simply cannot handle a more complex position with many legs without slowing down to the point where it becomes unresponsive for 10s of seconds.\n\nIB has absolutely amazing support for analyzing options portfolios in the Risk Navigator tool: it can handle whatever book of option you throw at it with fantastic performance, and IMO it has an incredibly superior model to ToS's, both in terms of its default settings as well as in terms of offering incredibly powerful ways to tweak it if you want (you probably don't, at least not initially).\n\nRobinhood has nothing. Well, it calculates your \"break even\" for single legs... But frankly, I wouldn't trust even that number without verifying it myself every time as RH is just... well, it's RH. \n\nTastyworks is something I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think this aspect would've changed much, since all I see is they trying to push a \"novel\" risk analysis approach: it sucks in this area. (it emphasizes too much this notion of \"probability of profit\", which is really absurd IMO as it isn't anywhere close to reflecting risk, especially in non-trivial positions). \n\nI'll share a couple of screenshot from IB later when I get to my competition so you can get a sense of what it looks like, and how you can explore ways to possibly protect yourself from big losses.",
