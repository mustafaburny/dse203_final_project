I think it is better positioned in real estate market than other technology focussed companies like Zillow in the space. Its focus on tech and investments in expanding platform capabilities is amazing. IMO it is a slow but sure winner in real estate brokerage space.\nMy GWRE average is $79. GWRE is a monopoly in end to end cloud based solutions for large insurance companies. Insurance companies have just started investing in technology/ digital transformation for their processes and have a long way to go. GWRE is coupling its platform capabilities with AI/ML which allows for better CRM, risk management and pricing. I know few consultant friends who are making a killing in implementing this for their customers. The management is awesome as it is led by a former McKinsey partner who had worked in this space for 15 yrs or so.\nWill take your word and buy more ADBE :)",

Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhh???? ROFLMAO ROFLMAO In fact, repeat after me girls, the only reason that my CRM ever trades red is only for purposes of SUCKERING ignorant amateurs and typical slobbering impotent wall street mammas boys into buying ultimately WORTHLESS CRM PUTS, again and again!!!! ROFLMAO ROFLMAO Bottom line: repeat after me girls, my CRM beauty continues to trade within an ONGOING MULTI YEAR BULLISH UPTREND, and will hit a REVISED price target of 230 or HIGHER by close of the month of JAN 2020, and that is a BULLISH TECHNICAL INEVITABILITY that will cause my CRM in the money CALL options to ROCKET IN VALUE!!!! Ladies, I placed my entire net worth, my own luxury home, into my PERFECT PORTFOLIO, both my LONG FAVORITES like CRM, plus my sick rotten short targets, and only SWUNG FOR THE FENCES based upon ABSOLUTE TECHNICAL CERTAINTY, since i am NOT insane!!!!!!!! So, I urge the amateurs, click my name, read my usual BRILLIANT posts, and try to EDUCATE yourselves, if you can, although so many of the average LIMP trader bozos struggle to understand words that are more than two syllables!!! ROFLMAO ROFLMAO",

Nancy Pelosi is bullish on FB, CRM, and AMZN, like every other person with 3 brain cells is.  \n\nLooking at her picks is no more useful than looking at a hedge fund\u2019s holdings.  \n\nThe whole idea is that she *could* time the market or a specific name based on non-public information.  A 30 day reporting lag blows that whole theory up.",
