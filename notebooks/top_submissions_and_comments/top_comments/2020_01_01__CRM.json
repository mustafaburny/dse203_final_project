I think it is better positioned in real estate market than other technology focussed companies like Zillow in the space. Its focus on tech and investments in expanding platform capabilities is amazing. IMO it is a slow but sure winner in real estate brokerage space.\nMy GWRE average is $79. GWRE is a monopoly in end to end cloud based solutions for large insurance companies. Insurance companies have just started investing in technology/ digital transformation for their processes and have a long way to go. GWRE is coupling its platform capabilities with AI/ML which allows for better CRM, risk management and pricing. I know few consultant friends who are making a killing in implementing this for their customers. The management is awesome as it is led by a former McKinsey partner who had worked in this space for 15 yrs or so.\nWill take your word and buy more ADBE :)",

You could also hold and wait for things to turnaround.  \n\nI do see Slack as being an acquisition target.  Any potential acquisition news/rumors would push this stock price back towards the $30s.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Apple, Google, or Salesforce made a play for Slack.  It wouldn't shock me either if Microsoft decided to make a play for Slack.  They've acquired competition before.  Some of the apps I used to use that were acquired by Microsoft were Acompli, Wunderlist, and Sunrise Calendar.  \n\nSlack also has a strategic partnership with Atlassian.  If I'm not mistaken, Atlassian sold some of their related IP to Slack, discontinued their competing product, and started redirecting their customers to Slack.  As Atlassian continues to grow, it wouldn't surprise me if they went back and acquired Slack.\n\nWhatever you do, don't panic sell.  The market is hot right now, but it won't be like that forever.\n\nTL;DR:  Be patient.  Hold.  If not, sell and diversify.  Slack is an attractive acquisition target.",
