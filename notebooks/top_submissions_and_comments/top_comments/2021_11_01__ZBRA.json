        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

The advantage of a ZEBRA over a regular PMCC is that the position doesn't lose much value if the underlying stays sideways. And IIRC a ZEBRA should be less sensitive to IV crush.

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

This seems like a big issue to me at first glance, but it would be unlikely for it to occur as the purchaser of the call would be giving up considerable extrinsic to do so. The owner of the ZEBRA wins in this case as they would pocket the net difference in extrinsic and be left with a 0.7+ delta leap to continue the PMCC.\n\nZEBRA: [https://optionstrat.com/STlUK5KPozt8](https://optionstrat.com/STlUK5KPozt8)\n\nLEAPS: [https://optionstrat.com/gZXCvwAR2laT](https://optionstrat.com/gZXCvwAR2laT)\n\nIn my mind the ZEBRA is theoretically better for higher IV stocks that you expect volatility expansion or stability.

        "body": "Purchasing shares to cover a short position can work, but it can also work against you. It's a very capital-intensive way to cover the position in any case. I've done it before both successful and not. A more capital-efficient way of doing this is cover the short with a deep ITM long option or a ZEBRA. I prefer ZEBRAs, especially long-dated.\n\nYou are always going to get a lot of sanctimonious knee-jerk responses about selling calls from people who have no idea what they are talking about. As someone who has sold naked calls for years, it's risky and it's a lot harder to make money than by put-selling. There's also a lot of value to balanced delta in my opinion. \n\nMost of the time lately they are either challenged or at an unrealized loss, but rarely ITM, depending on your entry delta. You usually get a month or two out of the year where they are the only thing that pays. It's easy to not be stupid about it. Don't trade meme stocks and don't sell 400 naked puts on a $20K account. The last few months have been rough, because a lot of stuff is up significantly more than volatility had priced in. Vol is just way under priced right now. I have strangles on MSFT, CVS, WMT and XRT that have all blown way past my short call strike. I'm inverted on all of them. At the same time, a lot of stuff has tanked and gone way past my short put strikes.",

        "body": "There\u2019s a lot of opinions here on your OP, and it really boils down to various factors everyone is considering from their own perspectives.  \n\nThose suggesting simply owning shares and selling covered calls are taking a more conservative approach in case the SPY crashes.  They can technically \u201chold forever\u201d and one day realize profitability while collecting some pocket change along the way.  But if it did tank, how long will that capital be tied up?  And it\u2019s quite a bit more capital than the contract.\n\nThe contract is somewhat more risky, in the event of a steep decline due to the time constraint and leverage, but you also utilize less capital up-front to \u201ccontrol\u201d the same amount of shares - leaving you the opportunity to potentially put money in other places to offset any losses you may or may not see here. (Diversification).  Of course, you can also sell calls in this strategy as well to collect some change along the way also.  \n\nHave you ever considered a ZEBRA LEAP?  It may not be what you\u2019re looking for or comfortable with, but it is one more strategy that may be something worth looking into\u2026.\n\nThe other thing I think a lot of people commenting here are concerned with is an imminent \u201ccrash\u201d.  The FED\u2019s announced strategy of tapering each month and potentially raising rates next summer aren\u2019t set in stone.  There\u2019s no way JPOW and this administration will continue down that path if the market is looking like it\u2019s going into meltdown.

        "body": "I was thinking that synthetic positions are cheap leverage. For example, a 2023 SPY synthetic (one short ATM put, one long ATM call) currently requires \\~$14,700 in collateral and 0 cash, and a SPY ZEBRA requires $12000 in cash. Both of these represent $46,000 worth of SPY, so you are getting 3x+ leverage. You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k. These make sense to hold for long periods as leveraged SPY plays, right?",

        "body": "Purchasing shares to cover a short position can work, but it can also work against you. It's a very capital-intensive way to cover the position in any case. I've done it before both successful and not. A more capital-efficient way of doing this is cover the short with a deep ITM long option or a ZEBRA. I prefer ZEBRAs, especially long-dated.\n\nYou are always going to get a lot of sanctimonious knee-jerk responses about selling calls from people who have no idea what they are talking about. As someone who has sold naked calls for years, it's risky and it's a lot harder to make money than by put-selling. There's also a lot of value to balanced delta in my opinion. \n\nMost of the time lately they are either challenged or at an unrealized loss, but rarely ITM, depending on your entry delta. You usually get a month or two out of the year where they are the only thing that pays. It's easy to not be stupid about it. Don't trade meme stocks and don't sell 400 naked puts on a $20K account. The last few months have been rough, because a lot of stuff is up significantly more than volatility had priced in. Vol is just way under priced right now. I have strangles on MSFT, CVS, WMT and XRT that have all blown way past my short call strike. I'm inverted on all of them. At the same time, a lot of stuff has tanked and gone way past my short put strikes.",
