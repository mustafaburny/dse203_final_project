        "body": "Question: How would I completely delta-hedge a long stock position (of any number of shares) without or greatly minimizing theta burn.\n\nI am trying to understand how I would go about \\*completely\\* delta hedging a long stock position (of any number of shares) while having no/minimal theta burn (which I believe disqualifies protective puts).\n\nFor example, in an ideal scenario: Suppose I hold 1000 shares of some stock, I would like to figure out an option scheme such any direction of price movement of said stock, my account balance stays completely flat (or bull biased with all potential downside mitigated).  However, I want to be able to completely hedge with extremely minimal theta costs.  Would this imply deeply in the money and long dated puts/LEAPS? Or is there some kind of spread that would allow me to do this more cheaply?\n\nSpecific example, going in WORK earnings last month with 1K shares and 10 puts expiring June 30th, however, WORK tanked but my 10 puts were not enough to offset my losses when the market opened the next day.  Was it purely not having enough put delta?  I want to be able to have come out of WORK earnings somehow covering all potential downside of the stock declining and have it cost a very/small amount of theta as possible.\n\nAnother example, I bought STX into an ex-dividend last month for a day to capture the dividend then exit asap, but I wanted to ensure that any price drop would be mitigated so that I can go into the ex-dividend without the typical risk of the stock dropping by the price of the dividend and creating a decline in balance.  \n\nI can't help but feel I am misunderstanding something.",

By no means am I an expert in this field yet, but I'm betting that their sizable increase in subscriptions, and the completion of the STX merger opening up new markets and increasing equity funding and credit (from JP Morgan), will lead to the price increasing in the long run. We'll probably see a similar pump up soon before their brand launch in September, followed by profit-taking. Of course, since I have money invested here, it'll most likely all just go to crap because that's how things actually work.",

I'm a cable cord cutter, but family wanted entertainment. So I compared mainly Netflix with Amazon, but research led me to study Roku.....and only for the remote control ability! I had a great experience with Seagate, and this Roku was giving me a similar vibe. So I took a gamble and bought 150 shares in one of my \"forget-it-about\" brokerage accounts. $10K is usually my starting investment, and I got it around $72 back in March. Again....TOTAL speculation and totally forgot I owned it! And if it weren't for some chatter about it yesterday, I would never had known how much it had appreciated. Lol, my PT was only $100, but when I saw that it was $150, I sold it all! Doubled my money in just a few months on something I wasn't expecting much. Might get back into it, but ROKU is not something I \"love\" so will have to think about it.",

The last hit movie it produced was in 2015 (bajirao mastani). I cant even recall any new bollywood music they have produced. \n\nI enjoyed watching the Eros entertainment banner when I was younger, but the scene is alot more competitive than it used to be in India in the 80s and 90s. All the top actors have launched their own production houses and tseries basically rules the music rights. \n\nI'm not sure how the STX merger will pan out. STX is more of a indie based company and  Indians enjoy over the top extravagant movies. Most indie productions don't bring in the box office numbers.",
