        "body": "NET and AKAM dropping on this news is crazy and a buying opportunity. [The huge spike of fake fancy bear DDoS extortion attacks](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/09/major-global-ransom-denial-of-service-campaign-continues-rising-trend-in-global-ddos-attacks/) is going to be a revenue and earnings driver for both companies. The levels of DDoS attacks happening around the world right now is simply unprecedented and driving companies to adopt DDoS mitigation services at rates never seen before.  In the security industry we are calling this DDoS extortion campaign the 3rd pandemic along with COVID and Ransomware. \n\nThe [FBI](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-thousands-of-orgs-targeted-by-rdos-extortion-campaign/amp/) is saying THOUSANDS of organizations have been hit since mid August. These companies are being driven into the arms of AKAM and NET to avoid extortion demands of 20-30 BTC.  Depending on the provider and the customer characteristics, these contracts will have a $50-$200K one time emergency set up fee and monthly recurring charges between $5K-$50K based on the bandwidth the website or the network consumes.  It\u2019s also worth mentioning that [OFAC warned on October 1st](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.natlawreview.com/article/ofac-advisory-warns-civil-penalties-ransomware-payments%3famp) that companies who pay ransoms to sanctioned entities may face civil liabilities making it SUPER risky for a company to pay an extortion demand. \n\nAKAM is the gold standard for critical firms like Financial Services and was [engaged](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-shifts-to-akamai-says-trading-continues-despite-site-being-down-again/6PRQ5W7SAMXA5Z5FKVRTQCSIXI/) when NZX Stock Exchange was hit in August. Their prices are high, but top tier firms are willing to pay. AKAM should be able to take a significant amount of the high end of the market. They have maintained market share and grown despite new entrants to the CDN market. Their Kona  platform is hugely capable at wrapping security and DDoS mitigation services around CDN. Their Prolexic Scrubbing Centers offer some of the industry\u2019s best network layer DDoS mitigation (Prolexic was best in class at this in 2014 when they were acquired by AKAM and only got better with scale).  \n\nNET stands to massively benefit from this spike in DDoS attacks as well. Their \u201cfreemium\u201d business model is designed for events like this. In a [recent investor presentation ](https://cloudflare.net/files/doc_downloads/Presentations/2020/q2/Cloudflare-Q2-2020-Investor-Presentation_FINAL.pdf) they discuss how they invert the typical marketing approach and rely on customers to \u201cpull\u201d them into new services and markets. This is the type of storm them have been waiting for. Their CDN and \u201cSpectrum\u201d application layer DDoS mitigation services give AKAM a run for their money and their network/BGP layer \u201cMagic Transit\u201d services are innovative and disruptive.  The current \u201cfake fancy bear\u201d attacks will likely drive significant Magic Transit revenue because these attacks are aimed at the network layer.  The beautiful thing here is the cost of this revenue is almost nothing because of their demand/pull business model and the fact that Magic Transit capacity is only utilized during an active attack. In other words, NET can put massive numbers of customers on the Magic Transit platform and not consume additional resources.  NET is also small enough that doubling or tripling security services revenue will have a big impact on the overall P&amp;L. \n\nTo put the scale of these attacks in perspective, I\u2019ve talked to engineers at one of the largest and most respected domain registrars. In many cases if you want to enable DDoS mitigation services you must modify your domain registration record to point to a new set of DNS servers. This change is usually a quick phone call and takes 5-10 minutes. This domain registrar said they have been making DNS server changes for companies that needed DDoS mitigation services 24x7.... for 5 weeks straight!!!  They said it\u2019s been unlike anything they have ever seen.   While this is an indirect indicator, I believe it\u2019s a pretty good proxy of demand happening over at AKAM and NET and is the reason I went long on both recently. \n\nSo... yeah. Buy the dip...",

        "body": "For edge computing and VPN, maybe not, but Gartner and Forrester both have them at the top of the stack for DDoS. While some companies may augment cloud and carrier based DDoS mitigation services with on-prem solutions like Radware, Akamai has generally been the choice of large financial services firms for mission critical sites. They also tend to use their CDN market share to cross sell their Kona and Prolexic solutions.  My only hesitation is they tend to be expensive and I am astonished they maintain pricing power with players like CloudFlare, Fastly and even AWS entering the market.  However they appear to be doing OK fending off these new players.\n\nNow CloudFlare on the other hand, seems to be making inroads in all the spaces you mention. Not only do they have serious creds in the CDN and DDoS market, they are pretty much competing head to head with ZScaler now in the SASE space.  If they can execute effectively, they could radically alter the cloud security market. This could make them an attractive acquisition target, especially if they see a significant dip in stock price.",

The Signal Sciences acquisition was smart and gives them good capabilities in the security space, but they are kind of bit players in the DDoS space. \n\nMy biggest concern with them regarding DDoS is they don\u2019t do BGP/Network layer scrubbing. They can do \u201corigin cloaking\u201d and try to hide your home network, but if attackers find you by ASN or Whois Infomation, your home network is dead. \n\nAt a 10,000 ft level, DDOS protection should have 3 layers.  1- Protect your network, 2- protect your DNS and 3- protect your websites.  Fastly excels at the website layer but is weak on the other two. \n\nFor me, this play was very specific to the breadth and impact of fancy bear attack techniques.   I went long Akamai and CloudFront because they have great solutions that counter this threat specifically. \n\nIf this extortion DDoS thing take off with other threat groups, AKAM will be the Microsoft Teams of the pandemic and NET will be the Zoom of the pandemic. Everyone will need a solution and these players are ideally placed.",

There\u2019s a little caveat, though. While changing DNS resolvers is easy (I\u2019ve always used bind and you literally open up a text file, change a couple of lines, then save it), one thing that is tricky is the TTL. That is an indication for downstream servers as to how long they should leave the current records in cache. For google.com on 8.8.8.8, it\u2019s set to 1800 s. So if it could take up to 30 minutes before that DNS change propagates out. For JoeBobDildoAndCreamPies.com, it might be much higher (for my personal domains I set it to a day). So while the change only takes a few minutes, it could be much longer before the effects of the DDoS die down. Still, this is great news for NET, because now they have a new customer and can protect them going forward. \n\nBTW, look into CRWD as well. They are not exactly in the same space as NET (more like adjacent). They\u2019ve been involved with Fancy Bear in the past and were definitely a cyber firm whose name name up during the 2016 election.\n\n\n[edit] not sure why it didn\u2019t click for me that AKAM is Akamai when I first read this, but they are top notch as well.

        "body": "I do this kind of thing for a living and it\u2019s not my first DDoS rodeo. I\u2019ve lived through several waves of these attacks and seen multiple generations of solutions.  At first we had to figure out how to do it ourselves with on-prem solutions like Radware and Arbor.  Next you had scrappy upstarts like Prolexic that used those techs to build scrubbing centers and offered services to those that couldn\u2019t protect themselves.  Then there was a wave of acquisitions and others trying scale the scrubbing center idea (e.g. Akamai buying Prolexic, carriers adding DDoS services). Now we have some entrenched players like Akamai, CloudFlare and some of the carriers, but I recently noticed that players like A-10, Radware and F5 are getting in the game with hybrid cloud/on-prem DDoS solutions.  From a technical perspective, these are an improvement over the 3 layers of defense I mentioned above because there is an on-perm component, but practically I think only a relatively small subset of customers will need this level of protection. \n\nGenerally some mix of A-10, Radware and Arbor will probably be the technologies the big players like Akamai, CloudFlare, Lumen and even Fastly use to deliver their services. So as these solutions providers build out there networks and scrubbing centers A-10 and the other hardware vendors could benefit in the same way a steel company will benefit when car sales trend up. \n\nThat said, A-10 is a pretty niche player. I run a team at a Fortune 50 multi-national and I\u2019ve only ever used a single pair of A-10 boxes on my network and those were eventually replaced by a feature on Palo Alto firewalls.  I suppose they could be an acquisition target if their tech is good, but I think they\u2019ll have a hard time competing against carriers and CDNs over time because the latter will have an easier time cross selling and up selling. I know I would rather expand services with a current vendor and push for volume discounts than go through the pain of cutting a contract with a new vendor for a niche tech.",

        "body": "Fastly doesn\u2019t do network layer/BGP driven scrubbing. They\u2019ll do a good job at protecting your website from volumetric and layer 7 attacks if its riding their CDN, but they can\u2019t protect your home network by using BGP to send traffic destined to your on-prem network to a scrubbing center. They have an \u201corigin cloaking\u201d feature where they try to hide your home network, but the fake fancy bear f\u2019ckers will find your on-prem networks by publicly available ASN and Whois information. \n\nThese attacks are basically volumetric UDP fragmentation and NTP/DNS amplification designed to clog network pipes going into your on-prem networks and data centers. Sure, maybe you don\u2019t have home data centers because all your infrastructure is in the cloud and you operate under a 100% zero trust SASE model and aren\u2019t vulnerable, however this is like 1% of real companies. \n\nAt a high level DDoS mitigation requires protection at 3 layers. 1- protect your websites, 2-protect your DNS, 3-protect your critical networks. \n\nFastly does #1. Defending against fancy bear requires #3. Akamai and CloudFlare have much more diverse offerings and can do all three. It\u2019s worth noting that large carriers like Lumen (formerly Level3/CenturyLink), ATT, and T-Mobile (in Europe) also do number 3 very well and are certainly seeing an uptick in this kind of business. I just don\u2019t know how much it will impact their overall P&amp;L.  I\u2019ve been watching these guys and may take a long position going into their individual earnings reports. \n\nTL/DR Fastly protects websites and not networks. These attacks target networks. NET and AKAM can protect networks and defend against these attacks.",

        "body": "For long term investment, time in market generally beats timing the market. ICLN gained $1.45 today, up 6.5% to close at something like $21.45. It could lose all of those gains tomorrow. But if you\u2019re planning to hold for 3-5 years (or longer) and the price goes to, say, $400, do you really think you\u2019ll be kicking yourself about losing out on $1.45? Probably not. Better to jump in now and add a set amount on a monthly basis than miss out on potential gains. \n\nETFs or Stonks? I buy both \u2018non-diversified\u2019 ETFs and pure-play stonks. The former are lower risk but also lower (potential) reward than the latter. I buy the pure play if I know the company, it has a good track record, wide moat, and is currently pushing the field. I go with ETFs to diversify within fields that I think will take off in the future, but where a pure play is a bit too risky or I don\u2019t know much about the field. The more I know about the industry, the more comfortable I am going pure play. \n\nI have about 10-15% of my portfolio on \u201cgreen revolution\u201d stuff like ICLN, QCLN, PBW, and TSLA. I think green energy and EVs are definitely going to be huge, but the big question is when. Batteries are a major hurdle for intermittent solar and wind, efficient and cheap purification/generation for hydrogen. Once those are solved (and batteries probably sooner than H2), this field will skyrocket. We could be in a dotcom-like bubble with these guys right now (is TSLA the next Yahoo?), but maybe not. Who knows. Time in market, diversify. \n\nI have another 10% or so in ARKs. ARKK is well comparatively diversified and pretty much consists of the Crown Jewels of all of the other ARKs. That said, ARKG has provided better returns. I\u2019m a biologist, and biotech is moving at an incredible pace. It\u2019s a much surer thing in the short (2-5yr) term than clean energy. I\u2019ve also bought a number of the stocks in the ARKG portfolio independently. TXG has been skyrocketing recently, and for good reason. They\u2019ve already had a huge impact on the field and show tremendous promise for future gains. They\u2019re basically a household name in my field, which is saying something for a company that went public just over a year ago. CRSP is another promising company. The founder just won the Nobel yesterday (up 16% today on the news), and CRSPR offers the potential to cure diseases, not just treat them. The people at ARK are really doing their research, and I have no problem piggy-backing on \u2018em. \n\nAnother field you might want to consider is semiconductors. AI, gaming, VR, data analysis/mining gaming, fintech, internet-of-things, you name it, the tech is based on computer chips. My bet is a lot of the processing that\u2019s currently done on a device is going to shift to the cloud as software demands begin to outpace hardware capabilities. That means server farms, which are simply massive numbers of GPUs, CPUs, SSDs, memory, etc. Company-wise, AMD, NVDA, TSM, and AMAT are all at the forefront, and their stocks have all killed in the last few months/years. SMH and SOXX are good semiconductor-focused ETFs. I have about 15% of my portfolio here. \n\nI also have some in COVID darling stuff like ZM, MRNA, BNTX that I got in on early and will probably be selling in the 3-6 months. Wouldn\u2019t suggest any of these at this point, especially given your goals here. \n\nThe rest is safer play blue-chip stuff like MSFT, APPL, TMO, ADBE, etc. - these guys all have massive war chests, which means they\u2019ll probably be expanding in the coming downturn, whereas other, more indebted companies will be contracting or going belly up.\n\nThat\u2019s my 10 cents. That\u2019ll be 10 cents...",

(you might have better luck at a casino...) There\u2019s plenty of information out there on selling credit spreads. \n\nIf multi leg strategies seem too complicated, what may benefit you the most right now would be to find companies you believe will do especially well in the future (e.g. AI/chip designers/manufacturers (nvda, intc, qcom, amd, amat, mu), home delivery (Amazon, chewy, Walmart)). After you find what you believe to be a few solid companies, trade shares (buy low, sell high) to get a general feel for each stock\u2019s price movement. This will help you immensely in understanding position sizing and will train you to spot opportunities to open/close options positions. \n\nOnce you\u2019re totally confident on an options strategy I\u2019d only risk at most 5%-10% of your capital. Even with what appears to be a completely winning options strategy, you must be prepared to lose it all. Things will happen in the market that will totally catch you off guard.

Aphria has turned things around but there was a very, very long stretch where they were not executing correctly and the past acquisition bullshit is still going to echo on the balance sheet for a long time.\n\nWhat's happening in Lesotho, LATAM, Israel, England?  Where are the thinstrips they PR'd?  The state of the art kitchen in Leamington where the edibles were going to roll out from?  The beverage partnerships they teased?\n\nSo it's nuance.  If you rightly crow about market share, leading multiple market segments, brand recognition, markedly improved flower etc you are also going to need to discuss goodwill, inventory, lawsuits.  It's how people talk about the cash but they don't talk about the debt.\n\nSo when I hear rah rah bullshit I like to counter it.

I'm giving no advice here, but apple still has a little room to run, tesla has been pushed but i'm sure even tho a dip is coming you could probably see a big return in the long run. facebook will probably have the opportunities to scale up more then most from where they currently are i believe they have the highest potential. theirs other big ones but whatever i guess just buy nuggies and be an autist or whatever no ones going to buy and hold 30 years here.",

        "body": "I was 13 years old back in the mid-90\u2019s when I first got into stocks. My dad loved the stock market and taught me about it. I had been working a lot of odd jobs mowing lawns, pet sitting for neighbors etc and I usually made close to a thousand bucks every summer. Over the next 3-5 years I slowly got Merck, Compaq, AOL, Microsoft and Cisco (with my dad\u2019s help). Commissions were expensive back then so every stock trade had to be carefully thought out. \n\nBy the early 2000\u2019s I setup an account for online stock trading (which was brand new back then). I had a part time job working in a kitchen and I was earning regular, but small, paychecks. I put as much as I comfortably could into stocks I liked. It really wasn\u2019t a lot of money but every bit helped. Commissions were cheaper online but still cost $10 to buy and another $10 to sell and fractional shares were not available to me so I had to make every stock trade count. It was challenging. \n\nThere was no Reddit stocks forum like this, YouTube wasn\u2019t out yet, and cell phones (if you even had one) didn\u2019t really have apps especially not stock apps... so information on trending stocks was a little more difficult for me to find. I did read cbs market watch (now called marketwatch.com) and yahoo finance but to a teenager I often didn\u2019t know what to make of news stories I found there. The world was changing so fast 9-11 bombing, war in Iraq, internet, cell phones, laptops became a thing, email replaced sending letters, newspapers got replaced by online news. \n\nEverything\u2019s easier now. Trying to predict the stock market back then felt a lot harder than now and with a lot less information available back then too. These days you can look up stocks online, get charts, find which ETFs hold it and get news articles about it then go buy a fractional share of it without paying a commission -all instantly online! Back in my day...lol... I had to call my stock broker and ask him to mail me information about a stock, wait 3 days to get it in the mail then I had to call him back up and pay $35 or $50 commission just to have the stockbroker initiate the stock purchase then I would get the paperwork in the mail to see what I bought it at. It\u2019s almost dangerous how easy everything is now. I worry that young people now can get swept up in whatever is trending and make rash decisions without even knowing what they are even doing.",

        "body": "Hi! \n\nI was basically you 2 years ago. (27 years old, resident of Latvia, started investing into US stocks with Interactive Brokers)\n\nMy strategy was also pretty similar: part of portfolio in ETF (S&amp;P 500 ETF=VUSA) + blue chips from different sectors with few dividends, like you said  \"my own little \"ETF '. I like your picks, I started with few of them: MSFT, AAPL, NKE + many others like Google, Visa, Mastercard, Johnson&amp;Johnson, Activision Blizzard, Sony, and United Health.\n\nAfter 2 years I have pretty diversified by sectors (mostly Tech tho) portfolio of 23 stocks (75%) +  ETF VUSA (25%). Learned a lot of about stock market through this period of time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I'm still undecided on Intel, Broadcom, Brookfield Renewables, Bank of America, Next Era Energy, Duke, Southern, Welltower, Toronto Dominion and Caterpillar. \n\nI really like INTC (bought after the dip) currently my biggest position, also similar stock is Cisco (also good % of my portfolio) if you like some kind of undervalued stock. \n\nBroadcom might be good buy too. \n\nBrookfield Renewables - I have no idea, but I hold Renewable Energy Group (REGI) stock as my pick for that sector. \n\nBank of America - I like it, even tho I have bought JPMorgan instead but I believe they are pretty similar fundamentally +similar price graphic. \n\nNext Era Energy - was considered to buy, but price was always too high for me lol\n\nDuke, Southern, Welltower, Toronto Dominion - Have no idea.\n\nCaterpillar - was considered to buy year ago, but not anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;my strategy about 20% tech 20% real estate 15% consumer 10% Finance 10% healthcare 5% telecom, 10% utilities and 10% Industrials. \n\nThat's pretty solid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I also plan on buying some Polish dividend stocks since its my original currency :D \n\nLet me guess,  CDR is one of them? )) \n\n\\--------\n\nOne of the things I changed in my strategy after 2 years are dividend stocks. I used to super like them but after few researches/reads and comparing historical returns of VYM (dividend stocks index) vs S&amp;P500 returns I see lower profitability for the price of constant income (dividends) which I will reinvest back to the market. If you're 55+ years old then ofc you would prefer it vs growth.",

As usual always do your own dd :-)\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t comment on the stock price, etc. I share facts and an issue with the buy back and Outstanding Shares.\n\nHere is my post below: \n\nBig Beer RuhRoh WHOOPSIE! - BBRW - But but but.... share repurchases... yet OS go... UP!\n\nI do not have a current position in this and haven\u2019t for quite a bit. Is there money to be made here, maybe, is there money to be lost, definitely.\n\nI would be very very wary before the next earnings comes out.\n\nThis $1.5 million buy back has been going on since early September. \n\nVerified from Transfer Agent on OTCMarkets\n\nOS start as of 9/1 - 1,668,839,113\n\nOS today 10/2 - 1,874,269,389\n\nThat is an increase of about 12% in OS or a bit over 205 MILLION! \n\n$1.5mil in shares at $0.004 would be 375 million shares... if they only managed to do 1/3 that should still be a reduction of 125mil\n\nIf you\u2019re determined to light your money on fire you could PayPal or Venmo me some instead. \n\nSeriously though make sure to be aware of the next update in November for OS or in the Q3 ER. No I don\u2019t know when the next ER will come out. \n\nSomeone should really ask the CEO how shares go up when they\u2019re buying back. You could also ask that pumper on Twitter and iHub who keeps saying he is buying millions at a time. \n\nPlease also take the time to learn to read OTCMarkets, tons of free info there.\n\nScreenshots from OTC\nhttps://ibb.co/d6pFRXv\nhttps://ibb.co/HHGRM8L\n\nGood luck y\u2019all",

I prefer to overweight those kinds of sectors instead of scarifying my diversification :)",
