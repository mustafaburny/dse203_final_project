[The huge spike of fake fancy bear DDoS extortion attacks](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/09/major-global-ransom-denial-of-service-campaign-continues-rising-trend-in-global-ddos-attacks/) is going to be a revenue and earnings driver for both companies. The levels of DDoS attacks happening around the world right now is simply unprecedented and driving companies to adopt DDoS mitigation services at rates never seen before.  In the security industry we are calling this DDoS extortion campaign the 3rd pandemic along with COVID and Ransomware. \n\nThe [FBI](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-thousands-of-orgs-targeted-by-rdos-extortion-campaign/amp/) is saying THOUSANDS of organizations have been hit since mid August. These companies are being driven into the arms of AKAM and NET to avoid extortion demands of 20-30 BTC.  Depending on the provider and the customer characteristics, these contracts will have a $50-$200K one time emergency set up fee and monthly recurring charges between $5K-$50K based on the bandwidth the website or the network consumes.  It\u2019s also worth mentioning that [OFAC warned on October 1st](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.natlawreview.com/article/ofac-advisory-warns-civil-penalties-ransomware-payments%3famp) that companies who pay ransoms to sanctioned entities may face civil liabilities making it SUPER risky for a company to pay an extortion demand. \n\nAKAM is the gold standard for critical firms like Financial Services and was [engaged](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-shifts-to-akamai-says-trading-continues-despite-site-being-down-again/6PRQ5W7SAMXA5Z5FKVRTQCSIXI/) when NZX Stock Exchange was hit in August. Their prices are high, but top tier firms are willing to pay. AKAM should be able to take a significant amount of the high end of the market. They have maintained market share and grown despite new entrants to the CDN market. Their Kona  platform is hugely capable at wrapping security and DDoS mitigation services around CDN. Their Prolexic Scrubbing Centers offer some of the industry\u2019s best network layer DDoS mitigation (Prolexic was best in class at this in 2014 when they were acquired by AKAM and only got better with scale).  \n\nNET stands to massively benefit from this spike in DDoS attacks as well. Their \u201cfreemium\u201d business model is designed for events like this. In a [recent investor presentation ](https://cloudflare.net/files/doc_downloads/Presentations/2020/q2/Cloudflare-Q2-2020-Investor-Presentation_FINAL.pdf) they discuss how they invert the typical marketing approach and rely on customers to \u201cpull\u201d them into new services and markets. This is the type of storm them have been waiting for. Their CDN and \u201cSpectrum\u201d application layer DDoS mitigation services give AKAM a run for their money and their network/BGP layer \u201cMagic Transit\u201d services are innovative and disruptive.  The current \u201cfake fancy bear\u201d attacks will likely drive significant Magic Transit revenue because these attacks are aimed at the network layer.  The beautiful thing here is the cost of this revenue is almost nothing because of their demand/pull business model and the fact that Magic Transit capacity is only utilized during an active attack. In other words, NET can put massive numbers of customers on the Magic Transit platform and not consume additional resources.  NET is also small enough that doubling or tripling security services revenue will have a big impact on the overall P&amp;L. \n\nTo put the scale of these attacks in perspective, I\u2019ve talked to engineers at one of the largest and most respected domain registrars. In many cases if you want to enable DDoS mitigation services you must modify your domain registration record to point to a new set of DNS servers. This change is usually a quick phone call and takes 5-10 minutes. This domain registrar said they have been making DNS server changes for companies that needed DDoS mitigation services 24x7.... for 5 weeks straight!!!  They said it\u2019s been unlike anything they have ever seen.   While this is an indirect indicator, I believe it\u2019s a pretty good proxy of demand happening over at AKAM and NET and is the reason I went long on both recently. \n\nSo... yeah. Buy the dip...",

This domain registrar said they have been making DNS server changes for companies that needed DDoS mitigation services 24x7.... for 5 weeks straight!!! \n\nThis is mostly true. There\u2019s a little caveat, though. While changing DNS resolvers is easy (I\u2019ve always used bind and you literally open up a text file, change a couple of lines, then save it), one thing that is tricky is the TTL. That is an indication for downstream servers as to how long they should leave the current records in cache. For google.com on 8.8.8.8, it\u2019s set to 1800 s. So if it could take up to 30 minutes before that DNS change propagates out. For JoeBobDildoAndCreamPies.com, it might be much higher (for my personal domains I set it to a day). So while the change only takes a few minutes, it could be much longer before the effects of the DDoS die down. Still, this is great news for NET, because now they have a new customer and can protect them going forward. \n\nBTW, look into CRWD as well. They are not exactly in the same space as NET (more like adjacent). They\u2019ve been involved with Fancy Bear in the past and were definitely a cyber firm whose name name up during the 2016 election.\n\n\n[edit] not sure why it didn\u2019t click for me that AKAM is Akamai when I first read this, but they are top notch as well.

Throw a dart on the list of QQQ stocks and you\u2019ll find overvaluation, which may be the new norm for a while. It\u2019s definitely a story as old as time.\n\nIt may be fair to price FSLY lower with a slight premium against their established incumbents thanks to some innovation they bring to the table. This may become reality with time. For instance, Akamai is priced like a digital utility but was the hot CDN in its heyday. \n\nIn some ways this craziness does have a twisted benefit: without these peaks and valleys in prices, there are less opportunities because the market, as a whole, would agree on a tighter price range. \ud83d\ude43\n\nI have no idea when the tide will go out, so I just prefer to invest in stocks that I\u2019m comfortable holding LT - even as a bag holder if I timed my buys poorly.

Its a higher risk trade but this is definitely a good spot to buy and hold for a while IMO. Most will disagree but I work in Devops and they are best in class CDN. Better than NET, better than Akamai IMO",

        "body": "I do this kind of thing for a living and it\u2019s not my first DDoS rodeo. I\u2019ve lived through several waves of these attacks and seen multiple generations of solutions.  At first we had to figure out how to do it ourselves with on-prem solutions like Radware and Arbor.  Next you had scrappy upstarts like Prolexic that used those techs to build scrubbing centers and offered services to those that couldn\u2019t protect themselves.  Then there was a wave of acquisitions and others trying scale the scrubbing center idea (e.g. Akamai buying Prolexic, carriers adding DDoS services). Now we have some entrenched players like Akamai, CloudFlare and some of the carriers, but I recently noticed that players like A-10, Radware and F5 are getting in the game with hybrid cloud/on-prem DDoS solutions.  From a technical perspective, these are an improvement over the 3 layers of defense I mentioned above because there is an on-perm component, but practically I think only a relatively small subset of customers will need this level of protection. \n\nGenerally some mix of A-10, Radware and Arbor will probably be the technologies the big players like Akamai, CloudFlare, Lumen and even Fastly use to deliver their services. So as these solutions providers build out there networks and scrubbing centers A-10 and the other hardware vendors could benefit in the same way a steel company will benefit when car sales trend up. \n\nThat said, A-10 is a pretty niche player. I run a team at a Fortune 50 multi-national and I\u2019ve only ever used a single pair of A-10 boxes on my network and those were eventually replaced by a feature on Palo Alto firewalls.  I suppose they could be an acquisition target if their tech is good, but I think they\u2019ll have a hard time competing against carriers and CDNs over time because the latter will have an easier time cross selling and up selling. I know I would rather expand services with a current vendor and push for volume discounts than go through the pain of cutting a contract with a new vendor for a niche tech.",

They\u2019ll do a good job at protecting your website from volumetric and layer 7 attacks if its riding their CDN, but they can\u2019t protect your home network by using BGP to send traffic destined to your on-prem network to a scrubbing center. They have an \u201corigin cloaking\u201d feature where they try to hide your home network, but the fake fancy bear f\u2019ckers will find your on-prem networks by publicly available ASN and Whois information. \n\nThese attacks are basically volumetric UDP fragmentation and NTP/DNS amplification designed to clog network pipes going into your on-prem networks and data centers. Sure, maybe you don\u2019t have home data centers because all your infrastructure is in the cloud and you operate under a 100% zero trust SASE model and aren\u2019t vulnerable, however this is like 1% of real companies. \n\nAt a high level DDoS mitigation requires protection at 3 layers. 1- protect your websites, 2-protect your DNS, 3-protect your critical networks. \n\nFastly does #1. Defending against fancy bear requires #3. Akamai and CloudFlare have much more diverse offerings and can do all three. It\u2019s worth noting that large carriers like Lumen (formerly Level3/CenturyLink), ATT, and T-Mobile (in Europe) also do number 3 very well and are certainly seeing an uptick in this kind of business. I just don\u2019t know how much it will impact their overall P&amp;L.  I\u2019ve been watching these guys and may take a long position going into their individual earnings reports. \n\nTL/DR Fastly protects websites and not networks. These attacks target networks. NET and AKAM can protect networks and defend against these attacks.",

        "body": "I do this kind of thing for a living and it\u2019s not my first DDoS rodeo. I\u2019ve lived through several waves of these attacks and seen multiple generations of solutions.  At first we had to figure out how to do it ourselves with on-prem solutions like Radware and Arbor.  Next you had scrappy upstarts like Prolexic that used those techs to build scrubbing centers and offered services to those that couldn\u2019t protect themselves.  Then there was a wave of acquisitions and others trying scale the scrubbing center idea (e.g. Akamai buying Prolexic, carriers adding DDoS services). Now we have some entrenched players like Akamai, CloudFlare and some of the carriers, but I recently noticed that players like A-10, Radware and F5 are getting in the game with hybrid cloud/on-prem DDoS solutions.  From a technical perspective, these are an improvement over the 3 layers of defense I mentioned above because there is an on-perm component, but practically I think only a relatively small subset of customers will need this level of protection. \n\nGenerally some mix of A-10, Radware and Arbor will probably be the technologies the big players like Akamai, CloudFlare, Lumen and even Fastly use to deliver their services. So as these solutions providers build out there networks and scrubbing centers A-10 and the other hardware vendors could benefit in the same way a steel company will benefit when car sales trend up. \n\nThat said, A-10 is a pretty niche player. I run a team at a Fortune 50 multi-national and I\u2019ve only ever used a single pair of A-10 boxes on my network and those were eventually replaced by a feature on Palo Alto firewalls.  I suppose they could be an acquisition target if their tech is good, but I think they\u2019ll have a hard time competing against carriers and CDNs over time because the latter will have an easier time cross selling and up selling. I know I would rather expand services with a current vendor and push for volume discounts than go through the pain of cutting a contract with a new vendor for a niche tech.",

And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted. I just wish he would back away from financial markets, because that is not going to be about real economy and employers and employee.

With SHLL at 47.80, if you actually like the company and intend to hold it for a while, the warrants are the way to go.\n\nThat doesn't mean anything is guaranteed--the common can drop below that $35 figure--but your odds are better in the warrants than the common right now.",
