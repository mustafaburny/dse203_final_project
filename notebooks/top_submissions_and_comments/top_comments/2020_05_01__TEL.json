        "body": "TLDR: they issued a lot of warrants that will dilute equity quite a bit. 5,142,859 ADSs that represent 15 shares each with a 2.25 exercise price and no expiration. Doing the math assuming everything is exercised, that adds 15X5142859= 77142885 shares, thus diluting the 12.1 million existing open shares by 63%, hence the suddenly much lower price. This is likely not a rebound play.  The math suggests their price should drop another 30%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom their announcement:\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel, May 26, 2020  /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0BioLineRx Ltd.
