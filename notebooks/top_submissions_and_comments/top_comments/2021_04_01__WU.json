        "body": "This is different from the correction we had in the fall. We are experiencing a bubble popping. This subreddit had only a few dozen active people in early 2020, then suddenly it was flooded with people from WSB, r/investing, r/cryptocurrency and god knows where else. SPAC valuations became insanely frothy ($18 for pre-target BTWN? Really?) and every half-ass high finance operator joined the gold rush, driving up valuations and making shitty deals. The exact same thing occurred in crypto in 2018 with the ICO frenzy and subsequent crash. The dead giveaway of a impending bubble pop is when celebrities get involved. Shaq and Kaepernick were peddling SPAQs, just like Katy Perry was instagramming her \u201ccrypto nails\u201d in 2018 and like five members of the Wu Tang started their own cryptocurrency. \n\nThe good news? Crypto recovered and so will SPACs. Just don\u2019t ask me when.",

        "body": "Excellent points!  We can also use other industries to see how they transitioned and new players were brought in:\n\n* Western Union charges a whole lot of money to remit currencies to a different location.  It's not just the fee's, but the FOREX spread which they capture.  They are obviously high cost, but the value is also high because of the ease in which to pick up payments in thousands of locations.\n\n* Banks and PayPal are middle of the road here.  They'll have a FOREX spread which benefits them and also charge a fee.  \n\n* Wise (or whatever they are now) are the best in terms of fixed fees and very close to real-time XE exchange rates when doing global money transfers.  \n\nAny of those companies (and banking institutions) can do what COIN does right now, and the fee structure will be identical to what is happening at real-time.   So COIN will need to include other services, such as portfolio or investment options.  \n\nRetail users will go with what they know, and what is easiest.  COIN is very new and doesn't have the known branding.  Then users will want to know how much they could have made / saved and as such, shop their options.\n\nLooking at Robinhood (RH) as an example.  People got in, but a whole lot of them transferred out to Fidelity, E*Trade and others with no consequences.  It's simply that easy in this day and age for stocks for a 3-5 day transfer to occur and all equities winding up with the new firm.",
