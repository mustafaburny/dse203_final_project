Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term. I think that\u2019s a pretty massive difference.",

You will see that over time the trend line is strongly upwards and short-term wobbles don't have a huge impact. If you're investing for decades away, you can afford to be patient.\n\nNow, if your timeline is shorter than that, then you're right to be cautious.

It is well past time to clean up our tax code and put in a more efficient and fair system of taxation from the have-nots to the have-alots.\n\nI want to see a fairer system in place so that more of the wealth created under our system is put to use for the benefit of everyone in our system. \n\nEurope has issues as well but has a much stronger social safety net and is still a reasonably successful economy, etc.\n\nThe govt. does a lot of good things with the money that is collected through taxes and could do more good if everyone paid a similar % of their earnings, whether capital or earned.\n\nThe govt. also spends on items that different groups of us are opposed to but that is the give and take that we all must work with.\n\nFor every \"good\" ultra-wealthy there are multiple examples of \"bad\" ultra-wealthy.

Sure for $6 billion you could ensure every starving person on Earth gets a sandwich and maybe a can of Coke but what about after? Also the U.S government spends like $6 billion an hour so go ask them to solve world hunger. Idiots fail to understand the actual grunt work it would take to solve world hunger. Gathering enough food is actually one of the easier parts. You need infrastructure and a stable government to aid in distribution. Most of the countries with a starving population live in places run by war lords who would just hoard any food rich countries gift them. But yeah a few billionaires like Elon making money are why people in bum fuck Africa are starving.",
