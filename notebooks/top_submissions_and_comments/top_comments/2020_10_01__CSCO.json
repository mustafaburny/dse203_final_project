I'm giving no advice here, but apple still has a little room to run, tesla has been pushed but i'm sure even tho a dip is coming you could probably see a big return in the long run. facebook will probably have the opportunities to scale up more then most from where they currently are i believe they have the highest potential. theirs other big ones but whatever i guess just buy nuggies and be an autist or whatever no ones going to buy and hold 30 years here.",

        "body": "I was 13 years old back in the mid-90\u2019s when I first got into stocks. My dad loved the stock market and taught me about it. I had been working a lot of odd jobs mowing lawns, pet sitting for neighbors etc and I usually made close to a thousand bucks every summer. Over the next 3-5 years I slowly got Merck, Compaq, AOL, Microsoft and Cisco (with my dad\u2019s help). Commissions were expensive back then so every stock trade had to be carefully thought out. \n\nBy the early 2000\u2019s I setup an account for online stock trading (which was brand new back then). I had a part time job working in a kitchen and I was earning regular, but small, paychecks. I put as much as I comfortably could into stocks I liked. It really wasn\u2019t a lot of money but every bit helped. Commissions were cheaper online but still cost $10 to buy and another $10 to sell and fractional shares were not available to me so I had to make every stock trade count. It was challenging. \n\nThere was no Reddit stocks forum like this, YouTube wasn\u2019t out yet, and cell phones (if you even had one) didn\u2019t really have apps especially not stock apps... so information on trending stocks was a little more difficult for me to find. I did read cbs market watch (now called marketwatch.com) and yahoo finance but to a teenager I often didn\u2019t know what to make of news stories I found there. The world was changing so fast 9-11 bombing, war in Iraq, internet, cell phones, laptops became a thing, email replaced sending letters, newspapers got replaced by online news. \n\nEverything\u2019s easier now. Trying to predict the stock market back then felt a lot harder than now and with a lot less information available back then too. These days you can look up stocks online, get charts, find which ETFs hold it and get news articles about it then go buy a fractional share of it without paying a commission -all instantly online! Back in my day...lol... I had to call my stock broker and ask him to mail me information about a stock, wait 3 days to get it in the mail then I had to call him back up and pay $35 or $50 commission just to have the stockbroker initiate the stock purchase then I would get the paperwork in the mail to see what I bought it at. It\u2019s almost dangerous how easy everything is now. I worry that young people now can get swept up in whatever is trending and make rash decisions without even knowing what they are even doing.",

I like your picks, I started with few of them: MSFT, AAPL, NKE + many others like Google, Visa, Mastercard, Johnson&amp;Johnson, Activision Blizzard, Sony, and United Health.\n\nAfter 2 years I have pretty diversified by sectors (mostly Tech tho) portfolio of 23 stocks (75%) +  ETF VUSA (25%). Learned a lot of about stock market through this period of time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I'm still undecided on Intel, Broadcom, Brookfield Renewables, Bank of America, Next Era Energy, Duke, Southern, Welltower, Toronto Dominion and Caterpillar. \n\nI really like INTC (bought after the dip) currently my biggest position, also similar stock is Cisco (also good % of my portfolio) if you like some kind of undervalued stock. \n\nBroadcom might be good buy too. \n\nBrookfield Renewables - I have no idea, but I hold Renewable Energy Group (REGI) stock as my pick for that sector. \n\nBank of America - I like it, even tho I have bought JPMorgan instead but I believe they are pretty similar fundamentally +similar price graphic. \n\nNext Era Energy - was considered to buy, but price was always too high for me lol\n\nDuke, Southern, Welltower, Toronto Dominion - Have no idea.\n\nCaterpillar - was considered to buy year ago, but not anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;my strategy about 20% tech 20% real estate 15% consumer 10% Finance 10% healthcare 5% telecom, 10% utilities and 10% Industrials. \n\nThat's pretty solid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I also plan on buying some Polish dividend stocks since its my original currency :D \n\nLet me guess,  CDR is one of them? )) \n\n\\--------\n\nOne of the things I changed in my strategy after 2 years are dividend stocks. I used to super like them but after few researches/reads and comparing historical returns of VYM (dividend stocks index) vs S&amp;P500 returns I see lower profitability for the price of constant income (dividends) which I will reinvest back to the market.

The vol skew isn't that big of a deal compared to the price spread in my opinion, but just the fact that puts tend to be a little more sensitive to IV than calls makes me shy away from them. IV usually increases when prices are going down, not up. So with call credit spreads even if IV does increase (bad for me) delta is decreasing (good for me). Don't forget: it's not even about the option prices themselves, it's about the difference in premium between them. The closer they get to ATM, the bigger difference in premium between the strikes because the chance that it could go either way increases. So, the fact that they're puts isn't terribly important, it's just one little thing among many that makes me lean toward call spreads.\n2. Yes, I prefer to trade call credit spreads with this strategy. Getting burned so hard with QQQ just soured me on doing this with bull put spreads. The probability of profit is similar, but just seeing QQQ blow through my strikes was demoralizing. With index funds like these, you're just more likely to see a large gap down than a large gap up, and even when there is a gap up overnight there's usually a pullback mid-morning where I can get out before it surges higher. *I can bank on mean reversion much more readily than I can bank on there NOT being a correction.*\n3. I don't tend to alternate indexes too much lately because after reading into it, day trades only count for \"*open-close*\" trades \"of the same or a substantially similar security\" in the same day. Until I dug into it, I wasn't sure if \"*close-open*\" trades counted as day trades. They don't, so that allows me to roll more easily. I don't use more than 2 or 3 day trades in a week, but it just makes me a little nervous to potentially be trapped in a strategy because I don't want to get flagged. I only tend to use them when scaling in/out of a position. For example, when the trade I have on reaches \\~50% profit, I'll usually buy back 2 or 3 spreads and roll them out to the next expiration. I've done that in the morning a couple of times and then there happens to be a big price decline later in the day and I've already gotten to my 50% target. If I want to manage my risk and really follow the strategy, I should close my positions, so I do it and take the day trade. I'd do the same thing if it went against me. It's more about having the option (pun intended) to use them if I need them.\n4. I haven't tried it on anything leveraged or inverse and probably won't--at least right now. The volatility scares me too much because when it goes against you, it goes *HARD* (e.g. SQQQ increased almost 10% on Friday if you include after hours). QQQ burned me too bad. If I were going to do it on with a leveraged underlying I'd probably do it on a leveraged DJIA product since the Dow tends to be the least volatile of the major indexes. Just be cognizant of the fact that options are leverage, so you're using leverage on a leveraged underlying during one of the most volatile times in recent market history.\n5. As far as risk/reward goes, just do what you're comfortable with while also remembering that--for the most part, the lower your max profit the higher probability that you're going to realize said profit. I usually shoot for \\~$15 max profit with 3-5 DTE and close them between $5 and $10 which allows me to roll them every day or two. But like I said I focus on resistance points so if the next area of significant resistance puts my max profit at $10, I'd rather be a little conservative and take that higher probability than be on the wrong side of a breakout. I'll probably be willing to risk more once I have a larger account, but right now a $500 loss would be a decent sized hit.\n6. You didn't ask about this, but from my experience it's also good try to use predictable-ish intraday price movements and mean reversion to your advantage. That usually means opening/closing positions in the morning or the afternoon when volatility is the highest. So again, if SPY gaps up overnight and opens like 2% higher, the tendency is that it will fall and \"fill in\" most of those skipped prices in the next couple of hours, even if it keeps going higher for the rest of the day. This also tends to happen when it gaps down, but is more predictable for a gap up. Those movements are your chances scale in/out to increase your max profit.\n\nSorry again for the novel, but I hope I answered your questions.",
