This ETF is 23.9% Apple and 20.3% Microsoft. This means, you'd be investing nearly equal amounts into both of those stocks and that would be almost half of this ETF. This would also help you diversify your holdings a little bit.\n\nThe next holdings in the ETFs portfolio include:\n\n**V**  (VISA) - 4.29%\n\n**NVDA** (NVIDIA) - 4.25%\n\n**MA** (Mastercard) - 3.80%\n\n**ADBE** (Adobe) - 2.99%\n\n**PYPL** (Paypal) - 2.94%\n\n**CRM** (Salesforce) - 2.80%\n\n**INTC** (Intel) - 2.80%\n\n**CSCO** (Cisco Systems) - 2.12%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps.",

At that job I started my 4 year degree in compsci and started pursuing certifications. In 2 years years I finished my A+ and network+, which allowed me to get a new job as a server administrator for a credit union. A year into that job I got microsoft certified, and a year after that I got my security+ certification with a promotion to systems engineer. I learned everything I could at that credit union; I made their consultants obsolete by learning cisco networking and VMware administration. The following year I finished my bachelor's in computer science, and then asked the same consultants I made obsolete at the credit union for a job. That was 6 months ago, right as all this covid stuff hit.\n\nThe only reason they lost my credit union as a client was because they took the time to show me around VMware and cisco administration. They taught me just enough for me to put together a vsphere cluster in my home lab with cisco switching and routing. That was all I needed to gain the confidence necessary to stop calling them. I decided that I wanted to work with them around the time I no longer needed their help! \n\nI knew it was risky going from a secure job as a Systems engineer at a credit union to an IT consultant for a small firm, but it was totally worth it. I wake up when I want to and work when I want to. I need to bill 15 hours a week to pay for myself and make the firm some extra money. Anything extra just makes me look good! Now I'm VMware certified and working on Citrix and Cisco certifications. I love all of my colleagues and the constant learning opportunities. I wouldn't trade my current job for anything.\n\nTldr: Never stop learning. Aim for a new certification every year, and make sure to network!",

But there were plenty of \"solid\" underlyings that shit the bed in 00/01, and didn't get anywhere near back to their highs for 10, 15, even 20 years (e.g., MSFT, PFE, GE, F, ORCL, CSCO, etc.).  Many still haven't recouped their 00 highs.\n\n20 years takes a bit more than a \"modicum\" of patience, and it takes a shitton of dividends to make up for a 50-75% price decline.\n\nDepending on timing, you pretty much can lose.",
