Their market cap is less than this years revenue, and their last quarter was profitable. Share price of 6 something when it should be at least double. It\u2019s uplisting to the TSE is set for February 17th and I would recommend hopping onboard this choo choo train before it hits double digits. Institutional ownership sits at a mere 3.8%. Insiders have bought ~950K shares in the past 12 months and own ~12.3%. They haven\u2019t sold a single share and the biggest holder is the CEO at 8.13%. The company has made something like 17 acquisitions in North America since October 2017 and have plans to expand into Europe in the future. If you need any more convincing, go look at the list of their platinum sponsors for next weeks #ConvergeConnect21 conference.. You might recognize some of the companies: IBM, Redhat, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Dell, VMware, AWS, PureStorage, Cisco, and Snowflake. Lenovo and PaloAlto are two of the gold sponsors. Hewlett-Packard and Intel are two of the silver sponsors. This is a Constellation Software-like company in the making- MASSIVE. Their latest bought financing closed today fully subscribed for a mere 80+ million dollars. Guess what they plan to do with it that money- M&amp;A. Did I forget to mention that they are very likely to break a billion in revenue this year? Oh yeah and they\u2019re still on the venture exchange! \n\nTLDR: CTS.V - strong buy before Q4 earnings (don\u2019t know when they are), or at least before uplisting to TSE in mid Feb. Thank you.",

I am thinking of diversifying my investments in two major areas: Buying physical gold (30-50%) and buying stocks and ETFs (50-70%). \n\nBuying physical gold might sound very conservative but given the gold price development and the huge uncertainty that is surrounding us these days I believe this is not a bad idea (and there is no tax on buying or selling gold). \n\nI am considering the following stocks:\nPayPal: With its recent development and the new crypto payment feature I am quite sure that it will be a safe bet. My goal would be to hold.  \nCorsair: A great and stable hardware provider now trying to get into the Esports business (which I think will be huge in the future). My goal would be to hold and monitor. \nTaiwan Semiconductor: The biggest producer of semiconductors. In my opinion a safe bet. My goal would be to hold. \nDocuSign: Many companies now getting into eSignature (accelerated big time through the pandemic). 2021 will be a big year for DocuSign. My goal would be to monitor throughout the year and decide based on what happens. \nHewlett Packard Enterprise: Not 100% convinced about this one. I see it as a rather risky penny stock option with good potential (they are into 5G and IoT so I believe they have potential). \nClearway Energy Inc: Second risky penny stock options. Their are planning to expand to China so the potential is quite big. \nCoinBase: I am buying into CoinBase as soon as their IPO happens sometime this year. In my opinion a no brainer. \n\nMy strategy for stocks might seem a bit weird as it is pure tech related. But I am expert in the tech space with 15+ years of professional experience. So this area is my playground and I have very good insights and understanding of the sector. I don\u2018t want to buy stocks from other industries I have no clue about. \n\nFor ETFs I am thinking about these:\nI fell in love with the ARK stuff and the more I research the more I like them. So I am thinking of ARKG (Genomic revolution) and ARKK (Innovation) or ARK IZRL (Israel Innovative Technology). I believe that Israeli companies will have additional potential in 2021 as they will be the first one to come out of the pandemic (also their startup scene is incredibly strong). \n\nDo you think it is smart to buy physical gold?\nDo you think it is a bad idea if all 2 or 3 of my ETFs would be ARK*?!\nDo you think this is a good overall portfolio strategy and how would you rate it?\n\nSorry for the wall of text and all the questions. If you have made it until hear I would really love to hear your thoughts, any feedback or criticism is highly appreciated :)",
