        "body": "I paint you a highly probable bear scenario.\n\nTesla cant meet production demand because of microchip shortages. Tesla is the most chip dependant car company out there. They will get hit by a shortage in chips to produce their cars. The prices of chips will also shoot up so high, Tesla will have no choice but to sell their cars at even lesser margins.\n\nThe green credits which Tesla depends highly on to boost their profit numbers become less attractive in 2022 and it drops significantly. A big revenue stream for Tesla is about to go out of business.\n\nAutonomous driving experiences set back, Tesla cant deliver a workable solution and regulations ban the use of fully auto vehicles due to safety concerns.\n\nThe already crowded Tesla network is both costly to maintain and cant expand quick enough. Other players using standard charging ports catch up and overtake Tesla here. Especially in Europe and China. Since Tesla cars can only charge on Tesla ports, suddenly, Tesla cars are less attractive to own.",

Other large supplies of ours are not even American such as Yageo and TE Connectivity aren't even headquartered in the US and manufacturer the bulk of their product in their home country. It's been a big issue for my portion of the defense industry the past couple of years because these factories in China are also sourcing a large portion of counterfeit electronic components on the market.\n\nI know we're not the only defense manufacturer using Chinese components because I've seen several news articles and reports from the DOD claiming this is a problem.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/10/us-military-reliance-china-foreign-suppliers-expos/\n\nPanasonic and Murata (Japanese) used to produce critical components of our products, but have since stopped selling to us because they don't want their products used in munitions.
