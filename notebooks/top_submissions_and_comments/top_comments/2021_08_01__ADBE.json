Cost of sale is what causes them to not be profitable.  The thing is the cost to retain those customer is very small so 2 to 3 years after they are acquired they are extremely profitable.  Once they hit critical mass those software companies make massive profits.\n\nGo look at Adobe from 2010 to now.  They switched from a boxed software model with Creative Suite to Creative Cloud which is a subscription model and acquired Omniture, Day, Market, Magento etc to build their Marketing cloud.

There are plenty of examples of widely used software that are not open sourced and easily outcompete the open source counterparts. Windows and Mac in Desktop/Laptop space. Office by Microsoft. Database products by AWS/Oracle. Content creation software by Adobe. Many more.\n\n\\&gt; it's Apple vs. the world.\n\nAnd Apple has won in *every single* field they have entered. Self-driving and VR are upcoming techs, but just because its Apple vs world doesn't mean Apple will be at a huge disadvantage. Indeed, it is the world that is at disadvantage when Apple enters a field.\n\n\\&gt; Apple also charges a fee to develop apps. It's free on Android.\n\nDespite iOS being less than 20% of market, more than 50% of revenue developers make are on iOS. Not sure what fee are you talking about, but the fact that iOS is still a priority for developers despite them having to pay a fee actually puts Android in bad light.\n\n\\&gt; iOS it is a massive pain\n\n99% of people on this planet just download from App Store directly, whether it is iOS or Android.\n\n\\&gt; The reality is they're losing margin on their phones\n\niPhones are the most profitable item at Apple, accounting for majority of their profits. If you think that they are committing a financial fraud by reporting $20B+ profits from iPhone sales instead of a loss, then I don't know what to say. This would be the biggest scam in the history of mankind.\n\n\\&gt; Also we are at peak phones now - I only see downward pressure on margins due to the competition\n\nActually, if you think that smartphone sales are at peak (which is incorrect), then Apple is even more likely to maintain sales (generally, people who buy cheap &lt;$400 Android are less likely to buy a phone when new one comes out when old one works just fine).\n\n\\&gt; I always felt their original PE ratio\n\nPE ratio is high for companies who have high growth potential. Microsoft has been doing not bad in cloud segment and cloud segment market is not even at 5% potential. Now obviously, *you* don't think Apple and Microsoft will grow in future, but others do; so naturally, you would say their PE ratio is high.\n\n\\&gt; This was true years ago. Not true anymore.\n\nBased on sales of phones with cost &gt;= $700, Apple dominates and they do that with iPhone 12 more than they did with any other iPhone apart from iPhone 6.",

History is full of no/low moat companies getting undercut. \n\nMuch of today\u2019s innovation is centered around removing the middle man as a function of cost reduction. I am making an assumption that the trend would continue because I see no purpose in reintroducing costs back in to the system. Amazon, Tesla, Netflix, Disney, Adobe, Opendoor, etc are all brands currently focused on removing the middleman and are quite successful as a result. You can dive even further to brands like Warby Parker and Harry\u2019s, that have very quickly carved out market share in long established markets that typically have a high entry barrier all through cost reduction. \n\nMy opinion continues to go back to no moat. Uber has nothing valuable to keep someone from doing it better, easier, and for less. I used Tesla as an example because it already has everything in place it would need except inventory. Google/waymo would have a similar advantage over Uber although they seem less inclined to do something like that. \n\nSo to simplify Tesla can easily do what Uber would do, but Uber can not easily do what Tesla does. Who is better poised for success in the self driving taxi sector? Same goes for Google and the rest. Lyft and Uber have nothing in place to stop the competition.",

        "body": "Moat is a broad term, and can be different things for different industries and companies. But generally, it\u2019s a structural competitive advantage.\n\nThe most used example is probably Coca-Cola. Their moat is their brand, which they spent 100 years building. Coke is virtually synonymous with Coca-Cola in many parts of the world. I live in Sweden, and when you order a coke at a restaurant here you\u2019ll sometimes get the reply \u201dwe have Pepsi, is that all right?\u201d\n\nMicrosoft and Adobe are two other good examples of companies with wide moats imo. Their moats aren\u2019t their brands but rather that they\u2019ve been industry standards for decades. There are equally good products (or near enough) available that are cheaper, but everybody still uses Word, Excel, Outlook, Photoshop, InDesign and so on because that\u2019s what their employees have all spent 15 years learning. Companies might be able to save money in the long term by going with a cheaper option, but that would require them to first pay to educate their employees in the new software, it could cause problems in the workplace before everyone grows accustomed to the new software, and so on.\n\nFacebook is another good example of a company with a good moat. Their moat is their platform and it\u2019s network effects, i.e. the more people that join their platforms, the better the platform becomes for everybody else and the more valuable it becomes for them. Imagine that you discover a social network that is twice as good as Facebook in every regard and joined it as the first among your friends. Now you\u2019ll try to get a friend to join it. You demonstrate its features, and the friend agrees that it\u2019s better than Facebook. But you are his only friend on the platform, whereas he has 199 friends on Facebook already. Odds are, he\u2019ll remain with Facebook even though he thinks the other network is better.\n\nOf course competitors try to cross these moats, but that\u2019s the thing about moats; they\u2019re difficult to cross! In the case of Coca-Cola, they have such a strong brand that basically no amount of marketing spending from Pepsi and others can threaten it. The only ones that could conceivably threaten Coca-Cola are Coca-Cola. In the case of Microsoft, the fact that they are dominant keeps them dominant. If only the didn\u2019t dominate the market, competitors could conceivably challenge them for market leadership with their equally good products. But alas, everybody is used to Microsoft so they don\u2019t want to learn new software even if it saves them a few bucks. And in the case of Facebook, in order to threaten it you first have to become as large as Facebook, and thus far Facebook have strategically acquired competitors with the capability to do that well before that point.",

They have other parts of the business that\u2019s doing very good.

A famous tech entrepreneur once said that \u201ctech is not about getting your gadgets to work, it\u2019s about having them at the right time.\u201d They were doomed from the start.  The director of operations for that project is now the CEO for the company with the light engine in Microsoft\u2019s Hololens 2.\n\nTim Cook has repeatedly said in keynote speeches that AR is the future and has been working on an AR headset for years, leaked to launch 2022 last year but could of course be delayed.  They are knocking down patents left and right on it though.  He has played his role perfectly, milking the smartphone to build the greatest warchest in history just in time to capture emerging technology as the market is ready for it.  AirPods make more revenue a year than nvidia and Adobe and most tech companies.  He knows what he is doing and is looking at the future.  They are a $2T company and have no trouble developing multiple verticals at once, especially when one of those verticals will replace or supplement their cash cow within 10 years.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re highly tuned into Microsoft\u2019s AR setup or commitment if you are comparing it to a watch.  It is without a doubt the most sophisticated and compelling AR device that exists in the world and comparing it to a watch from 2015 is low-brow.  Remember that the army is paying them $22B to outfit the military with AR and develop software for them.  Those headsets are already being deployed in combat zones.\n\nI\u2019ve got a little over a million invested in the augmented reality space if you count my big tech investments and am very up to date with all of the inner workings.  You can disagree if you like but I\u2019m telling you how it is in the current environment and who the serious players are.  You should research patent grants and who is aiming at what with what velocity.  I have money in Facebook too, but they are not even the only company dedicated to the concept of the metaverse, and Microsoft is doing the exact same thing with a head start.  They will likely coexist with different purposes.  As a last thought, you dog on Google and Microsoft for some wearables they\u2019ve released in the past.

        "body": "Yes, the low interest rates are supporting the stock market.\n\nNext, you need to learn that P/E ratios are great in theory but crappy in practice. P/E really tells you about the quality of earnings, not the value of the company. A company, like Tesla, with a high P/E means that the market values their FUTURE earning potential higher than say... GM or Ford. Using this logic, Adobe, with a P/E of 55, is more likely to have solid future earnings than a company like Microsoft with a 35 P/E. Or so the market thinks.\n\nIf you want to find value, look at Price to Book (P/B) or Book to Market (B/M; the inverse of P/B). Also, investigate CROIC or CROCI to see which companies are returning cash on their cash invested. That will help you find value.\n\nPeople use P/E like they use sticker prices on car. $100,000 for a car? Too expensive. I'm looking for a $30,000 model. That's stupid. What you want is the $100,000 car for $30,000! P/B will get you that. P/E won't.\n\nOnly retail investors use P/E. It's an easy way to talk about a stock but provides very little guidance in real life. Once you drop P/E, you'll see that there are a lot of undervalued but good companies out there. What this means, though, is that if you use P/E, you can end up with a lot of stocks in a particular sector... where P/E's tend to be low anyway. So you have increased your sector risk by having all stocks in the same sector, but the P/E's won't increase to the levels normal in other sectors. You aren't buying cheap, you are buying average that looks cheap when compared to other sectors (even though you didn't consciously realize that's what you did).\n\nI look at CROIC, Altman Z, Sortino, P/B, volume, expected return, and a few other things. Build a system you like that works. Then compare that system to the market to see how you are doing. If you make 10% but the market makes 15%, you would have been ahead to buy an S&amp;P Index fund. When you buy in a sector, compare your returns to the sector average too. If the sector earned 15%, but you made 10% on your pick, you chose a below-average stock and would have been ahead buying a sector index fund.\n\nComparing your returns to benchmarks lets you know how you are doing (once you start making money on a regular basis).",

Xilinx fell 3.7%, while AMD rose 5.9%. Several other technology deals that also need Chinese antitrust approval also saw their spreads widen today.\n\nOne reason for Xilinx's (XLNX) move down may be that risk arb investors can't handle the potential downside for Xilinx (XLNX) if a deal with AMD (AMD) were to fall apart as AMD's shares continue to rocket higher, according to CNBC's David Faber. CNBC's Jim Cramer also said he believed that AMD (AMD) has become a meme stock at this point. AMD shares have jumped almost 25% in the past two weeks.\n\nIn addition a Dealreporter column from last night may be contributing to weakness in the spreads. The opinion piece points out that China's leaders appear to have changed their tone about the importance of technology in late May and may have put the country on a \"technology war footing.\" The U.S. and South Korean's announcement to fund multi-billion dollar semiconductor factories may also have contributed to China's potential slowdown on approving the U.S. deals.\n\nAs far as Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) planned purchase of Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM), the Dealreporter column says the timing is uncertain. Last month traders circulated a report that the timing for Chinese approval had moved out as some customer have issues with export controls, though the deal was still likely to be approved.\n\nRisk arb investors may also be \"de-risking\" due to heightened antitrust risk after Aon (NYSE:AON) and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) abandoned their $30B deal last week after the U.S. sued to block the deal and after a report from The Information last night that the U.S. DOJ is considering filing a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth's planned $8B purchase of Changed Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG).\n\nLast month MLex reported that the AMD's (AMD) purchase of Xilinx (XLNX) is expect to see a Phase Two review by Chinese antitrust regulators. China's State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR is believed to have reached out to industry participants a few months ago to find out their views on market definitions and market shares.\n\nOther deal spreads that are wider today include Maxim (MXIM)/Analog Devices (ADI) and Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR)/II-VI(NASDAQ:IIVI).\n\nAlso last week it was reported that China's review of Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) planned purchase of Arm Holdings (ARMHF) was said to be delayed. China's antitrust regulatory hasn't started its formal review of the deal for Softbank to sell Arm to Nvidia, according to a report from The Information.",

But when it goes below 35, it's great for swing trade. \n\nIt's risky buying puts on it with the momentum of AMD and all the semiconductors beating earnings left and right currently, ie klac, lrcx, swks, qcom, amd, asml, txn, mchp, and upcoming amat, adi, qrvo.  Since it swings up 3x, it will render your puts worthless extremely fast.  \n\nOn 3x etfs, you have to be watching the minute chart because it can swing in both directions extremely violently.  It's not really a buy a put / call and forget it kind of ticker.",
