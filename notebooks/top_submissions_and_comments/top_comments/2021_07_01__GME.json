I opened a position in December after watching roaring kitty vids and seeing the DD posts in wsb, held the stock through January when it was illegally halted, then significantly increased my position in February at $40-70. My cost average is low, I'm up significantly and over the past 4 months and there has been significant price consolidation around the $150-200 price point. I would go into more about the business transition into an e-commerce giant, but there's just too many points to list and I can't be bothered on a Sunday night. The subs on this stock are kinda chaotic now with drama, so I don't blame anyone for not wanting to touch it. But I believe its a deep value play based on Ryan Cohens track record with chewy and the A-list team he's assembled.",

        "body": "Going to be some downvotes on this one, but... I'm holding GME while flat broke, so... fuck it.\n\nSo, I'd like to make a few points here...\n\n1. In many areas, 3% each side (6% total) is not the norm. Many areas it's more like 2% or 2.5% each side.\n2. If you think all Real estate agents do is 'take some pictures and put that shit up on the internet' you are vastly mistaken. Here's just a few other things that Agents are responsible for:\n   1. Providing E&amp;O insurance if anything goes wrong with your transaction.\n   2. Handling all documentation &amp; communication between parties, along with negotiations on your behalf.\n   3. Showing the home to potential buyers and/or promoting the home in multiple ways, including open houses (depending on the area, of course).\n   4. Providing a professional layer of protection aside from what I've already noted, so that they are there to actually facilitate the sale/purchase being done legally and responsibly, with as much information needed on both sides as possible.\n3. Zillow is Garbage. Seriously. There are literally dozens of other companies doing the discount Listings services in every state, and most of them are locally/regionally owned, so they are better places to put your money anyway.\n\nNow, all that said, are all agents great, upstanding people? No, haha... I'd say over half are garbage, possibly as much as three quarters - but this is where most people fuck up - they don't treat realtors as a product, and they should. You should meet with a few realtors before choosing one, and you should be candid with your expectations for them. If they can't meet those expectations, then either A) adjust if they have a reasonable reason why not, or B) find someone who can.\n\nWhat most people, including clearly the OP, truly don't understand though is that Real Estate is this shiny, twinkling thing that people are told will make them rich - Be an agent, sell homes, make tons of money!\n\nOnly about 10% of all Real Estate agents in the U.S. make over $100k/year. About another 10% make over $60k/year... the other 80% typically don't last more than 2 years before they go get a 'real' job. Real estate is cut throat in a lot of markets, and there are firmly entrenched 'old guard' types in most major markets that can make it really difficult for upcoming, GOOD people to get started - just another reason it's good when people shop around. Often a new agent, fresh from their Ethics and Law classes (yes, they actually have to take those), is waaaaay more likely to go above and beyond, and EARN that 2, 2.5, 3% than some King Cobra that's been doing it for 30 years.\n\nLook, I get it. It's sales. Salespeople generally suck... but unlike almost every other form of sales, Real Estate agents actually do serve an additional purpose other than just 'listing the home' or 'showing you a home'. Talk to any of the hundreds of people EVERY YEAR who end up in court because of title issues, deed issues, illegal contracts, falsified documentation, and so on because they figured they could just do it on their own.\n\nI do agree that in a lot of cases, the % model isn't the way to go, but that's where negotiation comes in... think of it like this:\n\n* If you're selling a home for $300,000, and your agent wants 2.5%, and assume 2.5% for the other side. That's $15,000 total, $7,500 per agent... but the brokerage is going to take between 10 and 30% of that depending on their contract, average 20%, so immediately that's now $6,000. That agent is going to, on average (you can easily look this up), spend roughly 20 hours working on each client. Assuming they are in the under 100k tax bracket, that means they are really taking home about $5,000, or about $250 per hour. Sounds like a ton of money right? Except they may only have one house closing every two months, or every 3 months, especially given the sheer number of agents out there right now... so all the sudden they are looking at that hourly rate not really mattering, since annually they are making the equivalent of working at starbucks full time.\n* If you're selling a home for $1m, and your agent wants 2.5%, tell them no. It's really not that difficult. You tell them that $50,000 for a combined total of 20-40 hours work between two people is not reasonable, and negotiate either a smaller percentage, or better yet, a flat rate. Tell an agent they will get a flat $10,000 guaranteed, and they are a lot more likely to accept than if you call it 1% (because that sounds shitty - most of these people are not that bright). Especially if this is a newer agent, that's the kind of money that can save their career.\n* These agents, depending on their brokerage, also have to pay for all their own marketing items, desk fees, real estate licensing costs, educational costs, etc. etc... this stuff adds up, and in a lot of cases can be Thousands of dollars per year on their own.\n\nAnyway, sorry to ramble on, but I see this hate for Agents a lot, and much of it is warranted (stereotypes exist for a reason), but I do think it's important to remember that most Agents are just people trying to scrape by. /shrug",
