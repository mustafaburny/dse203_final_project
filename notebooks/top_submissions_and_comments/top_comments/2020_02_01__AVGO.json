Holding off on making any big trades on those until I can put aside enough capital to actively trade stocks without leverage and still make decent wads of cash. \n\nI've got a general idea of what I'm looking to do but I don't set my entry/exit targets 'til I've watched the indices for the first 15-30 mins after open. This is why I like the FTSE &amp; DAX etc. they got a bit of bounce to them! Speaking of which I gotta watch those opens. All the best!",

There are tech companies that I want to own though. Avgo is one, IBM is another and in Canada I want to own versabank. It's a branchless bank. \n\nIBM ran away from me. Avgo, I don't have RRSP room and my TFSA is also full. I don't want to own it in my taxable. And versabank I'm not sure of yet. It has a very small market cap. I don't like companies that have less than 1-2 billion in market cap (preferably 2). I'm also not sure how much they can grow their business. Finally, their starting yield is small, but they've been growing their dividend at a really fast pace and their cashflow is great. Earnings have been good too.",
