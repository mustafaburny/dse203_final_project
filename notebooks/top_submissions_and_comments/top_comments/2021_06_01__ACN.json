        "body": "So your comment is exactly what needs to be called out as one of the reasons you SHOULD consider palantir as a true potential winner. Palantir doesn\u2019t specialize in sales and marketing speak, they specialize in getting dirty and getting the job done. Let\u2019s compare their proposal to another firm like Accenture\u2019s, which sounds really nice:\n\nAccenture\u2019s proposal: \n\n\u201cAccenture and Symphony AyasdiAI\u2019s concept supports the FDIC by delivering an analytics capability to predict changes in systemic and individual bank health without adding additional burden on the banks. Their approach uses automatic pattern detection, machine learning, new sources of data, and advanced analytical methods to enrich FDIC\u2019s current data and capabilities\u201d\n\nNow that sounds like some great beautiful marketing speak with really nice buzzwords that make me feel all fuzzy. Funny thing is, Accenture was already discontinued because the FDIC doesn\u2019t care about marketing speak, they care about the demonstrated tech doing the job they want it to.\n\nPalantir proposal:\n\n\u201cPalantir Technologies\u2019 concept supports the FDIC by offering Palantir Foundry (\u201cFoundry\u201d)\u2014a commercial Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that can be configured as a shared data ecosystem by means of extensible data, logic, and application capabilities housed within a single secure platform. With Foundry, the FDIC can establish a banking industry ecosystem that can accommodate the data reporting and sharing needs of the FDIC and its constituent banks while adapting to the changing realities of the organization, industry, and economy.\u201d\n\nThis definitely sounds dry, but here\u2019s the good news, this is exactly how the fdic speaks and what they are looking for. Something to get the job done, not to be all frills and show. I mean read their description of the contest, they even write like palantir:\n\n\u201caccelerate the adoption of modern technological tools to help financial institutions, particularly community banks, provide more timely and granular data to the FDIC\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t Hollywood. This is banking. My money is on the software that works the best.",
