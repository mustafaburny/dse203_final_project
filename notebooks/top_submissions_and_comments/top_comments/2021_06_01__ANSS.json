We had Intel, Intel, Dell, and Microsoft providing computers.  We had AOL providing network access and internet content for $25 a month.  One thing we didn't have was a large stock quite as overpriced as Tesla.  Tesla is a $50-$100 company trading at $600.  Cisco only had a PE of 110, not 600 like Tesla.  Companies were laying fiber in the ground like there was no tomorrow (which was sort of true). We had [pets.com](https://pets.com) instead of Chewy.  We had webvan instead of Instacart.   Ariba did b2b.    \n\n\nThe only thing that was different is rates haven't started going up yet.

It drops by 75%.  Intel was an amazing company in 2000 and it still makes loads of money, yet it still hasn't hit its 2000 high.

It's actually a pretty crowded market imo. There aren't a lot of comparables in the public market but you may be able to check out Sentinel 1 when they IPO. There are rumors of Cybereason IPO as well. \n\nFireye has an EDR solution but I imagine it's a tiny part of their business. And no one really would bring up Fireeye when talking about endpoint protection. Fireeye/Mandiant is most known for their incident response and forensic products and services. They are usually on top of most people's list to call whenever there is a security breach. \n\nBoth Palo Alto and Fortinet started off as security networking companies competing with traditional firewall companies like Netscreen and Cisco. In fact, the founders of both companies are former Netscreen execs iirc. Both companies have expanded their product and service offerings over the years to support security operations solutions. You tend to see Palo Alto and Fortinet used in larger enterprises who need holistic network security solutions. Normally, if a security team is looking at a Palo Alto solutions, they are probably also comparing it Fortinet and vice-versa. \n\nGenerally speaking - cyber-security industry is very broad. You are not likely to find a single company that would cover the entire gamut of security needs for an enterprise. So if your interest is in broad industry exposure - an ETF is probably a better solution.",

The June inflation and payroll expense numbers will continue taking out the pure speculation tech stocks because people will start to realize the Fed will HAVE to raise rates and they're floating on debt.  Then the next month, small and midcap growth take the hit and the record leverage will start getting called.  When it does, the whole 8+ years of speculative gains will unravel.  This is exactly like 2000.  Last time it was the internet ... this time it's blockchain and cloud computing. Last time it was Janus and Van Wagoner and this time it's ARK.  Last time it was AOL, Cisco, and Intel .. this time it'll be Apple and Tesla and Nvidia.  . They are all good companies, but they are highly overpriced.  I'm counting on value and international stocks holding up like last time.  If I'm wrong, well they are still going up for now and I'm sleeping fine.",

As someone in the cybersecurity field and tracks that space, there is nothing to reflect. BB bought up a mediocre antivirus tool (Cylance) busted their butts to get it on the same playing field as other EDR products (endpoint detection and response, think AV software amped up and without all the false positives) but they are still bottom of the pack (review the Gartner quadrant [here](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/11/gartner-names-microsoft-a-leader-in-the-2021-endpoint-protection-platforms-magic-quadrant/)).\n\n&gt; Similar companies in the industry are priced around $40-60 mark but I think they have a lot more potential imo. \n\nEDR vendors that be competitors to Black Berry are as follows:  \n\n* CrowdStrike - $216\n* SentinelOne - Private Company\n* Microsoft Defender - $245\n* VMware Carbon Black - $159\n* Broadcom Symantec ATP - $23\n* Malwarebytes - Private Company\n* Cisco AMP - $54\n\nWhoever you are listening too on BlackBerry and \"cybersecurity\" needs to do some basic research. The Cylance product (and the functions it brings) they bought is basically dead and has zero room for growth. That is 1/3 of their entire offering. Other services and capabilities by BlackBerry aren't used by large firms any more. Companies like FireEye, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, etc have better IR and forensic services.",

You tend to see Palo Alto and Fortinet used in larger enterprises who need holistic network security solutions. Normally, if a security team is looking at a Palo Alto solutions, they are probably also comparing it Fortinet and vice-versa. \n\nGenerally speaking - cyber-security industry is very broad. You are not likely to find a single company that would cover the entire gamut of security needs for an enterprise.

The June inflation and payroll expense numbers will continue taking out the pure speculation tech stocks because people will start to realize the Fed will HAVE to raise rates and they're floating on debt.  Then the next month, small and midcap growth take the hit and the record leverage will start getting called.  When it does, the whole 8+ years of speculative gains will unravel.  This is exactly like 2000.  Last time it was the internet ... this time it's blockchain and cloud computing. Last time it was Janus and Van Wagoner and this time it's ARK.  Last time it was AOL, Cisco, and Intel .. this time it'll be Apple and Tesla and Nvidia.  . They are all good companies, but they are highly overpriced.  I'm counting on value and international stocks holding up like last time.  If I'm wrong, well they are still going up for now and I'm sleeping fine.",

As someone in the cybersecurity field and tracks that space, there is nothing to reflect. BB bought up a mediocre antivirus tool (Cylance) busted their butts to get it on the same playing field as other EDR products (endpoint detection and response, think AV software amped up and without all the false positives) but they are still bottom of the pack (review the Gartner quadrant [here](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/11/gartner-names-microsoft-a-leader-in-the-2021-endpoint-protection-platforms-magic-quadrant/)).\n\n&gt; Similar companies in the industry are priced around $40-60 mark but I think they have a lot more potential imo. \n\nEDR vendors that be competitors to Black Berry are as follows:  \n\n* CrowdStrike - $216\n* SentinelOne - Private Company\n* Microsoft Defender - $245\n* VMware Carbon Black - $159\n* Broadcom Symantec ATP - $23\n* Malwarebytes - Private Company\n* Cisco AMP - $54\n\nWhoever you are listening too on BlackBerry and \"cybersecurity\" needs to do some basic research. The Cylance product (and the functions it brings) they bought is basically dead and has zero room for growth. That is 1/3 of their entire offering. Other services and capabilities by BlackBerry aren't used by large firms any more. Companies like FireEye, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, etc have better IR and forensic services.",

Apple hasn\u2019t innovated in the last 7 years (flat revenue since 2015) and Netflix doesn\u2019t have a big moat + decelerating subscribers. \n\nMy comment was directed towards Microsoft/Amazon/Google. Yes, there can always be disruptive tech that threatens established businesses that have to be monitored for. But until then the only threat to these 3 are government regulatory pressures.\n\nEdit: I doubt Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and Dell in 2000 made up 27% of the S&amp;P 500 like FAAMG currently does",

I see a lot of comments from people believing that Apple can do no wrong and that their sales and share price will always go up with minimal comments about valuation.  I think Apple is overvalued at this point in time and believe that investing in the company right now is risky.  Share price could easily trade sideways for a few years (like Walmart from 2000 to 2010) to allow earnings to catch up with price or it could correct to the downside (like Cisco from 2000 to 2001).
