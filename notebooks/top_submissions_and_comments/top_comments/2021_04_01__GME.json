(Copied by investopedia) \n\nA forfeited share is a share in a publicly-traded company that the owner loses (or forfeits) by neglecting to live up to any number of purchase requirements. For example, a forfeiture may occur if a shareholder fails to pay an owed allotment (call money), or if he sells or transfers his shares during a restricted period.\n\nWhen a share is forfeited, the shareholder no longer owes any remaining balance and surrenders any potential capital gain on the shares, which automatically revert back to the ownership of the issuing company.\n\nSo Basically GME, the company, now has more revenue because they hold more shares and they won't be sold by the leaving CEO.

Also, from the rules for \"yolo\" posts, it fits the minimum capital requirements.\n\nThere is not a point at which I intend to close. Ever. So it would be impossible for me to do a gain/loss porn post.\n\nThese updates are sort of a continuation of the mathematical DD about the system itself.\n\nWhen I posted my thesis on how GameStop stock was either going to reflect the true value of the company - which I personally believe is much higher than what we are seeing right now, or (through a mathematical anomaly in options trading on artificially price-suppressed stocks) a retail investor could technically own the entire company in a matter of years simply starting with 1000 shares.\n\nIt got a bit more complicated than originally expected, due to the bizarre price movements, but it is worth showcasing that this is working or not working.\n\nOthers seem to be enjoying this journey; and it's not just here to show off gains or losses. I am explicitly tracking the growth in share count.\n\nWould it be better to mark these as DD moving forward?",
