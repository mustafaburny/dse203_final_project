It demonstrates quite convincingly that there was no sustained short squeeze, and that the rise in GME's prices appears to be driven primarily by buyer frenzy and not short-sellers covering.\n\nThe short squeeze scenario is a banana-pants-crazy fantasy. GME is a speculative bubble and nothing more, and whether it will go up or down is hard to say, but whatever happens will be primarily driven by how many Superstonkers there are, not whatever various hedge funds are doing.",

You've wrongly assumed they're the same company and deserve the same valuation.\n\n2013 - $4130\n\n2014 - $4681 (13% growth)\n\n2015 - $5010 (7% growth)\n\n2016 - $6910 (38% growth)\n\n2017 - $9714 (40% growth)\n\n2018 - $11716 (20% growth)\n\n2019 - $10918 (-7% growth)\n\n2020 - $16675 (53% growth)\n\n2021 - $26671 (60% growth)\n\nAs you can see they used to be a low-mid growth company with the exception of the crypto boom years which was considered a one-off benefit.\n\nHowever they've transformed into a super high growth company. \n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 13% deserve?\n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 50% deserve?\n\nTo answer that, look at how different growth rates affect a company after 5 years\n\nCompany @ 50% growth after 5 years = 7.6x revenue\n\nCompany @ 13% growth after 5 years = 1.84x revenue\n\nIf NVDA actually achieves 50% for 5 years, which I think is too high, their profits would be over 60bn which is what MSFT earns now, and they're a 2.5T company.\n\nEven at 35% growth for 5 years, they become more profitable than FB is today.\n\nInvestors seem to have trouble on assessing growth valuation. That's why the investors who just throw money at growth stocks without evaluating financials do well, because they don't shoot themselves in the leg.\n\nIf you think NVDA will grow at less than 30% avg. then you have a point. However, the consensus is closer to 40% growth.",

Sports medicine has also developed new techniques and dramatically reduced recovery time for injuries that used to leave people crippled. Analytics has been dragged forward by sports teams and companies looking for that edge.\n\nWhat about having a single supplier vs multiple suppliers of a critical part as we are learning now with semiconductors?\n\nThe competition between the amd and nvda and other semiconductors to surpass Intel right now is transforming the way that we can use computers to solve problems.\n\nCompetition is what causes humans to take the information in those research papers and bring them to the masses in an affordable fashion.\n\nLack of competition is how we end up with complacency and apathy in our end products(again see Intel and their being left behind)",

So the idea that they are dead in the water or can't compete is plain wrong. \n\nTheir GPUs aren't looking too good right now but they are coming pretty soon. They can fill a gap in the GPU market for lower cost GPUs. \n\nI have a sizeable position in Intel and I have a smaller one in AMD. I will be looking at Intel's and AMD's server CPU and discrete GPU offerings next year to determine which position I will be expanding. Both look promising but Intel looks like it will offer a lot more value long term. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC you might want to open positions with all of them. Betting that the 4 of them will do well is probably a pretty safe bet. I would also look at MU, that's another position that I like right now.

You've wrongly assumed they're the same company and deserve the same valuation.\n\n2013 - $4130\n\n2014 - $4681 (13% growth)\n\n2015 - $5010 (7% growth)\n\n2016 - $6910 (38% growth)\n\n2017 - $9714 (40% growth)\n\n2018 - $11716 (20% growth)\n\n2019 - $10918 (-7% growth)\n\n2020 - $16675 (53% growth)\n\n2021 - $26671 (60% growth)\n\nAs you can see they used to be a low-mid growth company with the exception of the crypto boom years which was considered a one-off benefit.\n\nHowever they've transformed into a super high growth company. \n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 13% deserve?\n\nWhat valuation does a company that grows at 50% deserve?\n\nTo answer that, look at how different growth rates affect a company after 5 years\n\nCompany @ 50% growth after 5 years = 7.6x revenue\n\nCompany @ 13% growth after 5 years = 1.84x revenue\n\nIf NVDA actually achieves 50% for 5 years, which I think is too high, their profits would be over 60bn which is what MSFT earns now, and they're a 2.5T company.\n\nEven at 35% growth for 5 years, they become more profitable than FB is today.\n\nInvestors seem to have trouble on assessing growth valuation. That's why the investors who just throw money at growth stocks without evaluating financials do well, because they don't shoot themselves in the leg.\n\nIf you think NVDA will grow at less than 30% avg. then you have a point. However, the consensus is closer to 40% growth.",

Yesterday before close i bought a bunch of MSFT COST NVDA and SPY calls and said i wouldn't look until EOD because \"i dont want to be the kind of person thats glued to his phone all day staring at charts\" anymore. EOD yesterday all options were roughly 6k. at noon today they were worth 17k but i didnt know that cause i didnt look. EOD theyre now less that 4500 and will most likely open less than 3k tomorrow cause i just held. The day i chose to not stare at my account is the day basically everything lines up perfectly for me to make a shit ton of money. I've never had unrealized gains like that in my life besides GME.

So the idea that they are dead in the water or can't compete is plain wrong. \n\nTheir GPUs aren't looking too good right now but they are coming pretty soon. They can fill a gap in the GPU market for lower cost GPUs. \n\nI have a sizeable position in Intel and I have a smaller one in AMD. I will be looking at Intel's and AMD's server CPU and discrete GPU offerings next year to determine which position I will be expanding. Both look promising but Intel looks like it will offer a lot more value long term. \n\nIf you're not familiar with Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC you might want to open positions with all of them. Betting that the 4 of them will do well is probably a pretty safe bet. I would also look at MU, that's another position that I like right now.

Tesla is the future with EV, they have a head start over all competitors. And nvidia is innovating for the future. \n\nI\u2019m not disagreeing with what you\u2019re saying. I just like to keep my investments simple, but yeah I think emerging markets could be a good play for sure.",

That being said they rely heavily on brand loyalty (same specs as AMD CPUs yet more expensive) but are slowly realizing after the Ryzen market share loss that that isn't enough. AMD and Nvidia are serious competition they didn't release amazing specs/prices for their latest GPU line just for fun they wanted to squish Intel to the ground",
