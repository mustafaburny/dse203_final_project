        "body": "Definitely sustainable. I\u2019ve been trading for awhile now but just recently started options. You just have to be very proactive in buying offsetting positions when a trade isn\u2019t going your way. Don\u2019t buy too close to the money and make sure you have a decent amount of capital. As I commented above, if something isn\u2019t going your way either sell immediately or if you feel it\u2019s too late buy a longer dated offsetting position to mitigate losses. It\u2019s actually insanely easy to turn a quick profit. Be cognizant of what\u2019s going on in the news and if you\u2019re selling spreads on ETFs just know what they\u2019re made of. I\u2019ll be posting weekly updates on what I\u2019m doing starting tomorrow. I\u2019m also doing some Yolos but making sure they\u2019re at least 2 weeks out and selling quick once I make 750-1500.",

When you first start out you are going to literally bust your ass until you hit the point you can hire a driver to deal with the work.\n\nLets say you have a machine that takes 20 cases of soda to fill and you have 20 machines around. Your talking about 400 cases at 20 pounds a case. 8000 pounds.\n\nYour moving 8000 pounds at the store to your cart, from your cart to the truck, from the truck to the hand truck, from the handtruck into the machine. Can your back handle 32000 pounds and bending up and down each time you refill? Obviously rough math, but you get the idea.\n\nDo you have a vehicle that can handle this?\n\nRepair is dirty cheap if you have good machines and a good mechanic. Very easy to swap boards, validators, etc.\n\nStay away from snack and food machines if you are just starting out. Hassle to be cognizant of perishables and dates, etc. Need to consider how well candy holds as well - are you in Florida and have candy/chocolate machines?\n\nYou can absolutely crush it in the right location - but keep in mind its not get rich quick. It's get rich slow and by making sure your machines are all in a relatively close proximity (at least to start).\n\nWhen we do the rough math it usually comes out that 50% of sales price is profit. So for $1 can of soda, $.50 goes towards gas, products cost, commission, operational expense etc.\n\nHow do you plan on moving the machines? Each time you move its $150-$200. Where do you store them when not using?\n\nJust food for thought :)",

When you first start out you are going to literally bust your ass until you hit the point you can hire a driver to deal with the work.\n\nLets say you have a machine that takes 20 cases of soda to fill and you have 20 machines around. Your talking about 400 cases at 20 pounds a case. 8000 pounds.\n\nYour moving 8000 pounds at the store to your cart, from your cart to the truck, from the truck to the hand truck, from the handtruck into the machine. Can your back handle 32000 pounds and bending up and down each time you refill? Obviously rough math, but you get the idea.\n\nDo you have a vehicle that can handle this?\n\nRepair is dirty cheap if you have good machines and a good mechanic. Very easy to swap boards, validators, etc.\n\nStay away from snack and food machines if you are just starting out. Hassle to be cognizant of perishables and dates, etc. Need to consider how well candy holds as well - are you in Florida and have candy/chocolate machines?\n\nYou can absolutely crush it in the right location - but keep in mind its not get rich quick. It's get rich slow and by making sure your machines are all in a relatively close proximity (at least to start).\n\nWhen we do the rough math it usually comes out that 50% of sales price is profit. So for $1 can of soda, $.50 goes towards gas, products cost, commission, operational expense etc.\n\nHow do you plan on moving the machines? Each time you move its $150-$200. Where do you store them when not using?\n\nJust food for thought :)",
