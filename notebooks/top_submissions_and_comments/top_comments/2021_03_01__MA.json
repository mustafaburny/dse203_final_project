        "body": "https://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/\n\nPennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .\n\nOtcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. \n\nUnbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.\n\nFinviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .\n\nMy stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .\n\nYou can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.\n\nTD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. \n\nI trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .\n\nThe general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. \n\nWe all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . \n\nI don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. \n\nI go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. \n\nBillions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .\n\nBefore a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.\n\nI also go to Stocktwits for the same .\n\nSomeone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. \n\nBut these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.\n\nFinally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. \n\nIf you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .\nOn NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG \n\nhttps://www.allpennystocks.com/hotpennystocks/nsd.aspx",

They will release more trash and pay streamers to play it generating a user base with a focus on US, EU, CAD microtransaction flow as these countries don't limit \"gambling\" nearly as hard as some of the rest of the world. If you can't beat em, bet on 'em a little. I also like **BABA.** Hopefully Xie Jingping doesn't kill Jack Ma. Jack Ma rules.  \n\n\n**Buying MORE WMT:** Walmart owns Flipkart that is eyeing a public offering through a SPAC. Flipkart pays WMT. Walmart is also expanding their online/B&amp;M fulfillment with highly expanded emphasis on Store to Door delivery. They are more positioned to do this well than Amazon is at the moment despite Amazon's ownership of whole foods. Whole food's prices are too high for a lot of people and Walmart fills that gap very nicely. We will start to see local grocers fold if they succeed however.  \n\n\n**Buying Fossil Fuels with Emphasis on Diesel:** We are going to see record shipping, travel, and trucking as the world opens and everyone has to rush to meet demand. Airplanes run essentially on diesel. All Aerodiesel is essentially Kerosine. It's all fuel oil.  I think the smart money is going to be on the supply side. Prices may not increase but consumption will. A container ship uses approximately 1.5-4.0 **MILLION** gallons per tank. We also have trucking that hasn't largely gone to Natural Gas or hybrid yet so MACKs gonna MACK.",

It would have taken 5-7 days (according to another DD) for the shares to be sellable. \n\nSoros promised to divest their 18.5M shares (as of Jan) on principle. Those should be hitting the market by now. \n\nThe tech selloff has also contributed to keeping PLTR depressed. Cathie, however, has been gobbling up the shares at every dip. \n\nFinally, unless you are an insider and know more than the rest of us, Palantir's software claims are pretty standard for enterprise software. Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Siemens, etc., make those claims regularly. I don't think Palantir is special but they do have momentum and high profile clients. \n\nOverall I think PLTR is getting ready to take off, but they might find some resistance along the way.

        "body": "I have experience in setting up Snowflake in a Fortune 100 company. And I have also worked on Google Bigquery, AWS Redshift, and Azure DWH in the past. Here are my thoughts on its potentials.\n\n1. Snowflake is a way better product than Bigquery, Redshift, or Azure DWH. It automatically handles all legal database SQL syntax(Oracle, SQL Server, etc.). So data migration from the legacy database is less complex with a minimum learning curve. This is true not just for developers but for all the end-users like Analysts.   \n\n2. Multi-Cloud: It can be hosted in AWS, GCP, or  Azure. This might sound irrelevant. Here is why it's important. Let's say a company started using Bigquery because Google is the preferred partner. After a couple of years, things have changed, and the company decided to make Azure the company's preferred Cloud vendor. Now it's not that easy to migrate your Data warehouse from Bigquery to Azure DHW. With Snowflake, you are not tied up to a particular vendor. The point here is Snowflake gives flexibility, and enterprise companies love this flexibility. \n\n3. Snowflake integration is pretty neat. It integrates with GCS, AWS S3, etc., and with other APIs natively.  Sample use case. Running an ML model(API) on top of Snowflake data using SQL. You don't need to be an ML expert to run a model. Anyone with basic SQL can do this.  This is one example, Applications are endless.\n\n4. Data sharing and Data marketplace. They are building a data catalog complemented by the data sharing feature\u2014essentially data as a service. More data demand -&gt; More data listed in catalog -&gt;  Network effect growth through sharing-&gt; Customer exponential growth-&gt;More money. I believe this will be huge, which is the main reason I'm bullish on Snowflake. Because snowflake supports multi-cloud,  it's not easy for other companies like Google/AWS to replicate this.\n\n5. Snowflake Customer retention is really high, and I strongly believe this will continue to remain so. Most of Snowflake's customers are Enterprises.  In my experience, companies switch or change databases for 3 main reasons. 1. Scaling or maintenance issue 2. License or hardware end of life or no longer supports 3\u2014cost savings. Snowflake is highly scalable and utilizes cloud infrastructure with zero maintenance. So issues 1 and 2 do not exist. For the cost, it is charged per usage. It's way cheaper than any other legacy database like Oracle, HANA, etc. Basically, once an enterprise adopts Snowflake as their data warehouse, I don't see any reason for switching unless something terrible goes wrong.  Many companies still bear Oracle because of the complexity and cost of migration even though they really want to.\n\n6. They have some unique features. One that stands out for me is the feature called Time travel. ( Read about it https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html. This is mind-blowing. They also have the ability to create, schedule, run data pipelines without the need for any ELT/ETL tools. ( Including setting up dependencies). For enterprise companies, this may not be valid but definitely useful for startups.",
