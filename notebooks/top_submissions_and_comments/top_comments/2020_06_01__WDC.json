        "body": "From the little DD I've done here's what I know:\n\nMRVL's revenue still relies heavily on the dwindling HDD market. And though it's taking steps to reduce its reliance, their HDD/SDD sales currently account for over half of its revenue. Many of their SSD customers also happen to be their competitors, who are actively developing their own storage controllers. \n\nMRVL faces stiff competition in the networking and SSD hardware sectors, including such heavy hitters as Western Digital, Toshiba, Broadcom, and Intel. Though it recently (2018) acquired Cavium which extends its reach in the networking hardware market.\n\nManagement faced its share of controversy prior to 2016. It has since been replaced, however, and its acquisition of Cavium seems to indicate they're taking positive steps to gain strategic advantages, primarily in the networking market. \n\nI personally wouldn't consider them the \"next Apple stock\". They have a very long uphill battle to establish a secure market foothold, let alone establish market dominance. They don't have much diversity either, so any downturns that affect their product lines will hit them particularly hard. \n\nThey do seem to be poised for long term growth, but with a notable level of uncertainty.",
