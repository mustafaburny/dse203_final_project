Iridium Communications owns and operates the constellation, additionally selling equipment and access to its services. It was originally conceived by Bary Bertiger, Raymond J. Leopold and Ken Peterson in late 1987 (in 1988 protected by patents Motorola filed in their names) and then developed by Motorola on a fixed-price contract from July 29, 1993, to November 1, 1998, when the system became operational and commercially available.\n\nThe constellation consists of 66 active satellites in orbit, required for global coverage, and additional spare satellites to serve in case of failure.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

        "body": "NOK is currently priced very low. I think it would be a good acquisition target for some American company backed with private equity. Inside Nokia exist what was once Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs, Motorola wireless network infrastructure. \n\nThe main reason for low price  is Nokia's [ReefShark](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2018/01/29/nokia-launches-reefshark-chipsets-that-deliver-massive-performance-gain-in-5g-networks/) chipset supplier (Intel) who could not deliver.  Nokia had to cancel dividends because  they need to spend more into R&amp;D and redesign stuff.  Profit margins suffer because the FPGA based chipset is more expensive than anticipated.   This is probably just temporary setback but  very  bad one. There were even some rollout delays.  [\nNokia's 5G Chip Choice Leaves It Exposed\n](https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/nokias-5g-chip-choice-leaves-it-exposed/d/d-id/755184).\n\nDigesting Alactel-Lucent acquisition resulted other problems but  those sould be over soon.",

At what point do you think to yourself \u201chuh, maybe After being wrong over and over again, my logic is wrong?\u201d.\n\nPerhaps Boeing is staying strong because it\u2019s a duopoly in the biz and the US government has stated they are going to spend an incredible amount of money on defence, and space, which Boeing will be a recipient of?\n\nPerhaps the Max issues will eventually be sorted and the price reflects that?  Maybe the stock would have been $800 without the current issues?\n\n\nRegarding Tesla, perhaps the stock is so high because everyone and their grandmother can see the rest of the car manufacturers are so far behind giving them a 10 year head start on a network, autopilot miles logged, etc?  Ford is a joke, GM and cruise isn\u2019t doing remotely close to anything of substance, the Japs are still sticking to ICE and Hybrid; the Germans can\u2019t even figure out how to build a reliable ICE car in 100+ years let alone get into electrification.\n\nRemember when Walmart gave Amazon a 7 year head start?\n\nHow about when Nokia, Blackberry, and Motorola gave Apple a head start on phones?\n\n\ud83d\udca1",
