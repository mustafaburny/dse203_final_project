        "body": "What makes Apple more unique I think is how immaterial their value is. They don't manufacture their own phones, Foxconn does iirc. Many of the parts for the iPhone come from Samsung etc. \n\nI think part of the popularity of Apple is due to how invested some people are in their \"ecosystem\". If you've spent \u00a3100s on iTunes music/apps, a docking station and iCloud storage, you might not buy an android even if they are better. Many don't like change, I'm guilty of this. I've owned mostly Samsung phones (tried Sony and Motorola, didn't like them as much) and I just can't be bothered to change to a device that has a different user interface etc. \n\nThis complacency, combined with their \"coolness\" makes Apple valuable. And their devices aren't even bad, just slightly more expensive than the competition. I think the introduction of Apple + or whatever their streaming service is and their games subscription thing was a good move.",

Inside Nokia exist what was once Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs, Motorola wireless network infrastructure. \n\nThe main reason for low price  is Nokia's [ReefShark](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2018/01/29/nokia-launches-reefshark-chipsets-that-deliver-massive-performance-gain-in-5g-networks/) chipset supplier (Intel) who could not deliver.  Nokia had to cancel dividends because  they need to spend more into R&amp;D and redesign stuff.  Profit margins suffer because the FPGA based chipset is more expensive than anticipated.   This is probably just temporary setback but  very  bad one. There were even some rollout delays.

If this started a week ago and you chose Tesla, then you'd be a happy camper right now!  But I think it'll pull back quite a bit after some hype wears off.  Stocks that shoot up very high and very quick like that always pull back, sometimes a lot.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this project is how investing shouldn't be boiled down to weeks, but I guess that's all the time you have to work with in a school.  So my advice:  if you do this for real when you're older, think about 8 YEARS instead of just weeks or months!\n\nStill reading, or getting bored yet?  Here are some picks:  Amazon, Mastercard or Visa, Shopify, The Trade Desk, Adobe, Cognex, MongoDB, Match Group, Okta, Stitch Fix, Square, Twilio, Zscaler, Zoom Video Communications, MercadoLibre, Wix, Roku, Nvidia, Netflix, Micron Technology.  Given your short time frame, some of these should give you a good boost during that time - unless the market has a bit of a correction, which it might because it's been \"hot\" lately.  Pick some, pick all, whatever your teacher lets you do.  Hope this helps!",

Also $2k is not nearly enough unless you want to hold a single risky and downtrodden stock that don\u2019t generate much premium. With that little an amount you also won\u2019t be able to diversify. It\u2019s best not to hold more than 5-10% of your account in any one stock. If you can get margin on your account, skip the put phase and buy the stock and sell an ITM (I like around 70 delta) call. That\u2019s the same trade as a short put but you can leverage 4x usually. You can find stocks that can average between 0.5-1.0% a week. Going out farther than one week reduces risk and return. Some of my go-to lower price stocks are SFIX, MU, SNAP, TWTR, BAC, CIEN, CSCO, LK, MU, T, WDC, and XLNX. Beware of earnings!",

MU is a cyclical stock (look up micron cyclical to see why) so just buy 100 shares and sell a covered call every month with a strike at least 50 cents above your average cost. If the stock slips too much and you can't get a decent premium selling a strike above your average cost, weigh your previous premium gains against that and lower your strike so that if the shares were called away, you wouldnt have lost money all things considered.\n\nmy average cost was like 49 for a while (its lower now) and the stock went down to the low 40's. I couldn't sell a $50 strike for more than like 60 bucks. But I had already made 6k selling calls on MU. So I said, let me sell a 45 call then for three months out and get a 900 premium. If it does hit 45, ill lose money, but not more than I've made in total selling calls against my shit.\n\nthat's just the way i think of it. but yeah i would just buy now while its below 60",
