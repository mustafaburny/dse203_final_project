Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

Originally I held 10x 200/180 QQQ June Put spread (bought this January). Mid February  I bought out the 180 short leg and as QQQ crashed I rerolled the long leg to earlier date/lower strike at every ~100% gain keeping cash (took out about $30k cash out of originally $3.8k spread). The lowest/nearest puts I had were $170 QQQ Apr, but in the past 2 weeks rolled it back up to $180 QQQ May. I probably will not roll in up/forward any more and just let it expire in May worthless if the uptrend continues.\n\nI bought the $200 QQQ Jan2021 Call this Friday.\n\nJanuary is basically 6month after when I am fairly sure US confirmed will start decreasing (hopefully earlier!). When I bought it $QQQ was ~$181 so I chose $200 as ~10% out. I do think that with all the support the financial markets are receiving this will not be a prolonged recession so hopefully we will return to previous $230 level, in which case I don't care what the $VIX will be.  \n\nAlthough realistically I am already thinking of rolling my calls to higher strikes, taking out cash as we go (went from 12k-&gt;18k since Friday). On the down slide this lead to me extracting more cash from the puts than my original $200 QQQ June put is worth now.",

        "body": "Low end and mid end graphics cards will become obsolete in the coming years because APU's will be good enough to replace them. So nVidia will likely be pushed out of the market there because APUs are a product they can't compete with. \n\nRight now nVidia only has one main competitor which is AMD, who are too busy drooling on the floor to actually bring them pain, but both Intel and ARM are also entering the market.\n\nOn the long term AI algorithms will completely replace traditional game engines which will in turn make GPU's as we know it obsolete, my point in the original comment. Now nVidia are very well positioned to take advantage of this but there is no guarantee they will be the only players in this field, in fact I expect the software guys to come and steal their lunch because: \n\n1) Game publishers are rich as fuck and have all the money necessary to create this AI hardware divisions\n2) Epic Games who own Unreal Engine are 49% owned by Tencent and China has been ramping up their own silicon lately, and I can guarantee they will not miss this chance of controlling PC gaming hardware\n\nBasically nVidia's pie will continue to dwindle on the PC gaming and their growth on emergent markets will also be capped pretty soon.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk",

There was no way to predict it, so the real smart decision learned would've been to just spread out a bit, and split my cash into both, so if one does particular well, I can at least average and balance with the other.
