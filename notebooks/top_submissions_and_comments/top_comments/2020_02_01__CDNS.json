        "body": "&gt; I put $1,000 into the Target Retirement 2060 Fund, but I feel like it's more reasonable to retire in 2065 now. :(\n\nThe difference will barely be measurable. \n\n&gt; Additionally, I want to be a bit more aggressive. I want to jump into VTSMX and VFINX.\n\nYou already own VTSMX in your target date fund.\n\n&gt; Can I allocate money for Target Retirement 2065 Fund, Target Retirement 2060 Fund, FTSMX, and VFINX separately?\n\nYes you can but that's stupid.  Target Date Funds are all-in-one fire-and-forget investing strategies.  It makes zero sense to buy both 2060 and 2065 when they are 100% exactly the same except for their *slightly* different glide path that you won't even see for several decades.  VTSMX and VFINX track nearly identically over the long term and their top holdings are basically the same.  There is ZERO reason to have both.  Pick one.  Or pick neither since you *already* own VTSMX in your TD fund.\n\nAs far as being aggressive...90% stocks (as your TD fund dictates) is *very* aggressive.  There is ~~no added~~ barely any measurable benefit to going to &gt;90% stocks.  Best strategy is pick ONE target date fund and keep contributing to it every year (or whatever your investing cadence will be).",

        "body": "Around the late 90s, it became incredibly popular to increase operational efficiency (a.k.a. dollars made per dollars spent) by minimizing the amount of overhead through efficient supply chains. This is frequently referred to as [the Toyota way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way), but commonly implemented under the auspices of [Lean Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Six_Sigma).\n\n If you have a supply chain where you just order tons of materials have have them waiting for a long time in a warehouse to be used when you need them, your company is paying for more materials than it \"needs to\". Under perfect conditions, you get just the amount of materials that you need to keep production going for the short term, and replenish on a higher cadence. As long as you have reliable supply chains, this greatly reduces overhead, since you \"own\" a lot less of the components of your product at any given time.\n\nOver the past two decades, manufacturing companies have greatly reduced component inventories in keeping with these principals, rather moving towards receiving these components with as little time to spare as possible (a.k.a. [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing). This looks great for upper management under smooth conditions. The profits go up without selling any more product! ....However, it also means that if a supplier disruption occurs, you have far, far less time to react or find an alternate. It makes supply chains less robust to disruptions, as there is no slack in the system. No warehouses of parts than can cover the gap.\n\nI sincerely think this outbreak will cause global companies to reevaluate the risk-reward of lean manufacturing.",

This allows me to have a higher yield, purchase more shares, and have a greater chance for share price appreciation.

I keep my 401(k) solely in a target date fund and use my taxable brokerage for my higher risk stocks. I enjoy the process of building my own dividend portfolio and have had great success so far.",
