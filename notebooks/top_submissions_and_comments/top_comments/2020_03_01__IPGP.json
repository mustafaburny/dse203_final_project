Tell me which economic factors made the fed cut rates ? Pretty sure it's fucking clear as day the reason they did is because of the stock market. The market is in control of the fed now. A rate cut like this makes bond prices tanks even more, causing investors to throw their money into the stock market hoping for better gains then what bonds can offer them.",

March 15th, we'll also produce surgical masks) in China (Zaozhuang, Shandong specifically). We have a 500,000sq ft facility with a dedicated ISO class 5 Cleanroom for our 300,000 daily n95 production capabilities (and 1MM masks a day for surgical masks once it's at full operation) and we are taking bulk orders (10,000 pc minimum) for shipment within China, our clients are usually in charge of export as there simply isn't enough time for our limited employees to deal with exports. We supply to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in China called XiuZheng pharmaceutical group \u4fee\u6b63\u96c6\u56e2 and have sold millions of our n95 respirators to them. We also supply millions of n95 respirators to Xiaomi \u5c0f\u7c73, the phone company. We've had clients export to Russia, HK and US, though I'm not quite sure the exact logistics they went through. Some clients use freight forwarding companies.\n\nThe material costs have tripled in the last month alone so our masks are currently more expensive than usual, but people are nonstop purchasing due to the shortages. Hopefully we can help you get what you're looking for.  \n\nOur current pricing for n95 mask is 14rmb ($2 USD equivalent) for smaller orders of 10,000pcs+, 13 rmb ($1.86) for 50,000+, 12 rmb ($1.72) for 100,000pcs+, 11rmb ($1.57) for 1,000,000+ and 10rmb for 10,000,000+. This does not include shipping cost by SF Express which will be Cash on Delivery. It also does not include 10% taxes if applicable. Please keep in mind that material prices are constantly shifting so this may be out of date when you see this. Just two weeks ago (2/12/2020) our price per N95 mask was 18rmb while our prices in January was 4rmb! Once materials run out we cannot purchase them unless we pay a crazy amount for example, one ton of raw material used to cost 20,000 rmb, now for the same ton of n95 material costs 380,000-800,000 rmb, which is literally up to 40 times the cost for the same exact material. There is a global shortage of n95 grade materials.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me on Wechat or Whatsapp if you want to place orders. \n\nMy Wechat ID is: franktsaur and my WhatsApp ID is +16269916596. I am based in Los Angeles, but I work with the Asia team remotely. \n\nSincerely, \nFrank T.",

This week in Ireland no joke. Fear everywhere. So I think Warren Buffett said rule 1 in investing is don\u2019t loose money and rule 2 is see rule 1. So when you guys states side start to see what\u2019s happening I believe there will be more fear your side hence more selling.\n\nSo I liquidated everything on Friday because \n1. I think you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet in the USA re the Corona Virus (I hope I am wrong)\n2. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. So in cash now ( I have had a good run and can\u2019t complain)\n3. The is real fear out there . Rugby Matches being cancelled, conferences, first reported case of Corona in Dublin yesterday.\n4. I am a long term investor and will be back in again when this passes and it will pass. I am hopping by the Summer.\n\nI think long term you will all be fine.\n\nTake care guys. Interesting week(s) ahead.",
