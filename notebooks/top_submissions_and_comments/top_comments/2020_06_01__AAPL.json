I agree that the speculation has gotten out of hand lately, but Tesla from day one has had powerful, motivated leadership. Elon somehow manages to pull off miracle after miracle despite the insane challenges. The cult that surrounded Apple and Steve Jobs' vision is what made it one of the world's most valuable companies today. The insane talent of Michael Jordan made the Chicago Bulls the most valuable franchise of the '90s. Elon Musk is why Tesla is so valuable. No other car company has someone like that running things. Electric cars *will* be the kind of car everyone drives in the future. Gasoline is on its way out, it's just a matter of time frame. And the electric car that everybody wants is the one that will safely and reliably drive itself while doing so in style and has a cult of personality behind it.\n\nSo yeah, the price of TSLA does indeed look insane, but there actually is some merit to it. Sadly a much better time to buy would have been when so many people were hating on it at $200.",

This chip is x86 compatible and can run software for Intel CPUs.  For simplicity let\u2019s call this \u201cspeaking English\u201d.\n\nAnd then we have ARM, which Apple and Qualcomm are the largest firms producing those chips.  For our simplistic explication let\u2019s say they speak Spanish.\n\nSoftware for x86 (English) won\u2019t work as is on ARM (Spanish) even if developed against the same operating system.  So it either needs to be recompiled (rewritten in Spanish) or needs to be on the fly translated (which is really slow).\n\nApple has twice now switched CPU architectures that are incompatible with one another and this move to ARM will be switch #3.  It takes a lot of effort to pull off such a major switch and not anger or confuse users in the process.\n\nOnce Apple moves to ARM the only real big use left for Intel is Windows PCs and the data center.  Windows 10 was ported to ARM as well and AMD has a very competitive chip for the data center.\n\nI don\u2019t see Intel having much relevance a few years from now.",

A number of permabulls were sighted at the top of the tremendous rally wondering if it would be one day or two days until all time highs were once again revisited to relieve them of their calls.

        "body": "No, it's not driven by a magical expectation. The high price is due to their market penetration, which is unlike any competitor.\n\nI'm not saying it's justified, I honestly have no idea what the true value of this company is, nobody does, but the value in Zoom is so much more than a 'magical expectation'.\n\nTech companies have stickier customers than any other industry in history due to the incredible amounts of data they can collect.\n\nAt a global scale, both on a consumer, business and enterprise level, Zoom has daily analytics on:\n\n- How many video conferences take place\n- Who participates in them\n- Whether they use chat features or just the video/audio\n- How many people are in a meeting\n- How close participants are geographically\n\nHonestly, I could make this list as long as I liked, the data points are endless.\n\nNo other video conference company has such deep penetration across every area of the vidconf market. \n\nThat mix of personal, business and enterprise penetration isn't something anyone else in the market has, and it's so incredibly valuable at a data analytics level. \n\nBeing able to compare and contrast customer behaviours across different contexts unlocks insights that power incredible company growth (see: Facebook)\n\nThis incredible amount of data informs their future product development opportunities, meaning that it's a strong bet that Zoom is going to make better future plays in the technology space than their competitors (e.g. Google, Webex, etc).\n\nNote again that these competitors cover an area of the market each (personal, enterprise), Zoom covers all of it and more.\n\nWhen you combine that with the fact that they have already destroyed every competitor in the space on user experience and customer satisfaction, this puts them at a huge advantage over every other player in the video conference space. \n\nThey came into this space as a startup competing against Microsoft, Cisco and Google, and they're winning by a country mile.\n\nSo when video chats move from 'schedule a call' to an all inclusive platform that handles all communications across audio/video, personal/business, etc, Zoom is going to be the best placed to dominate that huge market.\n\nThis is an equivalent shift in the Telcom industry as the one from dial phones to mobile phones. \n\nIf you're imagining what a shift like that might look like, imagine having cameras from your TV, fridge and various 'IoT enabled' devices around your house that follow you as you talk to people.\n\nImagine having an affordable interactive whiteboard in your house that updates as your video partners write on their own interactive whiteboards.\n\nImagine it get used to plan family trips out as much as it's used to plan corporate strategies.\n\nImagine being able to manipulate AR models on video and share it with the world.\n\nThat all requires a central platform to harness all the data involved and turn it into a user experience. Zoom is better placed to do that than any other company in the world right now.\n\nThat is what it's price is driven by.\n\nAnd all you see is people whining that they had a security breach, as though that can't be fixed (which it has).\n\nEvery company has data breaches, not every company is this well placed to dominate a market that is going to grow like wildfire over the next 20 years.\n\n---------\n\nNow, with all that being said, I still only have 10% of my portfolio in Zoom, even with all this going for it, every company is a 50/50 bet at best. But if I'm gonna pick 10 companies in the world to invest in, Zoom is definitely one of them.",
