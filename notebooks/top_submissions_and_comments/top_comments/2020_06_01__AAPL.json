        "body": " Your whole post reads as if it's just reading the company's own investor relations pitch. \n\n&gt; Spotify is a founder led company. Daniel Ek has a history of success (was successful at 13, several successful previous companies, high level executive positions, and he is not motivated by money \u2013 I repeat, not motivated by money but he took on a notoriously difficult and entrenched music industry \u2013 and was successful). \n\nNot motivated by money? Do you have an honest source for this? And yes, he does not receive salary, but that is more or less meaningless, and likely a PR move as much as anything else. High level corporate execs make their money from stock options, bonuses, etc. \n\n&gt;Anyone who\u2019s worked with Ek, will vouch for his extreme, outlier intelligence, and competitiveness.\n\nSo basically like every CEO of a large corporation?\n\n&gt; Gross revenue is everything (ie Amazon). Top line growth is king. It\u2019s ammo for the founder to do what they do best, innovate and execute. If your top line is growing at the rate that Spotify\u2019s is growing, you can always find a way to be profitable. That\u2019s MBA 101. Any management consultant will tell you that. The fact that they are not profitable, means they DO NOT WANT TO BE PROFITABLE. They are growing, there are executing plans and reinvesting. Amazon could have been profitable 8 years ago, but it reinvested in distribution centers. \n\nThis is drastically oversimplified... people need to quit it with the dumb \"every non profitable growth company is the next amazon\" type stuff. It's silly and a cliche'd and overused comparison that ignores that hundreds of businesses that went out of business following the same model. Some industries that have enormous growth potential will never have the potential for enormous margin. Amazon always had the ability to shift their business to actually utilize that margin. \n\n&gt;Spotify is also investing for the future, they're building for the future. \n\nGreat, so what exactly are they doing to invest in the future, and why will it make them more $ downt he road? Name a single company that is \\*NOT\\* investing for the future... this is a silly comment that is not actual analysis.\n\n**Just some quick thoughts**\n\nI have nothing for or against Spotify, I'm being hard on you because your \"analysis\" reads more like cheerleading and trying to pump your position. \n\nWhat is the rate of growth in users, what is the rate of change in margins here? And what is the honest path to profitability in the very long run? What are the major risks here?\n\nI do not see a major moat here, and Amazon, Apple, and Google already compete in this space. This drives down margins, and will make it extremely difficult for Spotify to be consistently profitable in the long run on their own. This space of the market is entirely saturated and it has never been a particularly profitable area in the first place.",

I agree that the speculation has gotten out of hand lately, but Tesla from day one has had powerful, motivated leadership. Elon somehow manages to pull off miracle after miracle despite the insane challenges. The cult that surrounded Apple and Steve Jobs' vision is what made it one of the world's most valuable companies today. The insane talent of Michael Jordan made the Chicago Bulls the most valuable franchise of the '90s. Elon Musk is why Tesla is so valuable. No other car company has someone like that running things. Electric cars *will* be the kind of car everyone drives in the future. Gasoline is on its way out, it's just a matter of time frame. And the electric car that everybody wants is the one that will safely and reliably drive itself while doing so in style and has a cult of personality behind it.\n\nSo yeah, the price of TSLA does indeed look insane, but there actually is some merit to it. Sadly a much better time to buy would have been when so many people were hating on it at $200.",

This chip is x86 compatible and can run software for Intel CPUs.  For simplicity let\u2019s call this \u201cspeaking English\u201d.\n\nAnd then we have ARM, which Apple and Qualcomm are the largest firms producing those chips.  For our simplistic explication let\u2019s say they speak Spanish.\n\nSoftware for x86 (English) won\u2019t work as is on ARM (Spanish) even if developed against the same operating system.  So it either needs to be recompiled (rewritten in Spanish) or needs to be on the fly translated (which is really slow).\n\nApple has twice now switched CPU architectures that are incompatible with one another and this move to ARM will be switch #3.  It takes a lot of effort to pull off such a major switch and not anger or confuse users in the process.\n\nOnce Apple moves to ARM the only real big use left for Intel is Windows PCs and the data center.  Windows 10 was ported to ARM as well and AMD has a very competitive chip for the data center.\n\nI don\u2019t see Intel having much relevance a few years from now.",

A number of permabulls were sighted at the top of the tremendous rally wondering if it would be one day or two days until all time highs were once again revisited to relieve them of their calls.  Wall Street Bets users were overheard observing that it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway, as those who had bought at the top would paper hand their positions into oblivion (Ticker: MGM) at market open.\n\nIn other news, certain users of Wall Street Bets had still somehow been tricked into believing they were in a bull market even though zooming out to anything other than a 5 minute chart showed an accelerating downtrend over the last two weeks.\n\nBears, hungry on the news of a downturn, seized the day with a startling array of puts without understanding that volatility was falling exactly as fast as their positions were expanding, leaving them with little to show for the experience but a sense of righteous indignation, a sore ass, and a more complicated tax return.\n\nAnd finally, in what will likely be the feel good story of the year, Kang Gang was vaporized in a bouncy house mishap earlier today.

Account value dropped to 100k in no time.\n\nJune 11th hits, and I make BANK. 100k -&gt; 213.5k in one day. Dropped back down a little the next day (191k).\n\nJune 19 went up 19k to 210.5k, on SPY and AAPL puts.\n\nLost 9.5k over the next few days, on SPY puts. Down to 201k\n\nJune 24, made 34.5k on SPY and QQQ puts, literally FOMOing into them at open. Up to 235.5k EOD.\n\nJune 25, I go nearly ALL IN on QQQ puts from around SPY 303.5 through SPY 304.5. I am fucking retard. EOD spike megafucks me down from 235.5k to 170k. I get mad and spend my last 10k on MORE QQQ puts in the AH spike to SPY 308.\n\nJune 26: I fucking diamond hand my 375 QQQ puts as they rise from 4.50 a pop to 6+ dollars each. Sold 20% of them at 6.25, closed the rest at 6.5-6.89 each, when SPY was knocking on 300's door. Today's total? Up $78,862.30 on the day, ending with my account at $249,597.39.\n\nMy next move? NOT going all in on puts anymore. I've made my money, I'm not a genius, and I won't get lucky so many times. Retard strength comes in the form of diamond hands and that was literally my saving grace today. Will probably limit my put buying to 20% of my account from now on.\n\nAccount value chart: https://imgur.com/a/2oSxL9S",

I'm going to full inverse myself.\n\nWhich means I'm going to make every play my old self would think is absolutely retarded.\n\nI'm going to buy highly risky companies on the verge of bankruptcy. Go half-all-in on Hertz, airlines, cruise lines, AMC, all of it. At the same time, I will buy companies I think are retarded to buy because they are insanely overvalued. So I'll buy shit like Zoom, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, whatever.\n\nI think all these plays are FUCKING RETARDED. But going with my \"smart logic\" hasn't been working. So we will try inversing myself and doing things I genuinely think are stupid.\n\nIf I still lose money, I will know God is trolling me specifically. If I make money, I will know I'm retarded and should never try to succeed at anything ever again. Either way the outcome will be the same.\n\nTime for another drink.",

An index fund is a great choice for a long term, set it and forget it, investment. This advice is coming from someone who holds very little principal in index funds or any other ETFs.  On a time scale like that, your money will double every ~7 years (~10% average return). Why risk it?",
