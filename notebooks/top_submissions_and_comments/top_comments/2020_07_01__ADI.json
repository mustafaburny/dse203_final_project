        "body": "&gt; Hedge-fund billionaire William Ackman has come roaring back after years of dwindling assets and a self-imposed exile from the spotlight.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But the famed activist investor\u2019s recent wins haven\u2019t been fueled by publicly agitating for companies to change. They have instead come from outside-the-box moves like the one that will be on display next week, when Mr. Ackman is expected to launch an initial public offering of the biggest blank-check company ever, raising money to take a future acquisition public.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Ackman hasn\u2019t initiated a public shareholder-activism campaign since he lost a proxy fight with Automatic Data Processing Inc. in 2017. Instead, he has made long-term bets on large companies where he remains an involved shareholder, like Starbucks Corp. Earlier this year, he made a prescient bearish wager that enabled his fund to sidestep the stock market\u2019s plunge. Now he is taking a big swing in the IPO market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the first half of 2020, Mr. Ackman\u2019s public fund, Pershing Square Holdings Ltd., returned 29%\u2014handily beating a 4% decline in the S&amp;P 500\u2014boosted in part by complex hedges he began to put in place in February. Those hedges generated $2.6 billion in proceeds and offset other losses in his portfolio. His strong start to 2020 follows a big win in 2019, when Pershing Square returned more than 50%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Ackman declined to comment for this article.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hailed as an investing savant after strongly outperforming the broader market during the financial crisis, Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square fund swelled to $20 billion under management in mid-2015.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then, his fortune turned. A big bet on drugmaker Valeant began to unravel, ultimately costing the fund billions of dollars and driving losses for three consecutive years. A bet against Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. also floundered, and despite Mr. Ackman\u2019s many public appearances deriding the company\u2019s accounting and business practices, the stock kept rising. Between 2015 and 2019, his private fund shrunk by roughly $9 billion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Ackman stopped raising money for that private fund and focused on the public fund, retreated from the limelight and told investors he was returning to the type of investment analysis that first catapulted him to success.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;His assets under management are now more than $10 billion, with the public fund contributing more than $8.5 billion and the rest in the private fund. That money is concentrated in mostly large companies, such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. \u2014a formerly activist position where the team is on the board\u2014Starbucks and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Ackman has previous experience with taking companies public, having [helped flip](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577322270322801942) Burger King Holdings Inc. public in 2012 through the special-purpose acquisition company he co-founded.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next week, he will take another blank-check company public with the aim of raising $3 billion in its IPO. Pershing Square could add another few billion dollars to the pot, bringing the total amount for the SPAC to invest in a company to nearly $6.5 billion. The goal: to use the money to bring a large private company public, according to a regulatory filing\u2014potentially a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d valued at billions in the private market\u2014and continue Mr. Ackman\u2019s recent winning streak.",
