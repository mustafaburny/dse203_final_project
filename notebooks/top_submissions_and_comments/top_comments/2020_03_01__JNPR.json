        "body": "At a very small scale software like DNAC or DCNM works ok. Try to scale this to 10,000's of nodes, and it starts to fall apart. I have seen this multiple different times, and this was using recommended compute hardware given to us by cisco to try and make it work.\n\nThe automation software crumbles when you reach scales the require automation, which completely defeats the purpose.\n\nI also didn't say their hardware has issues. Aside from the usual bug schedule (which cisco is no better/worse than anyone else) their hardware is rocksolid, it really comes down to the software for the API on the devices, or the software of tools to manage it.\n\nCisco is only a leader in the market when you look at the entire breadth of their portfolio because: No one else is spread as thin. Only Juniper comes close and IMO and while i like SRX, it's not a while lot better than Firepower. Their ability to automate though? Leaps and bounds above cisco, and their hardware platform is arguable just as mature as any that cisco has on the market.",

        "body": "I don't think this is a stupid post. I've been thinking about this the past month. I think the two biggest dangers are: 1) $CGC price collapses on delisting from nyse back to $TWMJF on otc due to funds that are not allowed to put their pensioners, clients, etc. money in a company trading otc. So $CGC gets stomped into the ground allowing STZ to create an option to buy CGC based on these depressed ass prices; 2) so CGC uses cash to buy a depressed MSO [which one - prices are still wide between some of the peers?], but CGC doesn't have its opex under control yet to operate itself profitably meaning the cash cushion it currently has available is required until CGC reaches profitability. Sooo I have a hard time seeing this as a possibility unless a sudden, multi-tiered plan occurs: CGC announces that: 1) CGC, ACRG, TER all enter into a fuck ton of IIPR sale-lease deals for more cash upfront; 2) CGC will trade back on otc; 3) CGC will acquire ACRG + TER; 4) CGC announces an all cash acquisition of said MSO; 5) In exchange of a shit-term deal with STZ acquiring CGC's shares via option in the future, STZ agrees to provide an upfront premium cash equity infusion of $2B now in exchange for another 25% (or w/e) of CGC to be converted into CGC shares under STZ's ownership upon federal permissibility - along with all of their existing ownership of shares placed into escrow until such federal event...prob with qualifiers allowing STZ to withdraw their option from escrow upon certain events occurring for their own protection, too...hmmm lmao",
