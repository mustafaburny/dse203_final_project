        "body": "At a very small scale software like DNAC or DCNM works ok. Try to scale this to 10,000's of nodes, and it starts to fall apart. I have seen this multiple different times, and this was using recommended compute hardware given to us by cisco to try and make it work.\n\nThe automation software crumbles when you reach scales the require automation, which completely defeats the purpose.\n\nI also didn't say their hardware has issues. Aside from the usual bug schedule (which cisco is no better/worse than anyone else) their hardware is rocksolid, it really comes down to the software for the API on the devices, or the software of tools to manage it.\n\nCisco is only a leader in the market when you look at the entire breadth of their portfolio because: No one else is spread as thin. Only Juniper comes close and IMO and while i like SRX, it's not a while lot better than Firepower. Their ability to automate though? Leaps and bounds above cisco, and their hardware platform is arguable just as mature as any that cisco has on the market.",

Yes WEBEX has Zoom as its competitor but in network infrastructure it is the only major US firm and its competitors Juniper Networks doesnt quite have the scale as CISCO. However I would get CISCO maybe at 30 or less. I heard CISCO is entering the fabless network chip design market against Broadcom though so if you want sure throw down.",

        "body": "Nokia went FPGA originally for their 5G cells. These are more flexible than ASICs so good for testing and network design but they are less power efficient. Power is a big issue in 5G as telco's will need 3-5x the amount of sites we needed for LTE. \n\nEricsson went ASIC from the beginning which was the right call. In addition Ericsson has higher mshare vs Nokia and 5G will use the same RAN as LTE - so do I swap my whole network out or buy better 5G tech from the company I already buy my network infrastructure from?\n\nThat said MNO's are suffering and will buy from whoever offers the best terms. Payment terms will beat the better tech for many MNO's.\n\nI would still buy ERIC over NOK calls but better rhan both would be to back the tech behind them both and that will be ASICs.\n\nAlso ERIC &amp; NOK make their money from support/services/maintenance contracts as the MNO's play them off against each other to drive down Capex costs. Neither will profit bigly from 5G until at least mid 2021 when network maintenance contracts scale up.\n\nTLDR: Look for 5G ASIC companies instead of FPGA manufacturers like Xilinx. If going long ERIC or NOK buy exp as far out as you can - selling network infrastructure is low margin they make money from network services.",
