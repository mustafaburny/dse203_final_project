It is ripe for disruption.\n\nthe problem with that logic is that they're not a company that will be easy to disrupt due to how entrenched they are. they are basically like ms office in terms of being THE standard. even if someone made a new spreadsheet or document writing program, large businesses and city governments aren't going to use it. example: how many large companies do you see using google docs rather  than office?\n\ncity governments will  literally tell companies \"autocad format only\" when they submit their plans. getting back to the office comparison, this is an even bigger problem with autocad alternatives. with office stuff, in many cases you can simply pdf your document and send that and nobody would know/care what you originally made it with. (and for your email client, nobody knows if you're using outlook or not). with CAD layouts, everyone needs to be using the same software (because even where conversion to other programs is possible, when dealing with professional CAD layouts millimeters matter so everyone needs to be able to  trust that the conversion is PERFECT.)",

I look at FinTechs more so as partners with V/MA and not competitors. Unless one of these companies wanted to start their own payment network directly. \n\nBNPL (like Affirm) could take some of the credit card business but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some companies could start letting you even make installment payments via CC instead of direct ACH. I\u2019m sure people even use their debit cards, which are V/MA branded\n\nMy biggest concern is more regulation around payment networks and potential allowance of smaller networks to gain a piece of the pie. I read an article the other day how Australia may mandate low-cost debit card system for payments, which would allow banks to potentially utilize cheaper payment networks as opposed to V/MA (which are more expensive). I\u2019m still not overly concerned with this yet to make me back off my stance that both V/MA are great long term holds, but something to watch. \n\nOnce international travel comes back some post COVID, V/MA will shoot up as this is their bread and butter. That segment has still not really recovered yet from COVID and will be one of the last things that does.",

So in a way its ok that visa is a bit \"overvalued\" because the company is great and has some really good margins. \n\nI only purchased 5 shares so the difference between 200 and my AVG is around 110 which wont make much of a difference on a 10+ year investment IMO. Even if V gets closer to that 200 level there's always room to add more.",

It's a Highlander situation, and there can be only one. You must acquire the entire market, because second place is death. If Myspace, Friendster, GooglePlus or any of the other dozens of 'also ran' social networks had beaten Facebook to the punch, getting Zuckerberg'ed wouldn't be a thing.\n\nIn other industries like brick and mortar food or retail, it's important to maintain profitability while expanding. Expansion will take decades. Walmart didn't show up in the 1960's and take over America. It started in the backwaters other retailers were ignoring and built out, year over year, decade over decade. Same story with Taco Bell and dozens of others. This model requires persistent profitability.\n\nSave an Ma Bell or Facebook type business, I'll prefer improved margins.",
