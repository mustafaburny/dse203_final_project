        "body": "*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df473ecb7e9c5b9c107222c65f3131a/7be8cdb3803e5a29-77/s500x750/284bbb2175287530e6f02fc233a1772dce7a4852.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gdnoSkR_Hk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kQxYZ5sv6E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$SAFE** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$D** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$EXAS** \n&gt; * **$GT** \n&gt; * **$HLT** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$GPN** \n&gt; * **$CRNT** \n&gt; * **$BIP** \n&gt; * **$YETI** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$LSCC** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$NMM** \n&gt; * **$JE**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tvfxbnh.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DYTRi0w.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWB49z5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hiUR1ec.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w9FUjTz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cPnIcpa.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/BBaSJcZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tjUpFdY.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D7eo9EG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Y4rdLiL.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/feUqB85.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGxgQ96.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tC78cWW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $216.53\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

        "body": "*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df473ecb7e9c5b9c107222c65f3131a/7be8cdb3803e5a29-77/s500x750/284bbb2175287530e6f02fc233a1772dce7a4852.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gdnoSkR_Hk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kQxYZ5sv6E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$SAFE** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$D** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$EXAS** \n&gt; * **$GT** \n&gt; * **$HLT** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$GPN** \n&gt; * **$CRNT** \n&gt; * **$BIP** \n&gt; * **$YETI** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$LSCC** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$NMM** \n&gt; * **$JE**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tvfxbnh.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DYTRi0w.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWB49z5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hiUR1ec.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w9FUjTz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cPnIcpa.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/BBaSJcZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tjUpFdY.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D7eo9EG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Y4rdLiL.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/feUqB85.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGxgQ96.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tC78cWW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $216.53\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

        "body": "People I know who recently worked for IBM tell me that deal is kind of BS. IBM supposedly has adopted Slack 5 years ago and has already been widely (more than half) used since being introduced. So the impact on DAU is not going to go up by as much as people are assuming (I.e. 350k). It\u2019s likely just that on paper, now it\u2019s going to be the main instant communication platform considering they sold off their in-house IM service a few years ago which I\u2019m told isn\u2019t very good. So anyone still relying on the old system will be forced to use slack too. It\u2019s basically just wider roll out to an existing customer that\u2019s already widely rolled out.\n\n&gt; In the filing, Slack said \"IBM has been Slack's largest customer for several years and has expanded its usage of Slack over that time.\" The company added it would not update its financial guidance for the fourth quarter or its fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\n&gt; Business Insider reported than an IBM executive said more than 300,000 of its employees already had access to Slack and the company was working to onboard the last 50,000. The report said the expansion means \"IBM is now Slack's single largest customer.\" Slack's filing confirmed IBM has long been its largest customer.",

Dynamics AX, Dynamics NAV, Dynamics 365 are now cloud offerings.\n\nMeaning if you are on Dynamics NAV ,  there is not a lot of work being done to the NAV product, its all being done on \"Business central\" what is just NAV running Azure. If you want to \"upgrade\" you have to go to business central .\n\nSame with AX and \"finance and operations\" their branding is retarded but my point is there are a ton of customers who use these products and will be moving to the cloud versions, once they already use azure for that they will just keep using it for there other cloud needs.",
