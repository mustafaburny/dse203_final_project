        "body": "*****\n\n# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?\n\n&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?\n\n&gt; There\u2019s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, \u201cAs goes January, so goes the year.\u201d This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?\n\n&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; It isn\u2019t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. \u201cYes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a-lower-january-hasnt-been-as-bearish-lately.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus\n\n&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.\n\n&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.\n\n&gt; This year\u2019s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6df473ecb7e9c5b9c107222c65f3131a/7be8cdb3803e5a29-77/s500x750/284bbb2175287530e6f02fc233a1772dce7a4852.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 7th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gdnoSkR_Hk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.9.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kQxYZ5sv6E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$SAFE** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$D** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$EXAS** \n&gt; * **$GT** \n&gt; * **$HLT** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$APPS** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$GPN** \n&gt; * **$CRNT** \n&gt; * **$BIP** \n&gt; * **$YETI** \n&gt; * **$MPAA** \n&gt; * **$LSCC** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$NMM** \n&gt; * **$JE**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tvfxbnh.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DYTRi0w.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWB49z5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hiUR1ec.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w9FUjTz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cPnIcpa.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/BBaSJcZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tjUpFdY.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D7eo9EG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Y4rdLiL.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/feUqB85.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGxgQ96.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tC78cWW.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $216.53\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",
