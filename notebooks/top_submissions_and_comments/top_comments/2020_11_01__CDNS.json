        "body": "Seems fairly uninformed. I can't read \"And now, it\u2019s just a matter of time before the performance of ARM-based chips continues its march upmarket into Intel\u2019s last refuge: the server business\" without immediately thinking that he has no idea of the very long and tumultuous history of big iron server ARM. Apple's lighting core is not going to be in the datacenter/server space. Ever. That's not how Apple works. They keep their vertically integrated tech as a competitive advantage and as a way to gate in innovation from other players that literally don't have the capability to copy it without playing \"follow the leader\", the cadence of which works to Apple's advantage.\n\nIf ARM stays independent then ARM is not breaking into servers any time soon. If NVIDIA gets ARM then it is highly likely that ARM will be in servers, but that's just the progression of the trend that's already happening with stream processing eating x86 market share. NVIDIA will not be slotting in ARM chips into chip sockets currently owned by Xeon and Threadripper, they have a very different vision for the datacenter and server space that involves deep vertical integration and dominant performance to justify it. Thus their purchase of Mellanox as a means to that end.\n\nIntel is not screwed because of Apple (we've known about Apple ARM for many months now), it still comes down to AMD getting into the datacenter, server, and laptop space - areas where Intel has built it's behemoth size off of parts that they sell for thousands of dollars. Margins will be crushed, and Intel has insanely huge capex requirements due to running its own fabs. If Intel continues to have fab problems and has to execute an inevitably expensive transition to fabless while their margins are getting crushed, it's going to be another inflection point where investors are going to bail. That would probably be the buy-in time for a knife catcher, but I'd never buy it now. Their quarterly reports are so poor right now that every report has a serious risk of huge investment losses. Intel lied to investors for years about the severity of their fab problems, and Swan gets 0 leeway from investors. I remember how awful his first call was, how he was trying to blame China and how outright pissed the analysts were at his bullshit and how huge the resulting selloff was afterwards. It's really an important point that Intel has lost the trust of their investors, including institutions. These bad flow trends aren't going to reverse unless Intel perhaps kills it for a couple of quarters back to back, and that's not at all likely given the competitive landscape.",

        "body": "If you\u2019re a trader then it\u2019s important to have an exit strategy. Paul was a trader who was trading soybean oil. He went all in and lost everything since he refused to exit a position that he was all in on. It the takeaway isn\u2019t obvious, I\u2019ll make it clear: Don\u2019t go all in on anything. Ever. Sure, the upside can be great, but if the downside wipes you out then it\u2019s not worth it.\n\nAs far as long-term investments are concerned, we have not seen a period where a well diversified portfolio goes to zero. The largest drawdown we\u2019ve had was during the subprime crisis where if you were 100% invested in SPY, you\u2019d end up with a 51% drawdown (later rebounded, but it was still a difficult time for many folks invested in the equities market). At the time, a bit of diversification with bonds would have gone a long way to prevent that 51% peak to trough drawdown (the 60/40 portfolio only had a 31% drawdown over that same period.)\n\nIf you\u2019re in your positions for the long-term, you can take profits as you see fit. I sell into strength from time to time, especially if I have something that starts to grossly exceed my portfolio target allocation (eg if I have 5% in MSFT, and that position does ultra well and starts to take up 11% of my portfolio, I\u2019ll take some chips off the table to get back to my target allocation). I also buy more on a regular cadence, so I\u2019m constantly adding new money into the market.\n\nOf course, if you just want to trade, then both timing of your positions and having a plan on your exits becomes very important. The simplest way to figure this out is to look at how much you\u2019re willing to gain and lose, then set targets so that if they get hit you exit.\n\nI\u2019ve personally never found a consistent method of making money with trading, so I try to invest for the long term instead of worrying about day-to-day or even minute-to-minute scenarios. Different strokes for different folks though. Good luck!",

Making travel alot more annoying, this make travel agents more appealing for hassle free travel. \n\nI\u2019d say give it 6-18 months and it\u2019ll be at around $30-40 mark in that scenario. \n\nOr, vaccine talks die down and it drops to $8-12 range. Which is another buying opportunity imo.",

They can\u2019t make concentrated investments. They have to show quarterly results and so forth. For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

Equities like Microsoft, Apple, Sun, Oracle saw a huge influx of Japanese capital as their markets stagnated.  \n\nEven today, none of Japan\u2019s top 20 companies by market cap are internet or software/tech companies. \n\nThey\u2019ve basically missed the boat on every single technological revolution of the past 30 years.\n\nI\u2019m not as worried about the US, because the US (and China) are the world leaders in technological innovation in almost all major sectors.\n\nIf there IS for some reason a lost decade in the US, China will benefit, as they are the only country that can compete technologically, and their debt position vis a vis the rest of world is favorable.",

        "body": "Hello, I am looking for some advice on a potential portfolio allocation that I am considering. I am a new college graduate looking to begin investing. Before I list out the portfolio I am considering, please see my answers to the relevant information questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How old are you? **23**\n* Are you employed/making income? How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out. I've replaced them with Pinterest in my portfolio as my new search/advertising stock. Social search is the future and I now see the genius advertising potential of the Pinterest platform; I see them stealing advertising dollars away from Google and growing much better than Google over the next 5 years.",

IBM was a computer company.\n\nThe brilliance of MSFT was in - and this seems weird today - realizing that a company could make money just selling software. A ton of money. More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",

        "body": "One way I like to visualize dividend growth investing is by using Visa as an example. A lot of people might look at its current yield of 0.70% and think it would be a terrible dividend stock to own because they yield is so low. But when you look at the actual dividend amounts things start to become a lot more clear.\n\nIn 2009, Visa paid a dividend of $0.10 a share. In 2019 they paid a dividend of $1.00 a share. Visa's stock price was around $20 in 2009, so if we use that as our cost basis, the current dividend yield we'd be receiving from shares purchased in 2009 would be 5% (known as yield on cost). So basically even though Visa currently yields 0.70% to anyone buying today, that doesn't mean everyone holding shares is making 0.70% on their investment. \n\nThis is one of the reasons Warren Buffet has been so successful over the years. For example, his cost basis on Coca Cola is $3.25 per share, and the stock currently pays a dividend of $1.64 per share. This means Buffet's yield on cost is over 50%. He invested $1.3B in KO back in the late 80s and early 90s, and will now collect $654 million in income from the stock this year alone.",

Dorsey didn't even come across as an average CEO; he came across as \"THIS bum is the CEO of multi-billion dollar companies?

        "body": "&gt;that if we\u2019re faced with low growth and inflation expectations then this is where assets should be priced.\n\nBased on what model? Low growth + inflation implies higher real rates, which imply strong tightening of financial conditions. You think in that scenario stocks are priced rationally?\n\nThe whole narrative that stocks are expensive because yields are low should work both ways. If yields rise (due to inflation) stocks should then see a lot of selling, especially in longer duration exposures.\n\nLow growth + inflation expectations, if that were to actually occur, implies heavy P/E contraction in the coming years. That's assuming those expectations are actually discounting the correct things which they very well may not be.\n\nThat either gives you a 1970's type scenario, in which bonds get wrecked and stocks tread water relative to inflation, or more of a depression type deflationary scenario, in which case stocks **surely** are not priced properly.\n\nThe issue with any inflationary scenario is that if it truly gets going in any form (scenario 1 here where we see something similar to the 70's), we're in for a lot more trouble than we can handle. There is far too much debt for the economy to handle inflation pressures, and any increase in bond yields will result in massive tightening of financial conditions. That scenario likely ends up leading into a deflationary spiral in the end. There is a reason we saw a 20% drawdown in 2018. The global economy simply can't handle rate increases which inflation would cause.\n\nAs for any comparison to the the 1970's, the macro environment then was far different than now - they had very strong demographics, very low non-public debt, and the inflation was largely based on **demand** along with a few supply shocks\\*\\*.\\*\\* Globally, we couldn't be more opposite of that right now.\n\nOverall, the only particularly great argument for valuations right now is that there simply are no other great alternatives, and there has been no need to de-leverage due to the ability to lower rates and keep yields at or below zero globally. This, and the fact that unlike 08', governments are doing their best to not allow defaults of major companies, which has kept the market at least relatively orderly and prevented forced de-leveraging.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the trigger for any real longer-term recession or depression of any sort will come from inflation rising past an ever-falling threshold of growth. The \"level\" of financial tightening represented by yields has been falling for 40 years.\n\n* In 08', they over-tightened to the point where 5% caused the debt overburden to blow things up.\n* In 2018, 2.5% was getting far too tight, mandating emergency rate cuts going into 2019.\n\nNow? Debt burdens have expanded drastically post-covid, and banks are not lending very much at all. This causes a drawdown in supply, which increases overall inflation on a longer-term basis. So you get a scenario where the economy likely couldn't handle bond rates much past 1% (and that's being incredibly generous), yet the conditions for future inflation **relative to real growth** are growing.\n\nI certainly don't think the financial system is going to blow up tomorrow by any means, but we are getting close to the boundaries of the financial system to keep operating in the same way it has over the last 40 years, and any significant change, which becomes more likely the closer we get to those boundaries implies strong turbulence in the next 3-5 years.",

Reminds me of the \u201cunsinkable\u201d Titanic. It\u2019s delusional and needs to come back to reality. Not saying we need an insane crash but there shouldn\u2019t be an expectation that \u201cstocks only go up\u201d. If it weren\u2019t for QE and government stimulus, the market wouldn\u2019t be anywhere close to where it is today and you can\u2019t deny that. That is why saying it is overvalued is completely reasonable and actually logical.\n\nEdit: so because I changed one letter in the word stocks my entire post was removed? Very funny. Auto mods are a joke because they fail to understand context and instead remove posts simply for the use of certain words. All my points still stand.",

That\u2019s good news, but what do you do now? \n\nIf you think the market is set for a quick recovery, you probably pull the SPAC money out and put it into AAPL or AMZN, hoping for a 35% bounce. \n\nSo, in that case, you would have been better off in cash when the market was shaky. The SPAC (eg PIC) will recover, to at least $10 and probably more. But it won\u2019t give you a 35% recovery. So you\u2019ve essentially given up 5% for your capital for no reason. \n\n Now, if you think the market will be consistently bad, you might stick it out and try to play the quasi arbitrage game. The SPACs you purchase below their trust value might earn you 2-5% if a) the share price recovers, or b) you redeem your shares at the merger vote. \n\nIf the latter, that could be a long wait. If the former, the overall market is likely to recover more quickly than PIC. PIC will bounce back to $10 right away, but AAPL is likely to hit $120 before PIC hits $11. \n\nSo, that\u2019s sort of the paradox of SPACs as I see it. I\u2019m currently parked in QELL, DGNR, IPOF, CCIV, RBAC, RTP, and SOAC. \n\nIf the market stays choppy for a few for months, which is likely (I don\u2019t think we get any stimulus until Feb or so after a long drawn-out battle)... then SPACs might be a decent play... CCIV, SOAC, etc could announce a target and the price could jump 20% or more while the overall market is ranging. That\u2019s a win. \n\nBut if the market is really bad, they\u2019ll probably wait to announce an agreement, so you don\u2019t gain much there. And if the market does bounce back (eg sooner than expected stimulus), you\u2019re probably better off in AMZN.\n\nThe best SPAC play IMO is to be in cash in choppy market, and if/when the market plummets, scoop up warrants and units of the better SPACs at discounted prices (eg $9.50 for tier one units; sub $1 warrants for the best management team SPACs). \n\nBut then again, if you\u2019re able to time the market that well, you could buy SHOP or LULU at deep discounts and do just as well.",

Then you have increased expenses for housing and healthcare (US only).  There already is negative outflows for years and no one is talking about what happens as it accelerates as boomers retire.  The stock market started to go up significantly when the US switched from pension funds to 401k.  Granted there are other factors driving the economy but you now have a significant flow of new money into the market. \n\nBTW, bonds are sold in markets and auctions so if the rate is low that means a significant portion of the investment world thinks the economy isn't in great shape.  Have to ask yourself why are willing to lend money so cheaply.  The bond market is something like 3x bigger than the stock market.
