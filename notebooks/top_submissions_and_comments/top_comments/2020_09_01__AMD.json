Really the properties that matter for a chip (outside of just how good the design is) are the chip area (in mm^2), transistor count (which is a function of transistor size) and yield (which is a function of size &amp; process)",

        "body": "I've said it before and I'll say it again: why does anyone think AMD is a priced fairly at 40% the market cap of INTC, when AMD profited just $716M in the last 12 months vs Intel's $26B. It literally makes no sense. And I don't want to hear \"it's a growth story.\" Yes, that's true, but it's also all baked in by this point if that's the case. If you're buying into AMD at this level, you're basically saying to yourself that you expect AMD to grow profits by 14x from $700M to $10B just to match Intel on a comparable basis. And then the price would be fair and you'd have no logical upside. That's a massive \"What If\". Either Intel's profit is somehow less valuable, or AMD is vastly overpriced. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love AMD as a company and the products they produce. I have an AMD processor as part of my last upgrade. But the stock has gotten out of control. It just doesn't make sense anymore, so I sold in the 80s. I will look to start re-buying in the 50s because if $73 breaks, it's a long way down until the next area of support.",

        "body": "I am bullish on AMD but you have a very good chance of getting KANG GANGED trying to buy and hold calls now through both announcements in October. AMD tends to trade sideways within channels and those channels are wide enough to crush your 10% OTM options in a single day.\n\nI would recommend buying and playing the two events themselves, either day before (if you want to bet on a gap up) or day of. Buy weeklies and sell during the events. As we have seen from NVDA and AAPL recently, even very strong announcements get sold off in the short term and that selloff plus IV crush will destroy your profits 30 days out.\n\nI personally think the Zen3 event will be the bigger of the two. AMD will be launching CPUs that beat the best Intel has to offer, and probably at lower prices. Zen3 has the potential to be a huge leap forward.\n\nYour description of the NVDA \"battle\" is misguided in my view. NVDA is crushing AMD on market share and NVDA has the performance crown. With the very aggressive pricing of the 3080, NVDA has tried to cut AMD off at the knee because price:performance has been AMD's only selling point. The 30-series launch has been dramatic on Reddit, which is full of children who can't even afford shares, but it is actually a tremendously successful launch. NVDA cannot produce cards fast enough to meet what they've said was a 5-10x increase in demand over the 20-series at launch and initial inventory of both cards were similar. The \"huge driver issues\" have already been solved. The scalper/bot situation is bullish for NVDA because it shows demand is through the roof.\n\nConsoles are generally priced in, AMD inked those deals a long time ago.",
