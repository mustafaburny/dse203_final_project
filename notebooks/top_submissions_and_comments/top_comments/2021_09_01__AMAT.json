TSMC is building new fabs, Intel is building, GlobalFoundries is building, Samsung just announced increase in capital spending and they will profit from it in 2-3 years as this is on average how long it takes to finish a new fab. Right now the equipment makers will be the big winners on chip shortage. AMAT and LRCX are particularly undervalued. They sold off recently along with MU because they also supply DRAM equipment and there is suspicion in the industry DRAM cycle peaked. But their DRAM manufacturing equipment is less than 10% of portfolio. Moreover, new generation of DRAM goes 3D stacks which need new manufacturing equipment. So the whole industry will \ud83d\ude80",

ASML has been on a nice run so could just be a healthy pullback. ASML has an average analyst target of $911 so plenty of room to go according to them, but I just don\u2019t like the downgrades starting to happen with multiple companies. Just something to watch.",

Because I see FINTECH and semiconductors on here I have recommended those to you. \n\nAnother stock to research in materials is LWLG.
