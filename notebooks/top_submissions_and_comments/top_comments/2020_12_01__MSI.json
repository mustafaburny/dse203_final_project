        "body": "Kathuria was the public face for MirCorp, a joint venture with the Russian space agency aimed at privatizing space exploration. Los Angeles financial adviser Dennis Tito paid $20 million to go to the International Space Station in 2001, but the venture has since languished.\nDuring his time at MirCorp, Kathuria touted a $40 million agreement with NBC and the producer of the TV hit \"Survivor\" to devise a TV game show that would send the winner into orbit on the Russian Mir space station. But the deal fizzled after the aging Mir was deorbited by the Russians.\nKathuria also lists himself as president and co-founder of New World Telecom LLC, a firm that, according to one version of his resume, \"develops and operates major telecommunications and Internet projects throughout the world.\" He also previously listed himself as a founder of Koshika Telecom Ltd., \"which operates digital cellular mobile telephone services ... in India reaching 300 million consumers.\"\nCellular licenses revoked\nBut the cellular licenses, held in partnership by Kathuria's firms with an Indian company, were revoked by the government over a fee dispute. \"Koshika is not operational right now,\" Kathuria acknowledged.\nNew World Telecom was the beneficiary of U.S. Commerce Department help in getting permission to build a wireless telephone network in Albania. One Kathuria Web site asserts that his firm worked \"in partnership with Motorola, who has signed a letter of intent for $50 million,\" and that \"over $325 million will be spent on the project.\"\nBut a Motorola spokeswoman said the company simply agreed to sell Kathuria equipment if he could get financing. Ultimately, the deal with the Albanian government fell through, Kathuria acknowledged.\nKathuria previously has claimed that he co-founded X-Stream Networks Inc., an Internet service provider that became the third largest in the United Kingdom, and that he pioneered the concept of free Internet service. But Chris Sukornyk, who started X-Stream with his brother, said Kathuria was not a founder, \"did not help pioneer\" free Internet service, and never directly invested in the business. Kathuria's resume no longer refers to himself as a \"co-founder,\" but he maintains the company would not have survived without his help to line up financing.\nOne of Kathuria's higher-profile ventures was HealthCite, a Web site launched in August 2000 to deliver medical information to consumers and physicians. It attracted a $10 million investment from biotech giant Amgen and a $2.18 million loan from Enterasys Networks, a wireless equipment firm. It also hired Leo Burnett USA to provide marketing services.\nLittle more than a year later, Burnett filed suit in Cook County Circuit Court for breach of contract and eventually won a $155,000 judgment, which HealthCite is appealing.\nBy June 2002, HealthCite began laying off many of its two dozen or so employees. Even so, in November 2002, Kathuria supplied figures to reporters suggesting that HealthCite was the second-largest medical-interest site on the Internet. But the next month, Enterasys sued HealthCite for breach of contract and the firm told Maryland officials that it was broke.\n\"The company is not operating, has no employees, and has over $3 million in outstanding liabilities,\" wrote HealthCite president, Inderjote Kathuria, Kathuria's brother, in a letter to the Maryland attorney general.\nFirm sounds good on Web\nAs an offshoot of HealthCite, Kathuria created Agatal Inc., described in its Web site as \"a leading provider of wireless networks, network management services, health care information portals and broadband access solutions ... \"\nBut there is scant evidence that Agatal, or its successor firm, Vimani Wireless, has been providing much to anyone. Deals Kathuria touted in an Internet publication last November, involving wireless networks for a large insurance company and to build \"hotzones\" in Camden, N.J., never took place, he acknowledged.\nKathuria said an interviewer misunderstood him.\nOne former HealthCite official is Naiyer Imam, a Virginia radiologist who was Kathuria's roommate at Brown. Imam, who also chairs a firm that runs Kathuria's campaign Web site, was told by the World Intellectual Property Organization in July 2000 to give up rights to the \"burlingtoncoatfactory.net\" Internet domain name.\nThe ruling said Imam acted in \"bad faith\" for acquiring that domain name and others such as Izod, Liz Claiborne and Pepperidge Farm, with the intent of making a profit by selling them back to the companies that own those well-known brand names.\nImam and Kathuria currently are focused on a new business--a medical diagnostic imaging clinic chain, Medical Oasis Inc.\n\nKathuria has made different claims about the status of Medical Oasis in different versions of his resume. In one, he says it \"owns and operates chains\" of centers \"in partnership with Toshiba Corp. of Japan.\" Other versions of the resume describe Medical Oasis as \"positioned\" to become a leading chain of diagnostic centers and tout financial agreements with German technology conglomerate Siemens or Banco Popular, a Puerto Rican-based banking firm.\nBut officials with all three of those corporations say they have no financial agreements with Kathuria or his company. What's more, Kathuria conceded that the only functioning center connected to Medical Oasis was in Roanoke, Va., in which Imam claims partial ownership.\nKathuria is not only using his resume to try to win votes, but also to woo business partners.\nScott Seaberg, a vice president of Meridian Regional Imaging in Mundelein, said his firm has agreed to work with Medical Oasis to develop imaging centers in the upper Midwest.\nKey to the deal, he said, were Kathuria and his credentials.",
