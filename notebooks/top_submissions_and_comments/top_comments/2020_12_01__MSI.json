        "body": "That was a concern for myself personally moving forward to whether to place a stake in this company.  \nThere are 3 things which made me sold on CRSR moving forward.  \n1) Esports + Aggressive marketing - It's slowly gather more and more mainstream media attention, with major sports leagues putting in stakes and major corporations backing them as sponsors of teams and entire leagues. Corsair, along with MSI, AMD and NVIDIA have been the leaders in leading the fronts of aggressively marketing in this niche market with a  lot of potential. What's Corsair lacked prior was its brand name as Corsair has always been a great product going back as early as 2010s but known to only handful of PC Enthusiasts. It's becoming a more of a household name and brand recognition goes a  long way in terms of  generating revenue moving forward.   \n\n\n2) Tech Growth + Monopolization in a niche PC Part area - AMD|NVIDIA going head to head on releasing the latest graphic cards and improving their chip sets, the underlying factor is the necessary components that come with running these newest cards (Ram + Power Supply). In the RAM department, Kingston HyperX and Corsair have been the two leaders of RAM making and Corsair is starting to pull ahead as the best mid-high tier RAM to go to especially with its \"Corsair Dominator PLatinum RGB\".  \n\n\nIn the Power Supply market, Corsair is also to pull ahead as \"The\" power supply needed to require to run the powerful chipsets and starting to take monopoly in this field.  \n\n\n3) The Wild Card: What was interesting about the Q3 presentation was its sinking its money into coaching/training people to become streamers on such popular platforms as Youtube/Twitch, a market which took off within the past few years and really taking off with Covid by acquiring \"Gamer Sensei\". I'm interested how popular and how much revenue they can extract from this since they're the first large scale company to tap into this market. Q4 would give a better estimation on how this is going.  \n\n\n\\-----------------------------------------  \n\n\nWith that said, nothing is certain and I'm not sure. based on what you said, may hold true but even if what you said was true, it would be wise to invest in Corsair for the next few quarters knowing that CoVid is still rampant right now, in a world full of lockdowns and a  Q4 coming up with Christmas Sales + BF/CM sales included, no?",

But there are a lot of parallels.\n\nFor one, you underestimate how hard it is to make electric cars. First model s was launched in 2012, its been 8 years and even now, there aren\u2019t half decent equivalents from European car companies that can compete with the model s. Ever wondered why?\n\n\nThe meat behind electric cars is electronics, software and AI like self driving technology. Tesla was born in the part of the world that is the best at all of this. Europe is decades behind on AI, Machine learning compared to Silicon Valley, VW has no hopes of catching up to google/tesla with self driving tech. Silicon Valley is bloody good with electronics, Europe is not close. China is pretty close to Silicon Valley and that\u2019s why you see nio, xpeng etc get the hype. \n\nNext VW is coming from China. Tesla is the Ford/GM of the 60s from the US. Europe is falling behind because all the core technologies required to make great electric cars are not their strengths.",

        "body": "Kathuria was the public face for MirCorp, a joint venture with the Russian space agency aimed at privatizing space exploration. Los Angeles financial adviser Dennis Tito paid $20 million to go to the International Space Station in 2001, but the venture has since languished.\nDuring his time at MirCorp, Kathuria touted a $40 million agreement with NBC and the producer of the TV hit \"Survivor\" to devise a TV game show that would send the winner into orbit on the Russian Mir space station. But the deal fizzled after the aging Mir was deorbited by the Russians.\nKathuria also lists himself as president and co-founder of New World Telecom LLC, a firm that, according to one version of his resume, \"develops and operates major telecommunications and Internet projects throughout the world.\" He also previously listed himself as a founder of Koshika Telecom Ltd., \"which operates digital cellular mobile telephone services ... in India reaching 300 million consumers.\"\nCellular licenses revoked\nBut the cellular licenses, held in partnership by Kathuria's firms with an Indian company, were revoked by the government over a fee dispute. \"Koshika is not operational right now,\" Kathuria acknowledged.\nNew World Telecom was the beneficiary of U.S. Commerce Department help in getting permission to build a wireless telephone network in Albania. One Kathuria Web site asserts that his firm worked \"in partnership with Motorola, who has signed a letter of intent for $50 million,\" and that \"over $325 million will be spent on the project.\"\nBut a Motorola spokeswoman said the company simply agreed to sell Kathuria equipment if he could get financing. Ultimately, the deal with the Albanian government fell through, Kathuria acknowledged.\nKathuria previously has claimed that he co-founded X-Stream Networks Inc., an Internet service provider that became the third largest in the United Kingdom, and that he pioneered the concept of free Internet service. But Chris Sukornyk, who started X-Stream with his brother, said Kathuria was not a founder, \"did not help pioneer\" free Internet service, and never directly invested in the business. Kathuria's resume no longer refers to himself as a \"co-founder,\" but he maintains the company would not have survived without his help to line up financing.\nOne of Kathuria's higher-profile ventures was HealthCite, a Web site launched in August 2000 to deliver medical information to consumers and physicians. It attracted a $10 million investment from biotech giant Amgen and a $2.18 million loan from Enterasys Networks, a wireless equipment firm. It also hired Leo Burnett USA to provide marketing services.\nLittle more than a year later, Burnett filed suit in Cook County Circuit Court for breach of contract and eventually won a $155,000 judgment, which HealthCite is appealing.\nBy June 2002, HealthCite began laying off many of its two dozen or so employees. Even so, in November 2002, Kathuria supplied figures to reporters suggesting that HealthCite was the second-largest medical-interest site on the Internet. But the next month, Enterasys sued HealthCite for breach of contract and the firm told Maryland officials that it was broke.\n\"The company is not operating, has no employees, and has over $3 million in outstanding liabilities,\" wrote HealthCite president, Inderjote Kathuria, Kathuria's brother, in a letter to the Maryland attorney general.\nFirm sounds good on Web\nAs an offshoot of HealthCite, Kathuria created Agatal Inc., described in its Web site as \"a leading provider of wireless networks, network management services, health care information portals and broadband access solutions ... \"\nBut there is scant evidence that Agatal, or its successor firm, Vimani Wireless, has been providing much to anyone. Deals Kathuria touted in an Internet publication last November, involving wireless networks for a large insurance company and to build \"hotzones\" in Camden, N.J., never took place, he acknowledged.\nKathuria said an interviewer misunderstood him.\nOne former HealthCite official is Naiyer Imam, a Virginia radiologist who was Kathuria's roommate at Brown. Imam, who also chairs a firm that runs Kathuria's campaign Web site, was told by the World Intellectual Property Organization in July 2000 to give up rights to the \"burlingtoncoatfactory.net\" Internet domain name.\nThe ruling said Imam acted in \"bad faith\" for acquiring that domain name and others such as Izod, Liz Claiborne and Pepperidge Farm, with the intent of making a profit by selling them back to the companies that own those well-known brand names.\nImam and Kathuria currently are focused on a new business--a medical diagnostic imaging clinic chain, Medical Oasis Inc.\n\nKathuria has made different claims about the status of Medical Oasis in different versions of his resume. In one, he says it \"owns and operates chains\" of centers \"in partnership with Toshiba Corp. of Japan.\" Other versions of the resume describe Medical Oasis as \"positioned\" to become a leading chain of diagnostic centers and tout financial agreements with German technology conglomerate Siemens or Banco Popular, a Puerto Rican-based banking firm.\nBut officials with all three of those corporations say they have no financial agreements with Kathuria or his company. What's more, Kathuria conceded that the only functioning center connected to Medical Oasis was in Roanoke, Va., in which Imam claims partial ownership.\nKathuria is not only using his resume to try to win votes, but also to woo business partners.\nScott Seaberg, a vice president of Meridian Regional Imaging in Mundelein, said his firm has agreed to work with Medical Oasis to develop imaging centers in the upper Midwest.\nKey to the deal, he said, were Kathuria and his credentials.",

        "body": "I bought AAPL in March 2009. I knew I wanted to invest in 2006 when the iPhone was just a rumour, but I figured the housing bubble would crash the markets and they did. I also bought small amounts of GOOG and AMZN.\n\nMy methodology then and now is to look for a great company that's the dominant leader in a sector that's about to take over the world. \n\nThe iPhone in 2009 didn't have the most marketshare. But it was the best, most innovative smartphone with the best ecosystem around it. That gave AAPL the largest profit share \u2014 it still has about 2/3rds of global smartphone profits today.\n\nThat's important because many tech sectors today are winner-take-all or winner-take-most. If you invested in a diversified portfolio of smartphone makers, you'd have piles of crap with Blackberry, Nokia, Motorola, HTC, etc. \n\nGlobally dominant companies like AAPL are rare, so I stay patient and don't chase companies that aren't. I didn't add or subtract any companies to or from my portfolio for ten years.\n\nBut now, 70% of my portfolio is in TSLA. The parallels with 2009 AAPL are uncanny. TSLA dominates the EV market and is the only car company that doesn't sell EVs at a loss. No other EV can match a Tesla's performance for the price, even while selling at a loss.\n\nThe EV market is guaranteed to explode in the next 10 years, as many countries are banning internal combustion car sales by 2035 or 2040. They're literally making TSLA's competitors illegal.\n\nAnd that's not counting TSLA's leadership in the autonomous car space, and the clean energy sector (solar power + mass battery storage).\n\nJust like AAPL was the clear winner in the smartphone market, TSLA is the clear winner in the EV / autonomous car / clean energy markets. \n\n-------\n\nThe other area I'm investing in now is genomics \ud83e\uddec. It's much more speculative, with loads more uncertainty in the sector. Genetic medicine will for sure have explosive growth, but the science is full of unknowns and a company can implode with just one bad clinical trial. So picking individual stocks is much riskier than picking stocks in IT, social media, etc.\n\nMy two main genomics stocks are my top performers in the latter half of 2020 \u2014 outperforming even TSLA. But I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who doesn't know the sector and understand the risks.\n\nMost people would be better off investing in ARKG, Ark Invest's terrific genomics ETF.",
