This isn't just securities fraud, it's fraud on a whole different spectrum. If you were to tweet \"PLTR is going bankrupt in 30 days\" from meta-cognizant, just like the fucker in Craig did, you would be fine.\n\nSEC v. McKeown = fucking idiots who were literally compensated by the companies that they were pumping (manipulation based on incentives from the actual fucking fraudulent company should scream no-no to you) and dumping.\n\nNot even close to what we have here.

Big ones right off the bat are the Energy/EV sector (TSLA, ENPH, PLUG, NIO, etc.), the Genomics sector (EDIT, CRSPR, FATE, PACB), some tech/cloud (APPS, SE, FVRR), and some miscellaneous stocks (PENN!!!, RICK, CELH) etc. Genomics and EV specifically because they are supposedly the future. No doubt they are but that's what everyone was saying about the internet back in 1999, 2000, and it really took about 10 years for those stocks that crashed but survived to *really* get going (MSFT, ADBE, AMZN, PCLN, etc.), some haven't even recovered still, such as Cisco and MicroStrategy.\n\nDo keep in mind that the DOW has risen 12k+ points in just 10 months and some bubbles have already popped or on the decline (think NKLA or ZM).\n\nWhen you say \"everyone\", do you mean people on this subreddit or people in your daily life? I've noticed on these forums people are a bit more cognizant of what's going on, so they know that a lot of these valuations don't make sense but in the outside world, I know and have heard of plenty of people buying stocks on Robinhood because \"BuY tHe DiP!!\" is constantly blasted on social media and through word of mouth. For example, I know someone who bought US Foods on Robinhood for no particular reason. \n\nThese stocks go down once:\n\nA. Fed decides to increase interest rates\n\nB.

        "body": "Hello, \n\nJust wanted to get some advice here I have some ideas, but thought I\u2019d reach out. So my mother is transferring her 401k from her previous employer and I will manage it for her. I wanted to get some thoughts on asset allocation. \n\nHer scenario is she doesn\u2019t need this money within the next 10 years at least. She is still working self employed. She is 60 doesn\u2019t have any debt has other passive income (rentals), cure t holding are random funds her employer had with mass mutual they will be liquidated into cash and put into a traditional Roth. Risk tolerance I would say a 5 out of 10 (10 being very risky).\n\nMy thoughts where to select a handful of dividend stocks for 50-60% i like names such as jnj, mmm, xom, T, pg, Abbv, csco, ibm (trying to stick with dividend champion companies that are reasonably priced now..) etc and then the remaining 20% would be in a couple vanguard bond funds and remaining 20% in a vanguard s&amp;p fund. \n\nAny inout would be great this isn\u2019t her complete retirement fund it is a small portion and 1 of 3 of her retirement accounts. \n\nThanks,",

(I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",

        "body": "Ok, let's talk about Tesla.\n\nFor the record, I do not own any Tesla stock, nor do I own a Tesla car, nor do I plan to own either in the foreseeable future. (I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",
