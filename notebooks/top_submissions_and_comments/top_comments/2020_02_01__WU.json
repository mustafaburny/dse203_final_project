IE, it never has had any real capability of being a pandemic because the transmissability of it is far too low in any country with a westernized medicine system.\n\nBird flu never picked up human to human contagion in any meaningful way.\n\nAids? Aids is definitely a real and problematic disease, and it did become a pandemic essentially. But the 10 year incubation period makes it such that it's not  so immediately economically disruptive. It also isn't nearly as transmissible as the new coronavirus still.\n\nSars was a very real risk and threat no doubt, but you can look at the data and see how much more terrifying the Wuhan Coronavirus is already... The #'s blow away Sars already.\n\n**Just being logical here, the Wu-Flu has...**\n\n* Contagion levels on par with most major pandemics across history (most models give it a r0 within the range of 2-4, but data is not great right now). \n* Mortality rate enough to cause a lot of serious damage. Data is tough to figure out here, but the ratio of deaths to recoveries from the data we do have is a bit worrying.\n* No known cure or vaccine right now. \n* Potential of being spreadable from people with mild symptoms.\n\nFWIW, r0 and mortality rate right now are both believed to be higher than what the spanish flu of 1918 was which killed millions. \n\n**Could this Peter Out?**\n\nYup, of course it could. I'm not saying we are 100% going to be facing a global catastrophe here or anything. But at the same point, markets shooting to new all time highs to me points out that people are 100% overlooking this, meanwhile China is in full-blown panic mode. Somewhere, risk is not being priced in effectively. Even if the disease never becomes problematic, the measures that are needed to prevent its spread will be highly damaging economically.",

Also think about cost of utilities (is well insulated, is an old house or new house) you can get the costs for the year from the seller, real estate agent or the utility company. also the cost of taxes, yard maintenance.  I think the housing market is relative as far as going up or down. I feel the pricing of the house will be more dependent on comparables near it and days on the market as well as the sellers position.  You would be amazed how much you can negotiate if you have an eager seller.\n\n I would look at several houses that have all of the things you are looking for to get a feel for pricing.  This should give you an idea of what the market is for example, a 3 br house with garage, 2 ba etc.  Check out the neighborhoods in the day and at night.\n\nAlso do some research and think about what type of house you want.  Fixer upper....little bit of work needed or move in ready.  There are pro's and con's to both.",

By the way, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with the internet now due to the removal of Net Neutrality laws. \n\nIf healthcare was not private, prescription drugs would be more affordable because you wouldn\u2019t have lobbies in Washington creating laws that prevent competition. Did you notice that it\u2019s illegal to import drugs? Why isn\u2019t it illegal to import engine parts then? Or soy beans?\n\nSame with housing. If housing was a non profit business because a minimum amount of feelings would be built for people to live in, you could still be paying extra for a nicer home but you wouldn\u2019t be forced to pay $4,000 for a 1-BR apartment just because you work in a densely populated area (Look up rentals in San Jose CA and you\u2019ll know I\u2019m not making this up).\n\nAs long as retiring generations finance their life style through stock market investment, we will have engineered inflation because without it there would be no growth.",

A year ago they had no viable offerings for a good CPU (fx was dated af and not a contender, dont tell me about the fx series as an offering) and their best GPUs were weaker and not as cost effective as nVidias. The best they had was low to medium performance options for both markets. This has been their position with respect of Intel and nVidia for a long time. Now their CPUs are king and their GPUs are competitive, even lacking a flagship as powerful as the 2080 or 2080ti. \n\nThey have rapidly transitioned from a sustained underdog position to a real tooth and nail competitor. If we assume that this trend will continue does it not stand to reason that their share price should also continue to perform as they seize a greater market share?\n\nThis of course says nothing about server and console hardware, which im less familiar with but i hear they're doing well in those sectors as well.",

But TD, having an actual risk &amp; compliance dept isn't just going to hand you the keys to the kingdom that easy.\n\nWhen I first got started with them I called up and spoke to the compliance dept directly and told them I was into trading futures (which requires Lv 3) and they pushed the button for me, NBD.\n\nI recommend the same approach. Yes, they have a risk dept, but they all want to take ur money from you and want to help you give it to them in the way that makes you most comfortable.\n\nWhat they won't budge on is the min balance of $1500 to trade Lv 3 tho.\n\nGL",

What's the practical purpose of downloading 20 movies in an hour?  We only need the ability to download one movie in the time it takes to watch... one movie.  And we've had that for years.\n\nIt's similar with 4K and 8k and 12K tv's.  If your eyes can't resolve a difference and the content is all at 0.5K, what's the point in paying double and getting sound quality that predictable when the tv speaker is the size of my IUD.\n\nWake me when 6G or 15G or whatever comes along that can make a cell phone battery charge last a couple weeks, like they used to in 2002.  Or when it can give GPS location down to the nearest inch of 5000 personal items including my car keys and brow tweezers.  Or when it can read the insides of my arteries and allow life saving intervention without surgical or radioactive diagnostics.  Or when it can focus its idle EMF on inflamed cells to shrink tumors.  \n\nUntil then, 5G is just a fast connection to sites that are just getting slower because of bloat and ad tracking.",
