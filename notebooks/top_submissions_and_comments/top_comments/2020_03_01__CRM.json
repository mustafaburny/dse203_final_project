My only advice is to cut your losses and don't be ashamed or afraid to ask for help, even if it's reaching out to your fellow autists.

I have low risk/long term accounts, and a high risk account.\n\nIn one of my accounts, I first did a play on Beyond Meat. They tripled revenue expectations and slightly missed EPS. The stock fucking tanked harder than SPCE and TLRY. How does this make sense? It doesn't.\n\nAfter this, I went to another play, Salesforce. They did just okay, but dropped 7%. Fine, fair enough. Moved on to Cardlytics.\n\nNow, cardlytics. Here is the little sugar dusted fucking cherry on top of the mother of all cakes. \n\nAll the analysts gave them buy and up ratings leading to the earnings. They had been on a tremendous growth run, raising EPS every quarter. And on this particular, Q4 quarter, they succesfully beat EPS and earnings. They did *fucking great*. But wait! The CEO is uncertain about the future. In the 10K released with the earnings, he states he doesn't think the company will *ever* be able to deliver a quarter that good again, issues guidance of 30% less than the last equivalent quarter, and announces he is stepping down.\n\nThe stock didn't go up. It tanked. How much? 10? 15? Keep going! It *opened -35%.* I exited for the hills and watched in astonishment as it finished the day at -40%.\n\nAfter this, I thought, what the hell could go worse? Even perfectly good plays were bad mojo.\n\nAMD had their analyst day. I knew AMD had already prepared for supply disruptions during Trump's trade war with China during the previous summer. Sure enough, Lisa Su walked on stage, and said everything would be fine. No supply disruptions, and guess what! Some sexy brand new GPUs are on the way. It went up 6% after hours.\n\nWake up the next morning, and not only is it not up 6%, it's fucking down 2% from the previous day's close because of market panic.\n\nSomehow, after feeling like the margin account in question has been cursed by some power, with the amount of time I spent on DD on some of the plays, I'd rather have lost it all in a ridiculous JNUG play.",

        "body": "Full disclosure, I'm long $SHOP and got in several times during the run up from $300 to $400. It might be down in the short term as it's up a staggering amount LTM, but I wouldn't bet against it in the long-term.\n\nHere's my thesis:\n\nFirst, market dynamics. E-commerce continues to be the way business is done in retail. It's growing in double digits YoY and continues to take share. Shopify's got a pretty sticky/recurring revenue base. Brick and mortar retail -- and specifically mall-based retailers, particularly in the US -- are getting hammered (e.g. see Sears, Macy's, K-Mart, Forever 21, etc.). Malls in the US have been crushed recently, and the big names like SPG and Washington Prime are continually making rent concessions to keep retailers in their malls as they lose anchor tenants.\n\nShopify fills an adjacent need that Amazon doesn't fill, and Amazon even exited the market that Shopify operates in around ~Sept. 2015 and announced a partnership with them. SHOP provides a full end-to-end factory-to-consumer platform. It basically opens the window for small and mid-sized businesses to enter the e-commerce market at a not-too-unreasonable cost, which is huge as trends continue to shift in that direction, and SHOP is good at aligning its customers' financial goals with their own, which is highly compelling imo.\n\nThey're also making a ton of investments in their supply chain/logistics infrastructure. Their tech stack is probably best in class, plugs in with a lot of legacy ERP/CRM/MRP platforms (e.g. SAP) that allow it to bolt on to any company's existing enterprise stack. Shopify's platform is much better than many of its peers. It still only does ~$2bn in revenue, though it's already profitable on an adjusted basis.\n\nI'm by no means saying it's the next Amazon, but I could see it being a $200bn market cap company over the coming 5-7 years. I think it's a good long-term buy, though to your point, it has run-up considerably lately.\n\nThey're also always very cautious on earnings guidance, and consistently beat, so consensus estimates are always at the top end of the range. If they miss that in any of the coming quarters, expect a sharp pullback.\n\ne: spelling and added a few things",

        "body": "I'm kinda surprised to see comments about Boeing and Starbucks. Boeing seems destined for a GM-style bailout given the fact they're a military contractor whose civilian sector has been making mistake after mistake.  Starbucks is also planning a 40 million share buyback, and both these events are gonna see a lot of investors holding the bag.\n\nWith that in mind, I do feel tempted to go long on some companies (just not SBUX or BA).  Here's what's on my watchlist:\n\n* Disney (DIS): It's a media Goliath that is diversified and one I already own shares of. Can't see how they can't roar back once Covid clears)\n* Salesforce (CRM): Lots of companies rely on Salesforce's suites of products for their Sales and Marketing departments. Their products are also virus-resistant and industry-leading in what they do.\n* Crown Castle (CCI): 5G is the future of internet connectivity and places around the world will want to ensure their cell towers are up to the task. CCI offers a nice dividend and is slightly cheaper than AMT,  all while offering similar high quality cell towers that people would feel comfortable in investing in.",

I've proposed moving all of our ops to the cloud a dozen or so times over the last few years, and the execs have always shot down the idea. Maybe they'll be more receptive to it in a few months, but I doubt it. Until the cloud providers (AMZN, MSFT, GOOG) start doing it themselves, few others will. It's a huge operational undertaking that's pretty unproven and has much at stake. Imo, most execs are more risk adverse than forward thinking.

        "body": "So the point of that post (which was 2 weeks ago when we were like 2400) was mainly saying I think 2200-2300 is a fairly good long term bottom (I used 2250 a lot since that's a gamma bound), in which if we do go back, I would start aggressively buying at that region the good stocks (good stocks! like MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, NKE, even DIS, MCD who have been hit hard, etc., not some random stock).\n\nIt's entirely possible we go back to 2250 actually.  People shouldn't underestimate that.  The put skews are quite high right now still, but I don't believe 2200-2300 is going to be easy to break whatsoever, and thus is why I thought that could be a long term bottom.  However, since no one knows if we go back again (or even possibly lower like 1800 like some doom and gloom people), the strategy shouldn't just be to load all up at once at some arbitrary bottom no ones know if we'll even reach.\n\nMy hypothesis is the more aggressively it sells off, the more you should be buying.  Like today is NOT a good day to buy that much.  If you wanted MSFT, you should have done it last week.  But you can still buy a bit here and there on green days, but just aggress your buying into good stocks when we go down aggressively, since there will be down days (and multiple down days in a row) in this market.  This isn't like earlier this year before the virus where every day is like green.\n\nAlso I don't believe bounce back will be sudden, so you have plenty of time to buy before we reach close to ATH.  However my main hypothesis was 2200-2300 is a fairly good long term bottom so if we go back there again, I would load up once more there, but still buy even before we (if we) reach there.\n\nPlenty of good stocks in every industry.  Tech is like littered with so many good stocks that have been hit hard.  The usual QQQ top weights of course, but you can even go with CRM or ADBE if you don't wanna go with the usual MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, etc.  AAPL is good too although has more short term instability. But other sectors, there are so many blue bloods in those sectors who have been hit hard for no reason.  DIS might be the best example of one of these.  It's essentially impossible that stock will be lower than where it is 3 years from now.",
