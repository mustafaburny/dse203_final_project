If you miss out on this small handful of stocks you'll underperform over time. The overperforming stocks are NOT static, at one point the highest returning stocks included GE, IBM, Sears, and other market laggards, while currently successful stock like Apple and Microsoft languished for decades.",

So I will be around so long there are investors willing to keep the company running.\n\nAs for the eV controversial giant, this is not quite finished. Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money. Seagate was dismissed in 1997, sue again and paid [$45 M to R+ as late as 2000](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/seagate-to-pay-rodime-45m-to-settle-suit-2000-01/).   R+ only exists as a shell company and its share price soared on news of the patent settlement.  I think **NKLA** can remain as a shell company with its patent portfolio covering designs that covers most vehicles built electric or not. [It sue Tsla earlier](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/04/20/teslas-effort-to-short-circuit-nikola-lawsuit-fizzles-as-patent-office-denies-door-argument/?sh=44dc21a45d78). That Tesla copied NKLA on shield, cab shape and windshield design sued for $2B. If you think you will prosper you can bag hold your stocks.",

IBM was a computer company.\n\nThe brilliance of MSFT was in - and this seems weird today - realizing that a company could make money just selling software. A ton of money. More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",
