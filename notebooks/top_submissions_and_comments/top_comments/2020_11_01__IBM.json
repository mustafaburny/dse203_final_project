Gates's mom served on a charitable board with the CEO of IBM; they were more associates than friends, and that wouldn't have helped Gates at all if he hadn't already, you know, founded MS. \n\nElon's family didn't own an emerald mine, and he was $100k in debt when he graduated college. \n\nMeritocracy just means that merit - mostly in the sense of skills - is rewarded. It doesn't mean that everyone necessarily has an equal chance. \n\nIf a company needs and engineer and I have an engineering degree, and you don't - maybe because you had an abusive family growing up wit a father in prison and so never graduated from HS, the company is hiring me *on merit*. I'm an engineer; you're not; you can't do the job. \n\nThis doesn't mean that if our lives were switched at age 3 I would have done any better; that's just a separate question from meritocracy. \n\nI mean, if a company needs someone who speaks French, and my wealthy family summered in France every year and sent me there one a gap year and then on a junior year abroad...while you took French in HS...merit means I get the job *even though* I was only able to obtain my qualifications because my family was rich enough to keep sending me to France. \n\nBut the company isn't hiring me because of who I am, but because of what I can do, and that I can do it better than you can.",

First, comparison to the Leidos, CACI, BAH, IBM, HPE etc. of the government consulting world. They too employ a lot of talent. What is the difference with PLTR? Second, government consulting is often a \"customer intimate\" model, not quality leadership. Govt says it wants high tech, but they often buy those companies who understand them most. Which model is PLTR using? Why will PLTR succeed in Govt? Is it primarily IC?\n\nThird, if PLTR has silicon valley magic in it, then why is the commercial business not taking off? If you have a superior value proposition, that will be reflected in high margins and a kind of inevitability of customers who are drawn to your products. A weakness there would make me pause.",

Standard Oil in the early 1900s, IBM when mainframes were everything. Capital is so cheap right now that it's easy for startups to get funds. It may not seem like it but consumers will switch for better products or ways of doing things. Brands don't last forever and companies become more and more difficult to manage as their size increases.\n\nAlso don't forget the world is much bigger than just the US. China and other large developed countries are full of brilliant people, lots of access to capital. How long until Alibaba has boots on the ground in USA and starts aggressively pressuring Amazon?\n\nMy guess is that eventually the government will put a stop to big tech simply buying out their competitors. It's already a bipartisan talking point.",

        "body": "So the other response summed it up pretty well, but left one other important factor out. The importance of Intel's architecture is fading. It will always be around of course, but anyone that doesn't think ARM is going to keep getting a larger and larger bite of the pie isn't paying attention. Apple will give everyone permission to target software for ARM architecture and we'll soon see a second attempt from Microsoft. Again, we'll always have applications for Intel, but it won't be nearly as dominant. Intel's production woes over the past half decade are well documented, and it's clear that they are about as well run as Boeing these days. The problem for Intel is that they face much more fierce competition than Boeing. Intel will survive of course, but they'll be a shell of their former self, and they'll have fumbled their flagship products and missed the boat on the areas of the industry that are sure to see rapid growth. I understand that people want to target value, but Intel is priced the way they are for good reason. If you're looking for value in Intel then I have some IBM stock to sell you as well.",

Personally even if they have no product or schedule they will linger around awhile. They can use their patents sue every manufacturer in eV and often they generate revenue from those manufacturers as hush up money.\n\nSome years ago, a hard disk manufacturer making 3.5\" hard drive business was failing. It had a strong intellectual property department sued every hard disk manufacturer in the 3.5\" drive claiming patient infringement. In 1990 IBM was hit with a lawsuit as an inventor of the drive and sue by a smaller player. It paid some hush money. Seagate was dismissed in 1997, sue again and paid [$45 M to R+ as late as 2000](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/seagate-to-pay-rodime-45m-to-settle-suit-2000-01/).   R+ only exists as a shell company and its share price soared on news of the patent settlement.  I think **NKLA** can remain as a shell company with its patent portfolio covering designs that covers most vehicles built electric or not.

More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",

I agree cryptocurrency and blockchains are useful but I don't see Bitcoin as a long term store of value. It's far more volatile than precious metals and also intangible.\n\nIBM is making huge strides towards quantum computing, and once they pull it off, Bitcoin will become worthless once the public/private key cryptography is cracked and anyone with access to a quantum computer can simply sign transactions to send coins to themselves.

For example Cathy Wood said she would\u2019ve put a lot more into Tesla but because of rules and regulations the max she can invest is ~10% per fund she manages. \n\n\nIndividual investors can definitely beat the market by having a concentrated portfolio. Knowing the stock that they own intimately and not letting emotions get involved. \n\nThere are quite a few people who have a concentrated portfolio on 3-4 companies like Square, peloton, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, AMD and so forth. And they have all outperformed the market over 5-10 years. \n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance then buying single stocks can be worth it.",

        "body": "Agreed, but one thing I will add is this... when the market drops big often times it\u2019s hard to look at your account it\u2019s frustrating and you almost want to ignore it, or forget about it like a bad grade, relationship, bill or anything else that causes anxiety...  but it\u2019s at this time you need to calm your emotions and spend more time researching and critically thinking about your account.\n\nAlso you will have big losses, and it\u2019s hard to sell those even though there is much better places for your money.  One of the examples I will give you is from me personally this year.  I had 25% my account in BAC-K.  This is a preferred callable stock that trades around $25 and pays 7% dividend payment.  When the market crashed this \u201ccrashed\u201d too.  It dropped to $20 (a 20% drop) and I was pissed cause it shouldn\u2019t have moved that much cause I knew BAC was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders.  As much as I didn\u2019t want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to $25 pretty easily I had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money.  Companies like MSFT, AAPL, and other amazing companies dropped 35-50%... this was an opportunity I wouldn\u2019t get again and as hard as it was I had to realize I had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity.  So I knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20% at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term.\n\nTLDR when shit hits the fan it\u2019s natural to pull out or ignore your account, but you have to fight that urge.  It\u2019s at that time you double down on research and evaluating your financial situation.",

So, if your purchase price for MSFT shows your actual strike price of the put (207.50), then that $300 premium just went into your account (as cash proceeds) but not counted as a P&amp;L because it's not tied to the underlying performance.\n\nmake sense? basically, if you now sell MSFT at 204.50, you've broken even (if you include proceeds from the premium). what you *should* do is now sell a CC a couple strikes above where MSFT is.\n\ngood luck have fun",

        "body": "Hello, I am looking for some advice on a potential portfolio allocation that I am considering. I am a new college graduate looking to begin investing. Before I list out the portfolio I am considering, please see my answers to the relevant information questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How old are you? **23**\n* Are you employed/making income? How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

It will always be around of course, but anyone that doesn't think ARM is going to keep getting a larger and larger bite of the pie isn't paying attention. Apple will give everyone permission to target software for ARM architecture and we'll soon see a second attempt from Microsoft. Again, we'll always have applications for Intel, but it won't be nearly as dominant. Intel's production woes over the past half decade are well documented, and it's clear that they are about as well run as Boeing these days. The problem for Intel is that they face much more fierce competition than Boeing. Intel will survive of course, but they'll be a shell of their former self, and they'll have fumbled their flagship products and missed the boat on the areas of the industry that are sure to see rapid growth. I understand that people want to target value, but Intel is priced the way they are for good reason. If you're looking for value in Intel then I have some IBM stock to sell you as well.",

Before I list out the portfolio I am considering, please see my answers to the relevant information questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How old are you? **23**\n* Are you employed/making income? How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

They're more momentum players than long-term holders, so I guess based on that alone they might buy Zoom (because everyone seems to be using it these days, and that can't be a bad thing as far as the price is concerned (for now anyway.)  \n\n\nThere was a lot of hype around Zoom, and when it appeared on a lot of people's radars it was a lot cheaper than it is now.  They would have likely bought in when they first started seeing all those ads for seminars on Zoom, and notices of schools being closed and having classes on Zoom.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out. I've replaced them with Pinterest in my portfolio as my new search/advertising stock. Social search is the future and I now see the genius advertising potential of the Pinterest platform; I see them stealing advertising dollars away from Google and growing much better than Google over the next 5 years.",

IBM was a computer company.\n\nThe brilliance of MSFT was in - and this seems weird today - realizing that a company could make money just selling software. A ton of money. More money than computer makers could make by themselves. This was a kind of radical idea at the time.\n\nJobs was very successful at the computer business; the Apple was the bestselling PC from 1977-1982.\n\nApple wasn't killed by MSFT, it was killed by IBM, which built a PC from more or less off the shelf parts allowing *anyone* to build a clone. (Which, incidentally, would run windows). \n\nApple's computers couldn't compete with PCs built with off the shelf parts. It's not about Jobs being bad; it's about other people being better.\n\nIBM's approach almost immediately priced *them* out of the PC market, leaving the profits to MSFT and intel (and a tiny bit for clone makers, who mostly ended up in a low margin commodity business).",

How much? **Yes, $110k/year salary**\n* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) **Potentially looking to go to business school in 2-5 years, but definitely looking to buy a house (in probably 5-10 years). Not sure how much of the returns from the market I will use on this vs. taking out a loan. So otherwise, I am looking for retirement savings**\n* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) **I've got a long time horizon so my tolerance is fairly high**\n* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?) **None**\n* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other? **$20k in cash, plus I am looking to invest at least half of my salary this year since I am living with my parents and have no expenses.**\n* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? **I am prepared to hold onto my investments up until retirement, though I MIGHT want to take some money out to pay for business school/house**\n* Any big debts? **None**\n* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. **None**\n\nThe allocation I am considering is:\n\nS&amp;P 500 - 30%\n\nVWIGX (Vanguard International Growth ETF) - 15%\n\nVDADX (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF) - 15%\n\nQQQ (Tracks NASDAQ 100) - 20%\n\nWCLD (Bessemer Cloud Computing ETF) - 5%\n\nFINX (Fintech ETF) - 5%\n\nAAPL - 5%\n\nMSFT - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n1) given my goals and time horizons, is this too aggressive an allocation?\n\n2) am I missing any categories in which I should be diversified?\n\n3) for paying for business school ($200k-$250k if I decide to go) and buying a house down the line, does it make sense to liquidate some of what I will have in the market by then and take out a loan for the rest, or should I just leave it in the market and take out a loan for the full amount?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

        "body": "Nvidia is a safe investment in the long run (they might go down a bit this month though due to AMD, but overall Nvidia has went up consistently over the past 5 years and has shown no signs of deviating significantly from that), Microsoft is safe, Tesla is too scary for me personally. I don't buy ETFs or evaluate them, I evaluate individual stocks then choose whether or not I would like to purchase them. I play for large short term gains (large relative to my investment portfolio and short meaning a few months typically). I've made a 17.49% profit in the past 2 weeks (starting with 2k) due to making \"all in\" bets on Corsair (to be clear to do this I was incredibly confident it was going to go up, but I definitely wouldn't advise it if you do not need the money, I have a stupidly low retirement target). Corsair was likely my most risky investment that's why I left quickly. AMD and TSMC are great investments for a couple of years, probably 3 years or more (TSMC almost definitely 3 years or more since they make the most powerful CPUs that go in the new Xbox, PS5, AMD CPUs, Apple CPUs, and they even have Intel waiting in line since their factories are all in use). You'll almost definitely hate my diversity, but I'm likely going to buy all AMD and TSMC (In my opinion diversity is for people who don't know much about the market they are invested in or don't feel like keeping up with the news). If I were to make a more long-term safer account I'd buy NVidia, Apple, AMD, and TSMC (Diversification in different sectors doesn't help if the entire market goes down, and I don't believe these specific tech stocks have exited a year down for the past decade (I know at least for the past 5 years they haven't), except for AMD which completely changed as a company). I'm putting all of my money on AMD and TSMC once the market opens tomorrow (I'd recommend stocking up ASAP on those stocks since they had a bad day on Friday). Apple will likely not see that much growth if any this quarter, but they'll be great for the long term. If you don't have the stomach or patience for seeing temporary losses then I would not recommend tech (Microsoft isn't too bad actually). I've sat on 200 USD losses (which is 10% of my portfolio) and went positive 145 USD the next day (that was my worst timed trade with Corsair). This probably looks very frantic, sorry, I'm a bit too excited.",

I think that there now has to be some significant growth slowdown after such perfect business conditions start to come to an end. Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content. All of that makes me think that Netflix cannot maintain the high growth that they have had thus far and if they can't maintain that growth then investors will eventually start to abandon them. I'm still bullish on streaming though, so I've invested in Roku instead as my streaming stock since they are the \"picks and shovels seller\" for the \"streaming gold rush\" and unlike Netflix, they benefit from the increased competition entering the streaming market.\n\nGoogle - They have started to remind me of Microsoft during the Steve Ballmer era. When was the last time that Google successfully executed upon a great new product and didn't ultimately send it to ever growing [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/)? I think that it has been about a decade and they have just been living off of their successes from over a decade ago since then. Maybe Google will eventually get new management that revitalizes the company like Microsoft eventually got after Nadella became CEO, but for the foreseeable future, I've lost confidence in them, so I'm out. I've replaced them with Pinterest in my portfolio as my new search/advertising stock. Social search is the future and I now see the genius advertising potential of the Pinterest platform; I see them stealing advertising dollars away from Google and growing much better than Google over the next 5 years.",

Very insightful.\n\nDid some more research into TSM and am definitely considering investing.\n\nI\u2019ve asked around and have decided to completely reorganise. I got rid of the FAANG companies, Microsoft, Tesla and the emerging markets etf. I then added QQQ as it includes a lot of the big companies i already listed. And also added TSM.\n\nJust playing around with the percentages now, to see what gets the best projection",

Just look at the fact that this week travel stocks got fucked like tech stocks. That\u2019s not because of corona. Apple and amazon after good earnings report got fucked, same for Microsoft. People are limiting exposure to the market as a whole and just waiting to get back in the stock and don\u2019t want to get fucked by the election and corona news, but decided now wasn\u2019t the time. When it is the time, the trend will reverse hard. Apple was down 6% after a good earnings report and amazon was 5.5%.",

Little to no debt..\n\nUntil a new disruptive technology emerges (in what form we do not know) - whatever big comes out of internet/robotics/AI space/Data, big tech will absorb it right away. It's all about data. Something interesting will emerge, and it will be bought right away. Why do you think these companies have more cash than most countries combined.\n\nSure they can go lower in the short run but what do you think is going to happen a year from now.\n\nDo we think MSFT adding 8-10% rev growth on a 40bn revenue company will be $100 per share? Kingpin Bezos? Daddy Cook? Zuck?\n\nIf big tech was supposed to go down, they should have been broken apart already. It is too late now. Only thing that can disrupt is a complete new technology - the way green tech reshaping energy industry.",
