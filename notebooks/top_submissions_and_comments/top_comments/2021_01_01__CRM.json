That makes cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider **salesforce.com** ([NYSE:CRM](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/salesforcecom-inc/crm/)) a solid bet to outperform with Biden in the White House.\n\nIn simple terms, CRM software helps businesses track customer information, log service issues, and manage their marketing campaigns. Although retail is the most logical beneficiary of CRM solutions, it's by no means the end-all. Manufacturing, healthcare, information technology, and service industries all benefit from real-time customer data to better serve their existing clients and make add-on sales.\n\nIn terms of CRM software, [salesforce is the kingpin](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/28/got-1000-3-stocks-to-buy-to-start-2021-with-a-bang/). **Gartner**\u00a0estimated that it controlled 18.3% of the global CRM market at the end of 2019. That's more than double its next-closest competitor. With the addition of **Slack Technologies**, which salesforce has [agreed to acquire for $27.7 billion in cash and stock](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/salesforce-building-the-operating-system-for-the-f/), salesforce will have another way to cross-sell its products on a rapidly growing business-based platform.\n\nConsidering that most [software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/saas-stocks/) are valued at 20 or more times sales, salesforce looks like an absolute bargain at less than 10 times fiscal 2021 sales.\n\nTechnical analysis: Head and shoulders pattern, bullish signal\n\nPosition: 230C March 19th expiry",

        "body": "Hi.  Wow.  You've put a tremendous amount of work into all of this, and it's incredible of you to share.  I take a similar approach.  I use Morningstar reports (a popular analysts which you can access for free on Charles Schwab) to see if a business is good and favorably valued.  Morningstar focuses on qualitative analysis and also makes judgements about whether a business has a moat (no moat, narrow moat, wide moat).  So, my strategy is I look on Morningstar to see which companies have a wide moat.  Then I take notice on how a wider array of analysts including Morningstar values the current stock price.  All of this gives me some assurance that the company is long lasting and defensible, and it's a fair price.  Then I see which of these Wide Moat stocks are also in Ark Invest funds.  This tells me if the stock is also offensive.  I figure why not buy a business that Morningstar thinks is defensive and what Ark Invest thinks is offensive (growth).  There's actually a lot of companies that fall in this category.  They've included Google, Salesforce, Amazon, Adobe, Intuit, Ansyss, Roche, Novartis, Charles Schwab, Mercado Libre, Caterpillar, and probably a few others that I can't recall at the moment.  My last filter is that I do not buy companies that have a high debt to equity ratio.  I'm concerned about a future looming big debt crisis.  Anyways, I hope that helps you as well.",

I saw today that one analyst said its undervalued and he put an 80% increase on the stock.  That would put it at around $28-35ish value.  Safer to buy shares at this point.  An article came out saying Apple made them a buyout offer which they declined, and the company is also not commenting.  Obviously Apple needs an WV company in order to produce their vehicle and they already said it's with Hyundai and rumors of cannoo coming in for their tech is rampant. \n\nThe price will either drop at open and climb up throughout the day on all the people buying the news, or it will open high and keep climbing, and if that's the case the calls will be super expensive due to the volitility and hard to make a profit on unless we see 2-3 days straight of large price increase. \n\nSmart play, like I said, would be to buy shares and hold.  You can sell them at some point and wait for the stock to flatten out and dip and stay stagnent for a day or two, at which point then you can buy long calls. \n\ngo check out the cannoo website, from what I remember off the top of my head they don't plan on producing their vehicle commercially for a year or so, so worst case scenario you hold the shares if they dip, until they are at a point you want to sell them. \n\nIf you want to buy some calls tomorrow you should look into buying Salesforce or bigcommerce which are both low volitility.  You can buy some bigcommerce April calls and hope for good earnings release, also with salesforce you could buy some June $250-280 calls and hope their earnings are good.  the saleforce calls are like 40% volitility right now, so you won't lose a bunch of instant value on the calls since that's such a low volitility, and come earnings that amount will probably increase leading up to the announcement.",

Nevertheless, it is important to consider that PLTR is already working with some of the leading firms in the financial services, airline, oil production, and healthcare industries, and if they are able to broaden their reach by partnering with these customers (as they did with Airbus) it could widen their moat significantly.\n\nIn evaluating their negative profits, it is important to take into account their customer acquisition strategy and how their margins evolve as the platform's scale within the customer's operations.",
