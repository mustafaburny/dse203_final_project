It's a platform to switch between any cloud provider easier than conforming to each cloud setup separately. \n\nWhat company makes the best server to process transactions for credit cards, banks, large retailers and service companies? Ibm, their processors are purpose built. Some like banks, hospitals, insurers are require by law to run their own data transaction systems. Their 7nm power 10 / telum processors can handle more work load any one else. Amd and Intel chip followers take note of ibm's CPU architecture. Specifically their cash system that result in much lower latency and cash pools in the size of gigabytes, also shared memory pools in terabytes. \n\nThey came up with the 2nm and lower transistor process for chips. They led in creating a programming language for quantum computing. They set a world record in data storage solution with their 580 terabyte tape units.

Increasing consulting business. IBM was also early in jumping in and providing lots of online open courses with100s of thousands taking part across the world. \n\nIBMs role might be niche and you might not understand them.

Earnings growth will be a bit harder as companies will have some really hard comps and market multiples come in a little.\n\nThis. And I've made the argument before, the only reason we were able to successfully raise interest rates in the 80s is because an entirely new industry (tech) came online and fueled the growth of the US (and world) economy for the next 35 years. Seriously think about this:\n\n- Volcker jacks rates up to 16-20% from March 1980 to May 1981. This stops inflation, but causes a recession that is one of the contributing factors to Carter losing his reelection bid.\n\n- Apple IPO is December of 1980. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\n- Microsoft IPO is March of 1986. Now one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nAnd those are just the biggest. We also had companies like Intel, Oracle, Cisco, Dell, and others coming online in the 70s and 80s. And then that led right into the 90s and 00s with Google and Amazon, followed by Facebook, etc.\n\nAll of this to say, if the fed raises interest rates drastically, it's going to lead to a recession. And unless we have some industry that is going to lead the way forward for the next 30 years of economic expansion, I don't see how the fed will be able to stand their ground before dropping rates again. Maybe clean energy or biotech could do it, but I don't think we have enough momentum in either of those sectors right now to sustain us through a recession like tech did.",

What's up with logistics only having 3 players, and UPS being the outright monopoly? Seems like a huge opportunity for Uber and Doordash to make a name for themselves in on-demand delivery.\n3. It's funny how the first US bank appears at #62. Just shows that people aren't loyal to their banks, they only use them because they're locked in or it's convention. Makes me even more bullish on Square and Paypal. \n4. Why did they classify Google as a media/entertainment company? Either way, the Facebook brand is super strong, despite all the hate it receives on Reddit. \n5. I'm impressed that Zoom and AMD made the list. I expect in the future they will overtake Oracle, Salesforce, Cisco etc in terms of brand recognition and loyalty.",

This is not just me saying that this is NSS labs, Gartner, MITRE reports saying that. Fortinet is the best for SMB gateways and SD-WAN. Palo is somewhere in the middle but they have great perception from customers. CRWD is good for EDR especially since ransomware is hot right now, but they also have some vulnerabilities and can be bypassed. If we're talking pure security I like check point for gateways and public/ private cloud northsouth &amp; eastwest. I like Zscaler for remote access and secure internet browsing. I like Okta for IDAM. I like Radware &amp; Akami for ddos. I just want to clarify I speak from a security first point of view, not from a stock price point of view. my final note is don't invest in Cisco for security they are complete dog ass without HTTPS inspection and their ASA's + firepower suck.",

In fact, i would say the smaller guys were far worse on average. Many of the smaller subs came with their own products promising this and that when in reality its just the same thing you can get from cisco or microsoft but a lot less mature and harder to configure because of how raw it is. They only got the contract because they undercut or they had inside help pushing contracts to them. \n\nDont get me wrong. Im no fan of the big defense complex but that entire sector is just rife with incompetence and corruption. No different than any other country honestly. For what its worth, there are good companies that actually did consistently good work. Have to take my hat off to the MSFT guys for that. They might be draconian but they actually provide good work... Lockheed and Raytheon... not so much. Even though we had good workers, the people in charge had no idea what they were doing.",

He grew up poor and had a good job during the boom but it was still a life times worth of money that he had to give up. man was always frugal and had to recognize he just lost a house in california worth of money. Guy was sick for weeks, they took him to the doctor cause he wasn't eating or sleeping and they thought he had ulcers.\n\nCISCO ended up crashing from like $80 to like $9 in the crash and so he could have retired 20 years ago  if he just held longer.

        "body": "It's interesting and I don't have any basis on which to dispute.  I will say it's decidedly micro and anecdotal, whereas I'm taking the most macro view: Fastly has the most advanced tech that's respected by the most tech heavy players.  That has to be worth something.  \n\nI'd certainly be bitter if I did buy and hold, but I was selling tranches of FSLY on the times it was surging above $100.  I did however rebuild positions as it was falling to and through $70.  I thought it had a least one more run to $100 in it.  \n\nIf Roberts' prognosis is true, then it's been a heck of a turn.  \n\n Fastly was ready and able to solve the world's problems when COVID came along.  Seems pretty quick to be deemed irrelevant.  \n\nAnd what's even more crazy is their death was essentially triggered by Trump having a tantrum after social media users embarrassed him into thinking he was about to have a million person rally when in fact it was just 6,000 people.  \n\nHe made up that bizarre threat that tiktok was a national security threat... yet somehow this \"threat\" would be allowed to continue for 90 days as long as it was force-sold to the a Trump-supporting Walmart heirs.  That's a whale-sized pile of crimes and corruption right there.  \n\nInvestors speculated on what percent of Fastly's business might be impaired.  5%?  12%?  \n\nThe shocker came: China had abruptly killed 100% of their Fastly-Tiktok business.  Not just the US part.  All of it.  They'd either stolen or replaced FSLY's tech, all because of the tantrum threat.  \n\nI listened as Fastly management responded.  It sounded unpaniced and measured.  They talked about \"reserving the capacity\" in case Tiktok were to switch back.  At first that sounded ok.  But once it became obvious that wasn't going to happen, it sounded like they were still pining for that lost lover.  That was somewhat concerning to me.  Move on, and tell us what big client bases you're going to attack instead. \n\nThey did seem to recognize what the market was ruffled about, which at the time was Cloudflare's claim of distinction around security.  They acted seemingly appropriately by folding in Signal Sciences pretty quickly, so I was feeling somewhat comfortable about that.  \n\nHowever it's been quite awhile and I haven't seen or heard much from Fastly. They don't seem to have turned people on to the compute-on-edge, which feels to me like it might have huge potential.  \n\nWorse, when they've had hiccups, like with Tiktok or the large one hour outage this spring, it sounds like customers are flipping away from Fastly and the customer continues to do just fine without them (?)\n\nI think I read that after Amazon cut over when Fastly had the spring outage, they haven't bothered to flip back. If true, that doesn't speak too well of Fastly being essential.\n\nStill, if we think of NET and FSLY as Coke and Pepsi, there's always going to be a market for both.  I can't see Fastly just ceasing to exist, except through buy out of course.  I'd guessed some old blue chip like Cisco or IBM or Intel might buy them.",

        "body": "There are several things that will be interesting to see going forward over the next few years. I think Tesla sets a great real world example of loving the company/Elon's eccentrics/EVs/etc but also not a great stock. While admittedly I did ride up $TSLA pre-S&amp;P 500, that was before the P/E was grossly overvalued. Now I am not one of those that invest solely on fundamentals but also on sentiment, momentum and things I personally like. One thing to be said about $TSLA, or at least a lot of companies in general that are considered fairly nascent high growth is that typically you start over pricing growth. Most that start having a large rise, even paired with large profit margins/RoE/RoA/RoC you will see that over time they tend to rubber-band back towards a more value projection. This is mainly either due to competition or market sentiment or mistakes along the way or generally just a large fall in the market. Look at $CSCO or $ORCL near early 2000's \"bubble\". Now we are somewhat in a massive tech growth bubble. I wouldn't say that they were skyhigh because of the bubble as most of those bad companies didn't have actual revenue. One way to compare $TSLA to those 2x is the massive growth then sell off. What if I told you that Cisco and Oracle had massive revenue growth leading up to 1999. You would say, even at the top you would say it would of course continue going up. Well, what if I told you that it crashed and then it took 15yrs to go back up, all while STILL beating revenue consistently.\n\nWhat I am getting to is that, while Tesla as a company will continue to beat revenue and grow, the same people that support it will also start supporting other companies. People LOVE variety of vehicles. Yes, Tesla from an EV standpoint is on top. US built, safety standards, the current Beta Auto-drive system BUT, there are a multitude of companies around the globe that are working on the same thing. Are they a few years behind, sure. Are they currently going through the same QC issues that Tesla has had over the years and mostly worked through, sure. Look at GM's batteries, Ford Mach-E QC issues, the recalls and etc. The problem is that it is so overpriced right now that people are paying almost 500x for the stock compared to what the revenue is. Almost 350x the price compared to what their actual free cash flow is. To top it off, if Tesla was an amazing stock, then why is it that they continue to dilute the shares consistently every single quarter? That is just crapping all over your investors. Does dilution of shares help them use some of that cash to expand, sure. The problem is the amount of shares they keep dumping into circulation with not a single word on share buy back in the future. \n\nWhat happens when you get to 5 yrs and there are 50 other car companies that all have competing vehicles? Sure, they can continue their growth I can imagine but it'll probably slow with a lot of global competition. If they were the best as much as people are paying for the stock then why don't they currently have 90+% of the global EV market. It's because people like variety. So, say it's a value stock today compared to 5yrs from now. Okay, now you are just justifying paying for a growth stock that's only worth $1000/share with revenue and profit margins in 5yrs from now. To justify the stock price currently you have to make a TON of If/True statements; revenue continues to blow out estimates, global growth continues to blow out estimates, profit margin/RoE/RoA/RoC continue to blow out estimates, 3 party adaptors of his IP AI-Autodrive system, have multiple companies use Tesla's exclusively for EV taxis/car rentals, have Elon not mess up on Twitter and say something wrong or have a fallout with market sentiment because of something offensive. Over 5yrs a LOT of things can change. While I do agree that high growth companies can be afforded a lot more lenience in the P/E and other growth fundamentals on the balance sheet, it's really hard to swallow that this will continue going up. I think short term trading would be a little better but once quantitative easing starts being pulled back next month over the next 6-8 months and potential rate raises next year or 2023, I can imagine this may sideways trade for a long time until it normalizes with a P/E &lt;100 in the least.",
