In total, 125 million XB1 and PS5 were sold in the last 7 years. On average thats 17.9 million Xbox/PS. Thats a lot of money for AMD. When the XSX and PS5 get sold, more are about to be sold. Along with the fact that (I dont know the ticker for nerds), PC nerds buy AMD and NVDA instead of INTC because they know that AMD is better. Theres apparently 1.2 billion PC gamers, lets say 10% of them have the money and knowledge to build their own PCs and dont just buy a RZR laptop or a normal laptop that they can play some games on. Thats another 120 millions AMD/INTC buyers there. Lets say 40% of them buy AMD instead of INTC - thats 48 million people buying it. From what Ive seen, my friends buy a new CPU every 2 to 3 years so thats 16 million a year on average using conservative figures. \n\nSo currently 17 + 16 = 33 million users on average of AMD. \n\n\nNow lets talk about AMD encroaching into the data centre market. Cloud computing becomes more and more important everyday and who wants expensive shitty stuff made by immigrants only hired to fill a bullshit diversity quota so the CEO can watch his wife get pounded by Jamal, the Nigerian with no qualifications, to fulfil his interracial cuck fetishes? Jamal used to work at a mine before for INTC before they decided to use 'conflict free resources' to look good and all that did was raise unemployment and crime in low income areas in the Congo so INTC not wanting to create a massive epidemic of poverty, decided to hire people like Jamal and his entire family.

Now three years later, I think they are in a much better position to deliver and take their growth a lot further. That is why I am buying and accumulating shares these days, which I am planning on holding till I retire or find something with better potential for growth.\n\nPlease do your own due diligence before investing, and/or giving investing advice to family members and friends.

It's practically a 100x increase if that were to outright flip. About a 35x increase if they steal half Intel's market. Their sales would expand from about $6B to $35 - 40B. Right now AMD's market cap is 1/5 that of Intel so if you fervently believe in AMD's story you're looking at a multibagger even from these elevated levels.\n\nThat said, if Intel gets control back AMD's stock is primed to lose like 90% of its value. So this is a very high risk high reward play. I like AMD's odds imo they have always done a lot with a little, and their partnership with TSMC is set to help them stay ahead of Intel with their foundry woes.",

Rome already get much better traction and qualified much faster than Naples, Milan likely coming mid year and it will qualify fast too\n* new 7nm Zen 2 with 8 cores Renoir-APU and better memory controller (huge power savings, clockspeed gains, IPC gains, better dealing with bandwith bottleneck) are expected tomorrow/very early this year (increased cadence compared to last years), while Intel has capacity and node issues. Intel tries to cut iGPU for desktop to regain capacity, but they samewhat forfeit marketshare with this call. OEMs have to use discret graphics, which they hate for Budget PCs (additional cost, additional power supply...). a refresh with better graphics can be expected ready for holiday season (van Gogh)\n* overall better economy forecast and china deal, so likely higher demand, Intel cannot supply processors, so AMD will even more\n* AMD ordered a **huge** amount of TSMCs wafer capacity, so they made a call\n* there is still the possibility of Apple using Zen for MacBooks and Macs, it's only clear that they drop Intel this year. Apple may use it's own chips, but that's quite a barrier (x86 -&gt; ARM) and they use AMD GPUs\n* Nvidia has yield issues, probably their line up is delayed a few months",

        "body": "Help me out in this AMD situation!!  \n\nMy position summary-\nLong $20 Jan 15 2021 AMD Calls\nShort $40 Jan 15 2021 AMD Calls\n\nBack in April 2019, I figured that AMD options sell at very nice juicy premiums and AMD is also among the top ten most traded Options vehicle most of the time. I formed a bullish forecast on AMD when it appeared that it'll outsmart Intel in the nanometer race. That was when I decided to enter AMD. \n\nI opened five LEAP contracts for Jan 15 2021 expiration at an average of $1400 per contract. At the time AMD was trading at about $27 and it traded in a channel of $27-33 for several months. I made about $2500 (or about $500 per contract) just by selling premium on weekly calls. \n\nMy problem started in October when AMD started picking up wildly. In just a matter of 90 days, it went up from $28 to $51. I didn't want to let go of my AMD long position, so I kept rolling out my short calls in time to avoid risk of being called away. I reached at a point that my Poor Man's Covered Call converted into a Vertical Spread for Jan 2021 expiration. My spread is long 20 - short 40 C. I can't roll any further. At this moment, the whole spread is selling for $1500. And at the time of expiration, the entire extrinsic value of the short option will collapse and it'll be selling at the width of the strikes or $2000.   \n\n\nMy question is - What should I do in this case if I want to hang on to AMD since my forecast for AMD is that it'll go further up from here?\n\nSince there is very tiny extrinsic left in my long call, I'm thinking of exercising my long call @ 20 per share and use them as collateral instead. What this will get me? I will be able to roll my short call further than just Jan 2021.",
