Their technology is years beyond the top level performance products of their competition, not to mention their novel RDNA architecture as a backbone for a series of product line ups help to solidify a strong future heritage of its products just like Intel did with Its processors. I\u2019d expect expenditures to be high for this coming Q1 given their extensive development in the new architecture and in their 7nm. As soon as they ramp up production, a bit of marketing via esports sector and professional workplace sector, their market cap is going to be north of 100B quicker than most can see. The only thing setting them back is their fund allocation and debt management. If they can get the money towards the right development (which they are with graphics and gaming) they\u2019ll bake up a storm and become incredible my profitable. Their partnerships are a great sign of their success, or in other words, Apple, HP, Microsoft, Lenovo, etc are keystone companies that can help gauge the potential market exposure that AMD will get.\n\nMy position/plan: \n\nCurrently 45/46/47/48 Calls expiring 1/17. \n\nWill sell 3 days before expiration hoping it will go up and max out on the gains. \n\nRoll profits into TBD calls",

Intel dropped the ball and there is room for growth for AMD. \n\nAMD's market share 2019:\n\n* Desktop      20%   \n* Notebook    15% \n* Server          4%\n\nAMD will grow market share  fast next few years. They are expected to more than double their server market share to something like 10% next year alone.  Their Forward P/E is 43.09, PEG Ratio next 5 years is 3.11.  Their success is  limited only by TMSC's capacity. They will win  most deals from Intel if they can deliver the chips. \n\nIntel took  calculated risk in their  attempt to get ahead without EUV lithography and it failed spectacularly. \n\nThere is no reason to expect that Intel's next major process node tech  is failure but it takes several years. I fully expect Intel to be fully back within 5 years  with their  new process and packaging. Until it's ready, they are refining the existing process technology and losing market share.  AMD has few years to gain market share and grow into a big boy that takes on Intel as equal. \n\nThe new lithography process  transition is always a risk. Intel made a misstep and Global Foundries quit the 7nm game.  TSMC or Samsung might fail in their next big process. AMD is now fully reliant on TSMC. \n\n(Btw. Names like 10nm and 7nm are just commercial names and not comparable between companies. \nIntel's 10nm is 100 million transistors per mm\u00b2. TSMC's 7nm Mobile is 96 million transistors per mm\u00b2)\n\nSummary: If you want to value  AMD, look at what happens between TSMC and Intel.",

In total, 125 million XB1 and PS5 were sold in the last 7 years. On average thats 17.9 million Xbox/PS. Thats a lot of money for AMD. When the XSX and PS5 get sold, more are about to be sold. Along with the fact that (I dont know the ticker for nerds), PC nerds buy AMD and NVDA instead of INTC because they know that AMD is better. Theres apparently 1.2 billion PC gamers, lets say 10% of them have the money and knowledge to build their own PCs and dont just buy a RZR laptop or a normal laptop that they can play some games on. Thats another 120 millions AMD/INTC buyers there. Lets say 40% of them buy AMD instead of INTC - thats 48 million people buying it. From what Ive seen, my friends buy a new CPU every 2 to 3 years so thats 16 million a year on average using conservative figures. \n\nSo currently 17 + 16 = 33 million users on average of AMD. \n\n\nNow lets talk about AMD encroaching into the data centre market. Cloud computing becomes more and more important everyday and who wants expensive shitty stuff made by immigrants only hired to fill a bullshit diversity quota so the CEO can watch his wife get pounded by Jamal, the Nigerian with no qualifications, to fulfil his interracial cuck fetishes? Jamal used to work at a mine before for INTC before they decided to use 'conflict free resources' to look good and all that did was raise unemployment and crime in low income areas in the Congo so INTC not wanting to create a massive epidemic of poverty, decided to hire people like Jamal and his entire family. People want the pure stuff made of pure merit, not vaginas and melanin so AMD wins that market too.",

Here's a [calendar](https://imgur.com/a/P9Ou2MR) for this months earnings report.

Now three years later, I think they are in a much better position to deliver and take their growth a lot further. That is why I am buying and accumulating shares these days, which I am planning on holding till I retire or find something with better potential for growth.\n\nPlease do your own due diligence before investing, and/or giving investing advice to family members and friends.

It's practically a 100x increase if that were to outright flip. About a 35x increase if they steal half Intel's market. Their sales would expand from about $6B to $35 - 40B. Right now AMD's market cap is 1/5 that of Intel so if you fervently believe in AMD's story you're looking at a multibagger even from these elevated levels.\n\nThat said, if Intel gets control back AMD's stock is primed to lose like 90% of its value. So this is a very high risk high reward play. I like AMD's odds imo they have always done a lot with a little, and their partnership with TSMC is set to help them stay ahead of Intel with their foundry woes.",
