        "body": "If you're investing in dividends for \"reliable\" income, diversification is crucial. Companies can and do cut their dividend, sometimes even when they can still afford to pay it. For example, Western Digital suspended their dividend in March 2020 to focus on reducing debt and investing back in the company, and it remains suspended even as their profits have resumed.\n\nOwning a fund like VYM and/or VIG provides significant diversification. That way during recessions you might see a 25% reduction in dividend income if things are really bad, vs if you invested in a single stock you might see a 100% reduction.",

        "body": "Just to be open and because I care more about y'all more than myself or Vogel I do want to mention that there has been a change in the lockup. Not good or bad just changed.\n\nIt's been all over the place since last year between Vogel and Wu. But this is the final iteration it seems.\n\nThe last iteration was\nWu: 25% locked for 1 year unless above $15 for 20 days. 75% two year locked \n\nOther Microvast shareholders: 6 months\n\nVogel/Tuscan: \n50% is locked for 1 year, unless it trades above $12.50 for 20 days. The other 50% is locked for 2 years.\n\n\n\n**Now it is**\nWu: 25% locked for 1 year unless above $15 for 20 days. 75% two year locked. (Yes unchanged)\n\nOther Microvast shareholders: 6 months\n\nVogel/Tuscan:\n**READ THIS CAREFULLY**\n \nOf 75% of shares, 67% of the shares are locked for 1 year unless above $12.50 for 20 days. The other 33% is locked for 1 year regardless of price. \n\nOf the other 25% of shares, 50% is locked for 1 year unless it trades over $12 for 20 days. The other 50% is locked for 1 year unless it trades over 15. However he will lose his shares if none of these conditions are met.\n\nThese lockups are fairly similar (e.g 67% of 75% is 50%). I don't know if he's fucking with me or I'm just stupid). In summarize it's leaning more positive in my opinion that Vogel got himself a poor man's \"FDs\" and is either bullish or likes to gamble. Can slightly sell more now if it goes up, but will forfeit ownership to them for $0 if it doesn't.",

Over several years I accumulated almost 1000 shares of FDC.  8 years after I started working there, they spun off WU stock (which I sold soon after) and a few months after that they were bought by a private equity company and taken private.",
