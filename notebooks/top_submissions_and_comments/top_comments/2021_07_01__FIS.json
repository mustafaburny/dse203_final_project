Instead of buying and selling 10+ stocks - the ETF will do it for you.  Some ETFs also provide dividends, but not all.   The trade from individual stocks to ETFs is volume of trades.  If you want someone to manage it for you - You can buy one time and hold to let someone else do the short term work and you only get hit with expense fees rather than short/long term capital gains (until you actually sell the ETF yourself).  ETFs typically carry a pretty low expense ratio .02 (pretty low) to .2ish (which i consider as high).  \n\nI own both FTEC and FENY and they have a .08 expense ratio.  FTEC has been going crazy because of all the massive gains in tech and its what I know and follow.  FENY is a nice dividend ETF, and its cheap.  I also use the Fidelity platform, which is why I also lean towards Fidelity ETFs.  \n\nI'm not an analyst... this is just my 2 cents worth.",

Imagine if I'm buying to close, and the trade is executed with you on the other side, and you are selling to close.  Now what?  We were not counterparties before, but now an option contract needs to go away.  So they need to pick one of the contracts to get rid of, and link our counterparties together on the one that they decide to leave it open.  It's a total mess and it accomplishes nothing.\n\nWhen an option is exercised, the OCC makes good on it (kind of; settlement takes time).  At the end of the day, they pick a random person to assign to out of all the open contracts.  (Technically they pick a random broker, who then picks a random client).  This is why exercise can happen at any time but assignment can only happen overnight (this is also very important; you have no assignment risk if you do not hold short positions overnight).  They key here is that when you exercise, the OCC is on the hook to deliver.  If the person who sold the contract is bankrupt, and their broker goes under, your exercise still happens with no issues.  If this was not the case then you would have to worry about who your counterparty was.  Is the option being sold from an account at Fidelity, or some questionable broker that your have never heard of?  Do you really want to worry about that?  If there was counterparty risk then the price of the contract would vary based on the creditworthiness of the issuer.  It would be a total mess.  You wouldn't be able to have a market, because every contract would be different.\n\nIt's not true that Charlie is the only one who can exercise Alfred's option, so no that can't be known.  \"Alfred's option\" didn't even really exist.  They are all the OCC's options",
