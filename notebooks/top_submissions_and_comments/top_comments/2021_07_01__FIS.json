        "body": "Boring is the best, but it\u2019s not fun. Here\u2019s my strategy and I have been investing since I was in MY twenties: \n\nThere was a time when you couldn\u2019t just open an account and start buying investments. You had to have broker and usually you had to buy 100 share blocks of stock. Some companies had DRIP services where you obtain 1 share in the open market and then the company would register this share so that you could buy directly from the company thereafter. For example, Computershare.com is the transfer agent for many public companies and you can buy shares today directly from them. However, it\u2019s costly and very regimented when you want to sell. I still have some shares in DRIPs. Today, however, the world is your oyster. It\u2019s actually a bit dangerous, because with the push of a button you can lose a lot of money. \n\nStart a core position in a broad index fund, Schwab, Vanguard, and Fidelity all have good, low fee index funds (either ETF or mutual fund). Invest in this every month automatically if you can (dollar cost averaging). Keep this chugging along through thick  and thin. If it\u2019s only $50/month, so be it. \n\nAs you make more money, diversify and have fun, but keep that core chugging along! I remember delivering pizzas on the side when I was in the Air Force so I could buy Intel stock through DRIPs. Later worked a different side job to buy Cisco stock. I now have only retirement income so in order to max out my IRA each year, I work a part-time job. Last year I made $7110 and put $7000 in my IRA. \n\nNo investment is perfect. Time in the market starting at 22 is YOUR advantage. Don\u2019t worry about Timing the market. Make a move now and you can adjust it later; but if you start with a broad market, low fee index fund, you may never have to adjust it. Just add to it with other investments as you learn and make more dough. Quicker you get that core up and rolling, the quicker you can budget for some cannabis, renewables, or EV stocks. Or, whatever you find interesting and valuable.",

Instead of buying and selling 10+ stocks - the ETF will do it for you.  Some ETFs also provide dividends, but not all.   The trade from individual stocks to ETFs is volume of trades.  If you want someone to manage it for you - You can buy one time and hold to let someone else do the short term work and you only get hit with expense fees rather than short/long term capital gains (until you actually sell the ETF yourself).  ETFs typically carry a pretty low expense ratio .02 (pretty low) to .2ish (which i consider as high).  \n\nI own both FTEC and FENY and they have a .08 expense ratio.  FTEC has been going crazy because of all the massive gains in tech and its what I know and follow.  FENY is a nice dividend ETF, and its cheap.  I also use the Fidelity platform, which is why I also lean towards Fidelity ETFs.  \n\nI'm not an analyst... this is just my 2 cents worth.",

Patent trolls are usually the first thing that comes to mind in these situations but Netlist isn\u2019t some scam company, they\u2019re a real company with real innovation. \n\nA quick, rough breakdown of the Google history: \n\nNetlist that came to Google in 2006-ish trying to license their memory products to Google for their servers. Google said thanks but no thanks but then used their patented technology anyways. Netlist caught wind and sued Google in 2009. Google has been fighting this court case for 12 years now, their first defense was that the patent wasn\u2019t valid, but a USPTO PTAB recently came to the conclusion that the patent is valid. So Google should be on the hook for 12+ years of treble damages as well as court fees and possibly future royalties. Currently the judge in their case ordered both sides to try and talk it out and a joint decision was supposed to be turned into the judge just a few days ago so speculation is running rampant in the Netlist subreddit that an agreement was reach as nothing was filed on the deadline but who tf knows. Google has been fighting this tooth and nail for years and there are also cases against Micron and Samsung for similar infringement. \n\nNetlist has barely been staying above water this past decade, with most of its profits going towards fighting these legal cases and it seems like maybe the most recent win against SK Hynix may be the turning point. I can\u2019t say I know what\u2019s going to happen but things have definitely been trending in the right direction. Shareholders are basically betting that the last 12 years of missed profits from these giant tech companies will be realized very soon in triplicate with additional cash covering legal fees as well as forcing Google and others to pay royalties for future use of the technology. \n\nAs always, do your own research, I\u2019m not a patent lawyer nor an expert in computer memory technology.",
