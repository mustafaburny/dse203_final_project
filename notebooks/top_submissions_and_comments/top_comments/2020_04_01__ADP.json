They just look at who was on the payrolls for the period that includes March 12th.  So unless your paid monthly. We're talking the majority of that data goes out to March 13th tops.  In addition if folks are on the payrolls but not collecting a paycheck (would be a good # of folks initially) they aren't counted as having lost their job. \n\n The scale of the \"stay at home\" orders just isn't being realized yet.  The market is seeing under reported data, thinking \"that's not as bad as we thought\" and going up because of it.  I think once we start getting more of those numbers in April/May time frame, we're going to start seeing the true scope of damage we're enduring and the market will start going a lot lower.",
