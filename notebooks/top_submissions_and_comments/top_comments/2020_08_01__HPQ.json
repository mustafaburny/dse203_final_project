        "body": "[This link](https://www.dogsofthedow.com/djdelete.htm) has all the Dow changes. It does have a habit of sell low and buy high though, some examples: \n\n- Microsoft replaced Chevron in November 1999. Over the next 5 years, $MSFT was down 50% and $CVX up 25%. Microsoft eventually redeemed itself, but not after putting its shareholders underwater for 13 years.\n- Chevron reentered Dow on Feb 19 2008, 120% higher than November 1999, replacing **Honeywell**. Since then, $CVX is up ~50%, dividends included; $HON 300% higher. **Honeywell reentered Dow today.**\n- Also on Feb 19 2008, Dow replaced Altria with Bank of America. You should all know what happened to $BAC over the next year. $MO is up 300% after being booted from the Dow.\n- AIG replaced International Paper in April 2004. $IP is a lousy company indeed and has only gained about 60% since then, but $AIG got obliterated during the GFC and was booted from Dow on September 22 2008 after suffering 95% loss.\n\n------------\n\nDow has also done many things very right, such as:\n\n- Replace Woolworth with Wal-Mart in 1997\n- Replace Sears with Home Depot in 1999, although $HD actually underperformed Sears until at least 2008 \n- Replace Kodak with Pfizer in 2004, Kodak went bankrupt in 2012\n- Replace Kraft with UnitedHealthcare in 2012\n- Replace Alcoa with Nike and Hewlett-Packard with Visa in 2013\n- Replace AT&amp;T with Apple in 2015",

Management said it expects a slow, gradual recovery in the second half of the year.*  \n*Canon reported Q2 revenue of JPY673bn (-26% Y/Y, vs. -10% in Q1), missing consensus by 9%. Canon also noted that it is expecting a slow recovery in H2.*  \n*Ricoh reported FQ1 (Jun-Q) revenue of JPY352bn (-26% Y/Y vs. -2% Y/Y in Mar-Q), missing consensus by 10%. Management called out that office attendance rates and print volumes recovered after bottoming out in April and May.*  \n*Epson reported FQ1 revenue of JPY193bn (-23% Y/Y, vs. -5% in the Mar-Q), missing consensus by 11%. Management called supply shortages due to COVID which it expects will persist in H2.*\n\nHP laptops suck, no IT departments are spending on equipment except for maybe some WFH stuff - all signs point to weak Q.\n\nI don't have any positions in HPQ - if I did would look to buy a 8/28 $17P",

Just as stagnant as Goldman.\n\nImo, indices are in a bubble, dragged up by tech and unaffected by other market movement. Idk, they're not my thing.\n\nOther bank stocks, including JPM, MS, Canadian banks, etc. were good buys.\n\nTelling someone to buy bank stocks is like telling someone to buy tech stocks, the person has to do their own research, just like you don't want someone to buy BoA, Goldman, and Eurobanks, you don't want people buying GE, ASUS, and HPQ. People gotta due their own work.\n\nI just recommended bank stocks cause they're reliable in the long term.",

        "body": "&gt;Is your thesis at its core arguing that x86 as a whole is a dead platform, or that simply Intel is incapable of innovating it further to make it competitive against the rise of reduced instruction set? \n\nBill Gates is famous for starting to answer questions like this with \"I don't know how technical you are, but..\"  Fact is, I'm probably not technical enough myself to know the answer of either question for sure.  I can see that Apple just spent a great deal of money and effort on llvm and it is clear enough that they did so in order to go platform agnostic.  Since they had been coexisting peaceably enough in an ARM/x86 world for a long while I feel like they would not have done that unless there was a compelling reason to do so.  So I can reason backwards from their actions and intuit that someone at Apple was half a billion dollars worth of certain that they needed to get off x86 in order to build tomorrow's neat consumer gadget. \n\nAs far as whether it'll be AMD, I am not at all sure of that.  I have heard mutterings that M. Son might have ARM on the block and it's hardly like it'd be a bad fit for a variety of companies.  I think Apple might buy ARM.  nVidia is probably interested too if it's really for sale.  Intel might buy ARM, but I just don't know that the Intel board has the will to admit so publically that they've had their ass whupped.  AMD could buy it, but they'd need a pretty big loan.  On the other hand if Lisa Bae whistled and blinked her eyes really pretty like she does, I bet she'd have about a dozen banks happy to make it happen for her.\n\nI don't really understand why the ARM architecture is so good; I remember a time 10 years ago when my friend jumped up, jammed his hand into his pocket and threw his iPhone on the table and said \"My phone just got strangely hot.\"  Well iPhones don't do that any more and they last 48 hours on a charge and they can bruteforce 128-bit RSA encryption and I guess someone smarter than me could explain exactly why.\n\nAs far as Intel's ability to innovate, I have some Intel roadmap images saved somewhere from 2010 and 2013, when I built my first and second ever homebuilt PC, respectively.  (I'd been an Apple fanboy prior to that.)  They are so far behind that original schedule from 2010 - it was still \"tick-tock\" - that they could have gone out of business and rebuilt everything in their company from scratch and probably beat the time they actually put in.",

The last two years, same pattern. \n\nBut to your question of will it increase; look at their competitors. EA is a larger beast and it barely hit somewhere close to $119 before sinking back down to 90's. Do you think activision is in the same league as a company that produces consistent hits with sports titles and sims?\n\nI'd say, almost! CoD was not a truly consistent blockbuster until recently. On the blizzard end, WoW was declining until corona hit and everyone needed something to do/ a dopamine hit. Blizzard is taking it's sweet time with new titles, and Activision was locked out of china until now. \n\nSo, if I were to intuit based on patterns and this with terrible math skills and rudimentary stock knowledge, I'd say around $80 is fair to even optimistic based on expectations of new titles. \n\nThat said, since the stock market is larger than one company, political concerns and FED pump will distort that number.

        "body": "&gt;Is your thesis at its core arguing that x86 as a whole is a dead platform, or that simply Intel is incapable of innovating it further to make it competitive against the rise of reduced instruction set? \n\nBill Gates is famous for starting to answer questions like this with \"I don't know how technical you are, but..\"  Fact is, I'm probably not technical enough myself to know the answer of either question for sure.  I can see that Apple just spent a great deal of money and effort on llvm and it is clear enough that they did so in order to go platform agnostic.  Since they had been coexisting peaceably enough in an ARM/x86 world for a long while I feel like they would not have done that unless there was a compelling reason to do so.  So I can reason backwards from their actions and intuit that someone at Apple was half a billion dollars worth of certain that they needed to get off x86 in order to build tomorrow's neat consumer gadget. \n\nAs far as whether it'll be AMD, I am not at all sure of that.  I have heard mutterings that M. Son might have ARM on the block and it's hardly like it'd be a bad fit for a variety of companies.  I think Apple might buy ARM.  nVidia is probably interested too if it's really for sale.  Intel might buy ARM, but I just don't know that the Intel board has the will to admit so publically that they've had their ass whupped.  AMD could buy it, but they'd need a pretty big loan.  On the other hand if Lisa Bae whistled and blinked her eyes really pretty like she does, I bet she'd have about a dozen banks happy to make it happen for her.\n\nI don't really understand why the ARM architecture is so good; I remember a time 10 years ago when my friend jumped up, jammed his hand into his pocket and threw his iPhone on the table and said \"My phone just got strangely hot.\"  Well iPhones don't do that any more and they last 48 hours on a charge and they can bruteforce 128-bit RSA encryption and I guess someone smarter than me could explain exactly why.\n\nAs far as Intel's ability to innovate, I have some Intel roadmap images saved somewhere from 2010 and 2013, when I built my first and second ever homebuilt PC, respectively.  (I'd been an Apple fanboy prior to that.)  They are so far behind that original schedule from 2010 - it was still \"tick-tock\" - that they could have gone out of business and rebuilt everything in their company from scratch and probably beat the time they actually put in.",

        "body": "Hi all. I\u2019m new to this forum and was hopping you could help me rebalance my portfolio. I started investing at the beginning of last year and have about a little over 30k in my account. However, I am trailing the s&amp;p500 and nasdaq (quite considerably) for the period and would like to get some advice on what would be the best approach for \u201ccatching up\u201d to the market. Currently my portfolio is GOOGL 18%, FB 14%, V 10%, MU 9%, INTC 8%, OXY 8%, BA 7%, WFC 5%, INTU 4%, KEYS 4%, FLT 4%, UBER 3%, JNJ 3%, GILD 3%, MCD 2%.\n\nGiven the holdings above, where do you recommend I reduce/add or exit positions? I am considering selling the portfolio entirely and buying a few index funds instead to avoid the hassle of trying to beat the market, which I\u2019m clearly not good at lol.\n\nAny feedback appreciated. Thanks",
