The Jan 20, 2023 Call at strike 140 has an ask of $1.35, around 10 delta, -0.35 theta, 23 vega. If you wanted to go ITM @Perennial-Millenial style then it's a much more aggressive trade. For example, same expiration but 90 strike you now have to put up 15 hundo for one call, and you delta is a much higher +64, and the vega is basically doubled as well.",

        "body": "Everyone who is commenting on this company needs to search two things.\n\n\"In-Q-Tel\" + \"Palantir.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel\n\n&gt;Originally named Peleus and known as In-Q-It, In-Q-Tel was founded by Norm Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed Martin. Michael Crow served as In-Q-Tel's first CEO. In-Q-Tel's mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests. Origins of the corporation can be traced to Ruth A. David, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science &amp; Technology in the 1990s and promoted the importance of rapidly advancing information technology for the CIA. In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community. In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences.\n\n&gt;Former CIA director George Tenet says,\n\n&gt;&gt;We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ... In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ... enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger, and to adapt the technology that online booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results.\n\nA few hits:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jk3mhd/palantir/\n\n&gt;This patriotism is almost the fundamental idea of Palantir. The company's filed to go public says it \"does not work with clients or governments whose positions or actions are incompatible with the mission to support Western liberal democracy and its strategic allies.\" The fact that the main clients of Palantir are precisely the US security forces and intelligence services fully reflects the company's commitment to this mission.\n\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/aoc-calls-for-investigation-on-palantir-before-surveillance-company-goes-public/\n\n&gt;\"Palantir's numerous transparency and governance issues have been flying completely under the radar as they launch their public offering,\" Jacinta Gonzalez, a senior campaign organizer at Mijente, said in a statement. \"We're glad Representatives Ocasio-Cortez and Garcia tasked the SEC with investigating and are eager to find out why the agency has not done so.\"\n\nhttps://www.forbesindia.com/article/100-most-innovative-companies/how-a-deviant-philosopher-built-palantir-a-ciafunded-data-miner/36101/1\n\n&gt;The bottom line: A CIA-funded firm run by an eccentric philosopher has become one of the most valuable private companies in tech, priced at between $5 billion and $8 billion in a round of funding the company is currently pursuing. Karp owns roughly a tenth of the firm\u2014just less than its largest stakeholder, Peter Thiel, the PayPal and Facebook billionaire. (Other billionaire investors include Ken Langone and hedge fund titan Stanley Druckenmiller.) That puts Karp on course to become Silicon Valley\u2019s latest billionaire\u2014and Thiel could double his fortune\u2014if the company goes public, a possibility Karp says Palantir is reluctantly considering.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2020/10/01/2-reasons-you-should-avoid-palantir-stock/?sh=1b90fae7485a\n\n&gt;For example, Ocasio-Cortez is concerned that in 2009, Palantir\u2019s shareholder report revealed that the CIA\u2019s venture arm \u2014 In-Q-Tel \u2014 held 10% of Palantir. However, she noted, its S-1 \u201cdid not say whether that investment was still in play or how many Palantir shares In-Q-Tel held.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.iqt.org/\n\nHere is the In-Q-Tel website. Palantir is under Analytics in their Portfolio section. There is honestly not much on the site, as you might expect.\n\nLong PLTR.",

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

TSM, Samsung and INTC have near-term headwinds in terms of earnings based on semiconductor demand simply because it takes so long to expand capacity. The front-end winners in current semi production efforts are going to be those who supply the tools, products and services that go into these fabs that are planned for construction: AMAT, ASML, TER, LRCX, to name a few. Secondary effects on earnings from this will come 1-2-3 years down the line for the semi manufacturers themselves, depending on whether or not they are expanding/upgrading an existing facility, or building one from the ground up.\n\nThe end-users of these semiconductor products (GM, F, NVDA, AMD, etc.) will be the last ones to benefit from expanded chipmaking capacity, as easing the demand crunch allows them to resume normal sales levels. Note that for auto mfrs, this has a ripple effect on rental car companies, who sold all of their fleets in fire sales last year and now can't replace them because the auto mfrs can't make cars.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is booked up for the foreseeable future; these bookings have prices agreed well in advance, and are almost certainly not subject to TSMC's recent statements that they plan to increase prices; that will happen with new bookings down the line.",

I believe US fed policy reform is going to trigger a sector wide melt up.  And that an m&amp;a phase will randomly amplify the upside (briefly) for some of the mid tiers. Which is why I've spread a few chips around that craps table on AYR, VRNO, CCHW and TER.  I'm not married to them. Won't hold long.

That said, we will need perfect numbers to start the next leg up or a breather to let things cool off.

Just right there I have exposure in entertainment, consumer goods, home building, fintech/crypto, industrials simply from looking at stuff in my house. Do that yourself and you'll be absolutely fine. \n\nOn the other hand take a look at reddit hype stocks. You care about space exploration I'm sure but who do you know is actively participating?

Last month most if not all semi stocks rebounded after earnings (over 100% for most since the march 2020 crash).\n\nNvidia 20% in 1 month.\n\nAMD 12% top 6% rn in one month.\n\nON 20% on the decline in one month.\n\nAVGO 20% in one month.\n\nTXN 20% in a month.\n\nMU 12% in a month.\n\nIntel 15% on the decline in one month.\n\nLRCX  30% on the decline in a month.\n\nTSMC is probably the stock that will tank the least due to its seat on the table of semis and the fact it wasn't overbought 5 weeks ago.",
