        "body": "&gt;Is your thesis at its core arguing that x86 as a whole is a dead platform, or that simply Intel is incapable of innovating it further to make it competitive against the rise of reduced instruction set? \n\nBill Gates is famous for starting to answer questions like this with \"I don't know how technical you are, but..\"  Fact is, I'm probably not technical enough myself to know the answer of either question for sure.  I can see that Apple just spent a great deal of money and effort on llvm and it is clear enough that they did so in order to go platform agnostic.  Since they had been coexisting peaceably enough in an ARM/x86 world for a long while I feel like they would not have done that unless there was a compelling reason to do so.  So I can reason backwards from their actions and intuit that someone at Apple was half a billion dollars worth of certain that they needed to get off x86 in order to build tomorrow's neat consumer gadget. \n\nAs far as whether it'll be AMD, I am not at all sure of that.  I have heard mutterings that M. Son might have ARM on the block and it's hardly like it'd be a bad fit for a variety of companies.  I think Apple might buy ARM.  nVidia is probably interested too if it's really for sale.  Intel might buy ARM, but I just don't know that the Intel board has the will to admit so publically that they've had their ass whupped.  AMD could buy it, but they'd need a pretty big loan.  On the other hand if Lisa Bae whistled and blinked her eyes really pretty like she does, I bet she'd have about a dozen banks happy to make it happen for her.\n\nI don't really understand why the ARM architecture is so good; I remember a time 10 years ago when my friend jumped up, jammed his hand into his pocket and threw his iPhone on the table and said \"My phone just got strangely hot.\"  Well iPhones don't do that any more and they last 48 hours on a charge and they can bruteforce 128-bit RSA encryption and I guess someone smarter than me could explain exactly why.\n\nAs far as Intel's ability to innovate, I have some Intel roadmap images saved somewhere from 2010 and 2013, when I built my first and second ever homebuilt PC, respectively.  (I'd been an Apple fanboy prior to that.)  They are so far behind that original schedule from 2010 - it was still \"tick-tock\" - that they could have gone out of business and rebuilt everything in their company from scratch and probably beat the time they actually put in.",

I started investing at the beginning of last year and have about a little over 30k in my account. However, I am trailing the s&amp;p500 and nasdaq (quite considerably) for the period and would like to get some advice on what would be the best approach for \u201ccatching up\u201d to the market. Currently my portfolio is GOOGL 18%, FB 14%, V 10%, MU 9%, INTC 8%, OXY 8%, BA 7%, WFC 5%, INTU 4%, KEYS 4%, FLT 4%, UBER 3%, JNJ 3%, GILD 3%, MCD 2%.\n\nGiven the holdings above, where do you recommend I reduce/add or exit positions? I am considering selling the portfolio entirely and buying a few index funds instead to avoid the hassle of trying to beat the market, which I\u2019m clearly not good at lol.\n\nAny feedback appreciated.

I reverse-engineered the app, and feel confident in stating that I have a very strong understanding for how the app operates (or at least operated as of a few months ago).\n\nTikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, or your device... well, they're using it.\n\n* Phone hardware (cpu type, number of course, hardware ids, screen dimensions, dpi, memory usage, disk space, etc)\n\n* Other apps you have installed (I've even seen some I've deleted show up in their analytics payload - maybe using as cached value?)\n\n* Everything network-related (ip, local ip, router mac, your mac, wifi access point name)\n\n* Whether or not you're rooted/jailbroken\n\n* Some variants of the app had GPS pinging enabled at the time, roughly once every 30 seconds - this is enabled by default if you ever location-tag a post IIRC\n\n* They set up a local proxy server on your device for \"transcoding media\", but that can be abused very easily as it has zero authentication\n\nThe scariest part of all of this is that much of the logging they're doing is remotely configurable, and unless you reverse every single one of their native libraries (have fun reading all of that assembly, assuming you can get past their customized fork of OLLVM!!!) and manually inspect every single obfuscated function. They have several different protections in place to prevent you from reversing or debugging the app as well. App behavior changes slightly if they know you're trying to figure out what they're doing. There's also a few snippets of code on the Android version that allows for the downloading of a remote zip file, unzipping it, and executing said binary. There is zero reason a mobile app would need this functionality legitimately.\n\n... Here's the thing though.. they don't want you to know how much information they're collecting on you, and the security implications of all of that data in one place, en masse, are fucking huge. They encrypt all of the analytics requests with an algorithm that changes with every update (at the very least the keys change) just so you can't see what they're doing. They also made it so you cannot use the app at all if you block communication to their analytics host off at the DNS-level.",

Stocks are the rich mans game in 2020, this isn\u2019t 1950 anymore, stocks are the price that they are at because of a lot of manipulation by our government. I like that you\u2019re in small caps. Learn about Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ampleforth, Decentralized Finance, staking, private keys, exchanges, absorb it all. Jump into the new stuff don\u2019t even think about it just learn as you go. IMO there\u2019s more opportunity in Cryptocurrency than Stocks and I personally think it\u2019s more fun and a 24 hour market and can be done entirely on your phone if you want and buying in is so cheap right now, like pennies to invest in good tokens. If you don\u2019t believe me check out AERGO, a Token that has more impressive partnerships than hundreds of thousands of companies in the stock market. I don\u2019t think that dropping money into an index fund is a BAD idea, but IMO it\u2019s more of an 80s-2010s idea that isn\u2019t going to be as successful when the market is so disconnected from the realities facing America at the moment. I would HIGHLY recommend \u201cHow to Make Money in Stocks\u201d by William ONeil; the founder of Investor Business Daily. His strategies helped me make money in crypto this month in particular. But man just learn. That shit is free. Learn, explore, make folders and book mark shit. Definitely also recommend \u201cSteal Like an Artist\u201d",

I started investing at the beginning of last year and have about a little over 30k in my account. However, I am trailing the s&amp;p500 and nasdaq (quite considerably) for the period and would like to get some advice on what would be the best approach for \u201ccatching up\u201d to the market. Currently my portfolio is GOOGL 18%, FB 14%, V 10%, MU 9%, INTC 8%, OXY 8%, BA 7%, WFC 5%, INTU 4%, KEYS 4%, FLT 4%, UBER 3%, JNJ 3%, GILD 3%, MCD 2%.\n\nGiven the holdings above, where do you recommend I reduce/add or exit positions? I am considering selling the portfolio entirely and buying a few index funds instead to avoid the hassle of trying to beat the market, which I\u2019m clearly not good at lol.\n\nAny feedback appreciated.
