I started investing at the beginning of last year and have about a little over 30k in my account. However, I am trailing the s&amp;p500 and nasdaq (quite considerably) for the period and would like to get some advice on what would be the best approach for \u201ccatching up\u201d to the market. Currently my portfolio is GOOGL 18%, FB 14%, V 10%, MU 9%, INTC 8%, OXY 8%, BA 7%, WFC 5%, INTU 4%, KEYS 4%, FLT 4%, UBER 3%, JNJ 3%, GILD 3%, MCD 2%.\n\nGiven the holdings above, where do you recommend I reduce/add or exit positions? I am considering selling the portfolio entirely and buying a few index funds instead to avoid the hassle of trying to beat the market, which I\u2019m clearly not good at lol.\n\nAny feedback appreciated.

The last two years, same pattern. \n\nBut to your question of will it increase; look at their competitors. EA is a larger beast and it barely hit somewhere close to $119 before sinking back down to 90's. Do you think activision is in the same league as a company that produces consistent hits with sports titles and sims?\n\nI'd say, almost! CoD was not a truly consistent blockbuster until recently. On the blizzard end, WoW was declining until corona hit and everyone needed something to do/ a dopamine hit. Blizzard is taking it's sweet time with new titles, and Activision was locked out of china until now. \n\nSo, if I were to intuit based on patterns and this with terrible math skills and rudimentary stock knowledge, I'd say around $80 is fair to even optimistic based on expectations of new titles. \n\nThat said, since the stock market is larger than one company, political concerns and FED pump will distort that number. It could hit 90 as more people throw money into gaming stocks in general, but it's typically not a very volatile stock",
