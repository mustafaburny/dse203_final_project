        "body": "After we killed the Iranian terrorist dude, Sulamani, about a year ago I went in big on a number of cloud security stocks including $NET.  I am a software and devops engineer with a lot of exp in the industry and I have seen demos/sales pitches from just about every one of these companies and used many of them (good and bad).  So I bought the stocks that I make good products I enjoy using and trust as a consumer of these products.  Full disclosure, I made these picks because their tech works and I feel that technical leadership in this area will beat out accounting, marketing, and other aspects of successful companies.  That bet has paid off with 300-400% gains in the last year for the companies I bought with every penny of available capital \\~yr ago.  Those were $NET, $CRWD, and $ZS I am still long on these.  I also was into $MSFT which is good in this respect and $ESTC (which I unfortunately sold around $100 because they were going sideways). I have since gone into $FROG, $PLTR, and $SUMO which are more recent IPOs.\n\nThere are a few categories of attack that you worry about from an IT organizational standpoint.  This list is in no particular order other than the first one because you asked about $NET.\n\n* Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)\n   * Cloudflare ($NET) is the best protection you can have for this.  End of story.  They have many other products that make them a great company. They have introduced a new set of tools that cover everything you need for a work anywhere company.  They also have made some things that do for cloud computing what CDNs (like Akamai) did for static content.  There main competitors are Fastly, Akamai, and Limelight but $NET is best from tech standpoint.\n* ID management and access control\n   * $MSFT, $OKTA, Ping, Sailpoint from login perspective\n   * $FROG is also good from the perspective of managing access control to intellectual property\n* Malicious websites and phishing \n   * $ZS, $PANO, Fortinet, and a few others play in this space\n* Post attack cleanup\n   * $CRWD is the best here\n   * $ESTC is actually the best but it is open source and european which I think had some negative influences for me as an investor.   Splunk, $SUMO, Data Dog, and Snowflake can also be really good in this regard \n* Secure development\n   * There are a few companies but all of their stuff is hum drum",

        "body": "Between the two, I think NET has more long-term potential than CRWD.  As a personal rule, I never invest in cybersecurity companies that primarily deliver from the endpoint.  The reason is that, while CRWD is certainly a great play today, endpoint solutions seem to come and go all the time.  It's an easier market to disrupt.\n\nOnce a company starts running their critical workloads and applications through the NET infrastructure, I suspect it would be much more difficult to pull away.  NET is more sticky for the customer.\n\nAs an alternative, I would offer up PANW or FTNT.  They have more all-encompassing portfolios of security solutions so they can cover more use cases and they can pivot much more quickly.  They also both are very acquisitive, so they are constantly shifting to where the demand is.",

Which is what im saying. while it is true that the cybersecurity sector is overhyped. \nthere is a reason blackberry wouldnt moon, its because its fundamentals does not show it has the potential to.  \nyou are better off placing your bets on something else that while they have a higher sales multiple, also has higher room to grow.\nfor example, having a good product(s), having good costumers.  \n\nin the vehicles sector, they are competing with msft and aapl.\nin security they are competing vs fortinet and crwd.  if u take a look at their products and offerings, they chances dont look good.",

In a \"sector\" of Cybersecurity it is usually that the top 2-3 companies take like 90% of the marketshare ...

Extrem competition that they cant win unless the innovate so extremely fast what I\u00b4m not seeing coming. \n\nIf you look at the Charts and Compare BB with PANW ... BB just moves sideways (except to recently... suprise suprise) \nso BB went from 7 to 14 ( just the meme basically)  in the last 5years and PANW from 127 to 350.\n\nIf they fail to innovate FAST they will get crushed by the competition.",
