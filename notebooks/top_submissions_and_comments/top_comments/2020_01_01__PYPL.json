        "body": "&gt;Hothi was bewildered by the allegations and taken aback that he\u2019d  become the story. He and his family received racist messages and death  threats. Someone emailed the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where  Hothi is a doctoral candidate in Asian languages and cultures, to accuse  him of having \u201cdisturbing and violent tendencies.\u201d Voicemails left at  the department offices urged his expulsion. Disturbed as he was by the  invective, Hothi also felt profoundly validated: He\u2019d gotten inside  Musk\u2019s head. \u201cI realized that I had won,\u201d he says.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Naturally, he went straight back to Twitter. \u201cThis is my promise,\u201d he tweeted on April 20. \u201cTesla is a zero. u/Elon Musk will go to prison.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Under normal circumstances, TSLAQ would be just  another way for obsessives to find each other online, like #paleodiet  or #juggalo. But these obsessives have proved they can shape perception  and move the stock of America\u2019s most valuable carmaker. \u201cThey\u2019ve put  Tesla under a microscope, and they have succeeded in diluting the  company\u2019s success,\u201d says Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures and a prominent bull. \u201cIt leaves the average person who loosely follows Tesla confused and concerned.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Musk has repeatedly acknowledged the impact of critics and short sellers, often while indulging his more juvenile impulses.  He once sent a package full of short shorts to a regular heckler, the  investor David Einhorn, and he\u2019s blocked a handful of journalists\u2019  accounts on Twitter, including mine. In its most recent annual report,  Tesla cited \u201cscrutiny of critics\u201d as a risk to its business.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cYou  have a fundamental public disagreement on the social value of Tesla,\u201d  says short seller Fahmi Quadir. She isn\u2019t active on Twitter but says she  admires TSLAQ\u2019s democratization of due diligence. \u201cThere are also valid  questions about governance, sustained profitability, and product  integrity.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hothi\u2019s main claim to fame in the TSLAQ community was  his detailed reporting on the factory in Fremont in 2018. His production  estimates were reliable enough to be cited widely by both bulls and  bears. In June of that year, when Tesla erected a massive tent to house a  new Model 3 assembly line, Hothi flew a drone to peer inside the tent,  revealing that the cars were largely being built by hand. This was a  major scoop, undercutting the company\u2019s hyping of its sophisticated  robotic assembly line\u2014its \u201calien dreadnought,\u201d as Musk called it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hothi  was born 33 years ago in Punjab, in northern India, and grew up in  Fremont, not far from the factory. A voracious reader and devout Sikh,  he was obsessed with philosophy in high school but had trouble focusing.  He failed out, then turned things around at a local community college,  eventually transferring to the University of California at Berkeley. He  graduated with a bachelor\u2019s in philosophy in 2009.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The following year, Tesla went public and took over a shuttered  GM-Toyota facility in Fremont, where it planned to build the Model S.  The company and its unconventional CEO  became an irresistible story for the tech press, which routinely asked  if Musk was \u201cthe new Steve Jobs.\u201d In 2013 the Model S was named Motor Trend Car of the Year, the first electric vehicle to win the award in the magazine\u2019s history.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;By  then, Hothi was in graduate school, but he\u2019d developed a side interest  in the stock market. When he wasn\u2019t inhaling the work of post-Marxist  French philosophers, he was lurking on Yahoo! Finance message boards and  shorting dozens of companies, including Tesla and SolarCity. His  skepticism was rooted in the realities of the auto industry\u2014a  \u201ccapital-intensive, operationally demanding, low-margin industry,\u201d he  says\u2014but it was also a contrarian bet against Musk, who Hothi knew had  been fired as CEO of PayPal Inc.  before the payments company went public. \u201cPeople are always like,  \u2018Never bet against Elon,\u2019 but I\u2019m like, \u2018Always bet against Elon.\u2019 He  was a problem at PayPal, SolarCity was a disaster, and Tesla is a  disaster.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hothi argues there\u2019s a profound philosophical question  in the way Musk is perceived\u2014one related to a core tenet of Sikhism, the  prohibition of idol worship. \u201cI see people like Steve Jobs, or Elon  Musk, or Donald Trump,  or Barack Obama for that matter, and I\u2019m not inclined to fall on my  knees and worship these people,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, they\u2019re just ordinary  people caught up in situations.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In 2016, Hothi created an account on Seeking Alpha, an investing  website popular among short sellers, and started posting about the  SolarCity acquisition and other investment concerns. He says it became  clear to him, as he learned more about finance, operating metrics, and  regulatory disclosures, that Tesla was in a tough spot.  \u201cThere was never a moment where I had to realize, Oh man, this genius  is not a genius,\u200a\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it was more that this fellow  selling these cars is trying to get by in a really difficult  enterprise.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Over time, the Tesla shorts on Seeking Alpha largely  moved their conversation to Twitter, a world of brevity and memes. Hothi  joined the social network in March 2017. For skabooshka\u2019s avatar, he  chose a dystopian painting by the late Polish artist Zdzislaw Beksinski  of a skeleton playing the trumpet.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I first contacted skabooshka in June 2018 while  reporting a story about Tesla\u2019s new Model 3 assembly line in the tent. I  thought he might be a contractor or a supplier, or even, based on his  apparent knowledge of the factory and his photos of the tent going up, a  current or former employee. Unsure whether I was looking at the right  tent among the several outside the Fremont plant, I sent him a photo  from the train platform overlooking the factory. This it? \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d  he wrote back.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That June 19 he posted  his first accusation that the assembly line wasn\u2019t fully automated.  \u201cThis is the alien dreadnaught Elon promised: hand-building cars,\u201d he  wrote. (Musk had acknowledged  on Twitter that \u201cexcessive automation at Tesla was a mistake.\u201d) Later,  after he\u2019d posted his drone footage to YouTube, I asked skabooshka if he  wanted to meet in person. He declined because, he said, people were  trying to dox him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In July 2018 an obscure Twitter account with  few followers posted a dossier connecting skabooshka and Hothi. It  included information about Hothi\u2019s graduate studies and social media  accounts and noted that his brother, Gagan Hothi, worked at Volkswagen AG,  a Tesla competitor. The account had never tweeted before (and hasn\u2019t  since), so few people noticed at the time, but Musk seems to have been  aware of it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In late August 2018 the Wall Street Journal published a story about the notorious effort by Musk to take Tesla private, during which he\u2019d falsely claimed via Twitter that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a deal. (As  penance  for the tweet, Musk stepped down as chairman, and he and Tesla paid $20  million each as part of a settlement with the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission.) The Journal story didn\u2019t refer to Hothi  by name, but it mentioned Musk\u2019s contention that short sellers were  trying to undermine him and reported that he\u2019d contacted Volkswagen CEO  Herbert Diess to ask if an employee was criticizing Tesla under a fake  name. \u201cDiess replied saying it was the guy\u2019s brother,\u201d Musk told the Journal. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d (Hothi says his brother, who no longer works for VW, had nothing to do with his thinking on Tesla.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After  Tesla filed its restraining order against Hothi last April, Musk  responded to the July 2018 tweet that mentioned the brothers. \u201cThis is  extremely messed up,\u201d he tweeted. \u201c@VW, what\u2019s going on?\u201d A sympathetic  fan responded to Musk, mentioning the restraining order and saying that  \u201ctslaq must be one of the most insane things that\u2019s ever happened to a  company.\u201d Musk wrote back: \u201cNever seen anything like it. Tesla is just  trying to make electric cars &amp; solar power for a better future for  all. True, we might not succeed, but why do they want us to fail?\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TSLAQ  rallied to Hothi\u2019s side. Lawrence Fossi, an attorney who writes under  the pseudonym Montana Skeptic, organized a \u201cskabooshka defense fund,\u201d  which has raised more than $118,000 on GoFundMe. In his legal response  to the restraining order, Hothi contested Tesla\u2019s description of the  incident with the security guard. He\u2019d driven to the factory parking lot  to ask salespeople at the adjacent showroom questions as part of his  research, he says. Two men approached his car, and one knocked on his  window. Hothi, according to the Fremont Police Department\u2019s report,  \u201cdrove away at a slow rate of speed\u201d and struck an employee\u2019s knee in a  way \u201cthat did not appear to be an intentional act.\u201d Hothi denies that he  drove recklessly or that he intentionally hit anyone.",

One, for example, was about $55k on PYPL calls held through earnings, and they missed. Lost 84% on that one trade. \n\n3. Weak hands on many trades that may have broken even or won with more time. Hence the 1 month out (and sometimes 2 or 3 months out) options. \n\nToday\u2019s plays are much more infrequent and much smaller, nothing over $10,000. \n\nYou might think \u201cdamn, is your life ruined?\u201d No. That portfolio is still 6 figures, and is just one of 3 such portfolios.

I kept switching between CAD and USD since most people on here are American. \n\n10k USD was 14k CAD. \n\n\nI'll explain this in USD:\n\n\nSo the first interest payment is for the loan itself. (For example if someone borrowed 10k and paid it back the same day they still have to pay 1 month interest so the interest is taken directly from the money loaned) \n\nThe second interest payment is because I am a first time borrower from him with a vouch through the acquaintance. If I had no vouch it would be 3 interest payments. \n\nThe second interest payment is subtracted from the principal (so I now only owe 8k instead of 10k)\n\nWhen I pay him back the full 10k I do it as a refund through paypal. The reason for this is because if for some reason I don't pay him back or miss a payment he can do a charge back himself. \n\nInterest is 20%/month on balance of principal. So in 2 months I will have to pay him $1600 in interest unless I pay it down before then. \n\nInterest is compounded monthly, not daily.",

The only problem to work out would be receiving. Moving from the satellite dish down to an antenna in the phone. Obviously it's some years away before that happens but once we could receive starlink internet strait to mobile devices it would end cell services right? So 5g good play on a &lt;5 timeline but not so much later? Could starlink internet be received directly to a mobile device ever? Would cell services just connect to starlink with their towers then broadcast it to the cell phones over 5g frequencies? I'm just trying to get an idea of how things will workout once the full stain grid is up. Is Qualcomm the best 5g play?",

Buying in the afternoon always screws me.  It happens the worst on stocks like Disney, where all the option value is priced in at the very beginning of the day.  When traders realize Disney isn't going to move that day, those options lose a ton of value even though the stock price doesn't move much at all.  You can think you are buying a low at 1:30, but the option value will continue to drop until EOD.  On stocks like Disney and QCOM, i mostly buy EOD, and sell next day at open.",

If we believe growth forecasts.\n\nAs you aluded, Intel's desktop processors have fallen years behind AMDs, who are eating Intel's entire consumer market. However, Intel still have big business in corporate desktops and laptops, with the likes of Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Acer. Intel is also diversified into network controllers, SSDs and embedded ICs.\n\nIn the long term, and I'm surprised no other reply has mentioned this, the writing is on the wall for the x86-64 architecture, which means the writing is on the wall for both AMD and Intel, unless they do something.\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm are invested in making Windows run great on ARM, as is Apple with macOS. This is because ARM is cheaper, and gives twice the battery life. Performance and compatibility are rapidly catching up.\n\nMicrosoft's Surface line has already begun switching from Intel x86-64 to Qualcomm ARM. I am expecting Apple to announce a switch from Intel x86-64 to Apple ARM next year, and it will be a permanent switch, as they look to tightly integrate Mac and iPhone, as well as double their battery life, as well as reduce costs. The Mac represents 5% of Intel's revenue, and it will hurt. But Dell and Lenovo together represent nearly 30% of of Intel's revenue, and they are only waiting on more Windows software to run natively on ARM, and Qualcomm's higher end processors to arrive, which are both inevitable.\n\nIntel can make a comeback. It is a great microprocessor architect. If it went fabless, it could easily compete with AMD and Qualcomm. If it leveraged it's massive size and clout, it could, with some years, lay down the R&amp;D to catch up without going fabless. They probably need new leadership willing to take bigger risks to move faster in these directions.\n\n2020 is probably going to be okay for INTC. The Surface is the first alarm bell. The Macintosh will be the next. Both are relatively small markets, but I would not hang around to watch Dell and Lenovo follow suit.\n\nI hold a small stake in INTC. As AMD valuation is already through the roof, I will be transitioning that stake into TSM and QCOM.",

The premise of M1 is that they let you build your own \u201cETF\u201d if you will (they call it a pie). Pies can contain many different types of securities (stocks, ETFs, etc). \n\nOnce you create a pie, you can deposit as little as $10 to fund it. Since M1 has a concept of fractional shares, you would be able to buy both a portion of Qualcomm as well as a portion of OLED. By purchasing both, you greatly reduce your risk of a failure in your portfolio (being more diversified helps to prevent a situation like one company going out of business). \n\nYou can add as many or as few securities to your pie as you feel comfortable with. Once you have your pie, you can adjust it as you see fit. M1 supports rebalancing too (eg if you have 2 securities and you want them to both be 50%, M1 can readjust for you if one company gets too heavy.)\n\nBy building your own actively managed portfolio, you can control the securities that you\u2019re exposed to, while also making every dollar that you have work for you throughout the year (no more waiting and only putting dollars in the market when you can afford a whole share). As auto investing as a feature offered by M1, some people find it helpful to just automatically add to their portfolio every pay period.",

Your core is global market equity (+ bonds), your satellites are whatever you want them to be: specific ETFs, stockpicks, commodities, crypto. Basically anything you have knowledge about and can give you an edge.\n\nSpecific ETFs will have higher TER so the core also functions to drag your total TER down.\n\nI already said I do this with ETFs only, but I forgot to mention all my ETFs are global.  ETFS are most tax efficient in my case, but also gives no headaches about Elon musk tweeting about farts or having to balance countries. The ETFs will handle it all for me.",
