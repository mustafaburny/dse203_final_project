No need for emerging market funds in my opinion when developed markets HAVE given 25% annual returns and are currently probably undervalued.\n\nI've been buying blue chips.  Yesterday was BA, WDC, DIS.  I've got a few smaller companies mixed in, but those are limited positions.  UBER, OLED, a few like that.  Aside from the three big names I bought yesterday, I've got a lot of S&amp;P500 stocks at/near the top of my portfolio, and I've been adding to those positions over the past week.",

I've mostly focused on companies with greater exposure in their supply chains to Asia. For example, I thought the beating Western Digital took was completely undeserved, and that bet is paying off handsomely.\n\nAs long as the U.S. doesn't trigger a debt crisis, I'm fairly optimistic.",
