We hired the finest archiologists in Nigeria to look under our ground and found $100 billions of more gold.\n\nPlease sir we need a tractor to dig up our gold for only $50 thousands American. If you Paypal us the $50 thousands we will return to you 5% of our gold worth $5 billions back into your Paypal account once we have digged it out of the ground. We will even send you my uncle's donkey who is strong enough to plow 8 fields per week.\n\nPlease hurry we have lots of kind wise investors clamboring loud for this opportunity.\n\nSweetest regards,\nA real Nigerian Prince",

Although the entire industry is getting raped and most of them are not getting any government bailout, still Carnival owns almost 50% of the market and financially the most stable one. Now, plenty of other similar companies will go out of business this year or next and if Carnival manages to pull this through they have the opportunity to increase their market share way above 50%. \n\nThis is a long play and not without risks and I don't like cruises so will not go for it.\n\nOther than this I believe technology stocks which provide cloud services or the infrastructure/hardware to it will remain in high demand (Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google) or companies with loyal and huge fan base (Apple) are safe bet. I also like Applied Materials, basically they're providers to semiconductor manufacturers equipment and technology wise. \n\nI'm personally also looking at Visa, Mastercard and Paypal as they still have plenty of growth potential as I see still many developed countries are relying on payment with cash.",

        "body": "I appreciate it. I\u2019m only on here now because of the quarantine. I\u2019m so bored. Lol. I do find it interesting to read other people thoughts. I\u2019ve been an advisor for over 23 years now and traded options for over a decade. I\u2019ve learned a lot. I\u2019m just trying to help people. I do love trading options and find it very interesting. Here are some of my strategies for trading in general and trading options. Know what your goals are. Write them down. Stay the course and follow your gut. The whole point of trading options is having your wins be bigger than your losses. Take losses at times and be willing to sell a bjt early if you find profit. Very general I know, but mindset and psychology is very important. \n\nIn my limited time here on Reddit, I find many people interested in learning. However, many seem to focus on ETFs, shorting, and hedging their bets. If you like a company go for it!! For example, I love PYPL. When it was 90, I watched it for a while. When it traded down 1-2 points that\u2019s when I put on my ITM calls. I usually put on 1-5 calls on my plays. I also stagger the dates. I watch for earning reports, economic situations and trend / tech analysis. I use the overall trading of the SPY to find certain levels where I feel the markets will hold or trade up to. I watch around 300 stocks. So I have gathered over time a great feel for the markets as a whole. I also notice a lot of people here try to beat the market. Just like betting on sports. I understand to because I like underdogs in sports. But in the stock market I always take the winners. I stay away from oil, energy, airlines, cannabis, hotels, etc. I did recently flip the switch on BA after their restarting to build planes this week. Once I have my plays on, I watch and begin to sell once one is up around 50% or more. But I always leave at least 1-2 on for a monster run, SHOP, ROKU for example. I\u2019m looking for short term gains on my calls on long term gains on my puts. But I\u2019ve learned, this market is incredibly fast and unforgiving. So if you like AMZN go for it, can\u2019t really wait because the markets will move. I usually hold around 5-10 different companies that I have calls on.  Remember the time of the day you place or sell the option on, the expiration and the option volume really matter! You need to watch your plays during the entire market with emphasis on the opening and closing. I\u2019m not looking to hedge my bets, I think it\u2019s a waste Except for covered calls which is an entirely different strategy. \n\nIt seems like most people here are learning and not really trading but I love the enthusiasm. Good luck! I truly wish you well and if you have other questions, let me know.",
