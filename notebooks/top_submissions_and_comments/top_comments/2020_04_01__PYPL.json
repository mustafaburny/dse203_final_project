We hired the finest archiologists in Nigeria to look under our ground and found $100 billions of more gold.\n\nPlease sir we need a tractor to dig up our gold for only $50 thousands American. If you Paypal us the $50 thousands we will return to you 5% of our gold worth $5 billions back into your Paypal account once we have digged it out of the ground. We will even send you my uncle's donkey who is strong enough to plow 8 fields per week.\n\nPlease hurry we have lots of kind wise investors clamboring loud for this opportunity.\n\nSweetest regards,\nA real Nigerian Prince",

Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

All I can say is that, Square\u2019s underperformance and YOY NPV decline from March onward probably won\u2019t come as a surprise to market makers, but Paypal\u2019s overperformance might.\n\nPaypal, on the other hand, will likely see NPV deviate their YOY growth target by anywhere from +/-5%. The trend of companies moving their businesses online is only being compressed. While per user NPV has declined due to obvious macro conditions, small business user base is growing faster than YOY target leaving their NPV unscathed. When earnings makes this plain to see, Paypal will be differentiated and likely hit ATH of 10% over prior peak like Amazon has. \n\nPeople are scanning everywhere for bad news, but need to put their money somewhere. If you want a safer play, try betting on the companies that will definitely outperform, rather than puts on ones that will underperform. The bad news has already been sniffed out. It\u2019s the good news being neglected.",

        "body": "After trial and error (including some very painful errors),  I landed on a strategy of almost never buying calls or puts. The clock works against you as it ticks toward expiration.  I prefer to sell them and let the clock work in my favor.\n\nSo think about stocks you know and sell puts at a price that you would not mind owning the shares (you can always write calls against them) if the stock gets put to you. I sold some April 24 SQ $50s last week and closed out the position today at a nice profit.  Yes, $50 is way out of the money, but there was a decent premium when I sold them. The stock cooperated by not dipping anywhere near $50 this week.\n\nI often close out a position on Thursday afternoon because Fridays have been brutal lately.\n\nWith the volatility we have seen lately and what I consider an irrational rally (which seems to focus on coronavirus news and not the economy or earnings), I am only doing weekly contracts.\n\nI mostly sell puts on stocks that I don't think will drop too far too fast. I only rarely sell uncovered calls, but did sell some DAL calls last week at the $30 strike price, expiring tomorrow. I can't imagine why anyone in \"the market\" thought Delta would go to $30 in this environment, but obviously someone was willing to take that bet and there was a decent premium, so I took it.\n\nI am now looking at positions for May 1 expiration, keeping my horizon very short.\n\nThere is lots of premium in NFLX for example in out of the money calls, yet no catalyst for big stock price moves that I can see, since they just announced earnings. I am looking at $480s and $500s. Margin of safety!  The stock is at $426 as I type.  I could have gotten huge premiums before the earnings announcement, but the risk was too high with such a pricey stock. So I waited until post-earnings and watched the reaction. \n\nI am looking selling May 1 puts on SQ and PYPL as they have decent premiums for May 1. Both can move fast, though, so you have to be prepared to cut your losses if the trade goes against you.  \n\nThese are just stocks I know. I also know T, KO, SO, DUK and MO, but those stodgy dividend stocks move very slowly, so there is not much premium in their options.  Start with stocks you have a good feel for and look for ones whose options have enough premium to make you some money. These tend to be in the tech sector, but not always.\n\nI am avoiding energy stocks because what has happened there is just plain scary. My gut says that a president who said \"drill baby drill\" and obviously has no concerns about deficit spending (as if any politician really does)  -- not even enough concern to lie about it -- is very likely to bail out Big Oil rather than let that critical American industry fail. Bush bailed out banks, Obama auto makers, and Trump is likely to do so with Big Oil. But that's just my political tea leaf reading and I am not speculating on energy stocks -- either way --  based on those gut feelings.",
