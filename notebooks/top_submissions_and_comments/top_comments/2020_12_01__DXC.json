Not to mention they have top tier salespeople. Not sure about BB but I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s a very shit crew. Likely they rely on systems integrators like IBM and DXC to bring them in.

Projected 100% growth each year. 0 debt as of merger. Your window literally turns into the window at the beginning of Total Recall, where it dims itself and shuts off light when you want it to and can turn into a TV/tablet. Its such a sleeper its crazy imo.   \n\n\nOnce they start targeting people's homes, even maybe vehicles, it will change the world.",
