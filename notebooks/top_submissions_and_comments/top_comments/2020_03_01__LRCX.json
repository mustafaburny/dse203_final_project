        "body": "The situation has changed after the 15% run up. Each day that the market moves +=5%, there is more movement under the surface than we were seeing over an entire month last year. Yesterday's smart entry might offer mediocre immediate value tomorrow.\n\nThat said, here are some examples from last week, before the 15% runup. All of these were actual purchases for a fairly large account looking for smart entries for longer term holds of 1-2 years at minimum (bottom price, current price). Any mention of value is referencing a situation closer to the bottom price than the current price.\n\nBlackstone (37 -&gt; 46): Private equity with a solid foundation was offering value and future growth, with a historical precedent for being a smart buy in such times.\n\nStarbucks (50 -&gt; 66): Quality company at a fairly good price. China recovery play. Bought leading into an analyst day with the assumption that it would soothe the extreme uncertainty and draw in some buyers (bought when VIX was 70+).\n\nCapri Holdings (5.62 -&gt; 11.67): Mispriced equity. Was priced below bankruptcy and/or forced asset sales to larger players. Immediate risk was short term debt, which was refinanced to 2023 two days after entry.\n\nVentas (17 -&gt; 31): Mispriced. Priced at bankruptcy with a 20% dividend at the bottom.  REIT with exposures like healthcare that should be priced as under threat or distressed, not literally at liquidation prices. They reaffirmed dividend a few days after entry and the CEO did some PR.\n\nWelltower (27 -&gt; 50): Mispriced like VTR. Retirement home REIT trading with a 15% dividend yield. Strong strong value under the scenario of trending back to a \"return to normalcy\".\n\nLAM research, KLA Tencor, ASML: All have had a decent bump. EUV silicon lithography transition will not be stopped by the virus. An absolute juggernaut of a market force to buy into and put up against the current crisis.\n\nNokia: 5g buy and hold. Mediocre company at a great price. (Sometimes this can have a place in a portfolio. If everything is bought because of the same factors like \"quality company at a good price\", the portfolio will likely share some outsized exposures that need to be hedged against.)\n\nDiscover Financial Services (25 -&gt; 40): Strong consumer credit exposure. Incredible value otherwise. Once the Fed started stepping up to other asset classes it made sense to buy in. When the Fed announced CC debt could be used as collateral it made sense to go in hard. We saw two back to back 30% rises after buying in, probably because of the timely Fed pump.\n\nSabre (0.50 (yep) -&gt; 6): Has an entrenched position in a lucrative market with a valuable tech infrastructure. Strong possibility for a 1000% return in the next 5-10 years from the $3 buy in, outstripping the bankruptcy possibility.\n\nSo there is a recurring theme that you want to try and step away from possible cliff-faces and step in front of possible positive events. Would CPRI be forced to pay the short term debt at the end of the year, have no cash, not be able to sell off quality intangible assets like Versace, not be able to negotiate with their bank, and not be able to refinance? Possibly, but there was arguably a better possibility that they would find some breathing room and stop the drowning and thus the share price.",

        "body": "I mean I half agree with you. Yes you are right that this won't be like the 2008 financial collapse. However, the market was severely overvalued and still is. This new virus is just giving a reason to \"correct\" even more. Yes it's impossible to know where the exact bottom is but I think this has more room to go down. Example: MA still has a PE of 36, even after this correction right now. **Thirty Six!** Yeah they're a cash printing machine and one of the best stocks on the market, but that PE is not justified even for them. It should be between close to 30.\n\nTHAT SAID, there will likely be some industries that could fall close to what happened in 2008 - for example certain airline and gambling companies (AAL and LVS specifically). There was just a [report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-macau-revenues/macaus-gaming-revenues-tumble-87-8-in-february-over-coronavirus-impact-idUSKBN20O1HH?il=0) that LVS saw a 90% reduction in revenue for February in Macau - which is where the overwhelming majority of their revenue comes from. I know they reopened the casinos there a few weeks ago but people are still not coming. What happens if people stop coming to Vegas too because of the virus? That could last a few more months. Remember, they have over $4B in cash on hand but $12B in debt. They will of course bounce back (and I'm sure Adelson would pump cash into it if needed when the time comes, just as he did in 2008/9), but they could literally see their stock fall 50% from where it is now (or even more).",

The worse part is they currently believe it could have been cryptically circulating in Washington for six weeks now.  About the best news, I've seen is the number of cases in China has slowed, at least if you believe them.\n\nSo, the things that triggered the correction have only gotten worse.  Hence why I said this week will most likely be redder.  There very well could be another announcement like you got from Apple/Mastercard/etc as icing on the cake.  \n\nI'm personally not that concerned about the illness itself.  I am more concerned about potential disruptions.  It could seriously put a hurt on your income and life regardless.  I work in the school system part-time and if they were to say close a school down for two weeks, well there goes that income.  It goes beyond catching the illness itself.\n\nI live in Atlanta, about 30 mins from Jackson Hartsfield, I can tell you that Georgia has been already making lots of preparations (I'm surprised because normally our state is four steps behind).",
