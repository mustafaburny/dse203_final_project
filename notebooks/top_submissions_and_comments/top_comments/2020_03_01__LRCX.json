Historically, computer memory has been a commodity and always had boom and bust cycles. Now there are only three players left (Micron, Samsung and another Korean firm SK Hynix) and they do a better job at managing supply. That said we are supposed to be at the tail end of the latest down cycle. If that\u2019s the case then right now would be a buying opportunity. But if we are going into a recession then memory demand will probably fall off and you will be able to get in at a better price.\n\nEither way, LRCX makes the shovels and Micron is the one digging for gold so LRCX is less exposed to these cycles anyways. And on top of that memory is used every where now and will only keep growing. For me it\u2019s just a matter of getting in at the right price again.",

        "body": "The situation has changed after the 15% run up. Each day that the market moves +=5%, there is more movement under the surface than we were seeing over an entire month last year. Yesterday's smart entry might offer mediocre immediate value tomorrow.\n\nThat said, here are some examples from last week, before the 15% runup. All of these were actual purchases for a fairly large account looking for smart entries for longer term holds of 1-2 years at minimum (bottom price, current price). Any mention of value is referencing a situation closer to the bottom price than the current price.\n\nBlackstone (37 -&gt; 46): Private equity with a solid foundation was offering value and future growth, with a historical precedent for being a smart buy in such times.\n\nStarbucks (50 -&gt; 66): Quality company at a fairly good price. China recovery play. Bought leading into an analyst day with the assumption that it would soothe the extreme uncertainty and draw in some buyers (bought when VIX was 70+).\n\nCapri Holdings (5.62 -&gt; 11.67): Mispriced equity. Was priced below bankruptcy and/or forced asset sales to larger players. Immediate risk was short term debt, which was refinanced to 2023 two days after entry.\n\nVentas (17 -&gt; 31): Mispriced. Priced at bankruptcy with a 20% dividend at the bottom.  REIT with exposures like healthcare that should be priced as under threat or distressed, not literally at liquidation prices. They reaffirmed dividend a few days after entry and the CEO did some PR.\n\nWelltower (27 -&gt; 50): Mispriced like VTR. Retirement home REIT trading with a 15% dividend yield. Strong strong value under the scenario of trending back to a \"return to normalcy\".\n\nLAM research, KLA Tencor, ASML: All have had a decent bump. EUV silicon lithography transition will not be stopped by the virus. An absolute juggernaut of a market force to buy into and put up against the current crisis.\n\nNokia: 5g buy and hold. Mediocre company at a great price. (Sometimes this can have a place in a portfolio. If everything is bought because of the same factors like \"quality company at a good price\", the portfolio will likely share some outsized exposures that need to be hedged against.)\n\nDiscover Financial Services (25 -&gt; 40): Strong consumer credit exposure. Incredible value otherwise. Once the Fed started stepping up to other asset classes it made sense to buy in. When the Fed announced CC debt could be used as collateral it made sense to go in hard. We saw two back to back 30% rises after buying in, probably because of the timely Fed pump.\n\nSabre (0.50 (yep) -&gt; 6): Has an entrenched position in a lucrative market with a valuable tech infrastructure. Strong possibility for a 1000% return in the next 5-10 years from the $3 buy in, outstripping the bankruptcy possibility.\n\nSo there is a recurring theme that you want to try and step away from possible cliff-faces and step in front of possible positive events. Would CPRI be forced to pay the short term debt at the end of the year, have no cash, not be able to sell off quality intangible assets like Versace, not be able to negotiate with their bank, and not be able to refinance? Possibly, but there was arguably a better possibility that they would find some breathing room and stop the drowning and thus the share price.",

Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day.

Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle.

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",

        "body": "Great question. \n\nCompanies have been developing a new model for delivery of their services. Traditional IT is considered on-prem or on premise technologies. That can range from servers to applications. Technology vendors have been developing \u201ccloud\u201d technology for years and have been pushing this to market. However, because true cloud or \u201cpublic cloud\u201d is hosted in a vendors data center people are skeptical of using vendors because they don\u2019t control everything. This means all the responsibility is on the vendors to secure everything. \n\nSince cloud is the new way of deploying IT solutions and people are starting to accept the model more governments want in on the benefits of cloud. \n\nBut since the government won\u2019t be in full control of the cloud (see Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Oracle gov data centers) they need a way to ensure security, deployment, and capabilities are met. This is called fedramp. There are multiple levels in getting certified for usage from the government.",

That's only because if you start (and continue) to invest because you somehow believe \"I should start investing\" or \"I should be consistently investing\" (what brokers would have you believe, to ensure their survival) rather than \"I have found a good investment\" then you will always invest an inopportune moments. Buffett invests on very long timelines, using historical trends and ratios as a guide, whereas many investors look at more recent information, and only start investing at the point where recent history shows good returns. I'd say when recent history shows poor returns but long term history shows good, and the particular company you're looking to invest in has some kind of difficult to emulate competitive advantage (be it financial, operational, market, or some combination thereof) then go and invest. Otherwise, keep your money on the sidelines (and let it pile up) whilst you observe the market/industries/companies and wait for a great opportunity to buy. This is what the Oracle does, I think.",

        "body": "Great question. \n\nCompanies have been developing a new model for delivery of their services. Traditional IT is considered on-prem or on premise technologies. That can range from servers to applications. Technology vendors have been developing \u201ccloud\u201d technology for years and have been pushing this to market. However, because true cloud or \u201cpublic cloud\u201d is hosted in a vendors data center people are skeptical of using vendors because they don\u2019t control everything. This means all the responsibility is on the vendors to secure everything. \n\nSince cloud is the new way of deploying IT solutions and people are starting to accept the model more governments want in on the benefits of cloud. \n\nBut since the government won\u2019t be in full control of the cloud (see Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Oracle gov data centers) they need a way to ensure security, deployment, and capabilities are met. This is called fedramp. There are multiple levels in getting certified for usage from the government.",

I think the two biggest dangers are: 1) $CGC price collapses on delisting from nyse back to $TWMJF on otc due to funds that are not allowed to put their pensioners, clients, etc. money in a company trading otc. So $CGC gets stomped into the ground allowing STZ to create an option to buy CGC based on these depressed ass prices; 2) so CGC uses cash to buy a depressed MSO [which one - prices are still wide between some of the peers?], but CGC doesn't have its opex under control yet to operate itself profitably meaning the cash cushion it currently has available is required until CGC reaches profitability. Sooo I have a hard time seeing this as a possibility unless a sudden, multi-tiered plan occurs: CGC announces that: 1) CGC, ACRG, TER all enter into a fuck ton of IIPR sale-lease deals for more cash upfront; 2) CGC will trade back on otc; 3) CGC will acquire ACRG + TER; 4) CGC announces an all cash acquisition of said MSO; 5) In exchange of a shit-term deal with STZ acquiring CGC's shares via option in the future, STZ agrees to provide an upfront premium cash equity infusion of $2B now in exchange for another 25% (or w/e) of CGC to be converted into CGC shares under STZ's ownership upon federal permissibility - along with all of their existing ownership of shares placed into escrow until such federal event...prob with qualifiers allowing STZ to withdraw their option from escrow upon certain events occurring for their own protection, too...hmmm lmao",
