Basically because everyone is buying everything they can get their hands on right now(my company included). I'm still bullish on semi's but it's making me rethink my largest holding(SOXX), it's my largest holding by far.",

AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 0.5%.\n\nGreat news ADI shareholders as China OKs their merger but also this indicates that AMDs acquisitions will likely get approved too. Wise move on China's part overall to allow these acquisitions instead of being spiteful and blocking. Still, I don't think Nvidia will get approved. Too much is at stake.",
