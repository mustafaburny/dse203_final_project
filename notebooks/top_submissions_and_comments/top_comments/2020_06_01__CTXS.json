        "body": "Rate my portfolio: 28  \n\n\n* MSFT - impressive growth with new CEO and who stops them? Leader in the enterprise area as a cloud-service provider, team communications provider, Office 365, data analysis and BI facilities. Missing AI component, but their business is well diversified and very steady. International exposure.\n* AAPL - until revolution in smartphones (like NeuraLink or any other interface which will remove smartphones at all) very decent business. 5G is coming, a diversified business, large pile of the cash in the pocket. Apple Music is eating Spotify pie, new SE &amp; iPhone 12 should be a best-seller during X-Mas time. International exposure.\n* V - leader in the world of payments, slowly entering the crypto area, and its balance-sheet a bit better than Mastercard. In general both are good choices. The only issue is that for Visa default currency is USD, while for MA - EUR, and USD might be weakier soon.\n* INTC - leader in the retail chipset area, right now controls almost the entire CPU area.\n* NVDA - one of the few \"growth\" stocks here. Its P/E is very high, but low leverage, impressive P/S and amazing return on employed capital is making the day. NVDA is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI industry coming, as well as auto-pilot vehicles.\n* CTXS - ok, there is another growth company. Citrix provides capabilities to work from home without buying dedicated hardware. It means you don't need to buy everyone a corporate laptop to enable them to safely join from home. It is held by top index funds, and attracts a lot of S&amp;P 500 clients, who have high hopes in them.\n* BABA - yes, not the AMZN. BABA right now is extremely undervalued. They look absolutely amazing in every financial aspect, and thanks to extreme digitalisation of Asia, their revenue is growing super fast.\n* NKE - from one hand this is a consumer cyclical company, but from another - very strong brand. Their online shopping presens is huge, as well as exposure to a world market including China. I might assume they will stay around for a while thanks to the new trend of being healthy.\n* ACN - top IT consulting company, basically working for every Fortune 500 company. Right now I see 3 factors they will keep growing. At first, companies needed expertise to migrate to new cloud infrastructure. At seconds, companies will reduce their hiring budget for a while, but will instead hire external resources more intensively. At third, ACN made few acquisitions in the cyber-security area.\n* (Disclaimer: I had worked for EPAM for 5 years and might be biased)  EPAM - one of the faster growing IT services companies in the world. They have a very strong expertise in almost every area, like integration of complex IT solutions, cloud migrations, online shopping, etc. I see them a long term winner of the current setup. Also they start expansion to the Asia market.\n* CIEN - another long-term winner of working from home setup providing hardware configurations for organizing IT servers, clusters, telecommunications, etc.\n* LDOS - one more IT services company but working in the aerospace &amp; defense area with governments. One of the key vendors in the area of COVID-19 tracking facilities and digitalisation of government infrastructure to control COVID-19. Currently holds a portfolio of almost $30 bln agreements.\n* AVGO - another 5G chipset producer winner. Very solid diversified portfolio, good fundamentals.\n* TSM - semiconductor manufacturer, one the largest in the world. Produces chipsets for NVDA, INTC, AVGO, AMD and others. In my opinion, if I bet on the chipset industry it would be weird to not bet on TSM who is located in COVID-19 free area now and also has clients not only from the USA.\n* LRCX - yet another semiconductor company, but this time a leader in the area of automatisation of production lines. They produce solutions which help to automate facilities - the thing most factories will look into to reduce risk of COVID or any other pandemic.\n* MRK - one of the biggest healthcare companies. While everyone is watching Moderna, MRK also participates in the race for COVID-19 vaccine and has a very decent fundamentals and portfolio of products.\n* REGN - innovative bio healthcare company, their financial and earnings are skyrocketing with a huge potential to grow.\n* ROG - Swiss based healthcare company, very strong portfolio and financials\n* BAYN - I am not a super big fan of Bayer, but they are definitely undervalued now due to all PR recent PR issues. Expect to grow 50% in upcoming years, with strong fundamentals. \n* VIAC - one of the most undervalued TV companies right now. Very strong portfolio and strong fundamentals, clean balance sheet. Frankly I spent hours trying to find a reason for such a low price and didn't manage to find any except for \"index fund problem\".  \n* CI - insurance industry under the huge hit due to increasing expenses (people suffer from COVID) and reduced payments (people loosing job and might start cutting their spendings), but Cigna looks like one of the best to survive the storm and has a bright future for a long term. Faitly under-valued strong balance-sheet company.\n* SU - European large cap producer of energy, data and sustainability facilities. \n* BN - Another European large cap company: food producer. They position themselves as a healthy food producer, and COVID should not distract them as much as Americans food producers are. \n* HD - One of rare bets on American consumer spending. Leader in the area of organizing houses in sub-urban zones. With growth of WFH setup, more people expected to migrate to the country-side, so in the long term HD might benefit. Their balance sheet is also very solid.\n* VMC - Basic materials bet. Among all other basic materials companies, VMC looks the best. Also, despite I have high doubts about 1 tln infrastructure package to pass the Congress, VMC would benefit from this idea.\n* BRK-B - no introduction is needed. Buffet underperformed S&amp;P for a long time, but his portfolio is decent, he sits on a large pile of the cash and proper timing of deploying this cash would result in a great return later on. Still pretty safe to add BRK into my portfolio, their long term run looks pretty good.\n\nAlso I am considering adding 4 strong dividend companies with still promising futures.  \n\n\n* IBM - it might look like a dying mamont, but IBM for years is a leader of patents. They year by year increase their presence in cloud infrastructure, AI, robotics and other topics. With new CEO targets growth, IBM has a pretty decent future for the moment with a diversified portfolio of technologies &amp; patents. High hopes on IBM AI technologies. As well, IBM pays very huge dividends, so why not hold them for some time?\n* T - the same story but in another segment. Might benefit from 5G, has a diversified portfolio, enters the \"stream wars\" area and pays a huge dividend. As a diversification for stocks who pays small dividends but grow in market cap, good choice. \n* STX - Another high dividend representative from the hardware storage business. This area will stay around for a while, and STX is healthier than their competitors, look like a safe bet for a long term holding. \n* ABBV - And the last high-dividend company from the healthcare segment. There is a lot of analysis of ABBV around, so no reason to repeat it all.\n\nAnd 1 ETF:  \n\n\n* EXV6 - since I am EU resident, I need to invest into UCITS, and this is a basic materials ETF mainly RIO, BHP, GLEN, AAL. This segment supports all manufacturing around the world, why should they have gone?\n\nThat's basically it. I am still playing around numbers to calculate the potential risk of this portfolio and define the proper % allocation of stocks, but what's your thoughts on the companies from the list?",

Paypal and Square missed earnings but the momentum of the market took their stock prices higher. Which is kind of nuts. I'm excluding the big dogs because Apple, Amazon, etc will be fine.\n\nMillions are saving, hurting the US dollar, many companies took on debt to keep things status quo (or to keep the lights on) during COVID.\n\nI foresee companies going out of business because they can't pay their debts in this hybrid-opened world. Fewer jobs available mean less money being made, which means less money coming into the economy.\n\nI'm optimistic that leadership of companies will do well and make smart business decisions. I'm not sure the terms of the debt that was offered by the government, I think it was pretty forgiving. I just want to be realistic, which I why I like to hear what others think too!",

Anyone can stream nearly anything for free or very cheap subscriptions. 30 years ago you had to spend 10-20 dollars to buy one album, nowadays that seems like an absurdity to the average consumer. Ease of access means there is now a panoply of genres and bands. Artists have bypassed large studios and large labels because technology now allows them to record at home with a little investment in equipment, self-publish and promote their work through sites like bandcamp, soundcloud and social media in general. Labels used to be the great gatekeepers and help fund recording sessions; that's not how the industry works anymore.

Everyone sees their stocks and paycheck going up and they celebrate, but they don\u2019t understand or grasp that their money is worth less.  The dollar has this magical power over people.  They think if they get dollars, boats n\u2019 hoes will fall from the sky.  They think that the economy is this magical cornucopia that if you could just  take a little bit more from it than someone else you can guarantee your happiness.\n\nThey don\u2019t understand that a dollar is simply an arbitrary and imaginary measure of value that we all agree to use as a medium of exchange of labor and capital.  Because it\u2019s imaginary, it is fucked with and devalued without anyone even really noticing it.\n\nI used to question the morality of it all.  But over time I\u2019ve grown to appreciate that the inflationary system we have because it keeps people in line.  The working class poor love it because their paychecks get larger which enables them to basically inflate away their debts.  The rich love it because they get better access to capital.  The people who get fucked are the risk-averse savers, people on fixed incomes, and those who live further away (in economic terms) from the money printers (note that many FIRE fundamentalists check all three boxes).  But these people don\u2019t really seem to know this or care.  For example, they blame healthcare cost increases on some nameless, faceless politician or businessperson, but don\u2019t grasp the fact that the reason the costs of high \u201ctouch time\u201d industries continues to grow at 6% compounding is exactly because of inflation.  Productivity increases and capital expenditures can\u2019t control costs in industries like Healthcare and Education because it can\u2019t be automated.  But as long as gas, food, airplane tickets and automobiles stay roughly constant in price people don\u2019t think there is any inflation.\n\nSo, Do you want to bet against that type of a system?  I don\u2019t.  It\u2019s why I\u2019m always long, and I think shorting the market is pointless and always catches back up to whoever takes that strategy.  The inflationary system is here to stay because it works.",

So what\u2019s the point of selling right now if your actually investing for years, decades? None. Especially when it\u2019s super easy to get a loan for rock bottom rates, cash is very accessible for all the big boy investors and institutions. \n\nEveryone constantly downvoted bulls in March for even thinking that a V shape market recovery was gonna happen, for ever thinking we were gonna see ATHs again this year. Don\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten. There\u2019s a lot of remind me bot posts I got coming due soon from March . \n\nOnce again bears, hold this L . Scoreboard don\u2019t lie.

        "body": "Options are contracts.  They are not stocks, they are a contract stating that the holder has the right (the choice, or the *option*) to purchase/sell 100 shares of a specific stock at a specific price on a specific date.  Calls are for purchasing 100 shares on a later date, puts are for selling 100 shares on a later date.\n\nLet's say a stock, we'll call them AAAA for simplicity, is at $100 today.  If you were to buy 10 shares of this company, that would cost you $1000.  You would own 10 shares of that company for $1000 though.  If you instead buy options, you would likely be able to get a couple options instead for the same price.  Let's say that a $100 call on AAAA for next friday costs $5 per share, or $500 per contract.  For that same $1000, you could have 2 calls on AAAA.\n\nIn both scenarios, you're looking for the value of the stock to go up obviously.  If you have 10 shares and AAAA goes up one dollar, you gained 10 dollars.  If you have 2 calls (which is 200 shares worth of an option) and AAAA goes up by a dollar, those calls increase in value as well, although not quite as much, we'll say it increases by $0.50 per share.  That's still a lot.  Instead of making $10 from your $1000 investment, you made $100 instead.  It's not quite that simple though.\n\nCalls (and puts) have an expiration date.  If the call is expiring on the 12th (next Friday), then the value of the stock needs to be decently close or above the value stated in the contract, or the \"strike price\".  In our $100 AAAA calls, if the stock goes below $100 (especially on the Thursday), the value of the call will plummet.  And remember, since these are just contracts, you don't actually own anything with the money you spent.\n\nSince you also spent $5 per share in order to get the call, the value of AAAA needs to not only be above $100 on the 12th to be redeemed (nobody should ever execute a right to buy at a higher than market price, obviously, you'd just be throwing away money for no reason) but it needs to be above $105 in order to make a profit.  You had already paid $5 per share for the right to buy those shares later at $100 per share.\n\nNext, and here's what many people do in order to make their profit instead, *you do not have to hold your contracts.*  If you buy a call on Monday, you don't have to wait until it expires on Friday to make money.  If AAAA jumps to $120 on Tuesday, you could sell your 2 calls for likely $23-$24 per share.  That would turn a $1000 investment into $4600.  What a hell of a gain, right?  If you just had 10 shares, you'd have only made $200 on a 20% stock jump when people who are options trading just made a $3600 or a 460% return.\n\nLastly, the reason that so many people avoid them.  *Options can expire* ***worthless***.  If the stock drops to $95 on Tuesday, those calls are suddenly only $2 per share, you just lost $600.  If it drops again to $90 on Wednesday, those calls are suddenly less than $1 per share, you're at an $800+ loss.  If you had 10 shares, you'd have only lost $100.  On Friday if you still have those calls, if AAAA never hits $100, your calls will expire and you'll have lost the full $1000 investment with absolutely nothing to show for it.  That money is gone for good, no amount of wishful thinking is going to make it come back to you.\n\nPuts are the opposite of calls in a way, they're the right to sell 100 shares at a certain price.  You get a put when you believe the value of the stock is going to drop.  Let's say you have a $100 put on AAAA and the stock drops to $80 on Friday.  On Friday, you would purchase 100 shares of AAAA at market value ($80, or $8000 worth) and then immediately sell it to whoever wrote the contract for $100 per share, or $10000.  That's quite a profit right there too, you made money when a stock decreased in value.  You can't really do that with standard stock trading.  Puts do still come with the same risk as calls in the fact that they too can expire worthless if the value of the stock is above the strike price.  If you have a $100 put on AAAA and the value on Friday is $105, it would be absolutely stupid to purchase 100 shares at $105 to sell them immediately for $100.  Remember, these contracts give you the *option* to buy/sell at a certain price, it doesn't mean that you have to when they expire.\n\nI hope that helps!  If you've got more questions, I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.",

        "body": "Well put! It's always refreshing to hear from the perspectives of learning traders who have *actually learned* something.\n\nFOMO is one of the most dangerous Fears of Trading. This can be FOMO in anticipation or FOMO in reflection. In both cases, you feel a negative emotional reaction to missing or potentially missing a big move.\n\nAs you know, negative emotions are very bad as a trader and can limit your Trading Vision - preventing you from seeing a much clearer move that fits within your own defined strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"missing out\" in the stock market. There are infinite opportunities presented to you every single second. So focus on that. Focus on the stream of infinite opportunities and how you can interpret and decipher this data stream to pluck out trades within your own strategy boundaries.\n\nStick to your rules, manage your emotions, and focus on what is right in front of you.\n\n**I'd love to hear some thoughts from other traders who very recently learned this lesson. What made you learn it? Was it a big trade that went wrong or a big trade you missed? I'd like to hear your story and your interpretation of the lesson you learned :)**",
