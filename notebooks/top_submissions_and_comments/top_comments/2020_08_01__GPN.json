        "body": "Yup, my mistake, they are not issuers, only Disc and Amex do their own issuing. Payments processors DO NOT have a high margin at all. I used to work for one for over 10 years, and yes they do make money but it\u2019s not because of high margin, instead high volume. High volume of transactions going through a processor = decent money. Margins are low. You also have to keep in mind that they most likely do not do their own processing and outsource it to a platform like Global Payments or First Data who charge an interchange fee (base cost). The third party provider (USIO) then pads the interchange by adding a few basis points to it and that\u2019s where money is made on a transaction. Payments processors sometimes make money on fees (statement fees, PCI compliance fees, etc). Anyway, do what you feel, it\u2019s your money, but remember, buy the hype, sell the news. It seems u/varun22486 or whatever already \u201ctook profits\u201d so you should do the same if you\u2019re in the money. If not, wait for the earnings and keep your fingers crossed. This is a small shop in a market where competition is extremely high to say the least. Holding and hoping for this to reach Square levels is a moonshot. Your dime, not mine, just trying to help.",

        "body": "This deal is so odd to me. TikTok is a social media platform that is shrowd with controversy (Microsoft isn't keen on such) with it being banned in some countries, government agencies and companies demanding it be removed immediately off work devices and also flogged as Chinese spyware. So it's a murky deal going in but a popular app nonetheless.\n\nThis would have made SOME sense if we were in 2014 with Windows Phone. Microsoft since 2015 has shed itself from their previous consumer offerings such as Groove Music, W10M and Phones, MSN Health+Fitness and HealthVault, as well as canning almost all of the physical retail stores that were recently oriented towards (very) SMB customers as that was actually where a chunk of sales were legit coming from. \n\nMicrosoft's growth the past few years and ESPECIALLY recently has been dominant with the enterprise and SMB sectors. Consumer products and services aren't where Satya is focused on much at all. Like, Surface nearly was on the chopping block in 2014 if it wasn't a knock out it turned out to be. And to this day, they're focusing on doing what Dell and HPE do with enterprise oriented hardware sales as again, larger revenue streams than consumer.\n\nXbox is obviously their main consumer product and service that is a bright spot here. LinkedIn is more or less a service internally at Microsoft we don't know how money is made off the platform (and also doubles as our job listings board internally that we didn't need to build up from scratch). Not a social media platform really though. Microsoft has dabbled in projects like SoCl before where it was a Pinterest style platform.\n\nThis buyout, I don't unterstand where the tie in could be. As we did with Skype, it got rebranded as Lync for many years and Skype still is around for consumers but included with Office 365. I just don't see where they can realistically add this into an existing service or product to enhance an offering. It very much makes me think this is a foreray into social media, which...ok? If they are doing that, what a weird time to that. Microsoft has a stance of privacy focus and if this gets used for marketing and advertising, that negates a bit of that perceived trust people have with Microsoft. We really don't have a good advertising platform in part due to us not going so hardcore with connecting user data dots across people's devices like Google and Facebook do.\n\nI'm also wondering if Microsoft is trying to play the savior role and being the reason it's not banned in the US, I guess it'll score them brownie points. It'll possibly outshine Snap with SnapChat and stick it to them for being the reason in part Windows Phone failed to grow as Snap refused to even bother with Microsoft. It'll also possibly demonstrate to the tech industry that YES, you can have a social media site that people trust as it's not invading every God damn aspect of that user's life and still monetize it well. They like looking like the noble red herrings PR wise.",

In addition, a substantial majority of our free customers historically have not converted to paying customers and we expect this will continue in the future.\n2. The term of our current agreement with Baidu expires at the end of 2020. Since the on-going tensions between US and China might have an affect on this agreement.\n3. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\n4. Sales and Marketing Expenses are increasing at a rapid pace\n5. Their competitors are well established and they always pose a threat, see below the list of them in each domain\n   1. On-premise hardware network vendors, such as Cisco Systems Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., FireEye, Inc., Imperva, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., and Riverbed Technology, Inc.;\n   2. Point-cloud solution vendors, including cloud security vendors such as Zscaler, Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. through Umbrella (formerly known as OpenDNS), content delivery network vendors such as Akamai Technologies, Inc., Limelight Networks, Inc., Fastly, Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc. through Edgecast, domain name system vendors services such as Oracle Corporation through DYN, NeuStar, Inc., and UltraDNS Corporation, and cloud SD-WAN vendors\n   3.

Cloudflare and google collectively did a research on Browser Isolation. Even though, the results weren't promising, they are working towards it.   \n\n\nAlso, a key point to note is, Cloudflare leverages the idle network bandwidth to provide the free service to their customers since the highest priority is given to enterprise customers. By doing so, they were able to increase their exposure as well as establish more routes that been said, they want these customers to at least go for pay-as-you-go subscription which might help Cloudflare in terms of revenue.",

        "body": "This was EXACTLY what I was thinking. I was about to post this today in the morning.\n\nWith earnings on August 12 after market, here's the CISCO earnings run-up play for you.\n\nCisco is the biggest network hardware provider of the world, but they've been heavily expanding into software and subscription based services (think continual revenue and high margin). Cisco primarly sells network hardware like those little white boxes (access points) you randomly see on the ceiling in schools. It's so hard to describe what Cisco does because its reach is too far and too wide, but here goes nothing.\n\n1. Networking hardware\n\nMost expensive hardware (network switches, access points, and even office phones). They're also the biggest brand. Competitors include Arista, Juniper, Extreme Networks. They all released earnings and beat expectations. Arista did go down after earnings, but it had a really nice run-up and this is a run-up play. \n\n2. Cisco Webex - Webconferencing\n\nProbably the biggest reason for growth is Cisco's Webex. While Zoom and to a lesser extent Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have taken over webconferencing, there's plenty of pie to go around and that's where Webex has come in. From what I researched, it's not particularly great, but it's better than nothing. They tripled growth in WebEx from February to April according to their last earnings report. It's the most related search topic that's trending for Cisco.\n\n3. Cisco Anyconnect - Connect to work network\n\nWith work from home still very much a thing, workers need a secure way to connect to the hospital, college, or business networks. That's where Cisco Anyconnect VPN comes in. I'd say Honestly, there's not really much competition in this area.\n\n4. Security - Cisco Duo and Umbrella\n\nCisco has MFA (multi-factor authentification) for password security. This is taking over more and more especially in universities as you've probably had to annoyingly authenticate logging in using your phone. Cisco Umbrella helps businesses filter websites that are known to have malware. You probably know it as filtering gambling and porn websites. \n\n5. Institutional Ownership\n\nDidn't dig too deep here but Raymond James and Associates are making a big bet on it.  Cisco is their second biggest bet of the quarter after Apple. In the previous quarter, they held a total of 14,069,764 shares (through shares and calls) and now have 15,048,139 (through shares and calls). Since they've bought it, the price has not increased much so they definitely seem to believe in the growth here.\n\n6. Pricing\n\nCisco is still trading slightly below its pre-covid price of 49. It did well last earnings with 0.79 EPS and now it's expected to do 0.74 EPS this quarter. Comparatively, most of its competitors have already seen pre-covid prices at some point or another. \n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:\\*\\* 48C - Aug 21. Sell before earnings. (Hold through at your own risk.)\n\nDisclaimer: I am the furthest thing from a professional of any kind.",

CSCO is not a slam dunk play, no more so than BA, INTC, or DIS tbh",

Intel went from $27 spring of 99 to $74 a year later.  Juniper went public middle of 99 at $20 and was at $218 a year later.  All 4 bounced around the teens for the next 10 years.  These were big profitable even mature internet companies and all are still profitable and around doing well, but at much lower stock prices even now.  Yep, Sun Microsystems was trading at 10 times sales when it was at $60 and long term before and after it was a really good profitable company and a solid $3-5 stock.  BTW, if you take a look at how long it was at $60 (about a week), I had a friend that was an exec and sold his entire holdings (1 mm shares) at $60.   So there were people that made a lot of money in the Dot Com era but they were the ones that sold at the top.  All the ones that thought \"Stonks to the Moon\" were in bread lines a few years later.",

The two indices gained 0.7% and 2.7% for the week, respectively. The Dow (+0.7%) outperformed today, ending the week unchanged.\n\n\u00b7  While the Friday session ended on a firmly higher note, the bulk of the trading day saw the S&amp;P 500 oscillate near its flat line. The technology sector (+1.2%) continued showing relative strength thanks to a big gain in Apple (AAPL 497.48, +24.38, +5.2%), which supported the entire market.\n\n\u00b7  Most of the remaining ten sectors spent the bulk of the day in negative territory, but the continued outperformance in technology emboldened some late buying elsewhere. Only four sectors ended in the red with losses ranging from 0.3% (financials) to 0.6% (energy) while heavily-weighted groups like industrials (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) recorded gains.\n\n\u00b7  Industrials received a boost from Deere (DE 199.50, +8.40, +4.4%) after the company reported better than expected results for Q3 and issued net income guidance for the fiscal year. Transport stocks had a good showing, but the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.4%) still shed 0.2% for the week.\n\n\u00b7  The consumer discretionary sector received some assistance from homebuilders after today's release of a stronger than expected Existing Home Sales report for July, which followed better than expected Housing Starts and Building Permits on Tuesday. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 56.59, +1.20, +2.2%) climbed to a fresh record high.\n\n\u00b7  The energy sector was the day's worst performer, surrendering 6.3% for the week. Crude oil fell $0.31, or 0.7%, to $42.31/bbl, but gained $0.26, or 0.6%, for the week.\n\n\u00b7  Lawmaker\u2019s in Washington did not get any closer to reaching a fiscal stimulus deal while trade representatives from China and the U.S. will reportedly talk in the near future.\n\n\u00b7  Existing Home Sales for July, which soared 24.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million (consensus 5.39 million). That is the largest monthly increase on record, eclipsing the prior record seen in June. Total sales in July were up 8.7% from a year ago.\n\n\u00b7  The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects robust demand for existing homes. That is constraining supply even further, which will be a pressure point that feeds higher prices and bolsters the prospects for new home sales.\n\n**Index Summary -**\n\nS&amp;P 500 +0.36%;  Nasdaq +0.7%;\n\nDOW +0.51%; Russell 2000  -0.74% \n\nVIX:  22.54 -0.18,(  -0.79%)\n\n**Sector Summary -**\n\n*The three highest sectors for today were :*\n\n Information Technology +1.27%;  Consumer Discretionary +0.52%;  Industrials +0.41%;\n\n*The three lowest sectors for today were :*\n\n Energy  -0.63%;  Materials  -0.58%;  Communication Services  -0.44%;\n\n**Commodities -**\n\nGold -  1927.3,(  -0.99%);  Crude -  42.27,(  -0.73%) \n\n*Today\u2019s Option Activity Fast Facts -*\n\n **CBOE Put/Call Ratio -**  0.46\n\n ***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** KEYS with 11 x the ADV of 2439.

The private key is composed of the 'seed words' and should be hidden, as it grants access to the BTC in the wallet.  From what I understand, the more seed words involved makes the encryption harder to crack.

I reverse-engineered the app, and feel confident in stating that I have a very strong understanding for how the app operates (or at least operated as of a few months ago).\n\nTikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, or your device... well, they're using it.\n\n* Phone hardware (cpu type, number of course, hardware ids, screen dimensions, dpi, memory usage, disk space, etc)\n\n* Other apps you have installed (I've even seen some I've deleted show up in their analytics payload - maybe using as cached value?)\n\n* Everything network-related (ip, local ip, router mac, your mac, wifi access point name)\n\n* Whether or not you're rooted/jailbroken\n\n* Some variants of the app had GPS pinging enabled at the time, roughly once every 30 seconds - this is enabled by default if you ever location-tag a post IIRC\n\n* They set up a local proxy server on your device for \"transcoding media\", but that can be abused very easily as it has zero authentication\n\nThe scariest part of all of this is that much of the logging they're doing is remotely configurable, and unless you reverse every single one of their native libraries (have fun reading all of that assembly, assuming you can get past their customized fork of OLLVM!!!) and manually inspect every single obfuscated function. They have several different protections in place to prevent you from reversing or debugging the app as well. App behavior changes slightly if they know you're trying to figure out what they're doing. There's also a few snippets of code on the Android version that allows for the downloading of a remote zip file, unzipping it, and executing said binary. There is zero reason a mobile app would need this functionality legitimately.\n\n... Here's the thing though.. they don't want you to know how much information they're collecting on you, and the security implications of all of that data in one place, en masse, are fucking huge. They encrypt all of the analytics requests with an algorithm that changes with every update (at the very least the keys change) just so you can't see what they're doing. They also made it so you cannot use the app at all if you block communication to their analytics host off at the DNS-level.",

Stocks are the rich mans game in 2020, this isn\u2019t 1950 anymore, stocks are the price that they are at because of a lot of manipulation by our government. I like that you\u2019re in small caps. Learn about Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ampleforth, Decentralized Finance, staking, private keys, exchanges, absorb it all. Jump into the new stuff don\u2019t even think about it just learn as you go. IMO there\u2019s more opportunity in Cryptocurrency than Stocks and I personally think it\u2019s more fun and a 24 hour market and can be done entirely on your phone if you want and buying in is so cheap right now, like pennies to invest in good tokens. If you don\u2019t believe me check out AERGO, a Token that has more impressive partnerships than hundreds of thousands of companies in the stock market. I don\u2019t think that dropping money into an index fund is a BAD idea, but IMO it\u2019s more of an 80s-2010s idea that isn\u2019t going to be as successful when the market is so disconnected from the realities facing America at the moment. I would HIGHLY recommend \u201cHow to Make Money in Stocks\u201d by William ONeil; the founder of Investor Business Daily. His strategies helped me make money in crypto this month in particular. But man just learn. That shit is free. Learn, explore, make folders and book mark shit. Definitely also recommend \u201cSteal Like an Artist\u201d",

        "body": "This will inevitably get downvoted but I don't care. My dad and I run a little family hedge fund of sorts. I can't make as much as him because I simply don't have the same amount, but I'm up 13% this year and it's my first year investing. (I had shit mutual funds until I woke up this year, after realizing that the work I was doing with my dad could be done with my own money too.)\n\nMy dad, however, has turned $170,000 into nearly half a million since this past September, using short options strategies. The idiots on WSB can't accept the truth of the matter, but it's the people selling options that are making all the money. Along with my help, he's developed a strategy of shorting options right ATM, usually covered calls and usually on earnings. HE collects fat premiums, and either gets assigned or doesn't. If not assigned, he just keeps selling calls and might even run the price up a bit for a swing trade esque profit.\n\nThat's in addition to his long accounts that he doesn't touch, in which he's up over 10x since 2010. u/SugarAdamAli has a pretty good list, but I'd add AMD, Facebook, NVDA, and V. AMD especially is going to the moon. Lisa Su is a straight up generational genius and is poised to start eating market share that's incredibly valuable and highly up for grabs. Overall, I think Amazon is the best stock in the world right now though.\n\nWhat I don't agree with u/SugarAdamAli on is that the key is the price. Wrong. There are many keys, and the price is just one of them. If it was all about the price then any company with a high P/E and at an ATH wouldn't be worth buying. AMD has both, and I think is still undervalued. (AMD will be at 500 before 2030, and I think that's conservative.) If there's any 'key,' it's buying good companies and doing it with concentrated amounts.\n\nAlso, diversification is a term that's been beaten to death and people don't understand it anymore. You don't get rich by buying 500 companies which includes Macy's for Christ's sakes. Depending on how much money you have, you buy 10-20 all star companies and keep tabs on their progress.\n\nThe options strategy is another ballgame. There are many ways of approaching it. The best way to sum it up in a few words (even though I could write a book on it, because most people clearly don't understand how and when to use it) is that you never write on companies you wouldn't mind owning. That's a lot different than going straight up long, since going long you only want the companies you have conviction in, the ones you think are going to the moon. With options, I'd write, say, a short ATM put against SBUX, because they're a great company with a solid stock and on an earnings week the premiums will be solid. Oh, and also, you write weeklies. People writing anything longer dated can't do math, and apparently that's most people.",

It was absurd to think it at the time, and it's absurd now. Sustainable, repeatable, consistent gains are the only way to become wealthy.\n\nThe thing about the Bitcoin hard drive sucks. That is a huge problem with cryptocurrency. I read somewhere that 1/5 of all BTC is completely unusable due to lost keys and hard drives. Nevertheless I recognize that feeling of loss.\n\nThe important thing is you learn from \"mistakes\" and you can't let FOHMO (fear of having missed out) cause you take on undue risk in future trades. There was some guy on r/wallstreetbets that got his account from $10,000 to $700,000 and then lost it all.\n\nYou'll get there - it's hard to feel that way. It happens to all of us. \"I was looking at that stock, I should've bought it instead of what I bought\" or \"I should've put some money into $TSLA calls, it was going up, everyone said it was going to the moon.\" But you can't kick yourself over that stuff. Because remember, for every buyer there is a seller. And the guy who paid $2,000+ for $TSLA today because he had the same dollar signs in his eyes, he's got a shot of that stock going either way. Only time will tell how sustainable this rally is and just how much of these new gains the stock is going to be able to consolidate.",

I just spent a solid month learnings the ins and outs and how to really leverage it to my advantage. Hell, I even have a financial advisor set up my RRSP when I was 20 and it's made peanuts compared to what I've managed on my own. I'm going to try and move those TD Index Funds into my own RRSP portfolio and do it my way. \n\nI used to think getting rich was by working really hard and getting a high paying job. That helps but compound interest and money management are the real keys. That's why the rich get richer.
