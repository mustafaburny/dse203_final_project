You can try and get rich quick and be broke for life, or get rich over a long period of time and be much better off. I recommend when you buy stocks, you look at the P/E ratio. It\u2019s price of the stock divided by earnings per share. It gives you a much better indication weather a stock is over valued or not. Don\u2019t look at stock price or % growth, look at the P/E ratio. Right now apple is at 30. The S&amp;P average P/E is like 15. Higher P/E the more investors expect the stock to grow. Hold apple for 10 years and undoubtedly it will be worth more than it is today (not a financial advisor). Apple is a solid buy, and it will continue to grow undoubtedly. For reference amazons P/E is in the 80\u2019s and Tesla is in the 600\u2019s. Focus on solid companies like apple that have a competitive advantage and will continue to grow. I\u2019d look into a S&amp;P 500 ETF. It\u2019s the top 500 companies in the US. It automatically filters the bad companies out and the good companies in. Stop looking at share price and % growth, and instead look at P/E of a company that is established and has a history of growth( pot stocks will always rise and fall no matter what)",

        "body": "&gt;\u201cI think the valuation seems imminently reasonable,\u201d the \u201cMad Money\u201d host said. \u201cIf you want to speculate on a Chinese IPO, you\u2019ve got my blessing to bet on Didi. I would try to get as many shares as you can.\u201d\n\nI think you need to take what he says in context. He says buy this stock if you want to speculate. He says to buy if you want in on a Chinese IPO. He also calls it a bet, which further clarified that this was a bit of a gamble. \n\nThis was a play intended for at a certain type of investor with a certain risk tolerance who wanted to be in a certain sector. This was not general advice aimed at any person who happened to be watching the show. And as new information comes out, I think he has the right to adjust his opinion accordingly. \n\n\nWhen you\u2019re listening to an analyst, it\u2019s never a good idea to just blindly follow their buys and sells without looking at the underlying information the analyst is putting out and seeing if you agree with his or her opinion. Obviously Cramer has gotten a lot wrong but I\u2019ve never had a bad experience buying a stock on his advice because I only buy when I agree with his investment thesis. Some of my biggest winners over the years have come from watching his show, which include apple, NVDIA, Amazon, Facebook and google. And that\u2019s because I only bought a few stocks out of the thousands he talked about that I strongly agreed with his analysis. On a show where one man goes over hundreds of stocks per week it would be insane to think he could make the right calls on all them. Or even a majority. You gotta use your own brain to determine if what an analyst is saying makes sense and really understand the company before pulling the trigger on any investment.",
