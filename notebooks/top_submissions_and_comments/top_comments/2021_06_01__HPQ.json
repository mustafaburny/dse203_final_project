It's estimated that it will cost 1.8mil for a torch, and recurring revenues will bump that number to ~3 mil. 1 business line will justify a 100+ price target alone. Now add in what PYR is doing in the additive manufacturing field, and the potential of their partnership with HPQ to provide the cheapest cost of high purity silicon for multiple applications (including the EV space), PYR is an extremely enticing investment.\n\nMy pt is $100+ in 2 years. A future blue chip company. My position is 14k shares. I am 55/45 all in on PYR and HPQ (which I hold 60k shares).",
