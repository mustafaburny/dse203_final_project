        "body": "Yeah, definitely strange. I just took a look and of those leaving the list, 7 were for debt coverage. \n\nThis score is a pass if (3\\*Net Income) &lt; (Long-term debt). I just quickly scanned AVY and it took on a lot of debt during its last report while CERN had a significant drop in net income as some examples. \n\nMPX does not have positive FCF over the TTM, so that one dropped out. \n\nXLNX left because its earnings yield is not greater than the treasury. \n\nSo it's definitely a mix between the scores, but primarily debt related this month. \n\n\\---\n\nThis is the third time I've run the list, so I don't have a way other than scanning the older lists and seeing the outcome. I'll see if I can come up with a solution for this though.",
