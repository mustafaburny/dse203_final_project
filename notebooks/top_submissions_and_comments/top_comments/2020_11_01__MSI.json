Without a doubt, identifying category winners within the above tectonic shifts, such as Microsoft, Ford, and Standard Oil in the early stages of the growth of those new markets would have been incredibly valuable. Given the obviousness of the current transition to renewables, it is strange to me that this sub spends so little effort trying to identify which company will be the category winner. I think Tesla is likely to be that winner because when you examine their filings, presentations, and quantifiable progress they appear to be scaling better than any manufacturing business in the history of the world. It's a shame that there is so little interest in the study of the company here.\n\nI think you might have missed my point. I'm saying that yes, big changes happen, but if you look at the track record of those companies, how much profit did it actually generate for shareholders? And how obvious was it to know which company would make those profits? Maybe this is the equivalent of buying into Motorola or Nokia on the premise of cell phone supremacy. Or Kodak realizing the potential of a photograph and the lasting memory it creates.\n\nTake a step back and look at this big picture. There used to be 100+ automakers in this country. Of the ones that even did survive, how many are still around? And how many haven't been through bankruptcy? The odds of survival are extremely low even on the back of excellent technology.\n\nRemember that investing is inherently boring. You are debating between 2 birds in the bush and 1 in the hand. In the stock market, the amount of birds in the bush aren't always known without a lot of study and depth. And when will you receive them, with what risks and probability? Is it actually better than one in the hand?\n\nI wish you the best, but you have been warned. Ask yourself where you would have been in the dot-com bubble.",

Essentially he offloaded a shit ton of liability from ANT's (like paypal/venmo in china) loans onto the chinese government aka the chinese people.

        "body": "&gt; you are telling me that you would have all your money in a savings account if we had 0% inflation?\n\nNo, I said that if we had 2% deflation I'd hold all my money in a savings account. However if we had 0% inflation I would probably keep most, if not all of it, in a savings account anyway. I gave the example of pension funds specifically, since pension plans are usually based on capital preservation rather than high growth.\n\n&gt; you do realize that companies still exists and grow right?\n\nAnd companies also shrink and fail. Why take the risk when I know I can get a 2% appreciation every year?\n\n&gt; love that you try and throw around economic rigor as a buzzword, without providing any of your own.\n\nI don't need to provide any \"rigor\" when I'm stating consensus. You're the one arguing the case that challenges all existing theory.\n\n&gt; Thanks for the laugh mate, missed this side of reddit\n\nThe one that questions whether a currency based on wasted CPU cycles can be the basis of a stable currency? Consider this, the number of bitcoin transactions sum to about 0.22% the value of paypal transactions in a given year. However, bitcoin alone consumes more power than 7 nuclear power plants, more than the entire country of the Czech Republic.\n\nA single bitcoin transaction consumes more electricity than a small household does in an entire year.\n\nIf we were to seriously consider adopting bitcoin as a currency, we would need to build over 3000 nuclear power plants to support it. That's before I've even factored in the additional computational expense of adding more nodes to the network (it simply does not scale).\n\nI've got a BEng in Computer Engineering, and am near completion of an MSc in CS from a top 20 university. I've written my own blockchain systems before to learn about it. In fact, I bought my first bitcoin in 2012, and made good money selling it not long after. In total I've made about \u20ac10,000 on bitcoin, so this isn't about sour grapes either.\n\nIn my expert opinion, a blockchain is a slow and inefficient database. Bitcoin is inefficient by design. Transfers are extremely slow, and extremely expensive. This only gets worse as you increase the size of the network.\n\nIf you think it's going to be the next currency, you're a fool.\n\n\n\n\n\n**I'm very happy that you've made these arguments and got your upvotes, it's enough for me to see that this sub is not worth wasting my time on. Have fun chasing the bag kids. What would I know about bitcoin, I'm only a computer scientist.**",

As long as the next republican isn't a Trump 2.0 the US should return back to a normal path of slow and steady progression rather than back and fourth overriding their predecessors policies.",
