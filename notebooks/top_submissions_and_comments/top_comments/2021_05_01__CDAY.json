For Intel,   I do know however that as you increase your technode you must increase your equipment technology.  20 B for new Fabs is not an eye shocking number and anyone who knows semiconductor companies knows this.  \n\nLook at the foundry TSMC majority of output is in Taiwan with only 2 8-inch wafer facilities in the USA.   8 inch wafer facilities are money losers, you spend the same amount to produce them as a 12 inch wafer, but netting less chips, industry current standard or 300 mm or 12 inch.  Those fabs wont be around much longer and they will eventually need to be retooled, and most likely completely rebuilt.    \n\nWhy building in the USA will be so important in the future.   \n\nLook at Taiwan and Singapore two places China would love to control.  Let's say tensions with China intensify and a skirmish or war breaks out there.   There would be a strangle on a lot of chip manufacturing.  Pay attention to trouble brewing in the south china sea.  \n\nIf Intels fabs are up and running they would continue to build un-harrassed in the USA.   \n\nI agree that any time a company takes money for capital expenditures when it is running behind is risky. TSMC IS SPENDING 25 TO 28 BILLION THIS YEAR ON CAPITAL EXPENSES.  Samsung  is spending 28.1 billion this year. The reason Intel is producing more fabrication facilities is so that is can have more capacity which it does not have access to currently.  So the numbers being thrown around are normal for the industry.   \n\nI would have to agree in the short term intel is behind and it will take time for them to get back up.   I do however believe they will be much better positioned going forward.   Their stock already looks discounted. \n\nJust remember semiconductor companies are always playing texas hold em.   They have to put tons of money upfront and then hope everything works out to stay profitable.   Loss of power, interuptions in supply chain i.e. south china sea, would be devastating to any company producing there.  \n\nThe only thing that would push intel higher right now would be an announcement of more capacity,  upgrading to 450 mm wafers, or some new advanced processes that blows away the competition.   They are making more capacity but that yield will be 18 months or more out.  Not a bull or bear hear just my two cents.",

But more importantly, go a step further and understand what competitive advantages a company has to gain future profits without the rise in competition from other companies that will undercut them. Certain companies can find ways to get more pricing power in contracts with other companies or be able to price a little higher with consumers. \n\nFirstly, since the peak in February I'm up 9%, something to keep in mind. \n\nThese high-growth companies everyone gets excited about should be a part of your investment portfolio, but only a part. Many of them will fail or one day be out-competed by another company, while 1 will remain as the next big thing. They're riskier and more volatile in the interim. They haven't made it yet, they're just on the cusp of maybe making it. Look beyond just the recent price performance of the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake CHWY as an example.  They've yet to make a profit. Let me say that again, they've yet to make a profit.\n\nIn 2020 They had revenue's of $4.85B, but their net income with expenses was -$252.37m. \n\nThey still need to do 1 of 3 things generally speaking:\n\n1) Get pricing negotiation power over suppliers to get a higher cut of the products they are retailing.\n\n2) Get a higher price from consumers that are buying the product\n\n3) Get more efficiencies to lower expenses per amount of revenue they take in.\n\nCHWY is getting traction on their stock price, because they are on the edge of being able to turn a profit and possibly grow larger, but they haven't yet.\n\nIf there is any small downtrend in the market, stocks like this are bound to fall faster and deeper. Investor's are paying a premium for a stock that might turn a profit later.\n\nIn the meantime, they offer no dividend, so the stock doesn't give the investor anything back directly. The fwd P/E ratio, with analyst expectations they will be profitable in 2022, is still $442.89 (CFRA).  This means you are paying $442.89 for each $1 they earn. That is extremely high. To be worth the current price, not only do they need to start turning a profit, they need a high enough profit to make that P/E ratio lower between $15-$35.\n\nThis tells me any little news that shows forward momentum of improvement will make investors get excited, but any bad news on the macro-economy or about their suppliers, consumers, or the company can cause larger drops in the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example of a growing retail company that is a more stable investment is TSCO, Tractor Supply Company. They have a growing consumer market on the exurban edge of large and mid-size cities. One of the fewer places brick and mortar retailers have room for growth.\n\nThis is an example of a company that has made it, has room for growth, and the stock is paying out.\n\nThey have had several years of sustained profits. In 2020 They have a revenue of $10.6B and a net profit of $749m. \n\nThe stock is paying a divided to shareholders just over 1% annually.  The P/E ratio is 26.87. This means for each $26.87 in the cost of the stock the company is making $1 after expenses.\n\nWhat to expect is there is room for growth and room for the stock to go down, like any company. But it will be less volatile than CHWY. If there is a small hiccup in the macro-economy investors won't be as nervous. It's a stable company turning a profit that can justify its price without as much future growth. Whereas, CHWY depends on that future growth that is in jeopardy.\n\nThis exercise isn't about saying TSCO is better than CHWY or the opposite. That is not the point and I'd be interested in buying both.\n\nBut this is an exercise in understanding and managing risk. I was some riskier companies with real potential, but I choose carefully what % of my portfolio are those types of companies. I have other parts of my portfolio that are growth companies that have already achieved success and have lower P/E ratios, but are less risky during small downturns.\n\nThen I have another portion of my portfolio that are value companies. These are stable companies that I don't expect much growth (beyond growth from inflation), in fact some are slowly in decline, but they're stable, common to consumers and produce dividends. Sometimes just 2-3%, but sometimes 7%. That is annual income from the stocks, not tied to changes in the share price at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are two important sides to investing, 1) finding companies that will grow and 2) managing the overall risk you're taking in finding that growth.\n\nIt is easy to find growing companies during a long Bull Market, but these popular companies with these large potential upsides in stock price are the riskiest during a bear market or even a small downturn. You're not paying for the profits they are making now, you're paying a huge premium for profits you believe they will be making in 5-6 years vs. a company that is making the profits now.\n\nSo don't just look at the performance of a stock by share price over the last few years, rather look at it on a broader level of how much that company is making for that share price and how down it will probably go in a downturn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might buy some CHWY myself for my riskier portfolio allotments, but I know their profits haven't come close to justifying that price. It is priced at profit potential 2-3 years out and any sign of a potential downturn or problem will cause some volatile dips that aren't always guaranteed to recover.\n\n(Side note: I'm long on TSCO. I needed a good comparison to examine risk. At it's current price, I believe it to be slightly overvalued. It has been a good long-term investment.)",

Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''\n\nLooks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.\n\nWhich company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ? Will AMD still be producing better chips than their last one ? Is AMD going to be around or are Intel, Apple and Nvidia going to push breakthrough things AMD can't possibly match ?

And yes the yield issues are real.\n\nSomething I should have said higher up in the thread is that I don't think the node is Intel's problem.  Their bigger issue is that they don't have a CPU architecture that can compete right now.  The node wouldn't matter so much if the architecture was decent.\n\nThat's why the big.LITTLE designs and chip-stacking stuff is interesting.  They are pouring money into precisely the kind of research it takes to overcome these problems.\n\nIntel's market cap is over 230 billion dollars. AMD's is like 93 billion.  That's today, right now, with all the problems taken into account.  They have the money to \"fix\" this problem.  It sucks that it takes time but it's not like they can just call up a guy and ask for a better CPU lithographer.  It's all cutting-edge few-of-a-kind type tech, and I guarantee Intel is going to find a way to surprise people sooner rather than later.  I'm not saying don't buy AMD. I own 3 AMD gaming PCs in my house. I own a 5700XT, a 1060, and a 1650.  Buy whatever hardware meets your needs, but lets not fanboy into oblivion just to be part of the circle jerk.",

The upcoming RDNA3 chiplet graphics cards are said to be very, very fast and even much faster what NVidia can offer. There are some very promising leaks and the chiplet designs makes it possible to cut the time to market so AMD could probably be 3-6 monts ahead of Nvidia with even better products in the next GPU cycle.\nThis leads to better public recognition, probably higher prices and margins and after all higher revenue in graphics segment.\n\nAlso AMD is switching to 5nm next year when intel just try to improve its 10nm process. The 6nm APU Rembrandt and the 5nm version 1 year later will surely gain more market share in mobile and OEM market.\n\nFor me its most likely that Intel and Nvidia will loose market share to AMD and AMD will increase margins over time.\n\nI think its possible to double the revenue in die upcoming 1.5 years.",

Maybe that's an exaggeration, but I wouldn't touch the stock. There are deep content pools that legacy studios are putting together that will really eat into Netflix, including, ironically enough, the assets of TimeWarner formerly owned by AOL which are now the bundle that is HBOMax. \n\nAny company that isn't an existing conglomerate (like Amazon) that has the word \"cloud\" in its short description worries me. Don't get me wrong, the so-called \"cloud\" is really cool, but I suspect it will be like the old telcos that spent tens of billions burying fiber. Of course, in the long haul that fiber was needed and it was critical for rolling out the data hungry streaming model, but a huge percentage of it got placed and then sat dormant. It absolutely buried companies that were high fliers (you have to understand it wasn't just a dot com bubble, there was an entire telecom bubble as well). A lot of stuff with \"cloud\" in it will probably find a similar fate. There will be winners just like Amazon eventually gained the title of internet commerce king, but the carcasses of the dead will lay across Wall Street only to be forgotten in a few years. \n\nOne that I remember thinking was a turd was PLUG. Look at the max chart on that thing. I still wouldn't buy that. Maybe I'm totally wrong, maybe not. I think TSLA is also overvalued. I'm not saying it's a bad company or anything, but its valuation metrics are way out of whack. \n\nYou have to understand in that era guys would go on CNBC and talk about some new internet IPO was worth x billion because it had y million \"eyeballs.\" I'm not exaggerating. They would multiply page views by 2 and use it as a metric for valuation. That whole thing to me felt like the bigger idiot theory taken to the extreme, but even that feels more reputable than the people who push crypto on CNBC. \n\nI have cash. I want to deploy it because of inflation risks, but there's virtually nothing I want to touch right now so I've just been nibbling on Boomer stocks and swing trading SPY options. \n\nOh, and one other thing. Funds. Back then Janus Twenty was all the rage. They had closed it to new investors. People would brag that they were in it. It had all the high flyers. AOL, Cisco, JDSUniphase, Intel, Microsoft and Oracle. That reminds me of that ARK fund or whatever it is called. Again, not everything in the J20 was a terrible company, but valuations got so out of whack that things like INTC have never returned to their highs and MSFT and ORCL, while good companies, were dead money for over a decade. I think a company like TSLA has the chance to find itself in that sort of company where the stock takes a decade plus to touch its ATH again.",

Thus making chips more in demand and driving up prices. It's already been happening but I don't believe we've seen the true value of what's happening around the globe. (In terms of semi conductor companies) Intel however is a great company, lots of cash, little to no debt, and are inevitably going to be competing for the top spot in the industry.",

It's changing my life so I value it.  I don't look at P/E or anything else.  I don't try to make a buck, I just want to support a company I think highly of.  So far I bought Google and Nvidia during the google IPO (Nvidia for a stock market competition at the time, not as a value buy.), Apple when they switched to Intel processors, AMD when the Ryzen 2 was announced, Tesla when I was giving a ride in a model S early on, and right now I'm taste testing Beyond meat's new version 3.0 meat to see if to me it is a company I want to support.  I also want to get in on Toyota but I'm afraid of the Japanese stock market, but I value them as a company too.\n\nThe trick is not to exceed 10% of your portfolio for value buys (the rest goes into index funds /r/boggleheads style).  I value these companies as a consumer, not for profit reasons.  If I tried to profit I'd be chasing P/E ratios and other order book metrics trying to penny pinch and find the best deal.  That isn't me.  I don't want a second job.  I just want to support what I love, and that is a valid kind of value investing.",

For example, if you work in construction, you learned about rising lumber prices before everyone else, and know which companies could keep up with the demand. If you work in airlines you see when traffic is starting to increase, and which companies are handling the rapidly changing environment the best. If you work with tech, you knew when AMD finally became a serious competitor to Intel. \n\nIf you have a hunch, add the stock to your watchlist, compare their quarter earnings performances to their yearly price chart, and keep your eye on volume. Webull and Robinhood have everthing you need to know even if you don't buy through them. It's amazing to me how many people keep buying SNDL with 100 million in volume every day. That stock is being scalped to death. Low volume and strong price support is the time to buy in. It's an indicator that everyone holding the stock is long, and it's the last thing they'll liquidate because they know it's worth more than it's current trading price. The flatter it trades the cheaper options are on red days too.",

        "body": "\rMining companies are not crypto and a lot of people here are investing in crypto-ETFs without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual crypto either. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. That is a pretty big risk even though they can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

No administration would take him up on that.  They give the public goods away for pennies to cronies.

It's flat out theft, and they make stupid poor idiots cheer for it.  And then when the blizzard comes to Texas and they're facing a $10k power bill, they cry little babies.

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC, BTCX or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

The second part is much more relevant. These exchanges can be hacked and your coins can be transferred without your consent.

So your adress is where it is stored, but the software allows you to mutate the contents. \n\nNow.. if you are still reading :)\n\nWhichever is good for you depends on what you want.

This can be done on some exchanges (Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken), but again, they facilitate, they take. There are some cases where it is preferable though, i.e. when you don't have the minimum required amount to stake.\n\nWell that's all for now :) If you want more info, send a DM or visit us at the cryptocurrency sub.",

If you can't move your crypto to an offline wallet or a wallet where you can stake &amp; earn interest or even just to another exchange, then the implication is that you don't actually own it. Exchanges like coinbase/binance/kraken etc. have minimal risk attached to them but when you start working your way down the list outside the top 10/20 exchanges then the risk of them being hacked, someone gaining access to your account if your security isn't good enough or even the exchange exit scamming goes up.

Gox especially) meant a lot of emphasis was placed on moving your crypto into a personal wallet. \n\nPersonally I have no issue with leaving crypto on coinbase other than the fact you can't stake it there. I'd also have no issue with Binance, Kraken &amp; a few others. Binance especially offers some insane APY rates for staking. There's maybe a handful of other exchanges I'd keep my crypto on outside of that but I've no need to use them because you can get any coin you want on the top ones. \n\nAnd there are no tax implications for withdrawing.

Should have bailed earlier in the day at a $2k loss, but waited it out, ended up taking a $3.8k loss. Made it all back through the week and ended up +$300 by that Friday. But that is the only time I would have lost. But only because I didn't pay attention to upcoming market events.\n\nOpened a 0DTE 4100/4120 on 4/14. Was still stinging from the $4k loss a week before. Watched it dropping. Literally spend 2 hours in a gaming setup with fingers on the up/down keys and hand on the mouse adjusting my limits. Rode it from a $4k loss to $60 gain to $2k loss, roller coaster. Closed at a $159 loss with 45 seconds left in the trading day. Closed at 4124, so I would have been fine. But had $20k collateral riding on it and couldn't risk that for a $550 premium.\n\nThen monday, opened a 0DTE  4165/4175 spread. Panicked and sold at a $700 loss. Recovered right after I sold and closed at 4191. So would have been fine.

So I understand the technology\n\nBitcoin's blockchain keeps track of unspent transaction outputs, in other words the \"balance\" of accounts. An account is a set of private cryptographic keys. Bitcoin is a method of transferring coin ownership from one account to another, in public. Doing these transfers is trivial if you have a private database\n\nBitcoin's blockchain is simply a method of maintaining a public database. The alternative is a private database on bank computers. But you have to trust the banks and the government\n\nTo understand Bitcoin intuitively, watch a real-time animated visualization of the global Bitcoin transaction flow, as it is happening right now. This shows how Bitcoin is being used, right now, in real-time:\n\nhttps://dailyblockchain.github.io/\n\nEach square is a bitcoin address (similar to a cryptographic public key)\n\nEach graph component is a transaction. The components appear as transactions are broadcast into the bitcoin P2P network (but before they are verified and committed to the blockchain)\n\nEach transaction simply transfers bitcoin: from one or more input addresses, to one or more output addresses. In other words, money flows from one or more previous owners, to one or more new owners. That's how a currency works\n\nCoin ownership flows from green to red (yellow is in/out: I pay you and take some change back at the same address)\n\nWhen the output of one transaction becomes an input for a new transaction, the components are pulled together\n\nFor comparison, Visa handles about 1700 transactions per second. Bitcoin transactions are very expensive (mining fees) and very slow due to intrinsic limitations of the technology (broadcast P2P blockchain consensus). The only benefit is that there's no trusted central authority and a deterministic supply of bitcoins (controlled inflation)\n\nHere are the current transaction fees. This is how much you pay a miner to include your transaction in a block. It is very expensive if you want fast inclusion, and very slow if you don't want to pay:\n\nhttps://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h\n\nPro-Bitcoin, you have insane rants from Michael Saylor (CEO of MicroStrategy, often cited as a source of credibility for Bitcoin adoption):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kpfm08/michael_saylor_bitcoin_is_a_swarm_of_cyber/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n&gt;Michael Saylor: \u201cBitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy\"\n\nAnti-Bitcoin, you have serious warnings from real fintech/commodity experts like Buffett:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/l4acdg/buffett_discusses_bitcoin_cnbc_interview_after/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n&gt;WARREN BUFFETT: No, I do not own one \u2013 I don\u2019t own any cryptocurrency.

        "body": "That's fine, most of your points aren't wrong. And I'm not here saying everyone needs to do exactly what I do. I note that silver historically fluctuates between 1:20 and 1:45. Recently it's 1:65ish. You can adjust gold to whatever price you want, but for over 2000 years, silver was worth roughly 1:15 - 1:30 of that price. Unless we want to argue that gold is massively overpriced, a 1:67 ratio (as of today) would tend to point to silver being undervalued. Will it ever \"correct?\" Perhaps not, but it seems like a better place to put my money.\n\nI'll quickly acknowledge that the last 20 years have significantly deviated from past norms. It's my hypothesis that this is unsustainable over the next 40, and that the global banks have printed their way into a tipping point where we may see a shift back towards physically backed assets. It's the same with the digital, where we can clearly see a waning faith in paper currency. Perhaps the latter will be the better performing asset, but I can wrap my head around physical money more easily than a digital, backless one. I'm likely wrong. \n\nI'm not in PMs to try to make great returns, though. I think it's a fine long term store of value, that will counter inflation. Holding physical vs an ETF is a matter of personal preference, and the latter is fine. I personally prefer physical precisely because it's outside of the market. I'm the last person to get into conspiracies about PM ETF holdings, but having the overwhelming majority of my net worth tied to the market, it's nice to have a store of value exist outside of that. The chances of the US going all Venezuela and imploding are extremely unlikely, but if you're bothering to hedge your investments in the first place, it makes more sense to me to just do it \"right\" and hold physical. It's similar to how RH doesn't allow their investors to own the keys to the digital they supposedly own. \n\nI'm not disagreeing with any of your points, but I'm not sure where you get that $19 fee to sell. I can walk down to my LCS today and get spot value. I lose, at current prices roughly $4 on the premium paid, but like I said, they're abnormally high right now. Over a lifetime of buying, they tend to be lower. I understand when I purchase today, that I'm essentially buying at $32/oz. It's my belief that over the next few decades, it will be worth more than that. I'll reiterate that I'm not shooting for any market beating returns, it's a safeguard against any problems. \n\nUltimately, my case boils down to holding physical because I believe it to be a more adequate hedge against a highly unlikely collapse than holding those assets inside the market, and that silver is currently undervalued to the price of gold. Both of those things could very well prove to be untrue, and maybe I end up losing out in the long term. But at only 3% of my portfolio, I'm OK taking the risk of a loss for the downside protection against any crazy devaluation of the dollar.\n\nBut a PM hedge isn't for everyone, so don't listen to me.",

First I need to sleep on time so I can actually be awake to trade \ud83e\udd23\n\nThere are a lot of channels on YouTube, none quite like this guy. I recommend watching his oldest stuff. He mentions his big strategy almost every video. I recommend taking the free \"cycles timing indicator\" seminar too.\n\nAnyway if you can find his entire strategy and learn how to apply it, the pieces are scattered through several videos. Learn to read momentum.\n\nHe likes to find rare indicators for new videos. Honestly he could continue just making videos with the same examples and it would still be a good channel. Just relearning the same few keys over and over.\n\nAgain, mindset. Be humble, but not impatient.\n\nIf I see an entry developing but I'm too early, I often either get stopped out just before profit, or my profit isn't great (like under 1% or under risk). In those cases I've been taking slightly larger risk so I don't get stopped (and I don't place a stop loss, I just watch like a hawk). The thing that helped me here is \"would I enter here if I was going to buy options to take this trade?\" and normally I get a better entry because I want everything to be perfect. Just getting past the options spread can be tough in an hour or two.\n\nSo perfecting the entry makes more money and reduces risk. If a trade isn't going to work out, it should be obvious soon by the indicators, they'll negate the entry relatively soon.\n\nThe PDT rule helps in the beginning because you only get 2 or 3 shots per week. So you're looking for the perfect entry. Or if you have a margin account you can trade with unsettled funds. I like to hold stocks overnight, then sell during the day, and buy back later. This doesn't count as a daytrade so I can take 5 trades per week.\n\nIf everything goes well I should have over 25k in my account within the next 100 trades or so, maybe by the end of the year.

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC, BTCX or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

Some exchanges actually provide you with the coins, other just provide you with exposure to it and give you some kind of object tied to the price action but never the actual transferable coin.\n\nFor exchanges that allow you to buy the coins, just look at [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/) \n\nEtoro, Robinhood and a few others just allow you some exposure.\n\nFurthermore, exchanges give you acces to the coins, but they are never yours, they still can exert influence on them such as freezing the account and you will not be able to transfer or trade.

Last March this thing was a dead horse at 6 bucks then all hell broke loose .\n\n...multiple factors contributed to the greatest run on ammo as long as I have been in the industry ..8 years now. ..national emergency with Covid, Civil Unrest, Police Brutality..looting in Santa Monica, CA of all places, Massive influx of new buyers..the list goes on. \n\nObama was no match for this.  \n\nIt started March 12th 2020 and has been outrageous sales EVERY SINGLE day 417 days in a row!!!!!. Can't keep anyting in stock. Vista has a massive market share(Federal, Blazer, CCI, Speer, American Eagle and now Remington) This is THE ammo stock. They also hold the keys to primer manufacturing which is the reason we are in this mess. The primer shortage caused a backlog and then 10 million new gun buyers wanted to feed their new toys. \n\nSuper Demand City and no Supply easy math. As far as timing..this thing still has some juice left in it I believe and that's because they've had some price increases and recently stated they are behind a billion dollars in orders.\n\nPrice Targets range from 35-49. A consensus buy across the board on most outlets.  I believe all time high was 52 and change..it has a serious shot at beating that.  I have personally spent a year watching and running with this stock.  Seriously hours daily researching this for over a year.\n\nThe negative is there is low volume to move this thing. It's insane. It has taken a big jump, but over 14 months.\n\nThe earnings probably hit 575 million in this report and might break earnings record. It was at 38 not too long ago.  I've owned this since last March at an average of 7.80. I have taken profits twice so far. I now have stock and 35 dollar calls to hit May 21st which are green and also some 40 dollar hail mary calls as well. Those could be dreamers, but I work in this field and it never ends.

This will only continue as more and more serious institutions start to get it and don't want china to control them. \n\n&gt;The ecological impact of running computers to support BTC is insane and currently unsustainable.\n\nEnergy consumption of Bitcoin is lower then our current monetary system (banks, visa etc) in relative terms. There's also a clear trend to sustainable energy usage since mining is location independent and is a way to profit off of otherwise unusable land and wasted energy (deserts/surplus of the power grid etc.)\n\n&gt;Nobody knows the exact origin of BTC, so nobody really knows if there is a back door to hack\n\nKnowing who Satoshi is is irrelevant in terms of hacking. The entire code of the protocol is public since it started. Bitcoin is an open source project and anyone can look at the code if they want to. There are no backdoors and there's no way to build one unless you want the whole world to see it. \n\n&gt;there are a number of early early adopters that hold a huge amount and can tank the market anytime they decide to sell their billions of dollars worth of BTC\n\nOnly point that's fair imo. Although there's something to be said that the market can tank it by now and it won't be the end of Bitcoin. Also I doubt these individuals would voluntarily trigger a market crash by selling billions at once. They obviously believe in Bitcoin's future or lost their keys otherwise they wouldn't have stayed committed to their holdings for this long. \n\n&gt;I think blockchain is a tech that is here to stay, but current versions are basically beta tests.\n\nSmart contract platforms and everything build on them are still in beta/early adopter territory but Bitcoin isn't. Banks and the biggest financial institutions don't adopt technologies that are in \"beta\" Bitcoin is a trillion dollar asset and on it's way to cross the chasm to the early majority.",

Interesting but full of conjecture and vague suppositions, typical for that kind of pitch \"people disagree with me but this is because they are stupid and are part of the machine\"\n\n If VCs where prone to believe every similar line of reason they read like Dan's they would invest after every one of thousands of hockey stick presentations they see. Here is one such gem based on emotional appeal to the outsider:\n\n\"The idea that Satoshi perfectly crafted Bitcoin on the first try is unfathomable for them to consider.\" \n\nTo which the first commentor correctly replies \"Because it's unfathomable that this is true\" and there you have the summary of the two sides of the argument.\n\nEven a brief browse through the Wikipedia entry for Bitcoin will tell you as much based on its history.\n\nThere are so many other problems with BtC but let's just choose one and let's also apply another line if reasoning: how secure is it in a physical sense? People are keeping their keys on physical media in safety deposit boxes at multiple banks because they are rightly concerned people can and would kill them for their Bitcoin or otherwise steal it. Many people who used services for their wallet have been burnt hard. We have laws about the fiet money proceeds of such crimes but people who own BTC do well to be concerned. Whose jurisdiction does solving a theft of Bitcoin actually fall under? Where exactly is Satoshi if he is even a real person? If he is not dead it's pretty dangerous to be him.\n\nThe truth is that BTC is flawed and will be changed/replaced as people solve problems with it. As such it will become obsolete or be updated and when that happens it will be vulnerable and Dans reasoning is flawed on this basis.\n\nI have no doubt there is utility for crypto. I just think investing in any particular technology as an investment asset will be demonstrated to be a huge mistake in 15 years when when we look back on the crypto bubble of 20xx. Many of the Dotcom companies had value there was still a bubble. Except now with crypto we have perfected this bubble. For Dotcom and firms pretended to have value and products or services. \n\nBottom line: Dan is invested",

        "body": "Yes, as a Canadian, there are multiple exchanges available to us such as Newton, ShakePay, NDAX, WealthSimple Crypto, and some Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

        "body": "Taiwan has this little issue called \"China\" 100 miles off its coast, and China has been rattling sabers in Taiwan's direction for the past few weeks -- likely just to see what Washington's reaction is, but China is desperate for chipmaking capability, has failed constantly in developing the technology/know-how themselves, and would probably like nothing more than to do to Taiwan what it did to Hong Kong. \n\nI don't think that China will actually attack Taiwan because Xi knows that it's an open declaration of hot war on the entire world (not just the U.S.) but the threat is there -- the entire world's economy literally depends on Xi not going full Kim Jong Un level of insane on us. \n\nBusiness-wise -- TSMC is completely booked; any new capacity they manage to scrape together is immediately snatched up. TSMC has stated that prices will go up for new orders, but they are still working through the backlog that has been under contract for some time, and the new pricing won't take effect yet. This, plus the threat of China, is what's keeping the $TSM price depressed right now. Beyond that, they have nothing but tailwinds from a business perspective for the next several years. \n\nLook for the semicaps ($AMAT, $ASML, $TER, $LRCX, $KLAC, et al) if you want plays that will see action first from the TSMC, Intel and Samsung capex spending. The fabs will benefit from this capex second, while the fabless companies ($NVDA, $AMD, $AAPL, etc.) will see the benefit of this extra capacity last.",
