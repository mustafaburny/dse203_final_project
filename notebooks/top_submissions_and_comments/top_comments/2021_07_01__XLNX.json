Too much dilution, too few chips coming out of TSM to justify this.\n\nI know no one on Reddit wants to hear this, but Intel will be back at the cutting edge one way or another. Their single thread performance is still impressive, and the foundries will keep them in the game long enough to catch up to AMD's performance.\n\nAny AMD bulls should go to their local Best Buy and try picking up a new Xbox.

Nvidia having something spicy up their sleeve non-withstanding; you never know with Nvidia.   \n\n  Add in plans to buy back 4 billion worth of shares over the next 4(?) Years with cash on hand and plans for 3nm production by 2024 and everything I hear about AMD makes me think up up up. They have new deals with Samsung for their phones and google/amazon for servers, to add to the pile of deals like making chips for Sony and Microsoft consoles.

Only if all necessary regulatory bodies approve the acquisition. Currently China is the last approval required until the merger can occur. Technically China can say no and AMD will most likely decide to not go on with the merger.\n\nBecause the acquisition is a fixed rate of shares. OP is staring at current market prices the value of one share of XLNX currently is cheaper than 1.72 shares of AMD creating a small discount.

CUDA is the way to go!) but for general tasks the power efficiency of Epic chips and the lower price tag is very alluring.\n\nThey're both after Intel's lunch really. The risk here being how well companies trying to push for their own designs / architectures will do (Apple's M1 series, Google's, Amazon's and BABA's proprietary designs etc.). \n\nApart from those don't forget there's also a huge market for embeded, integrated and edge computing as well. I'm not a huge fan of AMD's Xilinx acquisition as we've seen that the use cases for FPGAs are very niche. QCOM most certainly is balls deep in this space, but there is growing interest from NVDA and AMD too!",

        "body": "i love $AMD, however comparing them to NVDA is not the right move. NVDA is a different beast in that they have the growth of AMD while having the stellar gross margins. Investors are willing to pay a premium for NVDA because of how stellar they are in printing cash and profits. That being said, AMD deserves to be priced closer to NVDA than Intel. I do not believe AMD and Su Bae are focused on catching NVDA, and are more concerned with taking market share from and crushing Intel. All the DDs written on here continue to ignore how important the Xilinx merger is. It was hated on by many, but Su Bae is no moron, she is strongly positioning AMD to dominate the CPU and Semi-Custom solutions. AMD will continue to make progress in the GPU and gaming market but the growth and tendies will come from expanding further into and dominating the server industry and building strong relationships that will establish profits for years, as well as expansion into 5g, aerospace and defense, and AI.",

However it's only trading at 1.4816 times more than AMD. There's a massive arbitrage opportunity for XLNX shares (roughly 16.32% realized gains at the end by my math, assuming AMD shares don't tumble randomly) and you only have to wait a few months at the most for the acquisition to be done. I'd say go get some while it's still in the red today. This is not professional financial advice, obviously, so do your own research.",

CUDA is the way to go!) but for general tasks the power efficiency of Epic chips and the lower price tag is very alluring.\n\nThey're both after Intel's lunch really. The risk here being how well companies trying to push for their own designs / architectures will do (Apple's M1 series, Google's, Amazon's and BABA's proprietary designs etc.). \n\nApart from those don't forget there's also a huge market for embeded, integrated and edge computing as well. I'm not a huge fan of AMD's Xilinx acquisition as we've seen that the use cases for FPGAs are very niche.

I don't see it as a potential candidate to breakout anything spectacular.\n\nTSM has been kind of suppressed because of threats from China about Taiwan... I think TSM is a good long-term play though, they are the largest chip fab company in the world.\n\nNVDA has been going real strong with no signs of letting up. With their split coming there's a lot of talk of going up even more due to what happened when some other companies recently did stock splits. Though it is kind of scary buying in while the price is at its peak.\n\nRight now the world is just waiting on China to approve the XLNX / AMD merger, which if it does then that could happen before the end of the year. The prices are pretty much in-sync, so buying XLNX can net you a decent profit if/when it happens. Not sure how LEAPS are handled with mergers and such.",

Investors are willing to pay a premium for NVDA because of how stellar they are in printing cash and profits. That being said, AMD deserves to be priced closer to NVDA than Intel. I do not believe AMD and Su Bae are focused on catching NVDA, and are more concerned with taking market share from and crushing Intel. All the DDs written on here continue to ignore how important the Xilinx merger is. It was hated on by many, but Su Bae is no moron, she is strongly positioning AMD to dominate the CPU and Semi-Custom solutions. AMD will continue to make progress in the GPU and gaming market but the growth and tendies will come from expanding further into and dominating the server industry and building strong relationships that will establish profits for years, as well as expansion into 5g, aerospace and defense, and AI.",

There's a massive arbitrage opportunity for XLNX shares (roughly 16.32% realized gains at the end by my math, assuming AMD shares don't tumble randomly) and you only have to wait a few months at the most for the acquisition to be done. I'd say go get some while it's still in the red today. This is not professional financial advice, obviously, so do your own research.",
