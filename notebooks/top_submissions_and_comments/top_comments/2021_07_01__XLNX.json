Oh and the XLNX acquisition or whatever pending china approval.\n\n  \nAND there are some tasty insider whispers IF TRUE insinuating next gen GPU performance above and beyond what they expect from Nvidia. FULL STOP. Not at bargain price points, or for certain niche applications just straight up expecting to have the best GPUs on the market next gen. Nvidia having something spicy up their sleeve non-withstanding; you never know with Nvidia.   \n\n  Add in plans to buy back 4 billion worth of shares over the next 4(?) Years with cash on hand and plans for 3nm production by 2024 and everything I hear about AMD makes me think up up up. They have new deals with Samsung for their phones and google/amazon for servers, to add to the pile of deals like making chips for Sony and Microsoft consoles. The future looks bright.\n\nI put 90% of my account in AMD last month when they were hovering around 80$ without a single worry and I haven't unwound my position yet. Hoping for 2021 guidance to be adjusted from 50% to 75% growth to set this thing off again. Or merger approval, whatever comes first.",

Only if all necessary regulatory bodies approve the acquisition. Currently China is the last approval required until the merger can occur. Technically China can say no and AMD will most likely decide to not go on with the merger.\n\nBecause the acquisition is a fixed rate of shares. OP is staring at current market prices the value of one share of XLNX currently is cheaper than 1.72 shares of AMD creating a small discount.

I do not believe AMD and Su Bae are focused on catching NVDA, and are more concerned with taking market share from and crushing Intel. All the DDs written on here continue to ignore how important the Xilinx merger is. It was hated on by many, but Su Bae is no moron, she is strongly positioning AMD to dominate the CPU and Semi-Custom solutions. AMD will continue to make progress in the GPU and gaming market but the growth and tendies will come from expanding further into and dominating the server industry and building strong relationships that will establish profits for years, as well as expansion into 5g, aerospace and defense, and AI.",

AMD is about 1/5th of NVDA in market cap.. and it would have to essentially fire on all cylinders in some kind of volume growth segment: AI, Autonomous, Crypto to get be in same ballpark as NVDA... not only through product pipeline but also getting folks to wean off of comparable nvda products. The xlnx acquisition may increase AMD\u2019s TAM but Nvidia is still king in many segments.. I would be surprised if any of that rapid amd growth happens before 3-4 years ..",

The regulator decides at the end of each phase if it's ready to make a decision or if it will move on to the next phase.\"\n\nSo rather than thumbs up, we've got up to 60 days before China gives the go ahead (or delays another 3 fucking months if they so choose).\n\nI don't see it starting to heat back up until a few weeks after earnings.
