This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. **If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, including the Senior Notes, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital.**\n\nLater, in the F-26 exhibit regarding debt, there\u2019s a section referencing $350MM in Senior Notes (basically a bond I\u2019m assuming) that was paid in 2019 using cash on hand. Then another round of Senior Notes were issued in March 2016 that come due in 2021 for $450MM. \n\nThere\u2019s some other debt-related info there that I\u2019m too fucking stupid to grok, but the idea that an unanticipated inability to generate cash flow (like a beer virus interrupting their operations) combined with what looks like a shitload of money coming due in the next year makes my eyebrows perk up. I have no idea if that\u2019s really a lot though or if it\u2019s just business as usual. \n\nProbably too late to get many upvotes, but maybe it\u2019ll catch someone\u2019s eye!",
