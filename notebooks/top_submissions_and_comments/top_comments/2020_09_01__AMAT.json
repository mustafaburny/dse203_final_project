        "body": "Pretty much everyone will list off some of the household names in big tech, like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, ADBE, GOOGL, etc. All of these are industry leaders with solid financials, so they\u2019re probably a safe bet for long-term growth. Though they may be overvalued right now (pretty much everything is). \n\nOther than those, within tech I tend to like semiconductors. I figure that cloud computing, AI, AR/VR, self-driving cars, fintech, bitcoin mining, smart phones and computers, etc. are just going to become a bigger and bigger part of the economy. And computer chips (CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, those chips in your credit card, etc.) are at the heart of all of these technologies. It\u2019s pretty clear that technological progress here isn\u2019t slowing, and demand for chips is just going to continue to grow. If you want to go with individual companies, NVDA, AMD, TSM, AMAT, MU, LRCX are all at the forefront right now, and have solid balance sheets. If you don\u2019t want to put all your money on one horse, a non-diversified, semiconductor-focused ETF like SMH or SOXX will give you exposure here while mitigating some of the risk. \n\nGreen/clean energy is a promising market, but it\u2019s a really young industry so there\u2019s a lot of risk in trying to pick a winner. TSLA is ahead of the pack for now, but it\u2019ll have competitors nipping at it\u2019s heals soon enough, and the stock is currently way overvalued. There are also other sectors of this market that TSLA hasn\u2019t tapped into, and could see massive growth in the next 5-15 years as we begin to wean off of fossil fuels. Again, a focused ETF like PBW or QCLN is a good way to mitigate risk and broaden exposure without having to pick a single winner. That said, this sector may be overvalued right now because oil/gas have taken a big hit during COVID and green energy isn\u2019t quite ready for prime time. In other words, oil/gas are currently cheap and will probably rebound a bit Post-COVID, so you could make money with fossil fuels, but I\u2019d stay out of them long-term and bet on clean energy/vehicles instead. \n\nI also like biotech and genomic medicine. TMO is a blue chip that basically has a monopoly and is a go-to for all biological research. Pretty safe bet on a well run company that\u2019ll be around for years. LZAGY, RHHBY, and TECH are similar, but tend to have their hands in more clinical trials and drug development, mainly with small molecules and other \u2018classic\u2019 treatment methods. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good ETF in this sector, but I haven\u2019t really looked as it\u2019s my field. CRISPR, gene therapy, etc. are all starting to show promise in the clinic, but is a really nascent industry. MRNA and BNTX are probably overvalued right now due to COVID speculation, but if they can get their delivery mechanisms to work (and they\u2019re showing promise), they\u2019ll basically revolutionize medicine. Again, if you don\u2019t want to bet on a single horse, ARKG is a good ETF for genomic medicine. TNX is a very young company that\u2019s showing a lot of promise for sequencing technology, so high risk but potentially very high reward. \n\nOther than that, it\u2019s always a good idea to put money into \u2018boring\u2019 non-risky, non-tech stocks. COST, WMT will probably be good picks during the coming economic crisis, and may actually be able to compete with AMZN if they shore up their online interface. V and MC are solid standbys (can\u2019t go wrong with credit cards). Also probably a safe bet to go with health insurance companies. SPY is also a broadly diversified ETF (basically the tracks the S&amp;P) that will be a safe bet long-term.\n\nMy suggestion would be to pick industries you think will grow long-term, and select a few stocks or an ETF within them. Set up a rather diversified portfolio so you aren\u2019t overexposed on any one front (I\u2019ve lost more than the market with this last slump, for instance, since I\u2019m overexposed in tech; I could probably use more \u2018boring\u2019 stocks like WMT). One or two shares apiece from 50 promising companies is a much safer bet than 500 shares in one or two very promising companies. Keep each at a smallish percentage of your total (I get really uncomfortable if a single stock goes above 10% of my total, even if it began as 1%, so I sell to bring it back down and use the profit to diversify). Generally speaking, the riskier the industry/company is, the lower percentage of your total it should be. \n\nHope this helps!",

        "body": "I'm happy to share some but with a disclaimer:\n\nThe so-called \"experienced investors\" will trash talk it as well as the inexperienced ones (more on this after).\n\nYou may want to skip to my core guiding principles if you don't care about the story. My writing is also pretty rough.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tldr:** I am a strategic opportunistic investor who throws out the majority of common held rules and holds onto key important ones. I focus only on companies that I know and/or use and I time the market. (Go ahead, tell me there ain't crystal balls, I've heard it enough times and I'm not trying to say that there are)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease don't read further if you already have an adverse response to this, because I'm going to write some stuff that I can guarantee will be unpopular here, but it's 100% real and I gave up trying to convince \"experienced\" investors like my father and best friend, who both struggle to beat 10%, whoa re convinced that they \"know how this works\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2007 I started using google finance to paper trade and learn how investing works. I messed around with etrade a little but never put time and effort in and they eventually closed my account due to inactivity and I never got that money back. Over the 8-9 years between paper trading and then getting on Robinhood, I had noticed some VERY reliable trends.\n\n**I can not vouch for them after 2016.**\n\nThe most obvious one was Activision-Blizzard.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###The Curious Case of ATVI and Holidays\n\nI had watched as, several years in a row, there was a consistent pattern between thanksgiving and Christmas. You see, ATVI would dip and then shoot up every single time. As a gamer I asked \"Why?\"\n\nIt hit me.\n\nEvery year ATVI released a Call of Duty game. I dug the first one but felt like it was more like FIFA or NBA games after that. Yet a growing player base and the fact that fans seemed to buy the newest COD game regardless of how many they already had struck me as amazing. I tested my theory and made a couple hundred bucks the next time the cycle came around.\n\nI'm a multi-platform gamer. Console and PC snobs completely misunderstand the mobile trend.\n\nFor me, I have to get out my laptop any time that I want to boot up steam and it's an ordeal at the end of a long day building and running our business. However, plopping on the couch and swiping open my phone is INFINITELY easier. People who weren't previously gamers now were hooked.\n\nSo, when Activision went to acquire King games I knew that all the old farts would be excited. They were. Another thousand or so there. Then the Warcraft movie and Warcraft expansion. ATVI was nailing it in these few areas alone. Yet I stepped away from them progressively more because, quite frankly, as a gamer I really don't like them.\n\nThat is why I no longer trust them as a reliable trend, I just don't follow them the same way anymore.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Trump Trump Trump\n\nNot gonna lie, regardless of political party this dude is a turd.\n\nBut, just like Musk, he does know how to control the media including social media and a lot of the stuff he's done, like the government shut down, has hurt a lot of people but has been an opportunity to make money on the markets.\n\nI feel dirty about that. But an objective view tells me that if I can take those gains and use them for good (such as $600 that I'm putting into a nonprofit next week) then I have to do my best with what's given.\n\nHis chaos has been great for opportunists in the market.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Brexit\n\nOh those poor fools. The announcement of Brexit came at a point where I was confident with the chaos and the fact that it provided me with an asymmetric risk. If I was wrong, worst case scenario was that I had to ride out the storm, beat case I made enough to live for that year. I wasn't wrong.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###Core guiding principles\n\n1. Never invest in something you don't know\n\n2. Target asymmetric risk/reward opportunities\n\n3. Build an intuition and trust it, but also analyze\n\n4. People way over complicate this. Just stare at a limited number investments every morning for 1-2 hours and check the news on them. Ask WHY what you see is going on. Do this every day and eventually you'll have an intuition for what's going on.\n\n5. Understand that sometimes it's completely irrational because it's people and dumb algo trading\n\n6. It's not a loss if you didn't get the max gain\n\n7. It's not a loss if it's value drops but you can hold on till better times\n\n8. **Know when to let go** on both ends\n\n9. Catch a falling knife (or a rising one). You're never going to hit the perfect bottom so just get the most gain you can (my father fucks this up so much that it hurts. He claims that he's waiting for the bottom and then he misses it and says \"oh well\")\n\n10. Play long and short term: Applied materials ain't going anywhere anytime soon, enjoy their dividend\n\n11. Ignore 99% of what everyone tries to tell you about investing\n\n12. A poisonous snake is just that. This is, ultimately, gambling. However, you absolutely can have an advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've been downvoted to oblivion on this sub because people either want to hear \"YOLO WSB BITCHES\" or old-school ignorant advice.\n\nI don't do options because I know them but I don't understand them. This frustrates me but I simply haven't been able to bridge that gap and I have 2 businesses and various outreach projects to work on.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI don't expect you to agree or like this and go ahead and deconstruct it and nitpick.\n\nThe take home is this:\n\nI'm happy with beating the market and what others think the cap on \"the best you can do\" is and whether you want to agree or not is irrelevant. I'm going to continue and it's going to continue paying for the things I do.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###The Elephant in the Room\n\nEveryone is right about this next election. It's going to be like Brexit.\n\nMy recommendation. No. What I am doing, is I am getting out of positions at a point where I'm happy with the gain and I'm going to have cash ready to buy every goddamn thing that I can when things tank.\n\nIf they don't, that's fine, but my gut says that the likelihood that they do, regardless of the way the election goes, is pretty high.\n\nThere IS a small chance that things go up.\n\nI AM OK MISSING OUT ON THAT.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI sold shares in Amazon before they broke 1000 and tesla before the big rallies.\n\nThat sucks, but I don't think it's useful to play \"what if\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith things as chaotic as those, I feel that it's late for me to get back into Amazon and I'm fine with that, there are PLENTY other fish in the sea. I've been an Amazon seller since 2006 and it was clear that they would grow, but I exited my positions at a point where I was happy and I don't look back.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat I hope to be a Takeaway:\n\nI stopped trying to comment on this sub because it was overwhelmed with \"smart\" people who apparently know something. I get it. I've read some of the famously recommended books and heard the lectures and videos. It was only as valuable as learning what people think about this stuff. I don't need to learn various chart types for what I do. I haven't cared about candlesticks. Sure, maybe you use them as tools in your tool belt but what I'm saying is that they are unnecessary. It's garnish if you understand the core of how people work. I also simply don't have the time anymore to look into that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat was a long-winded way to answer your question but I hope it helps some in both giving direct and indirect answers.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Edit:** I am so so so very stupid. I thought this was r/Robinhood and looking back at the post it's very very obvious that I was commenting for the wrong sub.\n\nPlease destroy me people, I clearly deserve it.",

Still long $FXF Swiss Franc because they cannot even control their currency rising against the Euro.\n\nI am going to set up a poor mans covered call on BETZ or DKNG or both.  2022/2021 calendar calls on SPXL.\n\nShorting OXY.

Cost 1.80.    \n\nIf rocket shoots up to like 80....lose all extrinsic value....spread is worth 2.00.    Needed to make sure spread was larger than premium paid.   After that...anything less than a massive sell off is profitable.  It could dip a little, trade flat, or go up.   Based on bad wsb info that i should've double checked, thought it was gonna go up a little at the very least.    \n\nResults, It sold off a little and I sold my spread for 3.05 this morning.  Stock went down, made profit on a bullish spread...iv is a bitch.   \n\nCurrently had avgo sept 4 / sept 11 call spreads at 375.  Bought for 0.4, sold half for 1.2.  Already booked a profit.    Expect good numbers...more so it just didn't have the run up the other semis implied it should have...., sell off because bitches are scared. Then a run up next week.",

        "body": "Broad Market:  That's tough to say.  If your very bullish on Tech stocks, QQQ might be your best bet. If you want a broader fund, then VOO is a good one.  QQQ uses the NASDAQ 100 as its bench mark while VOO uses the S&amp;P 500 as its benchmark. The top five holdings are the same for each of these, but in different percentages.  Another broad market fund I like is IWF. IWF uses the Russell 1000 as its benchmark.  It has a very good track record and seems to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over time. It's very similar to QQQ in its holdings, but again, percentages are slightly different.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices for a broad market fund. \n\nTech:  You'll get lots of opinions on this.  ARKQ and ARKW would be the choice of the ARK funds if you want it to be purely tech.  If you want to invest in disruptive innovative companies, but don't mind expanding beyond tech, consider ARKK. \n\nAnother one I like for tech is XLK. However, you have to keep in mind that XLK is almost 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft.  If you believe in those two companies, consider this one.  (VGT is very similar). \n\nSOXX is a fund that invests in semiconductor technology. One thing I like about this fund is that there will not be a lot of crossover between this one and your broad market fund.  Top holdings include: QCOM (9.5%), NVDA (9.5%), AVGO (8.3%), TXN (8%), INTC (5%). \n\nWCLD:  Cloud computing is a great sector, but be aware that many of these companies will also be in QQQ.  Top holdings include ZM (2.4%), CRM (2.3%), PLAN (2.2%), CRWD (2.1%), WDAY (2.1%). One thing I like about this ETF is that the investments are much more spread out than most ETFs. So, if any one company in the ETF is affected by bad news, it should have little impact on the ETF as a whole. I think WCLD is an excellent choice. \n\nClean Energy ETF:  I like ICLN like many others on this site.  I think the clean/renewable energy sector is really going to blossom over the next 10 years and I think ICLN is one of the better ETFs in the sector. Others you may want to look into include:  PBW, QCLN and TAN.",

Rather than invest in a point solution company, I'd recommend looking at a security company that is much more diverse like a Fortinet or Palo Alto Networks.",

I dont think networking is going away any time soon, and I think some large cloud providers will inevitably partner with them, and it wont be Cisco since they offer their own competing cloud.\n\nI also like Kingsoft.  If you believe in cloud computing, and you believe China wont let any company stay with an American owned cloud company, Kingsoft offers their cloud services along with WPS Office.  They are the closest thing to a Microsoft of China, and priced far below Alibaba.  Either they get bought out, or they continue to grow in order of magnitudes.",
