        "body": "Maybe, but I think it might take longer than most people think. Tech firms sell to governments. Microsoft is one of the largest military contractors around the world. Pretty much every country's military runs windows.\n\nJust listened to the q3 earnings call. Cloud demand is up like crazy right now. So, money is being shifted away from local resources into cloud computing resources. So many of AWS and Azure customers are shifting money into these tech companies. Smaller firms like NetApp, Atlassian, or Slack are seeing sales raise with this new demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, there are entirely new markets for tech that weren't viable pre covid. Consider the NFL, NBA....I can't remember the sport, but they now use MSTeams. Companies are seeing the cost benefits of remote work. Virtual Formula 1 is another example. Things are going to be interesting. To stay competitive, you will need to piviot into this new economic situation. Red Robin is an interesting case study. They cut costs like crazy and embraced off site orders. Or look at Trupanion's 10K. They cut costs and increased cash on hand to a point where they can operate for an entire year w/o income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to remember that there are millions of dollars worth of human intelligence driving the decisions behind each of these Tickers. Boards are made up of people with way way way way more industry knowledge than anyone on reddit. Yes, Tesla exists, and a tweet can swing billions of dollars around the moon, but for the most part, companies are ran by intelligent folks trying their best to make money. That's it. Even if the world is on fire, these people will find a way to sell you insurance on credit. The economy has existed since before the old testament. Exodus 30:11-16  is just ancient hebrew tax law. Even if it's not money, people will find something to trade to create value. The wheel keeps on turning.\n\nEDIT: Totally forgot, look at MSFT 10K. B2B OEM sales are the bread and butter. So you will need to see large retailers (including amazon) collapse before companies like intel and MSFT will feel the big hits.",

Now this is Jan-March so April was probably better as both US demand increased and China supply improved. Also based on his quote in Feb it showed that issue. \n\nThat said I still think they probably blew on the earnings side, as their product mix of Laptops to Desktops certainly changed. With seeing Nvidia's numbers the workstation (and obviously gaming)  improved nicely yoy. I would think HPQ should at the very least get to the 52 week moving average. Also Lenovo just reported pretty good numbers even though their stock did not respond muhc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDell: From the Laptop/desktop side, Dell 100% blew it out the most. IDC shows they had it figured out in Jan. Also with a large amount of sales going direct.  Their margins should be even better and they sell attach with that. Logi showed great numbers and that would sell through Dell. \n\nThat said their enterprise business is def screwed. It is already a tough market and with budgets all going to WFH, no one is buying capital equipment if they can delay. This is where the money is made. Cisco showed infrastructure is down,  HPE showed the same. Dell will have a large hole there. \n\nThey also have a big part of VMware which I personally think will have a good quarter as well. Although on-prem virtualization will not have great numbers, VSphere in AWS will, NSX, and most importantly horizon for VDI (look at Citrix numbers). Although vSphere is now considered more legacy to a certain degree everything still runs on it.\n\nLong story short I think Dell is going to be a tough one to call and would just pass but maybe buy VMware\n\nI made 250% on HPQ and cashed out the end of last week but might buy back in for some FDs.\n\nPoss:\n\nNetApp NTAP $45p 5/29\n\nplan to buy FDs for VMW and HPQ",

Look at the recent yoy growth of BRK vs SPY. Technology is the new paradigm and while airlines and oil are relics in the near future. Why go for a business trip/meeting when they can just use Zoom or Facebook? Not making the shift is foolish, even a blind man can see better than this oracle. What's more BRK is backed by Buffet, if he croaks, so does the stock, he is the face of the stock, regardless of whether he acknowledges it or not. What's more, he doesn't bother about learning technology because he doesn't need to anymore, in 10 to 20 years he wouldn't even participate in the stock market anymore. But the landscape would be vastly different from before, already we see tech giants ruling the market now, I wonder what will happen in the future?",

So why buy Berkshire instead of an index?  It has only 1 real tech exposure, Apple, so if you think tech is a bubble it's an incredibly safe investment relative to the market at large, which is being dragged upwards by tech.\n\nThat said, I don't invest in BRK personally. I just think you'd be dumb to downplay his incredible success for such a long period just because market fundamentals are incredibly hard to exercise on tech. \n\nThe only way to invest that much capital in that sector is to blow your load everywhere like Masayoshi Son, become the richest man in the world, then lose the largest amount of money in history when the bubble inevitably pops.",

        "body": "Google is search based on text and hoping websites adjust to that using SEO soft influence. Their banners are more and more lowering quality of search and overall search use is dropping due to apps and closed websites. They are big but a niche. Their model works for specific products only.\n\nFacebook is a developing world family and friendship automation. A lot of room to grow in places like Bangladesh. But technology which delivers value to customers is actually simple and they can easily be replaced. They are based on soft value not tech. \n\nAmazon us big in USA. It is a big country which used mail order catalogs way before internet. You can not have a store everywhere in America. Rest of the world isn't like that. They have been adding value to their offering because they want to offer the most for least like all retail but eventually someone will take this over. Just that their competitor can not be in USA or Europe. Europe is too small.\n\nData means nothing to customers. Customers want value for money. Data maybe can help speed up selection within millions of products but this doesn't really work as good as they promise. Ads and e-commerce recommendations are very much off once shoppers are not super easy predictable. Data and AI are a hype.\n\nMicrosoft also is a business software company with some diversification. In business it succeeds just like SAP and Oracle etc. It enters and it is hard to get it out. Not many players there as well as CIOs don't take much risk. But it's success is not because of them but simply because of digitalisation and globalisation. Microsoft itself hasn't created any relevant competitive value. They are just a big political entity in the right time and place. If something changes for them it will also change for SAP Oracle IBM etc. But they appear to be different because of hardware and games (more consumer) and Bill Gates always spent a lot on his PR.",

That's like those tards that bought up all the TP at walmart and then were caught trying to return it in two weeks because nobody was buying. Yea sure some people didn't have enough in the bathroom (savings) and maybe ran low until they implemented purchase limits (unemployment being raised by $600 a WEEK), but fucking again, what TP factories blew up? people aren't shitting more except traders figuratively, so you wait for the next shipment or two that was coming anyway and now you got your TP. Like seriously? They just dumped like 2-3 Tah-rilllllion dollars and most of it to companies to pay people, and to go directly to the one's no longer at companies. So most people have the cash they would normally expect because most people don't make shit. You know how much of that was to pay Buffett what he normally expects? Anybody over 100,000 didn't get what they usually make and if anything they probably sold part of their holdings in the crash. Instead, you have people wondering whether they should get their cash from unemployment or from their employer, worried that they'll get hired back too soon and lose some of it. Yes, hoard cash when the government is pumping out trillions and sell when the market is at a 40% discount. Oracle. Genius.",

Boeing, Tyson Foods, GE, IBM, Oracle, all the commodities companies are going to be seeing double digit percentage decreases in their sales and revenues.  I feel like Boeing has to go bankrupt, and so many of their suppliers will too.\n\nThe market for many products, e.g. commercial real estate, airplanes, oil drilling equipment, has literally disappeared, and the stock market has not priced that in yet.\n\nThe Fed has propped up an enormous bubble with their actions, but the economy doesn't reflect what they have created.  \n\nAt some point the central banks will have to let SOME investors get wiped out, and that is going to be a very unhappy day on the stock markets.\n\nFord and GM are in staggeringly bad financial shape, nobody is saying anything about it.  Every major airline is going to be going through a bankruptcy cycle, Disney is likely to lose 75% of their revenue for the year.  How the hell can the indexes be at these levels?",

So why buy Berkshire instead of an index?  It has only 1 real tech exposure, Apple, so if you think tech is a bubble it's an incredibly safe investment relative to the market at large, which is being dragged upwards by tech.\n\nThat said, I don't invest in BRK personally.

Why go for a business trip/meeting when they can just use Zoom or Facebook? Not making the shift is foolish, even a blind man can see better than this oracle. What's more BRK is backed by Buffet, if he croaks, so does the stock, he is the face of the stock, regardless of whether he acknowledges it or not. What's more, he doesn't bother about learning technology because he doesn't need to anymore, in 10 to 20 years he wouldn't even participate in the stock market anymore. But the landscape would be vastly different from before, already we see tech giants ruling the market now, I wonder what will happen in the future?",

Boeing, Tyson Foods, GE, IBM, Oracle, all the commodities companies are going to be seeing double digit percentage decreases in their sales and revenues.  I feel like Boeing has to go bankrupt, and so many of their suppliers will too.\n\nThe market for many products, e.g. commercial real estate, airplanes, oil drilling equipment, has literally disappeared, and the stock market has not priced that in yet.\n\nThe Fed has propped up an enormous bubble with their actions, but the economy doesn't reflect what they have created.  \n\nAt some point the central banks will have to let SOME investors get wiped out, and that is going to be a very unhappy day on the stock markets.\n\nFord and GM are in staggeringly bad financial shape, nobody is saying anything about it.  Every major airline is going to be going through a bankruptcy cycle, Disney is likely to lose 75% of their revenue for the year.  How the hell can the indexes be at these levels?",

So why buy Berkshire instead of an index?  It has only 1 real tech exposure, Apple, so if you think tech is a bubble it's an incredibly safe investment relative to the market at large, which is being dragged upwards by tech.\n\nThat said, I don't invest in BRK personally.

        "body": "Google is search based on text and hoping websites adjust to that using SEO soft influence. Their banners are more and more lowering quality of search and overall search use is dropping due to apps and closed websites. They are big but a niche. Their model works for specific products only.\n\nFacebook is a developing world family and friendship automation. A lot of room to grow in places like Bangladesh. But technology which delivers value to customers is actually simple and they can easily be replaced. They are based on soft value not tech. \n\nAmazon us big in USA. It is a big country which used mail order catalogs way before internet. You can not have a store everywhere in America. Rest of the world isn't like that. They have been adding value to their offering because they want to offer the most for least like all retail but eventually someone will take this over. Just that their competitor can not be in USA or Europe. Europe is too small.\n\nData means nothing to customers. Customers want value for money. Data maybe can help speed up selection within millions of products but this doesn't really work as good as they promise. Ads and e-commerce recommendations are very much off once shoppers are not super easy predictable. Data and AI are a hype.\n\nMicrosoft also is a business software company with some diversification. In business it succeeds just like SAP and Oracle etc. It enters and it is hard to get it out. Not many players there as well as CIOs don't take much risk. But it's success is not because of them but simply because of digitalisation and globalisation. Microsoft itself hasn't created any relevant competitive value. They are just a big political entity in the right time and place. If something changes for them it will also change for SAP Oracle IBM etc. But they appear to be different because of hardware and games (more consumer) and Bill Gates always spent a lot on his PR.",

That's like those tards that bought up all the TP at walmart and then were caught trying to return it in two weeks because nobody was buying. Yea sure some people didn't have enough in the bathroom (savings) and maybe ran low until they implemented purchase limits (unemployment being raised by $600 a WEEK), but fucking again, what TP factories blew up? people aren't shitting more except traders figuratively, so you wait for the next shipment or two that was coming anyway and now you got your TP. Like seriously? They just dumped like 2-3 Tah-rilllllion dollars and most of it to companies to pay people, and to go directly to the one's no longer at companies. So most people have the cash they would normally expect because most people don't make shit. You know how much of that was to pay Buffett what he normally expects? Anybody over 100,000 didn't get what they usually make and if anything they probably sold part of their holdings in the crash. Instead, you have people wondering whether they should get their cash from unemployment or from their employer, worried that they'll get hired back too soon and lose some of it. Yes, hoard cash when the government is pumping out trillions and sell when the market is at a 40% discount. Oracle. Genius.",
