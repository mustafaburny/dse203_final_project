This drone delivery industry will be common place in the future, maybe not for household city deliveries, but for rural and remote locations it'll end up being the cheapest and fastest way to get stuff. Oil rig in Northern Alberta broken down and need a new part to repair? Way faster than a truck, way cheaper than a helicopter or plane",

Imagine a drone could deliver an AED to any emergency site and provide earlier medical assistance to a critical patient? Applications ready to change the world",

Pros of SCR is their present reach of CAD sports fans and CAD sports gamblers (C-218 passed!) as well as their small float 50M or so shares, Rogers Comm backing.... Cons I have read that their autonomous TECH approach is ambitious and could lead to huge obstacles instead of just buying an already present platform for their app. Also their revs aren't huge with respect to market cap.... FLT.....Pros.. reach in the already moving global drone industry (with DSV and deal with Edmonton Airport), has 5(?) Patents. No debt virtually. Nice cash balance. Cons....pre-revenue company essentially at this point......their CEO sold like 200K + shares at the top in FEB 2021. I get people need to be paid but woof. Lots of socioeconomic obstacles to drone usage despite FAA support up to this point. Pretty sizeable float at 200M+shares....I think that covers it. Give me some criticism or an opinion. Thanks",
