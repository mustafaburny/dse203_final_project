Cons I have read that their autonomous TECH approach is ambitious and could lead to huge obstacles instead of just buying an already present platform for their app. Also their revs aren't huge with respect to market cap.... FLT.....Pros.. reach in the already moving global drone industry (with DSV and deal with Edmonton Airport), has 5(?) Patents. No debt virtually. Nice cash balance. Cons....pre-revenue company essentially at this point......their CEO sold like 200K + shares at the top in FEB 2021. I get people need to be paid but woof. Lots of socioeconomic obstacles to drone usage despite FAA support up to this point. Pretty sizeable float at 200M+shares....I think that covers it. Give me some criticism or an opinion. Thanks",

People have yet to fully grasp the potential of what the drone can do, or as Cathie wood puts it, EVTOLS. And there are a lot of companies racing to get to the top, but IMO so far from what I\u2019ve seen from the other drone companies is that draganfly has the most credibility and probable chance to really land some big name contracts or government contracts. They\u2019re under really good management, unlike some other drone companies named in this thread which now some people understand why I don\u2019t like ALPP.",
