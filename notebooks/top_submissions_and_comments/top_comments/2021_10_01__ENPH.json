System still going very strong. Had to call tech support for help with their monitoring device in late 2019. The phone tech told me, at the end of our phone call, that ENPH was about to soar in stock value, and has many great projects on its horizon, and that I should consider buying a few shares. I wasn't into stocks at the time, but I looked it up after the phone call- it was $20 per share at that time. I thought at the time, that $20 a share is nothing. Enphase must be BSing me! I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nAnyways, yeah. That's my personal ENPH story I guess lol.",

First Solar (FSLR) jumped 4%, SunRun (RUN) lifted 3.3%, SolarEdge (SEDG) surged 4.7%, and Shoals Technologies (SHLS) climbed 1.8% in the premarket trade. All four companies are manufacturers of solar panels, batteries, or systems for solar energy projects.\n\nIn the third quarter, Enphase saw record sales of\u00a0$352 million, up from\u00a0$179 million\u00a0a year ago and ahead of analyst expectations of\u00a0$345 million, according to FactSet data. Net income was\u00a0$22 million, beating estimates of\u00a0$16 million, while an adjusted measure of net income showed\u00a0$84 million\u00a0in profit. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was\u00a0$ 0.60, ahead of estimates of\u00a0$0.49.\n\nEnphase expects to set another record for revenue next quarter, with outlook for sales to be in the range of\u00a0$390 million\u00a0to\u00a0$410 million.\n\nEarnings came on the back of the company announcing a new type of energy system driven by its IQ8 solar microinverters, which convert the direct current (DC) generated by solar panels into alternating current (AC).\n\n\"Many homeowners often assume that their solar systems will function if the sun is shining, even during a power outage. This has unfortunately not been true until today. Now, with IQ8 homeowners can realize the true promise of solar -- to make and use their own power,\" president and CEO\u00a0Badri Kothandaraman\u00a0said in a statement.\n\nAnalysts at investment banking advisory group Evercore reiterated their \"outperform\" rating on Enphase shares, which they've given a price target of\u00a0$216. Enphase stock ended Tuesday at\u00a0$173.46, so Evercore's target implies 25%- plus upside. The analysts said the company was \"in the midst of a breakthrough new product cycle\" with IQ8.\n\nThe team at Evercore, as well as analysts at asset manager\u00a0Guggenheim Partners, also noted that the company continues to face supply chain and logistics challenges, but that it was doing a good job of handling them.",

        "body": "My non-financial advice to you or anyone, is to go for calls instead of puts for ENPH. I had similar thoughts as you are having for ENPH right now, I also feel this applies to my experience with TSLA as well.\n\nENPH is undervalued in my opinion, and is constantly beating financial expectations every single quarter for the past two years I've been tracking it. This year I've only done slightly out if the money calls for ENPH, such as ~$10-20 out of the money, expiring the friday after the current week that I'm buying them in. Buy them on a red downtrend during the day, and I've literally made money every single time from this. \n\nENPH puts will very likely end up costing you in the end, rather than rewarding you.\n\nUntil ENPH hits around $300-350, its undervalued in my experience/opinion and do not underestimate its ability to soar $20-50 in a single week and manage to keep its momentum there afterwards, much like TSLA always seems to do as well.\n\nI'm honestly kind of shocked that ENPH doesn't get more spotlight on reddit, because it certainly should. But then again, that would invite more hedgies over as well, which wouldn't be good.\n\nSo yeah, ENPH calls. I have 30 calls expiring next week(10 for $235 strike, 10 for $250, 10 for $260). \n\nHopefully I post here again next week confirming that all of these printed for me! Best of luck in whatever you end up deciding to do \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd19",

The other remaining 25% I have over a dozen stocks. Many speculative; some I like the business model, some I like the industry. I also carry some closed end, high dividend (CLM is doing better than the S&amp;P), REITs, and clean energy (RUN and ENPH).\n\n95% of traders quit.

This is important in terms of sheer compounded returns from time of investment.\n\nUPST wasn't even that low but comes close to one that exploded from that range (ish). \n\nEven stocks that are speculative and with minimal revenue but huge potential and a pedigree of sorts like DNA come onto the market with a huge and arguably bloated market cap\n\nIf you want sheer returns, looking for a company that has a large TAM or one that can expand and a more manageable market cap can ensure bigger returns over time.\n\nThat said, market cap bias is a real thing. I expect there to be many trillion dollar companies in the next decade. So when, say, INMD hits 100 billion, not much to be alarmed about if the entire market has grown in market cap.\n\nINMD is a great bet, by the way. Continues to execute amazingly well and expand into new sectors. Reminds me of ALGN.\n\nAnother thing is to look at TAMs themselves that will expand. Software for instance makes entirely new markets and that's why it eats the world and took so many by surprise. Apple made a whole new mobile economy with apps, ad tech, Lyft/Uber...possible. MDB is just a database company, for instance. Who cares? Well, people found uses for it, use the product, and the company makes money. Boom, TAM made with MDB the leader. And look at TAMs that encroach on or eat away at incumbents, fintech being the classic example. \n\nBiotechs are the other area where stocks can go from 1 dollar to a 1000 over a decade. Hard game to play. JAZZ for instance delivered those returns. IDXX has been extremely successful. ENPH (not bio) is a solar company that produced a unique product and has amazing management, making its returns over the past decade possible. Right now, I am intrigued by a ticker that stands for \"anti tumor necrosis factor\" (the initials); look at the research, scientists, TAMs of the drugs, and past successes. At 200 million market cap, nothing is baked into the share price. SDGR and ABCL are biosimulation companies that have huge possible TAMs and a unique revenue generating model -- people see big potential and possibility there.\n\nStill, TSLA is a social phenomenon. It's not a company anymore. To understand it, look up how \"mimetics\" (where the term \"memes\" comes from) have taken over the market. Explains at least a little of the TSLA phenomena, and more recently UPST",

System still going very strong. Had to call tech support for help with their monitoring device in late 2019. The phone tech told me, at the end of our phone call, that ENPH was about to soar in stock value, and has many great projects on its horizon, and that I should consider buying a few shares. I wasn't into stocks at the time, but I looked it up after the phone call- it was $20 per share at that time. I thought at the time, that $20 a share is nothing. Enphase must be BSing me! I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nAnyways, yeah. That's my personal ENPH story I guess lol.",

First Solar (FSLR) jumped 4%, SunRun (RUN) lifted 3.3%, SolarEdge (SEDG) surged 4.7%, and Shoals Technologies (SHLS) climbed 1.8% in the premarket trade. All four companies are manufacturers of solar panels, batteries, or systems for solar energy projects.\n\nIn the third quarter, Enphase saw record sales of\u00a0$352 million, up from\u00a0$179 million\u00a0a year ago and ahead of analyst expectations of\u00a0$345 million, according to FactSet data. Net income was\u00a0$22 million, beating estimates of\u00a0$16 million, while an adjusted measure of net income showed\u00a0$84 million\u00a0in profit. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was\u00a0$ 0.60, ahead of estimates of\u00a0$0.49.\n\nEnphase expects to set another record for revenue next quarter, with outlook for sales to be in the range of\u00a0$390 million\u00a0to\u00a0$410 million.\n\nEarnings came on the back of the company announcing a new type of energy system driven by its IQ8 solar microinverters, which convert the direct current (DC) generated by solar panels into alternating current (AC).\n\n\"Many homeowners often assume that their solar systems will function if the sun is shining, even during a power outage. This has unfortunately not been true until today. Now, with IQ8 homeowners can realize the true promise of solar -- to make and use their own power,\" president and CEO\u00a0Badri Kothandaraman\u00a0said in a statement.\n\nAnalysts at investment banking advisory group Evercore reiterated their \"outperform\" rating on Enphase shares, which they've given a price target of\u00a0$216. Enphase stock ended Tuesday at\u00a0$173.46, so Evercore's target implies 25%- plus upside. The analysts said the company was \"in the midst of a breakthrough new product cycle\" with IQ8.\n\nThe team at Evercore, as well as analysts at asset manager\u00a0Guggenheim Partners, also noted that the company continues to face supply chain and logistics challenges, but that it was doing a good job of handling them.",

I had similar thoughts as you are having for ENPH right now, I also feel this applies to my experience with TSLA as well.\n\nENPH is undervalued in my opinion, and is constantly beating financial expectations every single quarter for the past two years I've been tracking it. This year I've only done slightly out if the money calls for ENPH, such as ~$10-20 out of the money, expiring the friday after the current week that I'm buying them in. Buy them on a red downtrend during the day, and I've literally made money every single time from this. \n\nENPH puts will very likely end up costing you in the end, rather than rewarding you.\n\nUntil ENPH hits around $300-350, its undervalued in my experience/opinion and do not underestimate its ability to soar $20-50 in a single week and manage to keep its momentum there afterwards, much like TSLA always seems to do as well.\n\nI'm honestly kind of shocked that ENPH doesn't get more spotlight on reddit, because it certainly should. But then again, that would invite more hedgies over as well, which wouldn't be good.\n\nSo yeah, ENPH calls. I have 30 calls expiring next week(10 for $235 strike, 10 for $250, 10 for $260). \n\nHopefully I post here again next week confirming that all of these printed for me!

        "body": "Tesla IPOd at 2 billion IIRC. How many companies these days are IPOing at that market cap today? This is important in terms of sheer compounded returns from time of investment.\n\nUPST wasn't even that low but comes close to one that exploded from that range (ish). \n\nEven stocks that are speculative and with minimal revenue but huge potential and a pedigree of sorts like DNA come onto the market with a huge and arguably bloated market cap\n\nIf you want sheer returns, looking for a company that has a large TAM or one that can expand and a more manageable market cap can ensure bigger returns over time.\n\nThat said, market cap bias is a real thing. I expect there to be many trillion dollar companies in the next decade. So when, say, INMD hits 100 billion, not much to be alarmed about if the entire market has grown in market cap.\n\nINMD is a great bet, by the way. Continues to execute amazingly well and expand into new sectors. Reminds me of ALGN.\n\nAnother thing is to look at TAMs themselves that will expand. Software for instance makes entirely new markets and that's why it eats the world and took so many by surprise. Apple made a whole new mobile economy with apps, ad tech, Lyft/Uber...possible. MDB is just a database company, for instance. Who cares? Well, people found uses for it, use the product, and the company makes money. Boom, TAM made with MDB the leader. And look at TAMs that encroach on or eat away at incumbents, fintech being the classic example. \n\nBiotechs are the other area where stocks can go from 1 dollar to a 1000 over a decade. Hard game to play. JAZZ for instance delivered those returns. IDXX has been extremely successful. ENPH (not bio) is a solar company that produced a unique product and has amazing management, making its returns over the past decade possible. Right now, I am intrigued by a ticker that stands for \"anti tumor necrosis factor\" (the initials); look at the research, scientists, TAMs of the drugs, and past successes. At 200 million market cap, nothing is baked into the share price. SDGR and ABCL are biosimulation companies that have huge possible TAMs and a unique revenue generating model -- people see big potential and possibility there.\n\nStill, TSLA is a social phenomenon. It's not a company anymore. To understand it, look up how \"mimetics\" (where the term \"memes\" comes from) have taken over the market. Explains at least a little of the TSLA phenomena, and more recently UPST",

So the next thing I look at is the P/E ratio.  FTNT currently has a P/E ratio of over 100.  For comparison, the S+P 500 is at about 28 right now, with a historical mean of about 16.\n\nI don't know anything about the company, but a quick Google search says that they're in cybersecurity.  I guess investors are betting on them being important in the near future due to all the ransomware attacks, etc., therefore they're willing to pay an extremely high multiple for future earnings.\n\nMe personally, I don't buy stocks like that.  It's speculating.  Yeah, if the growth story pans out, better to get in now than later.  But if it doesn't, you're left holding a very big bag.  Every now and then you might get an Amazon for $250 even when people like me are saying it's overvalued.  But do you think all the companies trading at this valuation are going to end up being the next Amazon?  Probably not, so it's basically gambling.\n\nI prefer to invest in companies with a valuation that is reasonably justified in the present, while still taking into account *reasonable* expectations for growth based on historical numbers and trends.  It's a winning strategy that doesn't rely on the rosiest of assumptions in order to pan out.",

Same with ELY and so many more. Even Boomer stocks aren't safe. I'm why JNJ has gone down since Aug and PG since mid Sept. If I touch it, it's going south. I literally cause the peak to reverse in anything I touch. Guaranteed. I used to be very good at SPY, but now even that has inverse.  \n\n\nI feel like I have a duty to use these powers for good.
