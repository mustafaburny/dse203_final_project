I can't tell you at what price to sell though, so tread carefully and set your parameters before entering the trade :D\n\nAlso, when I bought my house in 2017, it already had enphase microinverters from 2014. System still going very strong. Had to call tech support for help with their monitoring device in late 2019. The phone tech told me, at the end of our phone call, that ENPH was about to soar in stock value, and has many great projects on its horizon, and that I should consider buying a few shares. I wasn't into stocks at the time, but I looked it up after the phone call- it was $20 per share at that time. I thought at the time, that $20 a share is nothing. Enphase must be BSing me! I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nAnyways, yeah. That's my personal ENPH story I guess lol.",

        "body": "Paywalled so:\n\nSolar specialist\u00a0Enphase Energy's\u00a0(ENPH)\u00a0earnings were so good that the entire sector was shining bright Wednesday.\n\nFremont, California-based Enphase 's third-quarter results smashed\u00a0Wall Street's\u00a0expectations, as the leader in home solar energy systems and a pioneer in inverter technology reported record revenue after markets closed Tuesday.\n\nEnphase stock jumped 15% in U.S. premarket trading, helping the\u00a0Invesco Solar Exchange-Traded Fund\u00a0(TAN) -- which counts Enphase as its second-largest holding -- rise 3.9%.\nThe rest of the sector was beaming, too. First Solar (FSLR) jumped 4%, SunRun (RUN) lifted 3.3%, SolarEdge (SEDG) surged 4.7%, and Shoals Technologies (SHLS) climbed 1.8% in the premarket trade. All four companies are manufacturers of solar panels, batteries, or systems for solar energy projects.\n\nIn the third quarter, Enphase saw record sales of\u00a0$352 million, up from\u00a0$179 million\u00a0a year ago and ahead of analyst expectations of\u00a0$345 million, according to FactSet data. Net income was\u00a0$22 million, beating estimates of\u00a0$16 million, while an adjusted measure of net income showed\u00a0$84 million\u00a0in profit. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was\u00a0$ 0.60, ahead of estimates of\u00a0$0.49.\n\nEnphase expects to set another record for revenue next quarter, with outlook for sales to be in the range of\u00a0$390 million\u00a0to\u00a0$410 million.\n\nEarnings came on the back of the company announcing a new type of energy system driven by its IQ8 solar microinverters, which convert the direct current (DC) generated by solar panels into alternating current (AC).\n\n\"Many homeowners often assume that their solar systems will function if the sun is shining, even during a power outage. This has unfortunately not been true until today. Now, with IQ8 homeowners can realize the true promise of solar -- to make and use their own power,\" president and CEO\u00a0Badri Kothandaraman\u00a0said in a statement.\n\nAnalysts at investment banking advisory group Evercore reiterated their \"outperform\" rating on Enphase shares, which they've given a price target of\u00a0$216. Enphase stock ended Tuesday at\u00a0$173.46, so Evercore's target implies 25%- plus upside. The analysts said the company was \"in the midst of a breakthrough new product cycle\" with IQ8.\n\nThe team at Evercore, as well as analysts at asset manager\u00a0Guggenheim Partners, also noted that the company continues to face supply chain and logistics challenges, but that it was doing a good job of handling them.",

        "body": "Tesla IPOd at 2 billion IIRC. How many companies these days are IPOing at that market cap today? This is important in terms of sheer compounded returns from time of investment.\n\nUPST wasn't even that low but comes close to one that exploded from that range (ish). \n\nEven stocks that are speculative and with minimal revenue but huge potential and a pedigree of sorts like DNA come onto the market with a huge and arguably bloated market cap\n\nIf you want sheer returns, looking for a company that has a large TAM or one that can expand and a more manageable market cap can ensure bigger returns over time.\n\nThat said, market cap bias is a real thing. I expect there to be many trillion dollar companies in the next decade. So when, say, INMD hits 100 billion, not much to be alarmed about if the entire market has grown in market cap.\n\nINMD is a great bet, by the way. Continues to execute amazingly well and expand into new sectors. Reminds me of ALGN.\n\nAnother thing is to look at TAMs themselves that will expand. Software for instance makes entirely new markets and that's why it eats the world and took so many by surprise. Apple made a whole new mobile economy with apps, ad tech, Lyft/Uber...possible. MDB is just a database company, for instance. Who cares? Well, people found uses for it, use the product, and the company makes money. Boom, TAM made with MDB the leader. And look at TAMs that encroach on or eat away at incumbents, fintech being the classic example. \n\nBiotechs are the other area where stocks can go from 1 dollar to a 1000 over a decade. Hard game to play. JAZZ for instance delivered those returns. IDXX has been extremely successful. ENPH (not bio) is a solar company that produced a unique product and has amazing management, making its returns over the past decade possible. Right now, I am intrigued by a ticker that stands for \"anti tumor necrosis factor\" (the initials); look at the research, scientists, TAMs of the drugs, and past successes. At 200 million market cap, nothing is baked into the share price. SDGR and ABCL are biosimulation companies that have huge possible TAMs and a unique revenue generating model -- people see big potential and possibility there.\n\nStill, TSLA is a social phenomenon. It's not a company anymore. To understand it, look up how \"mimetics\" (where the term \"memes\" comes from) have taken over the market. Explains at least a little of the TSLA phenomena, and more recently UPST",

        "body": "very startup has an origin story, a tale that illustrates its core principles. For Wealthsimple, that meant promoting low-fee, passive investing.\n\nAfter selling his first business about a decade ago, Wealthsimple co-founder Michael Katchen constructed a simple portfolio of exchange-traded funds using Microsoft Excel, then told the friends with whom he cashed out that this approach was the best way to invest their money.\n\nThe underlying premise: It\u2019s tough to outperform the market over the long run, so for most people it\u2019s better to invest in a mix of low-cost ETFs and ride the wave.\n\n\u201cThe feedback I got from my friends was, \u2018Mike, we\u2019re lazy. We love the system, but can you just please do it for us?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Katchen told The Globe and Mail in 2016. \u201cAnd they became the first 10 clients of Wealthsimple.\u201d\n\nThe concept proved popular with the millennial crowd, attracting billions of dollars in assets to Wealthsimple\u2019s so-called robo-adviser, and the company went so far as to buy Super Bowl ads preaching \u201csimple automated investing.\u201d In no time, Wealthsimple had so much buzz that people started to wonder if it would take down Bay Street\u2019s old guard.\n\nLately, so much of that seems like a past life. The company\u2019s automated platform still exists, but Wealthsimple is now advertising a day trading app for retail investors. And it\u2019s not just stocks \u2013 it is heavily promoting its new cryptocurrency business, which allows users to swap a slew of crypto assets.\n\nThe new strategy seems at odds with Wealthsimple\u2019s founding principles, particularly so with crypto, which is highly volatile and has some of the highest trading fees around. In a recent speech, Gary Gensler, the new head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, called the crypto market the Wild West, \u201crife with fraud, scams and abuse.\u201d China recently made all crypto transactions illegal.\n\nDespite the hard pivot, Wealthsimple has said little about its change of heart. When asked about the new strategy, no one was willing to be interviewed. Instead, the company sent e-mails explaining that it is diversifying to target different client segments.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to help everyone achieve financial freedom, no matter who they are or how much they have. That mission hasn\u2019t changed. We are a fast growing company building a full financial ecosystem for our clients across their savings, investing, spending, tax and crypto needs,\u201d Mr. Katchen wrote.\n\nAs for crypto\u2019s volatility, which prompted the SEC chair to call it a \u201chighly speculative asset class,\u201d Mr. Katchen does not believe that disqualifies it from inclusion in a well-rounded portfolio. Wealthsimple, he wrote, is \u201cvery comfortable recommending that our clients put their money in diversified, low-cost portfolios, while also supporting them if they wish to invest in particular companies or promising new technology.\u201d He also said that Wealthsimple is the first crypto platform to be regulated by a securities authority in Canada.\n\nWhat is happening at Wealthsimple is playing out in a similar fashion across the robo-adviser industry. Once-popular rivals in the United States, including Wealthfront and Betterment, are facing existential crises of their own. For all the billions of dollars that robo-advisers manage, it often isn\u2019t enough to turn a profit. Betterment\u2019s CEO stepped down last December, and its new leader acknowledged that an initial public offering likely was not possible until the company started making money.\n\n\u201cThese businesses operate on very tight margins. They just have extremely low fees, therefore they have to achieve pretty large scale before they\u2019re profitable,\u201d said David Goldstone, head of research and analytics at Backend Benchmarking, which tracks the robo-adviser market, in an interview.\n\nEven if a robo-adviser brings in tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue by charging around 0.5 per cent annually, the company has to spend heavily to attract new clients. \u201cThere was an industry-wide underestimation of how much it was going to cost to acquire customers,\u201d Mr. Goldstone added.\n\nCompounding the problem, the old guard woke up and launched robo-advisers of their own. In the U.S., Vanguard and Charles Schwab now dominate the market, with assets worth US$210-billion and US$60-billion, respectively, at the end of 2020. Betterment, the largest independent robo-adviser in the U.S., managed US$28-billion at the same date. In Canada, Bank of Montreal launched its SmartFolio robo-adviser in 2016, and Royal Bank of Canada followed suit in 2018.\n\nThe incumbents aren\u2019t simply more competition \u2013 they have a structural advantage, because they can cross-sell their robo-platforms to existing clients, lowering their customer-acquisition costs.\n\nTo adjust, Wealthsimple started diversifying in 2018 with a high-interest savings account, then added Wealthsimple Trade, which allows users to buy and sell stocks. In the fall of 2019, the company acquired software maker Simpletax. And a few months later it launched Wealthsimple Cash, a hybrid of a no-fee chequing account and a high-interest savings account.\n\nThe pivot to crypto started in August, 2020, when Wealthsimple\u2019s users were permitted to start trading Bitcoin and Ether. This past June, trading expanded to 14 additional crypto assets, including Litecoin and Dogecoin.\n\nWealthsimple does not break down its assets by division, but retail trading and crypto are what makes Silicon Valley salivate. Last fall, Wealthsimple raised $114-million in a funding round that valued the company at $1.4-billion. In May, it raised another $750-million, boosting its valuation to $5-billion only seven months later.\n\nRetail trading app Robinhood and crypto trading hub Coinbase recently went public in the United States, and their financial statements illustrate just how explosive retail trading revenue growth can be, particularly in crypto. At Robinhood, crypto brought in US$320-million in the first half of 2021, compared with just US$10-million in the first half of 2020.\n\nTo understand what that could mean for Wealthsimple, simply look at the fee schedule. The company\u2019s robo-clients often pay 0.5 per cent annually, while crypto traders pay 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per transaction (although Wealthsimple must split that fee with other parties).\n\nStock trading and crypto are also popular with younger users, which has always been Wealthsimple\u2019s target market but proved to be a tough nut to crack.\n\nEven though the company attracted billions in assets, it was a tiny fraction of the total wealth-management market. Switching rates, which measure the likelihood that someone is willing to leave their main financial institution, remain stubbornly low. In 2020, management consultancy Accenture pegged the switching rate for a primary financial account in Canada at only 4 per cent.\n\nYet as the company grows, it seems inevitable that it will move further from its roots \u2013 some of which are still exposed on Wealthsimple\u2019s website. In a section promoting its robo-adviser, the company writes: \u201cHistory shows that when you try to predict the future \u2013 by picking stocks, for example \u2013 rather than investing in a highly diversified way, you are more likely to underperform the market.\u201d",

        "body": "You might be 15 years old, and you're new to investing, but I think this is a wonderful opportunity for you take charge of your future and set yourself up nicely for financial health throughout the rest of your life. You can start now at age 15, and in 20 years, when you're 35 years old, you might be completely financially independent. Which of course would be super awesome. There's many 35 year olds walking around right now, that would wish they could go back in time to 15 years old and start doing the right things.\n\nThe right things, is learning all about the stock market and how this whole thing works. I think throwing that $200 into a ETF won't really help you too much along this path. My advice is for you to take out a nice sheet of paper and right down all the various products that you use all the time, and the products you love the most. For example, maybe you really like Disney+ streaming service. Or you really love Apple phones. Or you really like XBOX's, or you love Supreme clothing. Whatever it is, write it down. Then the next step is to find out who the parent company is that owns whatever it is that you're into. For example, if XBOX is one of your all time favorite products, the parent company is Microsoft.\n\nSo, you go through this list, finding the parent companies, and then you look for their ticker symbols. See if the companies are publicly traded. For example, if you like Supreme clothing, I think that's a privately held company, so you can't buy any shares in it.\n\nBut, once you have a nice long list of Ticker symbols that actually have real meaning for you, now you need to figure out how to compare and contrast these companies underlying financial fundamentals. \n\nBut how do you do this? Well, this is where YouTube can be your friend. There's plenty of YouTube videos that are specifically designed to help you look at a companies financials and understand what their financial statements mean. \n\nOf course, you're only 15 years old, so this might seem too difficult, but I'm telling you, just take you time, relax, you can learn this stuff. If you can learn which original Pokemon cards are the most valuable, then you can learn this crap. \n\nSo, once you do all this, then you'll have a much better idea of how things work, and then you can put your $200 into an investment account that allows you to buy fractional shares. This way, even though you have a small amount to start out with, you could buy tiny fractions of companies like Google (YouTube) or Microsoft (Xbox). This way, you can have a portfolio of maybe 6 or 7 companies that are using that $200, and even though you'll just have tiny slivers of shares, you can follow these companies over the coming months and learn more about how things work. \n\nYou can keep up with when they report their earnings, and how the stocks react to that news, etc, etc.\n\nI'm excited for you, and I wish I could time travel into the future about 20 years to ask you how you like being a multi-millionaire! Good luck!",

For example: I bought several shares of Microsoft in spring, and looking at the charts and their future earnings I decided that I would liquidate my position when Microsoft reached $300 a share \u2014 worked like a charm. \n\nDo this with every stock that you have post-consolidation. Your goal right now is to grow your portfolio size, you\u2019re going to achieve that by selling at your (reasonable) price target and then investing the extra cash again to grow further.

Apple is on a league of its own, and someone like nvdia or Qualcomm will create the M1 equivalent for PC.\n\n\nAnd the other problem as someone who works in Silicon Valley, in this industry and has a lot of friends in Intel is: \n\nIntel has been bleeding talent left and right for the last 5 years. \n\nIntel pays very low compared to Silicon Valley standards, that\u2019s partly because there is so much competition for talent from nvidia, apple, Qualcomm who are all killing it.  And as a big chunk of compensation is tied in RSUs, Intel cannot compete with salaries as these companies stocks have done extremely well. Apple\u2019s stock has gone up 300% in 5 years and if 30% of your compensation is RSUs, then you are basically getting 30-40% yoy raises for 5 years straight. No way Intel can keep up with that.\n\nIntel pays like 30-50% lower for a comparable position at apple. You just cannot retain top talent with that kind of a pay disparity. Anyone I know, who is talented enough and can leave Intel, has left Intel. \n\n\nIntel is seriously at the danger of becoming IBM of chip makers. Especially now, with amazon working on its own server chips, google working on its own, Microsoft is rumoured to be working on their own silicon for azure. Apparently Qualcomm is going to compete in PC processors. Intel is increasingly looking its in a death spiral. Google, Amazon, Microsoft can pay intel\u2019s top people 2x and poach them left and right. Because these companies are swimming in money form their other businesses.\n\n\nOne thing they have going for them is their fabs. With the increased attention to on shoring chip manufacturing, they should leverage that and start manufacturing chips from competitors for domestic consumption, especially like the defence industry. They have a healthy head start with chip manufacturing infrastructure and know how. They should lean into that. The days of them competing to make the best processors in the world is over.",

        "body": "So I really like GitLab as a company and work with them pretty frequently. If I had to bet, I would say that they are going to continue crushing the market. However, I think the stock is wayyyy overvalued.\n\nThey've got a market cap of roughly $14 billion and they'll probably do $210M - $220M in sales this year. If we say that sales = revenue (it isn't), their P/E ratio is 63. That's actually higher than one of their competitors Atlassian, who sits around 50. Atlassian's Git product BitBucket is nowhere near as good at GitLab, but Jira is literally everywhere. GitLab's closest competitor is GitHub, owned by Microsoft. Microsoft's PE ratio is in the high 30s but not a great comparison. At least 63 isn't anywhere near as bad as TSLA which sits at &gt; 400.\n\nGitLab is losing a ton of money (last year they lost about $200M). Luckily they raised about $800M from the IPO which gives them a few years of runway. My expectation is they will scale engineering and sales to keep up with GitHub.\n\nGitHub is extremely strong competition, but not for reasons people typically mention. GitHub is the defacto git repo for almost all open source software. However, they initially neglected the enterprise customers so GitLab has taken a lot of those accounts. In addition, GitLab's CI capabilities are a solid 1.5-2 years ahead of GitHub's.\n\nHowever... GitHub, owned by Microsoft, has more money than you can imagine. Microsoft's strategy is to give their customers that pay for TFS/Visual Studio free GitHub licenses. In addition, Microsoft will give customers hundreds of thousands of dollars in free consulting to help migrate over. \n\nGitHub also has a $5/user/month tier. GitLab did away with that tier a year ago because it is unprofitable. Microsoft has so much money, they are currently using those very cheap licenses for more user acquisition. Plus, pretty much every company is a Microsoft customer already so the sales reps have tons of inroads. In addition, Microsoft owns LinkedIn. That means Microsoft knows who works at what company, how to reach them, the skills of the company's employees, and what platforms they use (e.g., if a company has 30 enterprise software engineers for SAP, well, MSFT knows they do a lot of SAP work). That information is extremely valuable to sellers.",

        "body": "This is my research strategy. I\u2019m sure everyone is has a different method of screening/researching stocks.   \nMy screener:  \nI search 13F Holdings filings of super investors (Ex: Buffett, Munger, etc.). I have a list of 50 that I follow and compare their holdings for last 2 quarters. I parse this data and find stock that most of super investors own and check their actions  such as buys/sells. Ex: If I find that 17 super investors own MSFT and most of them bought additional shares in the last quarter then I will select MSFT for further research. There is a website (free) for this called https://www.dataroma.com (accurate, but I don\u2019t know who created it).  \nResearching a company:  \nOnce I identify a company as a potential investment, my next steps are:  \nStep 1. Check if company passes a list of indicators.  \nStep 2. Use P/E Ratio and Benjamin Graham formulas. If both calculate intrinsic value as undervalued then I consider buying. Otherwise I trust Graham\u2019s formula more and consider P/E to be highly speculative.  \nStock Valuation:  \nIn my opinion, calculating intrinsic value requires analysis of indicators and several formulas in combination or choosing applicable formula for circumstances. So it\u2019s not just plugging in the values into one specific formula.   \nIndicators:  \n\\* Below average price to book ratios  \n\\* Lower than average price to earnings (P/E) ratios  \n\\* Lower total debt to equity ratio  \n\\* Positive earnings (in the last 4-5 years)  \n\\*Steady or increasing dividends (in the last 4-5 years)  \n\\*Insider activity (no major sales by company officers)   \nFormulas:   \n\\*P/E Ratio Formula:  \nTrailing P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current price of stock by the total of its 12-months trailing earnings (trailing EPS). To calculate the current intrinsic value of stock, multiply trailing P/E ratio by the projected earnings per share (forward EPS).  \nCurrent Price of Stock / Trailing EPS = Trailing P/E Ratio  \nTrailing P/E Ratio \\* Forward EPS = Intrinsic Value  \nNote: This formula is more speculative since Forward EPS is used and  not applicable to all industries. Ex: Banks.  \n\\*Benjamin Graham Formula:  \n Graham\u2019s formula uses earnings per share, book value per share and assumes a P/E ratio of 15. Graham believed that no company should sell at more than 1.5 times its book value.  \nSquare root of (15 \\* 1.5 (Trailing EPS) \\* (Book Value per share)) = Intrinsic Value  \nNote: This formula is for a defensive investor.   \nNote: I have created iOS apps to help me research:  \nCompany 360  \nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/company-360/id1464857130  \n(Value Investing strategy)  \nSuper Investor  \nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-investor/id1441737952  \n(institutional ownership vs. retail sentiment on WSB vs. short interest)",

Intel's main business is in data centres, I think something close to 99% of data centres use Intel, and the big 3 are Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. While Apple is very unlikely to start supplying their chips to other companies, what they have done is proven to everyone just how powerful and efficient ARM chips can be and what happens when you drop a stagnant supplier.\n\nApple may not supply chips but other companies will. We now know that Microsoft and Amazon are working on custom ARM chips for their own data centres, and we also know that the world's most powerful supercomputer runs on ARM chips too. Intel has slept through all of this thinking their ~99% data centre marketshare is safe, but they will very quickly begin to lose marketshare once Microsoft and Amazon are happy with their ARM developments. This is without even mentioning AMD which is also making strides.\n\nI just see it as Intel will begin to shrink and pivot their business a bit, I don't think they'll disappear but I wouldn't expect much growth either. They could make and supply ARM chips themselves, but they don't make nearly as much money as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, so they won't be able to afford the same engineers who can make such developments. One of the main reasons Apple's chips have been so successful is because they can afford to throw *a lot* of money at it.",

It took companies like Amazon and Apple over many years to hit 500b valuation and then magically in 2-3 over 1 trillion. Now above 2 trillion in a shorter timeframe. Prior to this Microsoft was a stock that always sat around 30-60 for many years but just in the last 2 years it went from 800b to 2 trillion in market cap. Microsoft always had high revenue throughout its history.\n\n4) Tesla is not only the starter of electric cars but their experience and technology is ahead of everyone by many years because Tesla has been spending money on R&amp;D for many years on future technology, while the new start ups are worried about building a car and manufacturing for the mass.\n\n5) Traditional car companies transitioning to Electrical cars are hindered by \u201cold thinking\u201d and old branding. When you think of Electrical car, nobody thinks Honda, Volvo, BMW\u2026Tesla is number 1 because to many those older brands, they just selling gas cars. Many of them don\u2019t want to the the blackberry or Nokia (both of these companies dominated the phone market).\n\nIf Tesla continues to lead and create new technologies\u2026they will be the Amazon, Google, Microsoft of their field. \n\nSo ask yourself why not?\n\nIf you think it\u2019s just a traditional car company\u2026.then you won\u2019t understand it.",

The risk premium on SPY is therefore relatively low.\n\nUsually the best Wheel stocks are dividend paying blue chips, like AAPL, MSFT, JNJ, BLK, XOP, etc. Most people can't afford to wheel those stocks, though, so you need to find lower cost stocks that still have solid growth potential in the short term.

The financial press fixates on their $$$/numbers, but forgets they they will/are be globally dominant in cyber security and edge. The recent release of durable edge objects is frigging AMAZING and will fundamentally change web dev / architecture and infrastructure for years to come. The financial guys just can not see it yet. The audacity to attempt \"fix\" email with the release of their filtering tool that plugs into anything is nuts ... the boxes they are installing in buildings ... the list goes on.\n\n\r  \nWhile the current price is VERY heady (understatement) - people need to look at it differently. If CloudFlare disappeared, a lot of the internet would break. If Docusign disappeared (similar market cap) - not many would really notice and could work around it. This business is on track to become a global monopoly in cyber security and edge - the fast growing segments of Cloud. Based on what I know, I suspect that if CloudFlare doubled their prices tomorrow, they would keep most of their existing customers.\n\n\r  \nDefinitely a $1K company within 10 years ... but very hard to justify current value on financial metrics alone. I expect big volatility ahead and am prepared for a 30-40% drop ... but who knows what will happen that's why I am not selling as I have a long time horizon.\n\n\r  \nA random thought (not read anywhere) ... at this valuation (+takeover premium) if anyone was to buy them, it is a small pool with the $$$, then my pick would be Apple. They do not have a public cloud and are focusing on privacy. It would be a good fit. There would be too much anti trust issues with Microsoft, Amazon or Google.\n\n\r  \nI would post my YOLO, but not sure people would believe it. I am in deeeeeeeeeep (at 17, 20s, 30s and 60s). I was interested in this company while they were still private because I was using their products. I remember when Amazon was around $150 and I wa using AWS thinking this shit is amazing, but I could never justify the valuation. I decided I was not going to make the same mistake with Cloudflare.",

        "body": "very startup has an origin story, a tale that illustrates its core principles. For Wealthsimple, that meant promoting low-fee, passive investing.\n\nAfter selling his first business about a decade ago, Wealthsimple co-founder Michael Katchen constructed a simple portfolio of exchange-traded funds using Microsoft Excel, then told the friends with whom he cashed out that this approach was the best way to invest their money.\n\nThe underlying premise: It\u2019s tough to outperform the market over the long run, so for most people it\u2019s better to invest in a mix of low-cost ETFs and ride the wave.\n\n\u201cThe feedback I got from my friends was, \u2018Mike, we\u2019re lazy. We love the system, but can you just please do it for us?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Katchen told The Globe and Mail in 2016. \u201cAnd they became the first 10 clients of Wealthsimple.\u201d\n\nThe concept proved popular with the millennial crowd, attracting billions of dollars in assets to Wealthsimple\u2019s so-called robo-adviser, and the company went so far as to buy Super Bowl ads preaching \u201csimple automated investing.\u201d In no time, Wealthsimple had so much buzz that people started to wonder if it would take down Bay Street\u2019s old guard.\n\nLately, so much of that seems like a past life. The company\u2019s automated platform still exists, but Wealthsimple is now advertising a day trading app for retail investors. And it\u2019s not just stocks \u2013 it is heavily promoting its new cryptocurrency business, which allows users to swap a slew of crypto assets.\n\nThe new strategy seems at odds with Wealthsimple\u2019s founding principles, particularly so with crypto, which is highly volatile and has some of the highest trading fees around. In a recent speech, Gary Gensler, the new head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, called the crypto market the Wild West, \u201crife with fraud, scams and abuse.\u201d China recently made all crypto transactions illegal.\n\nDespite the hard pivot, Wealthsimple has said little about its change of heart. When asked about the new strategy, no one was willing to be interviewed. Instead, the company sent e-mails explaining that it is diversifying to target different client segments.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to help everyone achieve financial freedom, no matter who they are or how much they have. That mission hasn\u2019t changed. We are a fast growing company building a full financial ecosystem for our clients across their savings, investing, spending, tax and crypto needs,\u201d Mr. Katchen wrote.\n\nAs for crypto\u2019s volatility, which prompted the SEC chair to call it a \u201chighly speculative asset class,\u201d Mr. Katchen does not believe that disqualifies it from inclusion in a well-rounded portfolio. Wealthsimple, he wrote, is \u201cvery comfortable recommending that our clients put their money in diversified, low-cost portfolios, while also supporting them if they wish to invest in particular companies or promising new technology.\u201d He also said that Wealthsimple is the first crypto platform to be regulated by a securities authority in Canada.\n\nWhat is happening at Wealthsimple is playing out in a similar fashion across the robo-adviser industry. Once-popular rivals in the United States, including Wealthfront and Betterment, are facing existential crises of their own. For all the billions of dollars that robo-advisers manage, it often isn\u2019t enough to turn a profit. Betterment\u2019s CEO stepped down last December, and its new leader acknowledged that an initial public offering likely was not possible until the company started making money.\n\n\u201cThese businesses operate on very tight margins. They just have extremely low fees, therefore they have to achieve pretty large scale before they\u2019re profitable,\u201d said David Goldstone, head of research and analytics at Backend Benchmarking, which tracks the robo-adviser market, in an interview.\n\nEven if a robo-adviser brings in tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue by charging around 0.5 per cent annually, the company has to spend heavily to attract new clients. \u201cThere was an industry-wide underestimation of how much it was going to cost to acquire customers,\u201d Mr. Goldstone added.\n\nCompounding the problem, the old guard woke up and launched robo-advisers of their own. In the U.S., Vanguard and Charles Schwab now dominate the market, with assets worth US$210-billion and US$60-billion, respectively, at the end of 2020. Betterment, the largest independent robo-adviser in the U.S., managed US$28-billion at the same date. In Canada, Bank of Montreal launched its SmartFolio robo-adviser in 2016, and Royal Bank of Canada followed suit in 2018.\n\nThe incumbents aren\u2019t simply more competition \u2013 they have a structural advantage, because they can cross-sell their robo-platforms to existing clients, lowering their customer-acquisition costs.\n\nTo adjust, Wealthsimple started diversifying in 2018 with a high-interest savings account, then added Wealthsimple Trade, which allows users to buy and sell stocks. In the fall of 2019, the company acquired software maker Simpletax. And a few months later it launched Wealthsimple Cash, a hybrid of a no-fee chequing account and a high-interest savings account.\n\nThe pivot to crypto started in August, 2020, when Wealthsimple\u2019s users were permitted to start trading Bitcoin and Ether. This past June, trading expanded to 14 additional crypto assets, including Litecoin and Dogecoin.\n\nWealthsimple does not break down its assets by division, but retail trading and crypto are what makes Silicon Valley salivate. Last fall, Wealthsimple raised $114-million in a funding round that valued the company at $1.4-billion. In May, it raised another $750-million, boosting its valuation to $5-billion only seven months later.\n\nRetail trading app Robinhood and crypto trading hub Coinbase recently went public in the United States, and their financial statements illustrate just how explosive retail trading revenue growth can be, particularly in crypto. At Robinhood, crypto brought in US$320-million in the first half of 2021, compared with just US$10-million in the first half of 2020.\n\nTo understand what that could mean for Wealthsimple, simply look at the fee schedule. The company\u2019s robo-clients often pay 0.5 per cent annually, while crypto traders pay 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per transaction (although Wealthsimple must split that fee with other parties).\n\nStock trading and crypto are also popular with younger users, which has always been Wealthsimple\u2019s target market but proved to be a tough nut to crack.\n\nEven though the company attracted billions in assets, it was a tiny fraction of the total wealth-management market. Switching rates, which measure the likelihood that someone is willing to leave their main financial institution, remain stubbornly low. In 2020, management consultancy Accenture pegged the switching rate for a primary financial account in Canada at only 4 per cent.\n\nYet as the company grows, it seems inevitable that it will move further from its roots \u2013 some of which are still exposed on Wealthsimple\u2019s website. In a section promoting its robo-adviser, the company writes: \u201cHistory shows that when you try to predict the future \u2013 by picking stocks, for example \u2013 rather than investing in a highly diversified way, you are more likely to underperform the market.\u201d",

        "body": "You might be 15 years old, and you're new to investing, but I think this is a wonderful opportunity for you take charge of your future and set yourself up nicely for financial health throughout the rest of your life. You can start now at age 15, and in 20 years, when you're 35 years old, you might be completely financially independent. Which of course would be super awesome. There's many 35 year olds walking around right now, that would wish they could go back in time to 15 years old and start doing the right things.\n\nThe right things, is learning all about the stock market and how this whole thing works. I think throwing that $200 into a ETF won't really help you too much along this path. My advice is for you to take out a nice sheet of paper and right down all the various products that you use all the time, and the products you love the most. For example, maybe you really like Disney+ streaming service. Or you really love Apple phones. Or you really like XBOX's, or you love Supreme clothing. Whatever it is, write it down. Then the next step is to find out who the parent company is that owns whatever it is that you're into. For example, if XBOX is one of your all time favorite products, the parent company is Microsoft.\n\nSo, you go through this list, finding the parent companies, and then you look for their ticker symbols. See if the companies are publicly traded. For example, if you like Supreme clothing, I think that's a privately held company, so you can't buy any shares in it.\n\nBut, once you have a nice long list of Ticker symbols that actually have real meaning for you, now you need to figure out how to compare and contrast these companies underlying financial fundamentals. \n\nBut how do you do this? Well, this is where YouTube can be your friend. There's plenty of YouTube videos that are specifically designed to help you look at a companies financials and understand what their financial statements mean. \n\nOf course, you're only 15 years old, so this might seem too difficult, but I'm telling you, just take you time, relax, you can learn this stuff. If you can learn which original Pokemon cards are the most valuable, then you can learn this crap. \n\nSo, once you do all this, then you'll have a much better idea of how things work, and then you can put your $200 into an investment account that allows you to buy fractional shares. This way, even though you have a small amount to start out with, you could buy tiny fractions of companies like Google (YouTube) or Microsoft (Xbox). This way, you can have a portfolio of maybe 6 or 7 companies that are using that $200, and even though you'll just have tiny slivers of shares, you can follow these companies over the coming months and learn more about how things work. \n\nYou can keep up with when they report their earnings, and how the stocks react to that news, etc, etc.\n\nI'm excited for you, and I wish I could time travel into the future about 20 years to ask you how you like being a multi-millionaire! Good luck!",

It doesn\u2019t matter how Netflix does, they can have a record-breaking quarter, you\u2019re not going to feel the impact when you haven\u2019t even got a whole share. \n\nAfter consolidating, look at the companies you\u2019re invested in and choose a good exit point. For example: I bought several shares of Microsoft in spring, and looking at the charts and their future earnings I decided that I would liquidate my position when Microsoft reached $300 a share \u2014 worked like a charm. \n\nDo this with every stock that you have post-consolidation. Your goal right now is to grow your portfolio size, you\u2019re going to achieve that by selling at your (reasonable) price target and then investing the extra cash again to grow further. Bonus if it\u2019s a company that will pay you dividends while you wait.",

        "body": "This is my research strategy. I\u2019m sure everyone is has a different method of screening/researching stocks.   \nMy screener:  \nI search 13F Holdings filings of super investors (Ex: Buffett, Munger, etc.). I have a list of 50 that I follow and compare their holdings for last 2 quarters. I parse this data and find stock that most of super investors own and check their actions  such as buys/sells. Ex: If I find that 17 super investors own MSFT and most of them bought additional shares in the last quarter then I will select MSFT for further research. There is a website (free) for this called https://www.dataroma.com (accurate, but I don\u2019t know who created it).  \nResearching a company:  \nOnce I identify a company as a potential investment, my next steps are:  \nStep 1. Check if company passes a list of indicators.  \nStep 2. Use P/E Ratio and Benjamin Graham formulas. If both calculate intrinsic value as undervalued then I consider buying. Otherwise I trust Graham\u2019s formula more and consider P/E to be highly speculative.  \nStock Valuation:  \nIn my opinion, calculating intrinsic value requires analysis of indicators and several formulas in combination or choosing applicable formula for circumstances. So it\u2019s not just plugging in the values into one specific formula.   \nIndicators:  \n\\* Below average price to book ratios  \n\\* Lower than average price to earnings (P/E) ratios  \n\\* Lower total debt to equity ratio  \n\\* Positive earnings (in the last 4-5 years)  \n\\*Steady or increasing dividends (in the last 4-5 years)  \n\\*Insider activity (no major sales by company officers)   \nFormulas:   \n\\*P/E Ratio Formula:  \nTrailing P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current price of stock by the total of its 12-months trailing earnings (trailing EPS). To calculate the current intrinsic value of stock, multiply trailing P/E ratio by the projected earnings per share (forward EPS).  \nCurrent Price of Stock / Trailing EPS = Trailing P/E Ratio  \nTrailing P/E Ratio \\* Forward EPS = Intrinsic Value  \nNote: This formula is more speculative since Forward EPS is used and  not applicable to all industries. Ex: Banks.  \n\\*Benjamin Graham Formula:  \n Graham\u2019s formula uses earnings per share, book value per share and assumes a P/E ratio of 15. Graham believed that no company should sell at more than 1.5 times its book value.  \nSquare root of (15 \\* 1.5 (Trailing EPS) \\* (Book Value per share)) = Intrinsic Value  \nNote: This formula is for a defensive investor.   \nNote: I have created iOS apps to help me research:  \nCompany 360  \nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/company-360/id1464857130  \n(Value Investing strategy)  \nSuper Investor  \nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-investor/id1441737952  \n(institutional ownership vs. retail sentiment on WSB vs. short interest)",

Small periods of sideways movement or short term dips are fine, but sustained downward movements, or big moves down with a new resistance level that is made out of titanium steel is a disaster for a wheel.\n\nAs already noted in another reply, SPY isn't ideal for Wheels for pretty much the reason you already said: since SPY is well diversified, on average SPY is less risky and less risk means less reward. The risk premium on SPY is therefore relatively low.\n\nUsually the best Wheel stocks are dividend paying blue chips, like AAPL, MSFT, JNJ, BLK, XOP, etc. Most people can't afford to wheel those stocks, though, so you need to find lower cost stocks that still have solid growth potential in the short term. Not meme stocks, that's a volatility play. You want steady and predictable, not boom or bust.",

CRM, SNOW, Microsoft and Amazon would technically be competitors but with different twists.\n\nAMD is also positioned in a cyclical environment , which I hate. Cyclicality + not knowing how things are going to turn out for them long term make it a no go for me.\n\nIn the near term ( maybe 5 years ) Id say AMD is a no brainer buy, but the cyclicality of it makes it so It cant be a core holding for me. IF I had to invest in the sector, I'd go with something like ASML or ASYS. A supplier to the cyclicals. A pick and shovel play if you will.\n\nPLTR also benefits from the government contracts. Some people have said that its both its strength and its weakness, but Id argue that it provides no exposure to weakness what so ever.\n\nThe fact that PLTR has been the government's T1 data analytics and AI supplier for over a decade means they are sitting on technology light years ahead of the private sector. When and how they will be able to execute said technology is an unknown.\n\nPLTR has a lot of unknowns, as you stated, and this is a big reason why institutions shy away from the company. We will never be able to get a full peak behind the curtain, but I argue that this is PLTR's strength. Its relationship with government ensures its longevity.\n\nPLTR is just starting its foray into the private/commercial sector.\n\nIf a company is good enough to protect American lives and Uncle Sam's interest's , it projects a level of security , trustworthiness and safety  that they will be able to leverage in the private sector.\n\nLastly, considering AMD exists in the hardware ecosystem, growth will always be dependent on externalities such as supply chain issues ( currently on full display ) and commodity availability etc.\n\nPLTR doesnt require external inputs to sell their products. So exponential growth can be achieved with much less resistance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, thats my pitch. PLTR is my second biggest holding. Its also the one that lets me get the best sleep at night. I truly never worry about it. Max drawdown I figure is about 50% but with everything it has going for it, even in an economic recession, I see it as unlikely.\n\nOnce their SPAC deals and investments start bearing fruit, you're going to see institutions begin to FOMO into the company. At that point government contracts will be nothing but a distant memory.",

And should they really be worth more than the 8 largest automakers combined in the world? Even Volks has 7x their revenue atm, 5x the profit, and haven't diluted their shares by a whopping 57% in the past 5 years like Tesla did.  \n\nNo one in the investing community is arguing that Tesla is a bad company and that it is going to be irrelevant. But be rational. People already say what you are saying, that it's the future, that it is the next Amazon of their sector, or whatever. People already know Tesla's revenue will grow in the future. Why should you invest in a company with a stock price that already expects an insane amount of growth? \n\nAlso, why compare Apple's market cap growth to Tesla? In the same time period that Apple went from 500b market cap to 2300B (x4.5, 2016 to today), Tesla went from 39b to 800b (x40). I think it's easy to see which one is more reasonable, especially when you look at Price to Earnings. \n\nAlso, I really don't see any point in comparing Tesla to Microsoft in terms of over valued-ness, or using the argument that it always had 'good revenue'. Microsoft x8 their revenue in a 13 year span, have a 37% profit margin, shitload of share buybacks, etc. It is a company that showed it was a giant of technology, a cash cow and could continue to improve its revenue streams. \n\nIm not a 'Tesla hater' like the other comment said. It's not because im not opened minded that causes me to question Tesla's value. When you buy a company, you're buying a piece of it, expecting that it will beat expectations in the future, and that the risk you took pays off (increased share price). Unfortunately, it seems like every little bit of new technology is ALREADY price in Tesla. Even if they do become a 25 Price to Earnings company, with insanely good vehicles and AI, higher margins (idk how they can when they have so many competitors), and worldwide clients, how can Tesla continue to rise expectations? \n\nThey do not offer a unique product (of course the cars are and will be better in the next few years, but people do not feel forced to buy it if they want an electric car) like Amazon and Google. They are in a sector with lots of competitors. They have low profit margins. They have insane valuations.   I dont see any rationality that would explain investing in Tesla.",

Do you think Apple, Google, Amazon will continue to grow at astronomical rates like they have in the last 15 yrs? Nvidia has a bit of ways to go but Google/Apple/Microsoft have acquired so many companies over the last decade that they have started to slow down. A lot of regulations and months or years of anti-trust investigations are preventing further overtaking into large chunks of the market. Right now they are fairly over priced as well. Check out the P/E or P/FCF on the top 10 holdings in the $QQQ. Markets tend to expand and then contract towards the mean (avg value P/E essentially). Right now we've gone through a massive bull market over the last 20yrs (after the Tech bubble that is). While I think that a lot of growth is still contained within $QQQ and I'm sure the share appreciation will be decent in the future, I'm warry about $QQQ's P/E at 36 right now. That's fairly high, even for decent growth companies. Quantitative easing is about to start being tapered as well (or at least it should be or Powell will end up really making it worse). To top it off, we are seeing a multitude of supply chain constraints compounded by people just overconsuming because of being contained in the house. What happens next yr when we end up with a significant amount of oversupply finally. You'll most likely see a lot of revue numbers start dropping. All these people will not keep dropping $$$ on consumer goods forever like this. A large part of it is psychological FOMO and with tech items, a lot of BOT scalping. PS5s/Xbox/Nintendo/Graphic Cards/Pokemon' cards/\"Collectables\", / Vehicles / Houses / etc. \n\nI think going forward, if you want to drop some money into $QQQ, I would dollar cost average and make sure you're going to stay in it for another 10-15yrs to make it worth it. I'm not necessarily a bull/bear market person, but mainly a dollar cost average/investor with a long term outlook. Even so, the next couple yrs is going to be iffy/eh/hum... LOL. I do wish you the best though. I myself have some $QQQ long term holdings as well. If you can afford it when you get up to 100x shares of $QQQ, you can do far OTM CC's for some premium. That way you can lower your average holdings cost by making some premium off very low risk options.",

        "body": "IBM made some huge errors. Initially IBM did not believe in the PC revolution nor did they want to cannibalize their high revenue mainframe business, so they did not bother developing PCs. Once Apple took off they realized their mistake and wanted to quickly rush a PC to market. They quickly made the hardware but needed an operating system. Instead of developing their own they looked to hire an outsider to do it since that would be faster. They entered into an agreement with Microsoft that allowed Microsoft to retain the rights of the operating system.  This initially seemed fine since IBM dominated hardware, so they did not anticipate what would come next: dozens of competitors rip apart IBM personal computers, reverse engineer them, and then build their own IBM PC clones. The competitors sell the clones for a fraction of the cost of the IBM computer and take away huge market share. Meanwhile Microsoft is laughing their way to the bank as they own the rights to the operating system and make money regardless of who the hardware provider is. \n\nIBM realizes that they need to lower the cost of their products to compete in the marketplace so they look to cut costs. They cut back significantly on hiring. So where do all the top engineers go to? Not IBM but other tech companies like Microsoft and Oracle (and eventually Google, Facebook, etc).\n\n\nSo essentially they had no moat, and stopped hiring talent. Today\u2019s tech giants are constantly hiring and spending insane amounts on R&amp;D. The second they stop is when you should get worried.",

Apple hasn't been very innovative ever since the iPad came out, and now they're losing their competitive edge by letting their woke mob run the company through petitions instead having strong management. Their productivity is going to take a real hit in the coming decade. They'll remain extremely profitable because enough customers are caught in their web, but they won't be improving much anymore.\n\nOn top of that, Apple has a bigger risk of being disrupted if someone comes up with a new version of the smartphone. We're very used to the idea that everyone has and always will have one, but the smartphone will most likely be disrupted somewhere in the next 5-20 years by some futuristic piece of tech just as easily as the traditional cell phone and it's certainly not gonna come from Apple the way they're (not) innovating right now.\n\nAlso, 1 year is extremely short term.
