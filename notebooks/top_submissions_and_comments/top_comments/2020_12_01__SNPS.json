I've made so much money off FB even though the share price gain over the years isnt astronomical just because I'm pretty disciplined at selling when i feel companies are over extended and rebuying at lower points.\n\nDoing something for 4 years is one thing, keeping it up for another 11 is another. I can only hope.",

For example, Vertex just bought Exonics which is doing gene editing for Duchenne\u2019s, a super common single gene disorder in males.\n\nPlus, if delivery can be figured out, eliminating point mutations in cancers will be highly effective.\n\nPlus, gene editing single genes can have huge effects on polygenic disorders. Common SNPs in PCSK9 are completely effective in preventing heart disease, the number 1 killer in the US. \n\nPlus gene editing has uses in CAR T cells and other forms of immunotherapy. Ex vivo editing is a huge market.",

I have current positions in the following:\n\nTTD, TSLA, FVRR, CRWD, PYPL, NFLX, SNPS, PINS, HUBS, TWLO\n\nMy last change, I took a little off the top with TWLO as I thought it was going to tank...it did not and it kept going. I wanted to spread some love to PYPL, NFLX, SNPS and PINS. I should have let it run, but oh wellz.\n\nWhat I'd like to do is hopefully have 40% annualized return so I can get $1,000,000 in a 10 year timeline. I'm not interested in going with index funds (I will advise folks who are in their 20s to do that; I'm in my early 40s and my risk appetite is quite high.)\n\nI am think of liquidating everything to keep my double-up and go into the following M1 pies:\n\n**Financial Pie** 25%\n\n**Consumer Cyclical Pie** 25%\n\n**Communication Services Pie** 25%\n\n**Technology Pie** 25%\n\n**\\*** **Financial Pie**\n\nLMND 50%\n\nPYPL 50%\n\n\\* **Consumer Cyclical Pie**\n\nAMZN 50%\n\nTSLA 50%\n\n\\* **Communication Services Pie**\n\nDIS 20%\n\nFVRR 20%\n\nPINS 20%\n\nTWLO 20%\n\nZM 20%\n\n\\* **Technology Pie**\n\nCRWD 17%\n\nHUBS 17%\n\nSHOP 17%\n\nTTD 17%\n\nADSK 16%\n\nOKTA 16%\n\n\\--------\n\nShould I start from scratch with the above? If I can get 40% or more of annualized returns with what I've done I'd be very happy. Once I get a million, I will then turn into a dividend investor and live off yields for the rest of my life. That's my goal anyway. I welcome any advice or being pointed in the right direction.",
