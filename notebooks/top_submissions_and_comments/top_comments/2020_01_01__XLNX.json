He was drumming up Xilinx on the way up to 141 and its reversion down to the 80s, then all of a sudden \"I don't like it, too much China\". He was negative on Tesla before the rally and is now just following the trend. \n\nPrediction: He'll stop being bullish on Tesla well before it's double the market cap of Ford+GM, because it's a volatile stock and after the next dip he'll say he warned you when he didn't. Any idiot can tell you what happened yesterday.",
