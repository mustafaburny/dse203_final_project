He was drumming up Xilinx on the way up to 141 and its reversion down to the 80s, then all of a sudden \"I don't like it, too much China\". He was negative on Tesla before the rally and is now just following the trend. \n\nPrediction: He'll stop being bullish on Tesla well before it's double the market cap of Ford+GM, because it's a volatile stock and after the next dip he'll say he warned you when he didn't. Any idiot can tell you what happened yesterday.",

I'm looking at how the 50/70 delta zebras set up between SPY and XSP, and they don't setup quite the same because the deltas are different, but it's looking like the XSP zebra will be as cheap as $1440 or so, where the SPY zebra is closer to $1900.\n\nDef gonna look closer at it tomorrow and prolly buy a lot or two in XSP.",
