        "body": "DD: I talked to a veteran of the semiconductor/microchip industry yesterday about the current state of play. Here\u2019s the background. Please chime in if anything seems incorrect or misleading. \n\nAs many know, INTC used to be king and AMD was a hobbled minor competitor. NVDA were the graphics guys. \n\nThere are 3 major manufacturers: INTC (mostly for Intel chips, they do manufacture for others but not significant amounts), TSMC, and Samsung. NVDA uses TSMC, as does AMD. Samsung is mostly memory chips, whereas TSMC and INTC are doing processor chips, so not always direct competitors. \n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is that INTC is losing a ton of market share that has been locked up for decades, causing all other stocks to rise as a reflection of the increased growth potential as they gobble that up. This has been a trend for many years and is now accelerating as INTC continues to shit the bed. \n\nThe other big piece is ARM. INTC wrote the instruction set for PC chips, called x86. All PCs run on x86, so INTC has a big advantage there because they control the instruction set. However, mobile devices, tablets and IOT devices do NOT use x86, they use ARM. So if NVDA buys arm they get that same advantage INTC has for PCs and the mobile side (which is the growing segment ofc)\n\nAMD buying Xilinx is less of a big deal, paying a bunch of money to take out a competitor and fill some gaps in AMD\u2019s product capabilities. \n\nBottom line is that all non-INTC companies are doing well bc computing is growing and INTC is losing market share. Long term, NVDA is poised to be the new intel and AMD\u2019s growth will be more short-lived, unless Bae makes some different moves and changes the trajectory. TSMC kinda wins no matter what, as long as INTC keeps losing. \n\nBears r fuk",
