        "body": "Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:\n\nStocks only go up\n\n\n*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.\n\nI come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&amp;P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.\n\nI hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. \"What am I-\" \n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he asks.\n\n\"Huh?\" I respond, confused.\n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he demands, louder this time.\n\n\"I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-\" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.\n\n\"It's priced in,\" he says coolly. \"So why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nDizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&amp;P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. \"Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!\" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.\n\n\"Repeat after me: stocks only go up,\" Powell demands.\n\nI say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&amp;P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.\n\nPowell frowns and continues, \"I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nI feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, \"GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-\" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&amp;P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.\n\nThe first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" I say.",

I disagree. If I am going to send capital to a place far away, I want to know in advance what the laws are and how they will be enforced. As a foreigner, I prefer the rules to be as general, equal, and certain as possible. Even in countries with rule of law, acquaintances and locals get better treatment.\n\nalso the \"Chinese middle class\" argument is reminiscent of the common wisdom about Japanese stocks in the 1980s before their epic bubble and 30-year slump.",

Or that they're the only MSO that could absorb them all without having to break it up/part it out?  The former isn't true, so I assume you meant the latter.\n\nMy assumption is that GGP will part out ianthus regardless.  I doubt they'll look to strengthen their competition (e.g., CGC via TER), unless it's at a great premium.  Which TER would be foolish to pursue.  My guess is the best assets go to PharmaCann (Cronos'chosen horse) as bolt ons.  PharmaCann is in IL, Mass, NY, Penn, Ohio and MD; Peking Liddell as aq is in CO and MI.  So, iAnthus' FL and AZ assets are compelling new markets, with NY, Mass, MD offering asset upgrades/bolt one (license permitting) or divestment opportunities.  Total speculation, of course.",

        "body": "The main things to look at when looking for an ETF (aside from the index that it is tracking, in this case S&amp;P) are:\n\n* Expenses: the lower the TER, the better (there are other expenses that should be considered - for example, a fund that kept rebalancing its portfolio could lose a lot of capital there, not that that should be likely to happen for something tracking S&amp;P) but that's a reasonable \n* Assets under management: a bigger ETF is less likely to get liquidated (this is mostly not a concern for major s&amp;p 500 etf). \n* Trading volume: the higher the volume, the less likely is for there to be a lot of bid/ask spread (also probably not a huge concern in your case). \n* If it is a synthetic ETF (that does not *actually* buy shares, but simulates doing so via derivatives) or a physical one? Normally it should not make much of a difference, and synthetic ones could even be slightly more efficient/less expensive, but they could also be more risky if things got seriously bad (if the counterparts of the derivatives could not hold to their commitments, it'd be a mess). \n* If it is an accumulating ETF (that reinvests automatically its dividends) or a distributing one (that gives them to you). I'm not sure about the UK, but in many European countries accumulating ones are more tax-efficient since they let you reinvest the dividends without paying taxes on them. \n\nAssuming that what you want is an accumulating ETF with physical replication, two reasonable and pretty-much-equivalent possibilities could be [CSP1](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?query=IE00B5BMR087&amp;groupField=index&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00B5BMR087#overview) or  [VUAG](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?assetClass=class-equity&amp;index=S%2526P%2B500%25C2%25AE&amp;sortField=fundSize&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;groupField=none&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00BFMXXD54#overview): of course do your due diligence and check everything yourself, but both seem solid and cheap products that a lot of people use. \n\nIf I were you, however, I'd also consider something a little more internationally diversified than a S&amp;P index (big US companies did awesome lately, and they could continue doing so, but it's not guaranteed), like [VWRP](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00BK5BQT80&amp;groupField=index&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00BK5BQT80#overview) or [SWDA](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00B4L5Y983&amp;groupField=index&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00B4L5Y983#overview) (the biggest difference is that SWDA only invests in developed countries while VWRP does not) - they have a higher TER and they did not outperform the S&amp;P500 lately, but they still invest plenty in the US anyway (you can find the exact geographic distributions in the links) and could be a little less volatile. \n\nAgain, you should of course double-check everything yourself and see if that makes sense - these are just ideas, nothing more.",

        "body": "Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:\n\nStocks only go up\n\n\n*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.\n\nI come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&amp;P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.\n\nI hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. \"What am I-\" \n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he asks.\n\n\"Huh?\" I respond, confused.\n\n\"Why did you short the domestic market?\" he demands, louder this time.\n\n\"I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-\" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.\n\n\"It's priced in,\" he says coolly. \"So why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nDizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&amp;P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. \"Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!\" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.\n\n\"Repeat after me: stocks only go up,\" Powell demands.\n\nI say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&amp;P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.\n\nPowell frowns and continues, \"I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?\"\n\nI feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, \"GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-\" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&amp;P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.\n\nThe first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.\n\n\"Stocks only go up,\" I say.",

I only bought this year thinking that the CGC deal and because they were dropping more than it's piers was an opportunity: seems I was wrong about the timing. Now that I received the management information circular, I look at the deal and have a better understanding of the dillution happening , Gage however really didnt drop as much as TER , and it seems like the buying price is almost 2x the market cap of Gage now, are they really worth it. Curious to know what everyone thinks here and please correct me if some of my interpretation is wrong . Cheers",

I disagree. If I am going to send capital to a place far away, I want to know in advance what the laws are and how they will be enforced. As a foreigner, I prefer the rules to be as general, equal, and certain as possible. Even in countries with rule of law, acquaintances and locals get better treatment.\n\nalso the \"Chinese middle class\" argument is reminiscent of the common wisdom about Japanese stocks in the 1980s before their epic bubble and 30-year slump.",

Or that they're the only MSO that could absorb them all without having to break it up/part it out?  The former isn't true, so I assume you meant the latter.\n\nMy assumption is that GGP will part out ianthus regardless.  I doubt they'll look to strengthen their competition (e.g., CGC via TER), unless it's at a great premium.  Which TER would be foolish to pursue.  My guess is the best assets go to PharmaCann (Cronos'chosen horse) as bolt ons.  PharmaCann is in IL, Mass, NY, Penn, Ohio and MD; Peking Liddell as aq is in CO and MI.  So, iAnthus' FL and AZ assets are compelling new markets, with NY, Mass, MD offering asset upgrades/bolt one (license permitting) or divestment opportunities.  Total speculation, of course.",

        "body": "The main things to look at when looking for an ETF (aside from the index that it is tracking, in this case S&amp;P) are:\n\n* Expenses: the lower the TER, the better (there are other expenses that should be considered - for example, a fund that kept rebalancing its portfolio could lose a lot of capital there, not that that should be likely to happen for something tracking S&amp;P) but that's a reasonable \n* Assets under management: a bigger ETF is less likely to get liquidated (this is mostly not a concern for major s&amp;p 500 etf). \n* Trading volume: the higher the volume, the less likely is for there to be a lot of bid/ask spread (also probably not a huge concern in your case). \n* If it is a synthetic ETF (that does not *actually* buy shares, but simulates doing so via derivatives) or a physical one? Normally it should not make much of a difference, and synthetic ones could even be slightly more efficient/less expensive, but they could also be more risky if things got seriously bad (if the counterparts of the derivatives could not hold to their commitments, it'd be a mess). \n* If it is an accumulating ETF (that reinvests automatically its dividends) or a distributing one (that gives them to you). I'm not sure about the UK, but in many European countries accumulating ones are more tax-efficient since they let you reinvest the dividends without paying taxes on them. \n\nAssuming that what you want is an accumulating ETF with physical replication, two reasonable and pretty-much-equivalent possibilities could be [CSP1](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?query=IE00B5BMR087&amp;groupField=index&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00B5BMR087#overview) or  [VUAG](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?assetClass=class-equity&amp;index=S%2526P%2B500%25C2%25AE&amp;sortField=fundSize&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;groupField=none&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00BFMXXD54#overview): of course do your due diligence and check everything yourself, but both seem solid and cheap products that a lot of people use. \n\nIf I were you, however, I'd also consider something a little more internationally diversified than a S&amp;P index (big US companies did awesome lately, and they could continue doing so, but it's not guaranteed), like [VWRP](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00BK5BQT80&amp;groupField=index&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00BK5BQT80#overview) or [SWDA](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00B4L5Y983&amp;groupField=index&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00B4L5Y983#overview) (the biggest difference is that SWDA only invests in developed countries while VWRP does not) - they have a higher TER and they did not outperform the S&amp;P500 lately, but they still invest plenty in the US anyway (you can find the exact geographic distributions in the links) and could be a little less volatile. \n\nAgain, you should of course double-check everything yourself and see if that makes sense - these are just ideas, nothing more.",
