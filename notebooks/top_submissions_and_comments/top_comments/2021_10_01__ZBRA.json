It's not for everyone, and I'll get knocked, but I prefer watching a video a few times over reading books and articles.\n\nThat being said, InTheMoney teaches level 1 options and risk management about as good as anyone can. Fantastically palatable content.\n\nWhen you are ready to move on to more complex, multi leg strategies, Tech Conversations focuses on limited risk strategies (as opposed to unlimited risk). In particular, his presentation of ratio spreads such as the stock repair strategy and the zebra strategy are second to none. Don't pay attention to the stocks he demonstrates on, focus on the strategy and apply it to your stocks.",
