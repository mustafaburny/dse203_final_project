My current strategy is don\u2019t buy unless there is some type of retreat of at least a few percentage points, but don\u2019t be bothered by the fact that you\u2019re up quite a bit on the position overall.  For example, ZBRA has done well for me since January, but I didn\u2019t start buying more until it started tanking a few weeks ago. I was still up 50% overall when I bought, but I bought when it was down 10% so it felt better. Others might say that if you like the stock long term then just buy it regardless of recent price action, but my brain is incapable of that so I\u2019m left with this strategy",

There\u2019s one thing I forgot to mentioned that has helped, just keep in mind this only works for profitable companies.\n\nInstead of just looking at the price, look at the historic P/E ratio (which you can add easily to the price chart on Ameritrade). So going back to my ZBRA example, it had a PE of 41 on January 1st.  I was up 40-50% when I bought more in September, but the P/E at that time was around 37. So I\u2019m paying more, but it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m getting a better deal. That\u2019s just something that\u2019s helped me justify averaging up when I like a stock so maybe check that out for profitable companies",

        "body": "Put debit spreads are cheap on SPY due to its aggressive skew (they're like almost half the price of an equal call debit spread .. that's how much skewed SPY is). That would be one option to hedge cheaply. Also, a ZEBRA option strategy (selling 1 OTM put and buying 2 ITM puts .. you can structure them to get -100 deltas) is again very good if you really want downside protection (but they will obviously cost more). You can even sell a covered call if you have 100 SPY to reduce the cost of doing either one of these.",
