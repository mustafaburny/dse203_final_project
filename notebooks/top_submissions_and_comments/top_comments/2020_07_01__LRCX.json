If you are not proficient yet then just covered calls . \nWait for stock to go down a little, in this market any pullback is your chance to get in but I would be cautious &amp; buy small amounts. LT it will be just fine , watch how ASML does to get an idea about the chip sector. But LRCX is one of the better chip manufacturers. Been in since $65 .",

Something about them is no longer working. \n\nSecondly, MRK\u2019s press release for their phase 3 trial of [Islatravir](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) is set to begin soon after their presentation at the AIDS 2020 virtual divulging that the Phase 2b results proved that their drug has higher efficacy and safety from the analyses. \n\nThirdly, MRK has a proven track record for putting up great [earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-earnings-surprise-streak-could-161004767.html), and most analysts are bullish already about them for their earnings coming out 7/31. And will be even more so in the near future thanks to their EIDD-2801 exclusive rights from RidgeBack Therapeutics for an antiviral for covid until others produce a sustainable vaccine, and more so because they\u2019ll likely make up the shortage for HIV meds with current meds and their upcoming Islatravir. \n\nFuthermore, MRK just got [FDA approval](https://www.mrknewsroom.com/newsroom/news-releases/news-details/2020/FDA-Approves-Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-First-Line-Treatment-of-Patients-With-Unresectable-or-Metastatic-MSI-H-or-dMMR-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx) to use Keytruda for first-line colon cancer. Which will only drive their earnings. \n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t share the seeking A article, but it goes into further detail about why antivirals will be very important in the coming months since vaccines are still projected to be at least 6 months out, if not longer. If you want to see the SA article just google \u201cAntivirals Rather Than Vaccines for COVID-19\u201d\n\nAlso, the EIDD-2801 candidate they have rights to from RidgeBack is currently in quite a few trials, but one of the more pertinent one is in South Africa where they\u2019re needing 50 HIV positive people to see if it can help prevent covid in them, but also they\u2019re secretly hoping by sheer luck that the same drug can help manage HIV at the same time it prevents covid. \n\nSticking with my originals 7/31 $85-$90c, and 10/16 $90-$95, but I\u2019ll also add 1/21 $100-$105c since there are many analysts setting $100+ fair values for eoy.\n\nEdit: TL;DR\u2014 MRK $85+ calls cause they make the good drugs for bad things and it make printer go brrrrrrrr.",

        "body": "You don't know what you're talking about. Not car batteries, batteries. Like Powerwall. Like the 129 MWh battery farm in Australia. The farm in Australia alone made Tesla tens of millions - imagine that scaled up across the globe. With renewables like solar and wind coming to dominate electricity generation, utility-scale batteries will be necessary to store that electricity. That business alone will be worth billions. \n\nVehicle to grid is similar but much more decentralized. People can plug in their vehicle and earn some extra cash simply to use their car as energy storage. Same with robotaxis. Tesla can skim off the top and still outcompete Uber/Lyft with no labor cost. \n\nYes a lot of these come from the same product but that's *exactly why* Tesla is worth so much. What you're essentially doing is treating an iPhone the same as a Motorola flip phone. Yes they both make calls. But an iPhone has tons of other services in the form of software that make it worth far more than any flip phone.",

An expanded product line of shiny computers and reality TV-show streaming aren't something to be counted on for unlimited upward stock movements nor is it something to celebrate as the dazibao of 21st century progress.",

Let's be generous and say tech *should* trade at 30x FCF. AAPL, for instance, trades at 27x FCF. WMT (which is MUCH more tech than people give credit to), who has more infrastructure in place than AMZN for single/same day deliveries is trading at 24.5x FCF.\n\nI digress. AMZN is trading at 76x FCF. They operate on liquid thin margins if you're not including AWS which its market share/profit margins are being competitively eaten up by GOOGL, MSFT, etc. Anyway, even INCLUDING AWS, to get twice the FCF is going to be insanely hard. When a company is that large, growth is so, so much harder to achieve. Also keep in mind that it would have to maintain its market cap.\n\nMy point being that AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, etc kind of companies are so forward looking that it will be impossible for them to \"catch up\" to their current evaluations. Eventually, either they'll lose market cap or grow FCF (probably a mixture of both). Please don't talk about growth potential either (what do you think forward looking means?)\n\nI know the meme here is stocks only go up, which right now is true, but over time a company's goal is to make money and eventually hype will die down and investors will put money into more profitable/sustainable businesses. I'm not taking about value investing, either. It's never *not* happened given an extended period of time. And sure, we could have hyper asset inflation that is so far \"unknown\" making these PE ratios and FCF x's actually acceptable, but that wouldn't explain other companies being \"unfairly\" valued.\n\nAnyway, my other point being is *some* of tech is in a bubble that *will* be popped. everyone knows this but no one knows when it will happen.",

And when a stock drops 4% or more, you buy some calls or shares..\n\nI want you to watch from now on TQQQ and SPXL.\n\n\nWait for them to dip and then dip a 2nd time and on the 2nd or 3rd dip, buy in with shares or calls 1-3  months out..\n\n\nI want you to know this:\n\nAs the market tries to grind up to SPY $345-ish, I want you to watch Vix and UVXY..\n\n- WHEN YOU see Vix drop down to 15 or lower, you need to start buying calls for 6 months out.\n\nWait till Vix even possibly goes to 12 and then go all-in with Vix calls 3-6 months out.\n\nSo my point is this, even though you missed out and  this and that, don't EVER EVER TRY  to do the Revenge Trading or Diamond hands bullshit they try to push here on Dumb WSB.\n\nWhat you need to do is look in to using margin with covered calls.\n\nThis is where you buy 100 shares of something and sell 1 call at a strike you think the stock will go to and you will lose your shares after it goes above the strike you sold in profit.\n\nTD Ameritrade gives you 4x margin your cash which means if you have $25,000 you can actually buy $100,000 in shares of something, now Imagine day trading with $100,000 of AMD on any $0.40 cent up move in 1 day ?? see the picture here now?\n\n\nAnyway, regardless of all that, you need to do covered calls from now on.\n\nSo be on the lookout for Vix going closer to 12 and then go all-in Vix and hold with your \"diamond\" hands then for the next correction.\n\n\nHere is the kicker, the big insiders know they have now trained us to \"buy the dip\" now since everyone has \"missed out\" on all the gains and all the stocks flying up like Tesla and Nvidia and Facebook and Amazon etc.. so REMEMBER this WELL my friend, they now will trick everyone good again by doing a nice correction/sell-off drop, but then drop it a 2nd or 3rd time down with waves going down and when you think you are buying the dip, it will be a continual small dip over and over again so you get scared and mentally rekt out of the trade.\n\nSO, to prevent any of that, here is what you do, \n\nLook at charts of 2-3 years and buy when things are cheap.\n\nExample you ask??\n\nEasy, \n\nRCL $130 high, now $40-50\n\nCCL  $15/share and normally $50-60\n\nHST \n\nJets\n\nXLE (wait for this to go lower, then buy a lot though)\n\nand there are some more.. \n\nSPXL and TQQQ are big ones, please start buying these after they drop a lot ok.\n\n\nI hope this helps some. You can make money, you just need to stop with the options and try more with shares and/or covered calls as well as only buy calls when VIX has had a major drop, then buy calls on Vix and Calls on SPXL etc..  along with some otm cheap cheap ass puts 2 weeks out. But make the calls 3 weeks or more.\n\nAnd ONLY ONLY ONLY buy after something has dropped a lot.\n\nIt's actually that simple.\n\nNow what if the stock \"keeps dropping\" you say?? Well, then you weren't looking at 2-3 year charts like I said earlier.. See what I'm saying?\n\n\nSo now go fourth and show me that all you have to do is buy low an sell high after any pump. Unless you really are holding something for the long run but that should only be S&amp;P or etc..",

This sounds like the parroting of a nonsensical idea that world's populous has permanently altered their habits (be it in the form of individual consumption or in business practices) in the last 4 months thus justifying the valuations of companies that were likely already trading at lofty sums pre-crash.\n\nThe \\*only\\* way you can justify this narrative is if you believe the world isn't heading into a deep recession for the next 1-3 years and that the new normal is simply a reorienting of pre-COVID level spending and consumption toward these few \"tech titans\".\n\nAs you continue to buy into this sand castle story of infinite tech growth, ask yourself...\n\nWhy Zoom's execs have been dumping their stock during it's COVID run?\n\nHas Apple sold more iPhones since March YOY (and will people have the disposable income to continue to buy Apple products for the next year)?\n\nIs NVIDIA really worth more than Intel now at 1/7th their revenues?\n\nIs Netflix, a company that isn't profitable, worth more today with the increasing competition in the streaming space?\n\nIs Shopify with an estimated PEG of above 20 (when anything above 1 is considered over valued) going to sustain it's current price with massive earnings while we're in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression?\n\nFacebook losing it's biggest advertisers is bullish?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Tesla... \\*bUt iT's a BaTtErY sTaRt-Up\\*\n\nIt's hard to believe so many people are justifying these company's valuations based on this idea that the companies themselves somehow represent the next major technological revolution. An expanded product line of shiny computers and reality TV-show streaming aren't something to be counted on for unlimited upward stock movements nor is it something to celebrate as the dazibao of 21st century progress.\n\nDo one of those remind me in 6 months things and let's see where we're at.",

        "body": "Lets take this one bite at a time. Please understand this isn't a personal rant of Intel hate or AMD love, just my informed opinion about the companies as investments. \n\nClock speed - Yep. Intel still holds *single core* performance crown, at the cost of incredibly high power draw and all for maybe 5% improvement. Multi-Core AMD still leads and offers more value per $ overall. \n\nMarket Share - Depends on your sources and regions so I won't nitpick on specifically \"who has more % of market share\" but rather, who has momentum and is gaining vs. losing market share. AMD is gaining consistently regardless of data source. \n\nSecurity Flaws - Threat to both, Intel has just had more bad press lately. No telling when these flaws get picked up in the media or how much they will effect. However, the CTS Labs scandal from 2018 shouldn't be ignored. An intel funded \"security\" company based in Israel announces AMD vulnerabilities publicly without contacting AMD (industry standard to give notice so they can fix). Vulnerabilities were practically nothing (diversion from Spectre and Meltdown) and company has faded into the background without answering any questions, deleting their webpage \"[AMDFlaws.com](https://AMDFlaws.com)\"\n\nMarketing Deception - \n\n* 2018 Computex Industrial Chiller incident to distract from Threadripper\n* Principled Technologies funded study, using an Intel funded benchmark, that pitted the i9-9900K  against a 2700X that deliberately had half its cores disabled\n* Threadripper losing to an i5 in same Intel funded benchmark\n* 2019 MDS vulnerability appears, Intel bribes researchers to downplay severity\n* \"Real World Performance\" campaign the moment benchmarks started showing AMD consistently in the lead, trying to devalue long standing benchmark validity. \n* \"Financial Horsepower\" $3 BILLION set aside to persuade anyone considering AMD to stick with Intel.\n* \"Real World Performance\" caught deliberately hiding disclosures, which exist because Intel was previously caught in anti-consumer deceptive practices in 2009. \n* Plethora of vaporware product announcements with rigged benchmarks, but since the product was never released we can't independently test. \n\nAnti-Competitive Practices - See $3Billion bullet above. And dont' recall what their latest margins on CPUs were, but AMD margins are increasing and Intel has been price cutting. Again, momentum in AMDs favor. \n\nNvidia Market Leader - Team Green has long been the GPU market leader and it isn't debatable, but as AMD (hopefully) and Intel both become more competitive Nvidia may be forced to cut into their margin to stay on top. Sources vary again, but typically they sit at about 70% market share +/-. \n\nMy comparison to Ford/Tesla = Intel/Nvidia remains. Intel has the capability/cash to turn the ship around but I'm not buying until I see a defined culture shift there.",

Zen 3 moving to 7 nm to 7 nm EuV is a relatively big step that should bring 10% performance, they're talking another +15% in architecture so it could solidify AMD at the top.

The smartphone guys usually launch on the new node in like March, AMD will probably need longer, but not that much longer. There's another 7-10% performance or 15% power reduction at 5 nm and I think Intel is targeting their first 10 nm desktop processors Q4 2021 on 10 nm++ (no joke, that's their name). \n\nAMD's advantage fighting TSMC's 5nm vs Intel's 14 nm++++ for most of 2021 will absolutely crush Intel.",
