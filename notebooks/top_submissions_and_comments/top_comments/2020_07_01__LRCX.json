I thought I was rolling the dice at $1,000, which I never would have done without my $400-$500 shares. If they make money, lead their industries and are innovative then it's a good bet.",

I think I probably lost net a couple grand due to ZM and LK (when LK was trading in the 30s, when ZM got Zucked). Don't feel bad taking profits because you could have always ended up getting destroyed by one little piece of news like FB video (LOL, ZM is 120 more than that drop like 6 weeks ago).\n\nEdit: Lesson learned is stick to your guns as long as your investment is within your risk tolerance, but 25% a trade over 25 trades will go a looong way (~5% total portfolio of options MAX for me).",

They will not provide guidance so stock will retreat then you get back in at a much better price . If you are playing options then sell calls and protect the down side with a put spread . If you are not proficient yet then just covered calls . \nWait for stock to go down a little, in this market any pullback is your chance to get in but I would be cautious &amp; buy small amounts. LT it will be just fine , watch how ASML does to get an idea about the chip sector. But LRCX is one of the better chip manufacturers. Been in since $65 .",

It's honestly sort of amazing how many mistakes Intel has made in the past year or so, and they are legitimately at risk of becoming completely uncompetitive.\n\nThey basically lost 100% of the enthusiast/custom PC market overnight, and most of their revenue now comes from contracts with Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc for desktop and notebook CPUs (and a few other random components, like wifi and Bluetooth cards). And, these companies will almost definitely be looking to AMD, as Intel's 7nm chips aren't expected to be available until *at least* 2022, and AMD is already mass-producing. Depending on how hard these companies ditch Intel, it could be an actual death blow. \n\nAnd that doesn't even bring up the issue that things are shifting more and more to mobile platforms, where Intel completely failed. Companies like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm absolutely dominate in the mobile SoC sector and managed to castrate a titan when Intel attempted to enter that market and failed miserably. \n\nIt's bad news all around. \n\nDoes that mean they can't come back? No. Of course they can. But the concerns are real.\n\nWhat other major stocks have you seen recently crash 13% on earnings then just... Stay there? Flat? We are in the most legendary dip-buying market of all time, where almost any dip will be bought without any logic, and yet no one would touch INTC, which is one of the biggest tech companies in the world.\n\nIt's a bit concerning.\n\nYour DD is basically \"bruh, it's Intel. And they made a lot of money in 2019.\" But that's frankly just not very good DD my friend.",

Those devices have to go somewhere so you put them on a tower owned by AMT and CCI (crown castle, not carnival cruise line). Those companies make money renting the towers to the service providers. Then you have the companies that make the chips that go into those devices, the chips that go into cell phones, drones and the internet of things (NVDA, INTC, MRVL, QCOM, etc.). Then there are the companies that make the devices we buy to connect us to 5G (Apple, amazon, google, Tesla). Finally there are the service providers like Verizon att and t mobile that connect our devices to the 5G network. \n\nI suggest starting at YouTube. There are videos that explain what each company does and their role in the 5G network.\n\nHowever, I wanted ALL of the companies with not a lot of money so I went after the 5G ETF (ticker: FIVG).",

We\u2019re talking self driving cars, delivery drones, and doctors in New York performing surgery on soldiers in Afghanistan in a tent (hopefully we aren\u2019t there anymore). 5G is significantly different than 4G is that 4G has the giant towers that send signal for miles where 5G needs an incredible amount of small towers that shoot their signal a few hundred yards.\n\nFrom there you have the companies that make the actually radio transmission device like Nokia and Ericsson (both very reasonably priced)(fuck Huawei!). Those devices have to go somewhere so you put them on a tower owned by AMT and CCI (crown castle, not carnival cruise line). Those companies make money renting the towers to the service providers. Then you have the companies that make the chips that go into those devices, the chips that go into cell phones, drones and the internet of things (NVDA, INTC, MRVL, QCOM, etc.). Then there are the companies that make the devices we buy to connect us to 5G (Apple, amazon, google, and eventually, Tesla). Finally there are the service providers like Verizon att and t mobile that connect our devices to the 5G network. \n\nI suggest starting at YouTube. There are videos that explain what each company does and their role in the 5G network and pick which one you like the most. \n\nHowever, I wanted ALL of the companies with not a lot of money so I went after the 5G ETF (ticker: FIVG).",

        "body": "**RICK** \\- Not fond of this one. In the current environment, I see no upside.  \n\nRecognia has detected a \"Head and Shoulders Top\" chart pattern formed on RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc (RICK on NASDAQ). This bearish signal indicates that the price may fall from the close of 12.63 to the range of 7.25 - 8.25. The pattern formed over 24 days which is roughly the period of time in which the target price range may be achieved.\n\nRCI Hospitality Holdings Inc has a current support price of 11.03 and a resistance level of 15.32.\n\nA Head and Shoulders Top is considered a bearish signal. It indicates a possible reversal of the current uptrend to a new downtrend. A perfect example of the pattern has three sharp high points, the middle one being the highest, created by three successive rallies in the price of the financial instrument. The technical event occurs when the resistance marked by the neckline is \"broken\", thereby confirming the pattern.\n\n**NCLH** \\- It could be some time before you see returns on this one. Of all the cruise lines this one is probably in the best shape, financially. Long term hold, but be cautious.\n\n**MGM** \\- Another high risk stock. Again, this will likely come back in the long term, but I think you could do better with a solid tech stock or ETF in its place.\n\n**DKNG** \\- Probably overpriced, currently, but a decent long term pick.\n\n**QCOM** \\- solid company, great potential for both short term and long term. Buy lots of this one. Price target is $103; buy for under $90 if possible.\n\n**TMUS** \\- May struggle a bit in the next few weeks, but this is a solid pick. Might be a bit overpriced at the moment, but I think it will climb to $120 by the end of the year. Great long-term stock.\n\n**ETSY** \\- I think this is a decent pick, but it may be overbought at the moment. See if it dips, and buy the dip.\n\n**SQ** \\- I really like this company and this stock; but, again, I'm concerned that it may be overpriced. I'd watch for a dip, and buy then.\n\n**BA** \\- This one could be a good mid-term swing play. The MAX will be re-certified, and when that happens, I think the stock will pop. That said, the market for new jets may take years to reach the levels it was at a year ago. Buy, watch for the pop up, then sell.\n\n(Just my opinion. I own shares of NCLH, MGM and TMUS)",

        "body": "There are safety considerations with electromagnetic (EM) radiation.  Visible light, radiowaves, x-rays, etc are some of the bands on the complete spectrum of frequencies.  \n   \n[There are ionising and non-ionising bands as per this chart.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/375/cpsprodpb/2682/production/_107885890_5ggraphic-nc.png)  \n  \nFor ionising radiation like x-rays we have to limit exposure because it is harming our cells' dna. For non-ionising radiation we have to limit exposure because body tissue heats up when it absorbs them.  \n  \nConsider sunlight, which is a broad band of EM. We can feel infrared heating us up but we can't feel the UV burning us.  \n  \nWell, [5G is going to use frequencies up to about 100GHz](https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/30805-50906-An-illustration-of-the-areas-of-spectrum-5G-could-operate-within-via-Qualcomm-xl.jpg) which is much lower frequency band than sunlight and is not ionising radiation.  \n  \n5G is actually using microwaves so you know it can cook your flesh, except the power output of your phone's radio is kept well under the safe limits. The phone towers are a higher power output but the inverse square law means the receive level is quite low by the time it gets to you, and because of the number of mobile users, 5G towers and 4G towers are very close together transmitting on low power because that gives a cleaner signal and more data throughput.  \n  \nFinally I will quote the safe limit of 100GHz microwave output. [This NIH page mentions 10 Watts per square meter and 0.08 Watts per Kg.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765906/) A 5G phone will never get anywhere near that and the tower signal will be received by the antenna at about 0.0000001 Watts  and I would guess that your body would absorb about 1 milliWatt max from the tower. \n  \nSo because we have blood and sweat cooling us down, the tiny bit of heat is no issue. We're talking milliwatts total, compared to   sunlight which is about 1000W of radiation per square meter and some of that is ionising, unlike 5G. And even sunlight isn't too bad in moderation but 5G is fine as a low level background signal. Actually if you look on a spectrum analyser... there is a noise floor at 100GHz with signals here and there anyway.  \n  \nI hope that puts it into perspective... 5G is basically low power warm radiation and doesn't modify DNA (doesn't cause cancer). And it can't cook you because the power output is low, like TV and FM signals. It is like TV and radio signals but a higher band and with a much more efficient modulation scheme for data throughput.  \n  \nThanks for listening to my TED Talk.",

I couldn't find good larger software plays that might be a better business comparison. Maybe VMW, they have a 60 billion market cap. Which is still a 6x from where it is today. I think a 5x is a good target to sell a portion of winnings at (basically at around 150 share price). I think it is possible if they continue to eat market share and then turn on the earnings spigot. There are obviously risks that they can't -- I'm actually somewhat concerned that they have so much market share already but aren't profitable.",

This means that the company has been aggressive in debt financing which could shoot them in the foot if they cannot pay it off. But long term debt has been decreasing since 2018 which shows that they know that the company is over levered and have been paying off the debt. The company is extremely profitable with high margins and a high ROE/ROA. The P/E is in the high 20s which shows that investors expect high growth from the company which could hurt investors if the company cannot keep up with the pace. While the P/B ratio has been thrown aside by the investing community I still believe that it is an important metric. QCOM has an extremely high P/B ratio of 30+. Finally, the company has a worrying although not deadly current ratio of 1.5 which measures a company's ability to may off short term liabilities  (You **DO NOT** want a company with a current ratio &lt;1)",

The new one refused to sell chips at a fair market rate and demanded they buy entire mini-pc boards at 5 times the price, not just the chips.  Comma wasted $100k in r&amp;d developing a product they no longer had chips for. Now george hotz praises qualcomm, not for being cheap(gotta buy in larger batches), but for being consistent and reliable as a chip source so they can actually design a product around a chip and not get screwed.\n\ntl;dr nvidia is too expensive for anyone to use their chips, not because the chips are expensive to make, but because they have crappy pricing and don't guarantee supply unless you are a huge company.",

This alone tells me they probably have had a target before inception. Why? He has a full time dedicated career with a full plate. A man in that position is highly unlikely to undertake such a large endeavor on the possibility of acquiring a deal. Given his position and connections,  It is far more likely that he stumbled across an amazing opportunity or was approached by one. After consultation and/or careful deliberation, starting a SPAC was the fastest way to raise money and get this target to market. Given his background and ties I would also conclude that the target company will be in INDIA, which by the way has been making leaps and bounds in network expansion. IMO, they are hammering out the terms with the target now.  5G has already begun its rollout. So, it is in their best interest to announce sooner rather than later.",

I have been looking to enter that market since this year, but have not yet. Maybe I'll look to Cameco since our portfolios are already similar. \n\nI took take-two instead of Activision, but that's because I dislike Activision as a company. \n\nLike uranium for you, I've taken a similar stance on lithium. I've been trading lithium to get a feel for the market, but have not invested... Yet. Maybe Livent.\n\nFrom here we diverge a little: \n\nNo gold for me. \n\nI cover my web and cloud plays through ARK funds. ARKW and ARKK both cover web services with some overlap in ARKF. \n\nI also use ARKG for my biotech exposure. Especially illumina and crispr. \n\nThe only category I didn't feel was well represented in your portfolio was dividends. \n\nI hold XOM and IP for the dividends. IP is also defensive  in that it doesn't move much up or down. Just puts out dividends. XOM is hard to recommend, but those shares have been in my family since before I was alive and have paid for themselves many times over. \n\nI also hold some home builder tickers. Toll brothers and Lennar have been good to me, plus I like their products. \n\nYou mentioned tickers you may have missed. I push $pool on here any time someone asks that. It is my dark horse that no one else runs, but I love it. Just look at it.",

I would definitely buy these over QCOM or INTC. \n\nIf you want more growth (and therefore risk), you can go with AMD, MU, QRVO, or SWKS. Though do keep in mind that NVDA is growing very quickly. \n\nAlso, AVGO has a nice dividend.\n\nMy top semiconductor stock is NVDA. I want to buy in, but it\u2019s pretty overvalued. But it also keeps going up.",
