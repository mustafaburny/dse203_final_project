        "body": "One way I like to visualize dividend growth investing is by using Visa as an example. A lot of people might look at its current yield of 0.70% and think it would be a terrible dividend stock to own because they yield is so low. But when you look at the actual dividend amounts things start to become a lot more clear.\n\nIn 2009, Visa paid a dividend of $0.10 a share. In 2019 they paid a dividend of $1.00 a share. Visa's stock price was around $20 in 2009, so if we use that as our cost basis, the current dividend yield we'd be receiving from shares purchased in 2009 would be 5% (known as yield on cost). So basically even though Visa currently yields 0.70% to anyone buying today, that doesn't mean everyone holding shares is making 0.70% on their investment. \n\nThis is one of the reasons Warren Buffet has been so successful over the years. For example, his cost basis on Coca Cola is $3.25 per share, and the stock currently pays a dividend of $1.64 per share. This means Buffet's yield on cost is over 50%. He invested $1.3B in KO back in the late 80s and early 90s, and will now collect $654 million in income from the stock this year alone.",

So many of the mom and pop shop venues are probably going to close due to $0 cash flow this year. As long as LYV can make it out alive until restrictions are lifted... the only competitor in there way will be pretty much AEG and they can continue its pre-COVID momentum. Warning... the stock hasn't dropped a lot for a company that is in a cash crunch and has +95% revenue decrease, which surprises me. E\nWhat won't surprise me if the stock drops to $20 - $45 and I'll be a buyer.\n\nV and MA: Should also accelerate growth once a vaccine is available and transactions are lifted.
