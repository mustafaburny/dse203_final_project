It\u2019s already the most \u201cdiscounted\u201d semiconductor stock, and for good reason. \n\nMicron sells two kinds of memory: NAND and DRAM. Both of these memories have spot prices that swing day to day just like the prices of commodities (corn, crude oil, gold, etc...). There have been crashes in the DRAM/NAND price because of its long lead time to create the technology (10 week min) leading to slow agility for makers/sellers in terms of responding to supply and demand fluctuations. \n\nAnd supply is about to get fucked by the Chinese. New semiconductor company in China is making massive leaps in technology faster than expected. Micron says they\u2019ll be safe from Chinese NAND through 2021. This is wishful thinking, new estimates have expected Chinese nand output up 100% over previous projections. \n\nhttps://semianalysis.com/the-impending-chinese-nand-apocalypse/amp/",
