        "body": "MGI partnered with Ripple, to use Ripple's On Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which allows them to reduce the cost of their remittances by \\~70% and makes them instantaneous, as opposed to using traditional correspondent banking methods. Since they're not a bank they are less regulated and can get away with this. Western Union is the one who's tech is lagging.\n\nODL works by using partnered crypto exchanges at each end of the transaction to convert from the sending currency - to XRP - send the XRP - then convert to the destination currency, all within a few seconds. Since the XRP ledger is public you can track suspected ODL transactions here to get an idea of how it works:  [https://utility-scan.com/](https://utility-scan.com/).\n\nThey've also recently partnered with Uber. Small partnership at the moment but there's speculation that MGI and Ripple could be more heavily involved as uber expands their Uber Money and Uber Wallet setup.",

Would suggest making sure you are ok holding the name for a Long time in case it drops well below your strike price (or you're willing to just close for a loss).  Also consider dividend paying names so that you'll at least get something while waiting for it to recover.  There is a lot of low priced 'junk', but any stock scanner should let you filter on price if that is a 'hard' rule.   \n\nHow about either HPE or HPQ?
