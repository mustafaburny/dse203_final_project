Anywho, I'd like to impart some sage wisdom to all you young whipper-snappers.\n\n1) Diversification is key.  Some stocks go down at times.\n\n2) Invest heavily in safe securities:  IBM, GE, Sears (might be down, but it's bound to make a comeback; great catalog)\n\n3) High Yield savings accounts are wonderful for your portfolio\n\nLow Risk tolerance, slow and steady, conservative investing... that's the keys to success!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMort",

Let me let you in on a secret, this whole CPU improvement thing is bs. Intel already has the technology to beat AMD, they just pace themselves so that they can maximize profit. Don't you think it's strange that the products are SOOOOO similar year on year, that doesn't make any sense. CPUs are basically a monopoly through research and Intel holds the keys to the kingdom, trickling out the next phase so AMD keeps up so they don't get shut down as a monopoly.",

        "body": "My advice would be banish a few of the feelings and impressions you have expressed.  There's no reason for shame or feeling dumb.  You're ahead of at least 90% of people, many of whom never figure out that investing when young is critical.  \n\nHowever I'd also caution you to block out any feelings you have about your one year or investing experience. You've had about the easiest year possible and it's not typical whatsoever.  \n\nYou are correct that average people cannot possibly save their way to wealth.  Savings never exceed costs so they're pointless if your goal is wealth.\n\nMajor keys I'd suggest: Transfer your fears that were about markets into fears about debt and spending.  Treat debt and spending like smoking that can kill you.  If you can establish life habits now of being thrifty and not following the herds into debt, you'll be better off no matter what stock markets do.  Train yourself not to covet the nicest car or the biggest house.  \n\nConsider every transaction as to whether it's an asset or not, and be strict in the definition that it's only an asset if it pays you directly.  Define a liability as something that costs you money. \n\nA house and car don't pay you (unless you're doing AirBnB and Uber) , so they're not really assets.  Cars and houses cost you fuel and insurance and maintenance and utilities, so they're liabilities, and you want your liabilities as small as possible.\n\nDepending on your situation set up fundamentals like insurance and emergency fund and family protection.  Determine your risk and participation levels and whether that means you should basic index fund base before you do stock market investing.  \n\nAnother habit is to establish an up breakable rule that you'll always devote the first $____ of every month to your plan.  This commitment should be a stretch but it should be something you can afford.  The key is to never allow yourself to break it, even if it means you have to juggle or struggle for that month.  It's about mindset and discipline.  No cheat days.  \n\nMost people do the opposite, they treat their bills and bar budget as sacred, and then do saving/investing if there's anything left over.  You flip that around.  Make the first thing be the investing amount, make it mandatory, and then you'll force yourself to make sure you budget and adapt to do the other payments because you have to. \n\nThen, whatever funds you're prepared to lose, go at it.  Lots of people don't figure out what you have until they're at or near retirement.  You have your whole life so if you blew it all this year, you have a lifetime to reset.",

        "body": "The debit spread can be beneficial in any numbers of ways. The main ways I use them are:\n\n1. YOU WANT TO MAKE BUYING AN OPTION CHEAPER: In the case where you simply want to buy a put or call i.e.you have a strong feeling about a direction; you can sell a much poorer quality option (much further out of the money) to offset the initial cost, and to help minimize theta (time) decay as days go by. This strategy generally makes money if the stock goes in your direction but always sell if the underlying gets near the out of the money leg.\n\n2. YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY FROM THETA DECAY: If you have a significant amount of money at your disposal. You can buy a deep in the money option (in this case all the value is intrinsic) and sell a far out of the money option against it. This strategy will make money if the stock stays flat or goes in your direction (but not so much that it gets near the sold leg).\n\nThe art in spreads is always in the leg you sell. You always want to be selling the option in an area where you think the stock won't go. And if you can do that, that leg is essentially free money. It's like selling someone your house for cheap but after paying they have to fetch the keys off the top of Everest. Chances are you'll keep your house and their money, but occassionally things go really against you!",

They also don't need to use biometrics or location data for authentication. Here's some food for thought:\n\n* Google's 2017 Pixelbook [has a built-in hardware U2F key](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixelbook-u2f-token-built-in/) so you can use U2F without needing a separate hardware key.\n* GitHub has created a [macOS application](https://github.com/github/SoftU2F/) that emulates a U2F key so you can use U2F on a Mac without needing a separate hardware key.\n* Consider how Safari-integrated Apple Pay works on any iPhone or Mac with a Secure Enclave: if a website supports Apple Pay, the website will ask the iPhone to begin an Apple Pay transaction. The iPhone uses TouchID or FaceID to authenticate, the Secure Enclave does its thing, and then the phone sends the credit card token to the website. Picture the exact same thing, but where the credit card token is replaced by a U2F or WebAuthn token. Apple's Secure Enclave is the exact same concept as a U2F hardware key\u2014logical separation between a desktop OS and the storage of the cryptographic keys.\n\nAny device maker could adopt this type of stuff to create any smartphone or PC with its own secure U2F key built in. You know when a website has the option when you're logging in that says \"this is a public device, don't remember my login\" / \"this is a private device, keep me logged in.\" What I'm describing above would be a way for a device to prove that it's the same device as last time, automatically, without needing to plug in a separate U2F key each time.\n\nEdit: added detail and link",

I say to myself, she\u2019s heavier and a 6, but she\u2019s rich and nice so might as well hit it for the sport. Anyways we hangout for a bit and she kisses me goodbye, after 25 minutes of knowing me. A bit forward but hey this ones in the bag. She calls me half a bottle of wine deep that night and I come over and smash. Now while lined up from behind I got a whiff of \u201cuht oh\u201d that doesn\u2019t come from a butt. Like a true solider I turn on the fan and strategically point it where I the breeze is flowing away from us. She stops and says \u201clemme suck ur dick\u201d - pause - im in shock, my dick was just slamming this sweaty gross vag forever and now she wants to put her mouth on it? What do I do? She\u2019s gunna puke and tell everyone my dick is stinky. I pull an alt right and say \u201cya sure after I shower I\u2019m tired.\u201d Smooth. I wash my dick like no ones business and return, ready to receive fellatio. Gentleman this is where the story turns for the better. This tiny girl sucked the soul out of my body through my dick that night. Right down the hatch like a champ. Didn\u2019t bat an eyelash. 10/10 bomb killer head. Some so good I figured had to be an off night for her pussy. Maybe it was too hot, or the wine, maybe the wine. I said ok \u201cwill give her another shot tomorrow\u201d. \n\nTomorrow came but I didn\u2019t. For my boner was smacked down by a futile whiff from this dirty girls boner garage. Sex before that was great. Really great. She was down for whatever and was just my type. Vocal, aggressive &amp; dirty. I spent the next 3 days trying different scenarios to remedy this issue. Shower sex, random half clothed sex &amp; every position I could remember from my 17 years of watching porn. Alas, on the third day I sat there, on her couch in her beautiful loft condo. I knew that this issue was not going away, and I just couldn\u2019t do it. She knew something was up and was getting catty and annoying whilst making us some pasta dish for dinner. \u201cFind a way out man, find one\u201d I said to myself. She marches over and drops the plate in front of me. I look down. \u201cMushrooms\u201d I said outloud. \u201cWhat?\u201d She says. \u201cMushrooms\u201d I said again, louder. I hate them, you know this. \u201cOh wtf ____ why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d But I did tell her, many times. \u201cI\u2019ll just order a pizza from up the street\u201d. This was my ticket, I\u2019ll go to \u201cpick up a pizza\u201d and ghost her. Never to be seen or heard from again. She begins flipping out. I patiently wait 15 minutes and say \u201cok I\u2019m going to get the pizza.\u201d She looks at me funny. She knows. She knows something is up. She follows me out to my truck, begging me to stay. I tell her no, \u201cI\u2019m leaving, you\u2019re crazy and I\u2019m not coming back.\u201d She boils over. Screaming. She begins pleading. \u201cStay, Come and fuck me\u201d \u201cfuck me ___\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cna\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll suck your dick, just stay.\u201d My ears perked as blood rushes to my dong. At this point my inner monologue is a riot. Ultimately I come up with a plan to go back inside, get her butt naked while only my pants are down and then run out and away because she will be too naked to follow me. I say \u201cok, I\u2019ll bang you but then I\u2019m out.\u201d She obliges by reaching for my ignition to get my keys. Obviously I stop her and put them in my pocket. We go inside and the plan is unfolding perfectly. She blows me until I\u2019m at full salute, I turn the fan on and grimace in the mirror at myself as I head into the fray once more. I give it a solid 60 seconds before I smell sweat &amp; fish beginning to singe my nose hairs. I count down from three &amp; quickly pull out. Pants up. Out the door to my truck giggling the entire time. I can hear her coming. I fumble my keys on the way to the ignition. Truck on. Reverse.i look up and there she is. But naked in her driveway. Running towards my car. Boobs flailing, a 5\u2019 marshmallow with tits chasing my truck steps at least 20 yards yelling \u201cwait\u201d \u201cwait!!\u201d. I bust a one legger burnout in my awesome blazer and I\u2019m out of there. Stopped at the pizza place and ate my 45 minute old pizza with delight. Got home, washed my dick and never looked back. I did endure many calls &amp; texts. But that\u2019s my one gross pussy story. Damn proud of it too.",
