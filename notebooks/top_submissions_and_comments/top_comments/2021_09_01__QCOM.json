Only way to do well is to wait a couple months and buy at a bottom. Not interested. \n\nTsm prints money on PMCC because the price is so stable.  Have $115 Jan 2023 Leaps and been doing very well.

Intel is no where near competitive in pay compared to those companies and are losing people left and right. I know several of my friends who left Intel for companies like Apple, qualcomm and so on.\n\nIntel needs a revival from the ground up. Intel has a massive layer of middle managers who dont do much but have been around for 10+ years and do not plan on moving. But the young talented engineers, who are the actual foot soldiers who work on the products are leaving in droves.\n\n\nIntel needs a complete overhaul of its culture, management and compensation structure. I dont know if they can do that in time.",

        "body": "Less bad then you might think. Most people fundamentally misunderstand what caused the supply crunch thus fundamentally misunderstand who is adversely affected.\n\nCovid didn't suddenly cause a massive spike in demand in order to precipitate a crunch. There was some demand increase in consumer electronics sector as more people purchased equipement to work from home but this is rather minimal and mostly focused on products that people didn't already have and are using lower end semiconductor processes, think webcams, mice, keyboards. Take a look at LOGI to see how this side of the demand increase played out.\n\nNow, so what -actually- caused the supply crunch? Well actually it was automakers and other traditional industries that forecasted a massive decrease in demand cancelling or scaling back their supply contracts. This caused foundries to either spin down for retool or sell capacity to someone else. Both are having a significant impact on auto chips right now which are mostly produced on the less advanced 32nm+ node processes.\n\nThe latter is why this affects TSLA less (though they are ultimately still affected which I will address later). They went ahead and purchased the depressed capacity, similarly AAPL/GOOG/QCOM/MRVL all took advantage of this to buy up capacity and lock in cheaper rates for the next couple of years while autos and industrial companies were panicking about a sustained economic recession.\n\nHowever this still ultimately does affect TSLA (and NIO, LI, etc that took similar approaches) in that purchasing capacity during the dip doesn't protect you from increased requirements going forward due to growth. So while they aren't needing to cut production like traditional autos that stupidly cancelled their contracts they aren't able to grow capacity because the same companies that cancelled are now willing to buy capacity at a premium and are buying everything they can.\n\nThis has some big follow-on effects for the semi-conductor industry though, especially combined with developments over the last few years w.r.t geopolitics. Firstly all the big foundries (INTC/TSM/Samsung) are building out new fabs now. These take 2-3 years to online but once they do come online we are going to see a massive supply glut which will drastically lower the prices of NAND, consumer electronics chips etc and free up the older fabs for the next gen of auto/industrial chips which will slowly upgrade from 32nm+.\n\nThe boom/bust, crunch/glut cycle is nothing new for semi-conductors but there has just been a perfect storm of factors to make this particular cycle very noticable for the first time of people outside of consumer electronics.",
