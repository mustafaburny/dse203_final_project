It's been a few years since I did a deep dive,  but hardware was only about 25% of their revenue from what I remember.   Most of the revenue comes from licensing. \n\nThis is why Apple took them to court.   Every cell phone maker HAS to buy a license from QCOM since they own most of the IP for the modems, from 3G through 5G, cell phones don't work without QCOM IP.  \n\nNow QCOM doesn't sell individual licensing for modems,  it's just one license that includes the modems and the processors and everything else and it's expensive.   Once you buy the licensing,  the QCOM components are cheaper than the competition since they have small margins (after all,  they already made a bunch of money on the license).\n\nApple tried to play hardball and quit using QCOM,  but when IBM couldn't make a 5G modem,  they capitulated and signed a multi year contract with QCOM. \n\nStill lots of growth opportunities since all the IoT stuff is going to have modems and those modems are going to buy licensing from QCOM. \n\nI still own 100 shares at a negative cost basis (I had 250 shares at a low $60s basis and sold 150 shares above $130).",

Hard to interpret, but it seems like it is an open standard chip architecture mostly with emphasis on low-power consumption and security (mobile). It is meant to compete with ARM (Qualcomm snapdragon processors are ARM). There seems to be a concensus that this is better than the ARM architecture, which I have no problem believing.\n\nI don't understand their licensing model, but it looks like poison to any chip making company, even worse than open source is to software companies. I don't see it giving rise to a bunch of new chip companies because the cost of entry into that market is so high, and tying your hands with this weird opensource licensing would only increase uncertainty.\n\nI know Nvidia tried to buy ARM and now they are recruiting chip designers with CPU experience. I don't know what that means, but RISC-V is supposed to support vector operations, which is speed advantage of a GPU, presumably without the same amount of difficulty to implement (although even that is getting easier). No strong sense of what impact RISC-V will have long term. If Qualcomm adopted RISC-V over ARM, I'd consider investing in Qualcomm.",

If anything Aerojet has become a stronger company as they wait for approvals. \n\nI agree to an extent that it can be picking up pennies, however I only participate in cash out arbitrages when the underlying company is a good sound company in case of a deal collapse. A great example was when I participated in the NXPI deal when they were suppose to be bought by QCOM in a cash deal. The deal collapsed due to regulators blocking it and their stock price significantly dropped in the short term. However, holding them for the long term afterwards paid off and I believe a similar situation with AJRD is happening. There are risks which give it a tremendous spread to cash out price and if the deal falls through yes there will be a drop. But if you hold it for the long term I believe you can recover your short term loss.",

Those three have the lowest P/E ratio in their industry. They're priced as though they're headed into the shitty side of the semiconductor industry cycle, but they have angles that are diversifying away from memory chips in the case of MU, INTC is I believe in the process of tentative beginning of a turnaround story driven by the chip shortage, and QCOM is diversifying out of 5G and preparing well and fast for Apple developing their own modems, which isn't guaranteed.",

Only way to do well is to wait a couple months and buy at a bottom. Not interested. \n\nTsm prints money on PMCC because the price is so stable.  Have $115 Jan 2023 Leaps and been doing very well. If you pick the right strategy you can make money on lots of stocks\n\nI think OP forgot to mention TSM just raised prices 20% to increase margin and pay for more capacity so their financials should improve in next Q or 2 which will cause the price to continue increasing.",

        "body": "Less bad then you might think. Most people fundamentally misunderstand what caused the supply crunch thus fundamentally misunderstand who is adversely affected.\n\nCovid didn't suddenly cause a massive spike in demand in order to precipitate a crunch. There was some demand increase in consumer electronics sector as more people purchased equipement to work from home but this is rather minimal and mostly focused on products that people didn't already have and are using lower end semiconductor processes, think webcams, mice, keyboards. Take a look at LOGI to see how this side of the demand increase played out.\n\nNow, so what -actually- caused the supply crunch? Well actually it was automakers and other traditional industries that forecasted a massive decrease in demand cancelling or scaling back their supply contracts. This caused foundries to either spin down for retool or sell capacity to someone else. Both are having a significant impact on auto chips right now which are mostly produced on the less advanced 32nm+ node processes.\n\nThe latter is why this affects TSLA less (though they are ultimately still affected which I will address later). They went ahead and purchased the depressed capacity, similarly AAPL/GOOG/QCOM/MRVL all took advantage of this to buy up capacity and lock in cheaper rates for the next couple of years while autos and industrial companies were panicking about a sustained economic recession.\n\nHowever this still ultimately does affect TSLA (and NIO, LI, etc that took similar approaches) in that purchasing capacity during the dip doesn't protect you from increased requirements going forward due to growth. So while they aren't needing to cut production like traditional autos that stupidly cancelled their contracts they aren't able to grow capacity because the same companies that cancelled are now willing to buy capacity at a premium and are buying everything they can.\n\nThis has some big follow-on effects for the semi-conductor industry though, especially combined with developments over the last few years w.r.t geopolitics. Firstly all the big foundries (INTC/TSM/Samsung) are building out new fabs now. These take 2-3 years to online but once they do come online we are going to see a massive supply glut which will drastically lower the prices of NAND, consumer electronics chips etc and free up the older fabs for the next gen of auto/industrial chips which will slowly upgrade from 32nm+.\n\nThe boom/bust, crunch/glut cycle is nothing new for semi-conductors but there has just been a perfect storm of factors to make this particular cycle very noticable for the first time of people outside of consumer electronics.",
