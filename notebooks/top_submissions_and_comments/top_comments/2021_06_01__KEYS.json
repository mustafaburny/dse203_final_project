Years down the line, the same title will be sold for a fraction of the price on their own platform... and that's it.\n\nWhy the focus on the amount of times a digital title can earn the publisher money? The incremental costs of producing additional copies of a digital game are near 0.\n\n&gt; A small percentage off tens of thousands of resales of an old or obsolete title that is no longer offered in the publisher's own catalogue vs. buying the game from the publishers' own old game discount bin for a few bucks... again, once? Might not make sense initially, but especially in the used / old game market those small revenue streams would add up: especially when compared to a scenario where users would not otherwise buy the game.\n\nI still don't see the incentive for a publisher to cannibalize their own sales. As an example, Fallout: New Vegas was released in 2010 on Steam and other digital platforms. It cost $59.99 then. \n\nToday, Fallout: New Vegas is available on Steam for $9.99. A person that wants a copy of the game can buy it today. The publisher will receive the same percentage cut of the $9.99 sale that they received from the $59.99 sale.\n\nLet's now assume that Gamestop has a digital NFT token that allows resale of digital games. Someone in 2010 buys the game for $59.99, and today sells its for $9.99. The publisher receives a cut of the $9.99 sale, in addition to the original $59.99 sale.\n\nThe problem here is, what's the difference to the publisher? They receive the same amount of money from the sales. The keys to sell a second copy of the game have already been generated and sent to Steam for resale, so there's no incremental cost there. The NFT resale is basically cannibalizing a new sale.\n\n&gt; drive up scarcity of used titles? Release special NFT collector's versions of certain titles which are unlikely to ever go down in price due to extreme rarity?\n\n&gt; Especially the latter: think Magic the Gathering and take the Black Lotus card as an example. If you could release a fixed amount of those into the wild and get a cut for each and every high-price resale of those decades down the line... wouldn't you?\n\nI can see the argument/value for NFT sales of collectible items intended to be artificially scarce. Maybe not a multibillion dollar market, but definitely a possible avenue for revenue growth.\n\n I don't see the argument for driving artificial scarcity for regular, non collectible digital games. Even in the pre digital games, the games that were scarce were driven by production costs, and not by publishers attempting to drive up prices by limiting availability.",

The merger and its accompanying PIPE allowed the firm to pay down debt and cut its leverage, and now it wants to lock in the benefits with a lower-cost refi.\n\nJP Morgan is sole physical bookrunner on the dollar and euro term loans, totalling $1.026bn between the currencies. This will be followed with an equal sized slug of bonds in dollar and euros, yet to be launched.\nTalk on both tranches is 300bp-325bp at 99.5, with a 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, half a turn below its present level, according to the loan marketing materials.\nLenders have successfully pushed back on proposed margin ratchet terms \u2014\u00a0including Cerba, for example \u2014 but these are generally deals which started with more aggressive terms, such as multiple step-downs for each quarter-turn of leverage. Deals with 25bp for half a turn have largely sailed through.\n\"It's a real economic term and something investors can easily rally around,\" said a leveraged finance syndicate banker. \"Some of the other docs points can be a bit of a niche interest but this is universal.\"\nPaysafe earmarked \u20ac1.25bn-equivalent of its outstanding debt for repayment as part of the merger, which closed at the end of March. The company said in\u00a0its introduction to equity market analysts\u00a0that it would have net leverage of 3.6-3.8 times on its 2021 earnings following the transaction \u2014 suggesting it intends to activate the margin step-down quickly.\nIt will, however, be going on the acquisition trail as well. Outlining the deal to analysts, Foley said: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6 times. As Paysafe continues to grow and generate cash flow, that leverage ratio will continue to come down creating even more opportunity to pursue accretive M&amp;A opportunities.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s estimated leverage at 5.2 times on March 2021 numbers, after backing out some of the company\u2019s adjustments.\nBased on its expected 2021 Ebitda, the business was 6-6.2 times levered at the end of last year, with net debt of $2.99bn, incurred when Blackstone and CVC took the firm private in 2017. The sponsors scored a huge win with the transaction, paying \u00a33bn for the company and selling it on at a valuation of $9bn.\nHowever, both firms will remain invested. They took $2.3bn off the table as part of the Spac deal, but rolled over $3.29bn, while the Spac itself put in $1.467bn.\nThe PIPE investment (private investment in public equity) closed at the same time injected a further $2bn, with cornerstones from Foley-affiliated entities Cannae Holdings and Trasimene Capital Management, and outside capital from Fidelity, Third Point, and Maplelane Asset Management.\nAlongside the term loan and bond refi, the company will have a new $305m revolver in place following the closing of the deal.\nSpac-driven M&amp;A activity is increasingly\u00a0feeding through to leveraged credit markets and to CLO portfolios, as sponsor-owned companies become targets for SPAC acquisitions. The equity raised through this route usually deleverages the company, meaning loan repayments or refinancings tighter \u2014 in some cases, helping take out loans trading at low levels at par.\nPaysafe\u2019s existing euro loan already had a margin of 325bp, the wide end of the new guidance, but it also had outstanding second lien debt of $200m and \u20ac214m in its original LBO capital structure, which paid 725bp and 700bp respectively and have now been repaid.",

        "body": "No, you do not own crypto with WealthSimple. Also, a lot of people are investing in crypto-ETFs without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual crypto. You will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. That is a pretty big risk even though they can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

But I actually listen to what others say and I pay close attention to what competitors are doing and developing. The facts are that they still don\u2019t make comparable products and people still don\u2019t make any actual arguments against Tesla. \n\nI\u2019m open to learn and encourage discussion about why Tesla won\u2019t be the winner, but no one says anything other than things like you\u2019ve just commented. Tesla bulls get blown off with \u201cthey aren\u2019t profitable\u201d \u201ccompetitors will catch them\u201d \u201cstock is overvalued\u201d but these aren\u2019t based on facts, it\u2019s FUD and speculation and not reasons why the company won\u2019t continue to win. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019ve speculated on is that it is the best investment Long term, and that they will be the largest company by revenue. Which I backed up with reasoning that is based on current information available to everyone. \n\nTo comment on your first point, if all those things were true then how would they not be leading in revenue? The top companies by revenue are in energy, oil and gas, and automotive (other than retail), if Tesla is leading in all these sectors and continue to post insane profit margins they would be leading in revenue.\n\nTesla is also about to turn insurance on its head and will have the best possible rates due to large pools of data that their cars collect for them for free. If they solve FSD their robotaxis will be free money, they have all the keys to solving it and are the only company actually attempting this. Waymo is limited to level 4 autonomy and is not able to profitably compete at scale because of the amount of effort it takes to render and update their maps which are needed for the cars to work, unlike Tesla who\u2019s cars actually understand what they are doing and have been doing this safely for millions of uninterrupted miles. \n\nThere is so much to be bullish about and so little to be bearish about. As I said, please point out something I\u2019m missing that is backed by facts and not fake news.",

        "body": "In all seriousness though, I think NFT have real value... Errr, uhm, some of them do. The concept makes great sense. For instance, baseball cards and comic books are collectible and worth money. Many people place value on the physical asset but in reality if the card or book was blank then it would have no collectible value. So if the value is content then it makes sense to store it digitally for a multitude of reasons. However, comics and baseball cards become more valuable over time as they become more rare due to loss from circulation. I think this is the idea behind issuing only a certain number of NFT... Limit supply to generate some value. Some of those digital assets (NFTs) may be lost over time, like BTC removed from circulation because people forget keys, but will be less than physical collectibles. So circling back to original question, I don't think so NFT will come crashing down, much like all collectibles don't lose value simultaneously. It really depends on each NFT and categories of NFT. Do I think lots will lose value? Yes, absolutely, because many have no real following and it's relatively few people buying them up. However, the NFT for Charlie bit my finger is immensely popular and will always hold value because it generates cash flow to the holder through YouTube views, licensing, etc. Ultimately I could see the digitizing of many assets including real property as NFTs.",

Seeing how beaten down everything was gave me hope and ambition that smart money placements would grant good returns, which they have. I think balance is so vital, because if you own a stock but it's weight in your portfolio is only 10%, then in the event of a huge drop your overall losses are minimized. \n\nNothing that I've said is special, I just think perspective and mentality are keys as well as sticking to whatever investment/trading strategy is right for you.",

        "body": "options are great way to define your risk. Learn basic one sided \u2014like buy a call or a put if you have a sense of direction. If moves against you then sell it. I started that way in mid 90s and have never looked back.  You don\u2019t need complicated strategies but may want to add some of the basic ones as you gain experience.  My first play was 3 calls at .50 on a $22 stock.   It ran and coupe days later that $150 play was worth $1300. So the leverage is great, but if you get stupid or greedy and don\u2019t cut losses when they are small and take profit often  then it don\u2019t matter if you are in stocks or options, you will probably wipe out the account. Education is the 1st key\u2014proper execution is all the next keys combined.  Additionally, DO NOT go naked (just selling premiums), no matter how enticing it looks\u2014that is an expert game and hedging is always needed or you assume infinite risk).  And the experts screw up a lot, so don\u2019t think you are smarter or have found an edge.  You haven\u2019t.",

Steam isn't even very good at selling things it does sell. Discoverability is down the drain. Greenlight didn't work out, just like that nephew of yours. Shovelware dominates the whole thing.
