Years down the line, the same title will be sold for a fraction of the price on their own platform... and that's it.\n\nWhy the focus on the amount of times a digital title can earn the publisher money? The incremental costs of producing additional copies of a digital game are near 0.\n\n&gt; A small percentage off tens of thousands of resales of an old or obsolete title that is no longer offered in the publisher's own catalogue vs. buying the game from the publishers' own old game discount bin for a few bucks... again, once? Might not make sense initially, but especially in the used / old game market those small revenue streams would add up: especially when compared to a scenario where users would not otherwise buy the game.\n\nI still don't see the incentive for a publisher to cannibalize their own sales. As an example, Fallout: New Vegas was released in 2010 on Steam and other digital platforms. It cost $59.99 then. \n\nToday, Fallout: New Vegas is available on Steam for $9.99. A person that wants a copy of the game can buy it today. The publisher will receive the same percentage cut of the $9.99 sale that they received from the $59.99 sale.\n\nLet's now assume that Gamestop has a digital NFT token that allows resale of digital games. Someone in 2010 buys the game for $59.99, and today sells its for $9.99. The publisher receives a cut of the $9.99 sale, in addition to the original $59.99 sale.\n\nThe problem here is, what's the difference to the publisher? They receive the same amount of money from the sales. The keys to sell a second copy of the game have already been generated and sent to Steam for resale, so there's no incremental cost there. The NFT resale is basically cannibalizing a new sale.\n\n&gt; drive up scarcity of used titles? Release special NFT collector's versions of certain titles which are unlikely to ever go down in price due to extreme rarity?\n\n&gt; Especially the latter: think Magic the Gathering and take the Black Lotus card as an example. If you could release a fixed amount of those into the wild and get a cut for each and every high-price resale of those decades down the line... wouldn't you?\n\nI can see the argument/value for NFT sales of collectible items intended to be artificially scarce. Maybe not a multibillion dollar market, but definitely a possible avenue for revenue growth.\n\n I don't see the argument for driving artificial scarcity for regular, non collectible digital games. Even in the pre digital games, the games that were scarce were driven by production costs, and not by publishers attempting to drive up prices by limiting availability.",

        "body": "\nPaysafe preps post-Spac\u00a0refi\n\u00a0\n\n02 Jun 2021\n\nFintech payments provider Paysafe has launched a refinancing of its remaining credit facilities, following its $9bn merger with a Bill Foley-controlled Spac, which closed in March. The merger and its accompanying PIPE allowed the firm to pay down debt and cut its leverage, and now it wants to lock in the benefits with a lower-cost refi.\n\nJP Morgan is sole physical bookrunner on the dollar and euro term loans, totalling $1.026bn between the currencies. This will be followed with an equal sized slug of bonds in dollar and euros, yet to be launched.\nTalk on both tranches is 300bp-325bp at 99.5, with a 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, half a turn below its present level, according to the loan marketing materials.\nLenders have successfully pushed back on proposed margin ratchet terms \u2014\u00a0including Cerba, for example \u2014 but these are generally deals which started with more aggressive terms, such as multiple step-downs for each quarter-turn of leverage. Deals with 25bp for half a turn have largely sailed through.\n\"It's a real economic term and something investors can easily rally around,\" said a leveraged finance syndicate banker. \"Some of the other docs points can be a bit of a niche interest but this is universal.\"\nPaysafe earmarked \u20ac1.25bn-equivalent of its outstanding debt for repayment as part of the merger, which closed at the end of March. The company said in\u00a0its introduction to equity market analysts\u00a0that it would have net leverage of 3.6-3.8 times on its 2021 earnings following the transaction \u2014 suggesting it intends to activate the margin step-down quickly.\nIt will, however, be going on the acquisition trail as well. Outlining the deal to analysts, Foley said: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6 times. As Paysafe continues to grow and generate cash flow, that leverage ratio will continue to come down creating even more opportunity to pursue accretive M&amp;A opportunities.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s estimated leverage at 5.2 times on March 2021 numbers, after backing out some of the company\u2019s adjustments.\nBased on its expected 2021 Ebitda, the business was 6-6.2 times levered at the end of last year, with net debt of $2.99bn, incurred when Blackstone and CVC took the firm private in 2017. The sponsors scored a huge win with the transaction, paying \u00a33bn for the company and selling it on at a valuation of $9bn.\nHowever, both firms will remain invested. They took $2.3bn off the table as part of the Spac deal, but rolled over $3.29bn, while the Spac itself put in $1.467bn.\nThe PIPE investment (private investment in public equity) closed at the same time injected a further $2bn, with cornerstones from Foley-affiliated entities Cannae Holdings and Trasimene Capital Management, and outside capital from Fidelity, Third Point, and Maplelane Asset Management.\nAlongside the term loan and bond refi, the company will have a new $305m revolver in place following the closing of the deal.\nSpac-driven M&amp;A activity is increasingly\u00a0feeding through to leveraged credit markets and to CLO portfolios, as sponsor-owned companies become targets for SPAC acquisitions. The equity raised through this route usually deleverages the company, meaning loan repayments or refinancings tighter \u2014 in some cases, helping take out loans trading at low levels at par.\nPaysafe\u2019s existing euro loan already had a margin of 325bp, the wide end of the new guidance, but it also had outstanding second lien debt of $200m and \u20ac214m in its original LBO capital structure, which paid 725bp and 700bp respectively and have now been repaid.",

        "body": "I've found I've had best luck with a balance of passive and active investing. I start with a portfolio of index funds based on factor investing(mostly chasing value premium),  and devote a small percentage of my portfolio to at most a few individual stocks where I'm confident they are undervalued.\n\nI've had a lot of luck with this strategy so far. What I've learned from my early mistakes is:\n\n1. Don't own anything unless you have a very good reason for owning it. If your reason is \"their dividend is good\", \"their business is booming\", or \"they seem like a sustainable business\", just stick with index funds. You need a compelling reason the market is not valuing them fairly, something that isn't priced in. When I bought SLV, it was because I knew it was a temporary liquidity crunch and that fed actions would drive inflation fears. When I bought LUMN, it was because I took a deep look into their financials and determined they were undervalued. When I bought Western Digital &amp; Seagate, it was because I saw the potential for Chia to boost their earnings.\n\n2. Buy as if you can't sell for 5 years. It's possible that after you buy, the price starts dropping and doesn't recover. If that happens, will you be comfortable holding it? If the answer is no, then either don't buy, or keep it to a very small position.\n\n3. Don't buy a ton individual stocks to \"diversify\". 1 stock you are confident in accounting for 5% of your portfolio and a broad market index like VTI for the remaining 95% is safer than 40 manually picked stocks each representing 2.5%.",

US could have said we don't use your 5G equipment and that's final. But that's not all they did. They forbid Google licensing Android to them, they forbid everyone from selling chips from them, they even made a big fuss about Seagate selling HDDs to them. It wasn't just about 5G equipment. They destroyed the whole company just to spite China. Now, yes BABA probably don't care about spying on US but say if their cloud business really takes off, and there are these tensions with China and US really wants to damage China in any way they could just say BABA is selling software to Chinese military to enslave muslim minorities or some such bullshit and we would see all sorts of bans and sanctions. Certainly say goodbye to your ADRs. Logical? No. Makes sense to weaken your biggest rival in any way in geopolitical sense? Yea. I would not think something like that is impossible.",
