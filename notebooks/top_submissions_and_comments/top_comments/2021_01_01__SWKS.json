        "body": "I've been doing it for about a year now. In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",
