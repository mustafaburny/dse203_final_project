        "body": "Neither of these names are speculative. In fact, I believe both companies - should they continue to position themselves accordingly - have one of the longest growth runways of any stocks on the market. I realize that is quite the statement, but most of the analysts and commentators have not had a full understanding of the technologies on offer or the potential end-markets these two can service (I suppose you can throw Akamai into the mix, but they\u2019ve been slower to get into the edge computing game). \n\nA lot of people have almost exclusively characterized these two as CDN providers. A content delivery network utilizes edge servers (servers placed at a geographical proximity closer to the end-user) to cache web content (text, images, videos, etc.) from websites and applications so that they can be sent to a web client more quickly and more securely. \n\nHowever, that is just one part of what these companies offer. The real promise for me is 5G and IoT. As the 5G buildout matures, it will be more economical to deploy IoT devices for a greater breadth of companies. Because of this, there will be an exponential demand for data transmission. Projections have put the growth of the global datasphere at nearly 300% over the next four years alone. \n\nSecurity will be huge in this type of computing environment, more so than today even, as sensors and IoT devices track and manage the performance of logistics, industrial, and transportation systems. Despite numerous advantages of edge computing, it also increases the number of attack vectors for network intrusion. Therefore security offerings and DDoS mitigation capacity will be big selling points for IoT customers to choose a network provider. \n\nWhile the CDN market will continue to grow at a fairly consistent pace as more people work from home, stream video, do shopping online, etc., the broader edge computing market will probably end up dwarfing the CDN market in terms of size. \n\nFor me, you can definitely say the valuations are stretched - on pretty much any metric. At the same time, I don\u2019t think the TAM that these companies are exposed to is being fully taken into account. Neither is the fact that this is a mega-trend that will likely not run its full course until 2030 or 2035. \n\nRisks are that they lose competitive positioning, end-market demands shift, too much spending on the network prevents profitability and multiples eventually shrink as growth comes down. I\u2019m sure new ones could emerge, but it\u2019s not hard for me to see how these companies can continue to execute and sustain richer valuations. Especially in the case of Cloudflare, with their margins, they have the potential to be a cash cow.",

Limelight Networks is more of a competitor to Fastly.\n\n\nThey share a lot of the same mechanics but the differentiator is their product focus. High quality speed only makes privacy less of a business risk and they don't charge you more for getting DDoSed. \n\nFastly will give you cheap and quality video services.\n\nNeither lock you into a vendor like Azure or AWS.",

Feedback on my ideas (good idea/bad idea/etc.) and any advice in general is much appreciated. I haven\u2019t looked into anything but single companies thus far, and want to look into other ways to invest but don\u2019t know where to start, so recommendations on where to start would great. \n\nMy ideas thus far:\nVerizon, \nClorox,\nGeneral dynamics,\nNvidia ,\nSquare ,\nAkamai ,\nScott\u2019s Miracle Gro ,\nAdvanced Micro Devices ,\nThermo Fisher Scientific ,\nLockheed Martin ,\nNorthrop Grumman \n\nI know these are all massive companies and represent value rather than growth investing.

        "body": "Akamai Technologies stock is trading higher Thursday after Cowen analyst Colby Synesael raised his rating on the content-delivery network company to Outperform from Market Perform, while upping his target price to $150 from $107.\n\nSynesael is basically making the observation (which I made in an April Tech Trader column) that Akamai shares (ticker: AKAM) have not participated in the huge rally in internet infrastructure plays amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The analyst says there is now a \"meaningful disconnect\" between Akamai and other security and CDN stocks, despite its larger scale, higher profitability and \" still solid growth.\" He sees Akamai as an \"attractive way\" to play long-term trends like cloud security and edge computing.\n\nSynesael points out that the stock looks cheap relative to both security plays like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) and to other content- delivery networks, such as Cloudflare (NET), Fastly (FSLY), and Limelight Networks (LLNW). He argues that Covid-19 has served as a catalyst to Akamai's security and CDN businesses.\n\n\"We believe Covid-19 has resulted in increased demand for both its enterprise and internet security product offerings given the increase in the number of attacks across organizations and the internet,\" Synesael writes. \"We believe Akamai's security business is an underappreciated component of its long- term growth opportunity and that as it becomes a larger portion of total revenue more investors are likely to start valuing it on its [sum of the parts] which we believe will result in a significant re-rating of the stock.\"\n\nThe analyst notes that there have been investor concerns about the company losing market share to peers like Fastly, but asserts that \"the growth of competitors is more a function of an expanding opportunity for CDN providers rather than share stealing from Akamai.\"\n\nAkamai shares were up 7%, at $113.78, in recent trading, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9%. The stock is up about 32% year to date, which is impressive growth -- except when compared with Cloudflare, which has more than doubled, and Fastly, which has more than quadrupled",

This resulted in higher transaction approval rates and eliminated the need for businesses to sign multiple agreements and connect to multiple providers. Back in 2014 no one else was doing this. The closest thing was Global Collect but they didn\u2019t have direct connections. Each time you add a \u2018hop\u2019 in the transaction flow data is slightly altered (true reason for transaction failure is obscured) and it creates more points of failure. Pricing is also impacted.\n\nAfter that, they were the first company to HEAVILY invest on creating one platform for both in store transactions and online transactions. Before this you had some firms very good at POS and others very good at CNP. This meant if someone buys something online the in store POS doesn\u2019t have full visibility or and easy way to refund a online order.\n\nTo your specific question, until 2010 ANET was only a gateway and required merchants to have a separate merchant account with an acquiring bank to process payments. Post CyberSource acquisition of ANET they offered acquiring services as well, but it was (and still is) limited to the US and UK.\n\nAdyen (literally translated to \u201cdo it again\u201d) also had a leg up since the founders created and sold Bibit (translated to \u201cseed\u201d - watch it grow) and knew a lot about the industry and challenges.\n\nWhat is a problem for Adyen is they have become arrogant (some could argue rightfully so) and this is turning off a segment of the merchant community.",

Samsung is probably the second best in the world, and they're a good 3 years behind TSMC's current node.\n\nTSMC manufactures chips for companies like Apple, AMD and Tesla. This is how good their reputation is. They're the best.\n\nBet against shit companies. Not the Rolls Royces of the industrial world.\n\nIf you're gonna bet against a foundry, bet against UMC or something. If Intel were just a foundry, I'd bet against them, because their foundry side has been floundering for years now. But I would never bet against Intel's sales and marketing....",

This has started to decay a bit in recent years, but the last time AMD had the better CPUs in the processor space (a couple of decades ago) you still could not buy a PC with an AMD processor because of various contracts Intel had with the PC manufacturers.\n\nThis is no longer an accurate description of the market. AMD and Intel are both widely available in basically every single OEM's product lineups. I'm sure there's a few random OEMs out there that only use one chip manufacturer for accidental reasons - they got a good wholesale deal, or they have a limited lineup of models and it was easier to use a single chipset - but in general AMD is equally available from all the big OEMs.",
