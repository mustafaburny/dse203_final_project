        "body": "So now, the big inflation component is a supply shortage - the other component, velocity of money, which is what spills inflation into every aspect of the economy, has yet to take off. When this happens we see what we see now - industry-specific inflation while others that don't make sense to have inflation aren't showing it. \n\nMost consumables are domestic and insulated from international freight shipping cost. As long as the local supply is not constrained, there's not much threat of inflation at first. Why would you expect to see the price of fruit go up when they ship in from the next state over and the crop yield is good? \n\nAnd four different industries that all face supply chain issues will take different amounts of time before the costs start getting passed onto the consumer. This is common with companies like Western Digital or Toshiba that buy semiconductor chips (NAND, DRAM chips) because they know to stockpile inventory ahead of time. They can deplete inventory and shelter clients from cost increases for a while, while they're waiting for backlogged orders to be met. \n\nWhereas the cost of building a new home was driven up by lumber shortage. So those home construction companies didn't anticipate a lumber shortage and we saw more immediate price impact.",
