        "body": "This sort of discussion is why r/investing finds WSB a joke. But I still love my WSB memes.\n\n\\- It's clearly overvalued, even a fully retarded understanding of FA will show you that.Even after the recent drop it's valued at around 40x REVENUES (LOL), not EARNINGS. Other tech stocks have nowhere near these valuations. FB has a revenue multiple of around 8. Difference is FB and other stocks actually have a decent chunk of revenue converted ( and will continue to be converted to revenue) to EARNINGS. ZM has almost ZERO prospects of converting even a fraction of this revenue into earnings due to :\n\n\\- Bigger,better competition with massive amounts of capital to invest compared to ZOOM. Google, MSFT, FB, CISCO, ADOBE. Do you really think that if there was that much money to be made in the videoconferencing sector ZM will even have any significant market share a short time from now?  What kind of earnings or margin do you see be made on this small market share, if any? These companies have just cloned what worked for Zoom and offered it for free through their existing interlinked platforms. Offered a similar ( and eventually better) product for FREE, not a great investment thesis for ZM longer term. Video conferencing is NOT a high tech, heavily patented sector, it's essentially freeware longer term. The software development is basic and we wouldn't even be talking about Zoom if it wasn't for beer aids. \n\n\\- Beer aids has peaked, at least fear of it has. People will start going back to offices around the world soon, no long term thesis for zoom's current price. One of the first things struggling businesses and companies cut during downturns is non-essential IT expenses, so like I said, even if you think a recession/possibly depression is likely (I do) you would cut zoom use across the company and move to a free platform.\n\n\\-ZM was clearly a meme stock bought buy poor , first time normies or mum and dad investors that was happily dumped on them shortly after the IPO. Fuck me, to get and idea of the average investor just remember that ZOOM ticker mooned because investors didn't even bother to check the right ticker for this pile of shit and bought the wrong company. ZOOM trading was even suspended lol. Being a med-long investor on ZM is like flying a booking a spaceflight where everyone on the vessel including the flight crew tell you BEFOREHAND that they are mongoloids but you still buy a ticket anyway. \n\n\\- Security issues, zoombombing, shit load of existing tech companies exploiting the shit out of these stuff ups as they ramp up their own products. The power google,FB and others have using their advertising budget and other media platforms to promote their own product shouldn't be underestimated - just look at the propaganda that been put out by big tech the last few days.\n\n\\- Friday was just a tiny dead cat bounce with people taking profits and/or some market makers covering their spreads on expiration, the drop was anticipated but happened a bit quicker than many were expecting imo. That's my retards opinion on the open interest and the put/call ratio activity anyway. There where a shit load of calls on this and still are that are now way OTM and will expiry useless over the next couple of weeks and have already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- How many more reasons do you need? This is WSB, Elon bipolar rant over. Iv'e been short on this dumpster fire since the 7% below the top, mostly unbalanced butterflys and backspreads and I even gone full retard at points and just bought straight puts occasionally. They have been printing but to be honest I feel a bit sorry for the mum and dad investors who bought this cos they saw their kids using the app - they are not stupid, probably smarter than me most of them- but they have been handed this pile of shit by CNBC and analysts who work for the same banks that made fees on the IPO and selling on the spike.",

I've bought SQ, DDOG and ADBE but I sold them all already after +20%. This is something I'd normally never do. I still have GOOGL and FB but might dump these later too. The difference with 09 is that tech is now seen as a safe haven.\n\nSo what's left?\n\nAll your small &amp; midcaps will be reporting weak Q2 numbers combined with bad news around banks probably underestimating all the bad debt they need to take on. Correct guidance after Q2 will determine whether it's time to start loading up. You could already start now but you're probably too early.\n\nThe companies to look at are those that benefit from whatever situation will be happening or the ones that have a battered share price and are likely to climb again. All very difficult to predict considering there might be some bodies buried in all the bad debt estimations. Some stuff I'm doing now is:\n\n\\- Put profit from tech stocks in my All-World ETF for the long term.\n\n\\- Increased my stake in companies like AER when they dip, airline leasing will profit from this situation for example. \n\n\\- Looking at the EU market for real estate stocks with strong balance sheets to enter after Q2",

People pirating the software go on to work at companies that buy the same software.  \n\nDitto to OSS, or free accounts below a certain threshold... they are effectively marketing costs to grow the user base which you later hope to monetize.\n\nAs a prime example, I use Fusion360 as a hobbyist.  But if I ever transitioned to a business where I needed to use CAD/CAM for my dayjob, there's a strong chance I'd reach for Fusion because I already know it.  And then I'd be a paying customer (or my boss would be).\n\nRegarding Autodesk in particular, I think they've done a really good job marketing Fusion to students and hobbyists, and are continually adding in functionality from their other software offerings.  It's all over the 3d printing and hobbyist CNC sphere, and at least some of those people will be pushing to use it at their day job.  \n\nNot to say it's the better software by any means, whole industries are entrenched in competitors (CATIA / NX for aero, etc), but they've done a pretty good job pushing the hobby/student angle imo.",

        "body": "I can give the perspective from a tech/software dev.\n\nIn my opinion, these are sort of different players. In fact, I would say that NVDA and AMD are far more analogous to each other than even AMD -&gt; AAPL, and certainly to MSFT. The  way that I see it, NVDA/AMD are fundamentally companies that are concerned with producing a *physical good* \\- literal chipsets and dies. AAPL seems to waver on the hardware side of things (they have been known to go proprietary in that arena, but have also loaned out work to INTC on more than one occasion). I most certainly see MSFT as a true software/PaaS/SaaS company - suffice to say that they are producing very little in the way of physical goods.\n\nI think the *soft/hardware* direction is important to mention, because that fundamentally plays into the way that these companies deal in the market. Developing hardware is a mind-bendingly expensive process (relatively speaking). It takes years of R&amp;D and cash on hand to fund something that is truly great. An example of this would be the move AMD made to Zen (which is based on the concept of 'chiplets'; highly-scalable many-core designs that are fundamentally different from their monolithic predecessors).\n\nIn terms of growth, I would have to say that I see two viable options here: *NVDA and MSFT*. MSFT is pretty easy to explain; they create a product that fundamentally has lower upstart costs (software development's most expensive attribute is the cost of human labor) and lower maintenance costs (I would think). There is some movement towards a more data-center driven profit scheme (which would require boots on ground hardware en masse), and Azure is certainly an AWS competitor, but I think we've yet to see them really go full throttle on that (I think it could be big if they did).\n\nNVDA is a leader from a technological perspective. GPU compute-cores are very specialized devices that are good at doing only a few things, but very, *very well.* NVDA has been hammering away at this technology for years - they know the game, and they know where the money is. Autonomous cars, drones...the computer viz recogition software for postal, for literally anything, runs on a platform that is fundamentally a GPU (very high level view here). Machine learning applications in this field at the data-center level (think machine learning on AWS) are absolutely dominated by NVDA; In fact I would go as far as to say there aren't really a lot of competitors out there that are bringing to the table what NVDA does (Honestly AMD has severely gimped even their consumer dies at this point).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can elaborate more, but I'd go with MSFT and NVDA on this one.",

        "body": "AMD. NVDA is a good runner up. AMD stands to grow the most because on top the growth in various hardware markets, which it shares with NVDA. AMD is also slowly eating Intel's market share as well. Which NVDA can't do.\n\nAAPL is being destroyed by Huawei especially in China. And the growing anti-US sentiment in China as well as China being one of the few economically opened markets through this Pandemic won't help Apple's overall sales anytime soon.\n\nMSFT is a blue chip. It's not going to grow very fast. It will likely move with the overall market.\n\nAMD will be that stock in 2025 that people will go, \"I wish I would've bought AMD back in 2017 after Lisa Su overhauled the product line.\" Like AAPL 2004, AMZN 2012, or NFLX 2013. Full diclosure, I bought a boat load of AMD at \\~$10 in 2017. I don't know if that makes me too biased to listen to or more credible about the stock but there you go.",
