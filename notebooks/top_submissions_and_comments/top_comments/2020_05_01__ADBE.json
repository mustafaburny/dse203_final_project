I\u2019m thinking it might make a solid investment, especially at the low market cap. Has your opinion changed?",

I\u2019m sure it gives decent ideas sometimes, but most of the time it means you\u2019ve missed the alpha already.  I look for trends/themes that have years of potential tailwinds ahead of them and find companies I like that are capitalizing not those trends.  Someone earlier said invest in things around you, that\u2019s good advice and how I ended up in Square years ago.  \n\nFew themes to look into:\n\nThe war against cash - PayPal, Square, V/MA all big beneficiaries of people going more and more cashless.  This will be hastened by the virus and people not wanting to touch cash which is why paypal keeps winning.\n\nE-commerce - Amazon (obviously), MELI and SE are emerging markets e-commerce plays.  SE also has a large payments section  and video games in SEA ( i like this stock a lot)\n\nTele-health and remote work - early innings of this theme - TDOC, DOCU, CATS, ADBE all solid plays that\u2019ll have years of upside ahead of them as they continue to disrupt.\n\nHope this helps, I don\u2019t like to follow momentum unless I can get ahead of it (VTIQ for example was an obvious momentum stock that people were going to bandwagon on).",

ADBE is another one that seems overvalued at first glance, but when you look at the number of shares and consider that most of our entertainment is made or rendered in Adobe and look at the CC subscriptions, their value isn\u2019t far from where it should be.  The unlimited growth is definitely a huge factor, but most of these stock pay little to no dividend, so that money is going back into the share price.",

But I still love my WSB memes.\n\n\\-  It's clearly overvalued, even a fully retarded understanding of FA will  show you that.Even after the recent drop it's valued at around 40x  REVENUES (LOL), not EARNINGS. Other tech stocks have nowhere near these  valuations. FB has a revenue multiple of around 8. Difference is FB and  other stocks actually have a decent chunk of revenue converted ( and  will continue to be converted to revenue) to EARNINGS. ZM has almost  ZERO prospects of converting even a fraction of this revenue into  earnings due to :\n\n\\- Bigger,better  competition with massive amounts of capital to invest compared to ZOOM.  Google, MSFT, FB, CISCO, ADOBE. Do you really think that if there was  that much money to be made in the videoconferencing sector ZM will even  have any significant market share a short time from now?  What kind of  earnings or margin do you see be made on this small market share, if  any? These companies have just cloned what worked for Zoom and offered  it for free through their existing interlinked platforms. Offered a  similar ( and eventually better) product for FREE, not a great  investment thesis for ZM longer term. Video conferencing is NOT a high  tech, heavily patented sector, it's essentially freeware longer term.  The software development is basic and we wouldn't even be talking about  Zoom if it wasn't for beer aids.\n\n\\-  Beer aids has peaked, at least fear of it has. People will start going  back to offices around the world soon, no long term thesis for zoom's  current price. One of the first things struggling businesses and  companies cut during downturns is non-essential IT expenses, so like I  said, even if you think a recession/possibly depression is likely (I do)  you would cut zoom use across the company and move to a free platform.\n\n\\-ZM  was clearly a meme stock bought buy poor , first time normies or mum  and dad investors that was happily dumped on them shortly after the IPO.  Fuck me, to get and idea of the average investor just remember that  ZOOM ticker mooned because investors didn't even bother to check the  right ticker for this pile of shit and bought the wrong company. ZOOM  trading was even suspended lol. Being a med-long investor on ZM is like  flying a booking a spaceflight where everyone on the vessel including  the flight crew tell you BEFOREHAND that they are mongoloids but you  still buy a ticket anyway.\n\n\\-  Security issues, zoombombing, shit load of existing tech companies  exploiting the shit out of these stuff ups as they ramp up their own  products. The power google,FB and others have using their advertising  budget and other media platforms to promote their own product shouldn't  be underestimated - just look at the propaganda that been put out by big  tech the last few days.\n\n\\- Friday  was just a tiny dead cat bounce with people taking profits and/or some  market makers covering their spreads on expiration, the drop was  anticipated but happened a bit quicker than many were expecting imo.  That's my retards opinion on the open interest and the put/call ratio  activity anyway. There where a shit load of calls on this and still are  that are now way OTM and will expiry useless over the next couple of  weeks and have already.\n\n\\-  How many more reasons do you need? This is WSB, Elon bipolar rant over.  Iv'e been short on this dumpster fire since the 7% below the top,  mostly unbalanced butterflys and backspreads and I even gone full retard  at points and just bought straight puts occasionally. They have been  printing but to be honest I feel a bit sorry for the mum and dad  investors who bought this cos they saw their kids using the app - they  are not stupid, probably smarter than me most of them- but they have  been handed this pile of shit by CNBC and analysts who work for the same  banks that made fees on the IPO and selling on the spike.",

Women like to try on makeup in store. It's one of the few retailers that won't go bust from online competition. They are also focusing on online sales. Both online and physical stores will continue to grow. ULTA is a first stop for women looking for every day makeup. \n\nATVI (Activision) - 21%. COD warzone is a huge hit. All my coworkers are talking about it. Activision Blizzard has some of the most loved titles. The video game industry is going to grow for a long time. Activision will continue to follow trends and advance with technology.\n\nDIS (Disney) - 19%. Another great brand that people love. Disney+ is a huge hit and will continue to grow at a rapid pace as more people learn about it. Disney plus can catch up to Netflix in a few years. Both Disney and Netflix have roughly the same market cap. That means for the price of Netflix you can buy Disney+ and the rest of Disney is free. Disney owns so many entertainment companies it's pretty much a monopoly. \n\nAKAM (Akamai) - 9%. The largest security company in the world. Their customers are huge corporations like Adobe,  Airbnb, AMD, Audi, best buy, Fiat, Fox, Honda, IBM, Ikea, MSI, Microsoft, NBA, NBC, us air Force, US Department of state, Ubisoft, and Verizon. As technology becomes more advanced and connected, security demand is going to grow exponentially. Currently adding more to Akamai.",

Eventually you will want to bring in your own branding, hire designers, make new landing pages, and create things custom. Wix/Squarespace making everyone fit into their code-less 'box' just makes it difficult to scale your business at a certain point.\n\n*Are there other competitors that you think are more fit to take on Shopify or do they have that big of a competitive advantage?*\nThe closest competitors/services to Shopify are WooCommerce, Magento (owned by Adobe now, I believe), BigCommerce. In terms of a competitive advantage per-se it's hard to put my finger on, all these platforms have relatively the same offerings honestly, with various trade-offs on features and ease of setup. But more often than not I'll have clients coming to me saying they want a Shopify site, and they've done their research on their own time. I think where Shopify is winning is that they have great support, they have a great tech/product team and ecosystem for developing apps/services/API's to expand and connect their platform to other services that support your business, and they have eCommerce solutions for every level of store owners (beginner/small business/medium size business/enterprise). I think Shopify has set themselves up to be the major player in the space for a long time.\n\nI think the best alternative you could research into is Magento, which was super popular until Shopify started up and gobbled up market share. They were acquired by Adobe in 2018, and I haven't kept up with how they've changed Magento since acquiring it or what plans they have for it moving forward to compete with other players in the space.",
