The price you're paying matters, and it's silly to act like it doesn't. \n\nMaybe it's enough of a challenge that for the average investor it's reasonable to triage and just buy a good company at any price.

It\u2019s a lot cheaper for people to order online rather than drive a 2-ton vehicle across the earth everytime they need to buy a carton of milk or a fleshlight.   \n\n3. Has given people a lot of their time back that they would\u2019ve had to spend running errands like grocery shopping. That extra 3-4 hours saved every week and reinvested wisely can compound into something life changing for a lot of people.   \nSpends 1 billion every year to help advance space travel via Blue Origin.   \n\n4. Has employed over 2 million people with a company-wide minimum wage of $15.  \nYeah he has 150bn net worth.

If we forced Amazon\u2019s founder to redistribute his wealth it would be enough to run the country for 2 weeks at best.

So is everyone else: HSIC\n\n\\- Business realized during covid that having sick employees at work is a terrible idea for productivity. Enter TDOC with a fix. For 10 bucks, they can see and fix the employee remotely within a hr and have a healthy employee return to work quickly.\n\nTechnology\n\n\\- Buy often from your local toy store? Me neither: AMZN, ETSY\n\n\\- Go in to the office much now? me neither.

Make much on them? Me neither. Know who made a ton? GS, JPM, MS, NDAQ\n\n\\- And since no one pays in person anymore, every institution from colleges to the local sushi spot now must accept credit cards: PAY, FLYW, SQ, PSFE\n\nMaterials\n\n\\- Using something electronic?

SO derived it\u2019s monopolistic power through acquisitions of rival refineries and distributors; purely horizontal integration, followed by outright price fixing.\n\nAmazon is absolutely massive, but the growth method and diversity of markets they participate in distinguishes them from old trust oriented monopolies. I\u2019m terms of AWS, the majority of growth was organic, and would not have ran afoul of antitrust law back in its hay day, such as when US v. Aluminum Co. of America was prevailing law.\n\nAn attempt to break up Amazon by business segment would probably fail due to the shift since the 70\u2019s from Per Se Antitrust violations to the Rule of Reason. They aren\u2019t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.\n\nOnline shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.\n\nOverall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren\u2019t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",

Facebook was in trouble for collecting data without content too. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal? But now everyone is hot for FB stocks.\n\nMicrosoft has been fined millions by the EU for monopolistic practices as well. But everyone loves Microsoft stocks nonetheless. \n\nAnd as to Ant Group, they are a massive financial service company that can offer customers credit. How come they don't get to be regulated like a bank? My point is that these actions make sense and good regulations is beneficial for investors too in the long run.",
