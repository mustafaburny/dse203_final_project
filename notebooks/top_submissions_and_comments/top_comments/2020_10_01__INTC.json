        "body": "Imagine basing this months price action on TA when everything is going to be driven by the news cycles around 2 events. I'm waiting for AMD moon this month because their 2 significant product launches are not sufficiently priced in.\n\nWhy do I say that? Look at any \"investing\" comments section on AMD and all they will talk about is how AMD is overpriced because their P/E is 160 lol or AMD is just another overvalued tech company like Tesla. Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like &gt;2X and &gt;3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that. Last weeks action was all about the 5800X AotS benchmark leaks - without knowing when future leaks are coming I don't see how we can predict any specific movements.\n\nMarch 21 95C, 100Cs",

It all pivots on TMC in Taiwan which makes it tricky.\n2. 3500 US companies are suing Trump for blocking China trade access. which implies US companies want to go to China not stay locked into US.\n3. DCEP Chinese digital currency, not mentioned but could challenge the global dollar in time.\n4. Democrats are going to be more aggressive than Trump towards China. They called him \"Uncle Donald\" at one point. friendly-ish, they likely respect his financial approach even if he is brash. I dont think US will be friendly if Dems get in, and the vibe towards China will get a lot colder and nastier. that is not good if they are losing the global cold trade war, then US will start to play dirty tricks. Hilary would have had us all in a war by now imo. psychopathic woman. maybe she is still pulling strings somewhere. I truly hope not.\n5. Propaganda machine that has been driving Anti-Chinese sentiment for months is working very well and that is a big worry as once China feel even more cornered, they will likely react more aggressively. US are the cause of this whole fiasco, not the Chinese, but we are being sold differently on that narrative because US are dirty war players. history upholds that truth.\n6. China gaining more economic power and US losing it globally would totally change the face of world economy and markets fundamentally to the point it is almost impossible to imagine what that future would look like and one big question - how far would US Government be willing to go to stop that happening? that is scary because historically US Govmt have no limits that they have not been willing to go to before, including killing their own in extremely large numbers.\n\nAnyway, how all that effects trade, we will only really know after the election.

No. Apple is still going to keep selling phones and so on. Just hold. \n\nAlso we have a vice presidential debate coming up so keep an eye on Mike Pence.\n\nIf Trumps condition becomes severe, -1.5%.

This guys cannot handle tough questions from his shareholders and her is terrible for investor confidence when they grill him (and they do).   \n   \nRead this ass wipe.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there's higher demand or because you're trying to offset the seven-nanometer delay? **Because it's hitting the margins big time, which doesn't really tie in my head to, like, yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So how do I think about the drivers of that seven-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven -- or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven-nanometer delay given what it's doing to the margins?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yeah. Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year 'cause it's clearly -- it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And we're -- part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and, I would say, on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we had forecasted for the year. So it's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that, again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer products.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**But wait a minute. If I look at your annual guidance now versus where it was in the beginning of the year, it's higher, but it's actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied in -- when you first gave the annual guidance six months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were now given you've actually lowered the second half?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue, Stacy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Well, I think I'll start with our full-year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. So that's --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Yeah. But you're just making it sound like where you can typically get to, is there --**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let me just finish, Stacy. I think it's a good question, but maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sorry.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Full-year demand for the company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer we've kind of set are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first six months, and we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, that the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And as we accelerate 10 faster, because customers are banding it more, the implications are that our margins, all else equal, will be lower. George kind of highlighted those were the primary drivers of the one-point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster, and our 5G comms business and the data center group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think, is a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If it's more of our growth than we had anticipated, all else equal, margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume, all else equal, will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year.

        "body": "Imagine basing this months price action on TA when everything is going to be driven by the news cycles around 2 events. I'm waiting for AMD moon this month because their 2 significant product launches are not sufficiently priced in.\n\nWhy do I say that? Look at any \"investing\" comments section on AMD and all they will talk about is how AMD is overpriced because their P/E is 160 lol or AMD is just another overvalued tech company like Tesla. Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like &gt;2X and &gt;3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that. Last weeks action was all about the 5800X AotS benchmark leaks - without knowing when future leaks are coming I don't see how we can predict any specific movements.\n\nMarch 21 95C, 100Cs",

You sound almost as full of shit as Bob Swan himself.\n\nThey are currently 4-5 years behind in their core business and not competitive in their other segments. They have a ton of cash and they will keep using it to try and spend themselves out of this mess while they suffer delay after delay. By the time they even have EUV basics figured out TSMC will likely be producing 3nm chips.\n\nWhat does this mean? Dramatically lower power consumption (\\~ 25%) especially in the mobile sector.

It all pivots on TMC in Taiwan which makes it tricky.\n2. 3500 US companies are suing Trump for blocking China trade access. which implies US companies want to go to China not stay locked into US.\n3. DCEP Chinese digital currency, not mentioned but could challenge the global dollar in time.\n4. Democrats are going to be more aggressive than Trump towards China. They called him \"Uncle Donald\" at one point. friendly-ish, they likely respect his financial approach even if he is brash. I dont think US will be friendly if Dems get in, and the vibe towards China will get a lot colder and nastier. that is not good if they are losing the global cold trade war, then US will start to play dirty tricks. Hilary would have had us all in a war by now imo. psychopathic woman. maybe she is still pulling strings somewhere. I truly hope not.\n5. Propaganda machine that has been driving Anti-Chinese sentiment for months is working very well and that is a big worry as once China feel even more cornered, they will likely react more aggressively. US are the cause of this whole fiasco, not the Chinese, but we are being sold differently on that narrative because US are dirty war players. history upholds that truth.\n6. China gaining more economic power and US losing it globally would totally change the face of world economy and markets fundamentally to the point it is almost impossible to imagine what that future would look like and one big question - how far would US Government be willing to go to stop that happening? that is scary because historically US Govmt have no limits that they have not been willing to go to before, including killing their own in extremely large numbers.\n\nAnyway, how all that effects trade, we will only really know after the election. I was hoping other peeps might share their wisdom/thoughts here which was my reason for posting.",

This guys cannot handle tough questions from his shareholders and her is terrible for investor confidence when they grill him (and they do).   \n   \nRead this ass wipe.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there's higher demand or because you're trying to offset the seven-nanometer delay? **Because it's hitting the margins big time, which doesn't really tie in my head to, like, yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So how do I think about the drivers of that seven-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven -- or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the seven-nanometer delay given what it's doing to the margins?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yeah. Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year 'cause it's clearly -- it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And we're -- part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and, I would say, on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we had forecasted for the year. So it's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that, again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer products.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**But wait a minute. If I look at your annual guidance now versus where it was in the beginning of the year, it's higher, but it's actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied in -- when you first gave the annual guidance six months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were now given you've actually lowered the second half?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**George Davis** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue, Stacy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Well, I think I'll start with our full-year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. So that's --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Yeah. But you're just making it sound like where you can typically get to, is there --**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Let me just finish, Stacy. I think it's a good question, but maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So --  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Stacy Rasgon** \\-- *Bernstein Research -- Analyst*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sorry.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bob Swan** \\-- *Chief Executive Officer*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Full-year demand for the company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer we've kind of set are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first six months, and we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, that the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And as we accelerate 10 faster, because customers are banding it more, the implications are that our margins, all else equal, will be lower. George kind of highlighted those were the primary drivers of the one-point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster, and our 5G comms business and the data center group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think, is a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If it's more of our growth than we had anticipated, all else equal, margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume, all else equal, will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year. Thank you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Operator**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/23/intel-intc-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/23/intel-intc-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx)\n\nI bolded her questions.

Which is true and it is how branding works, by enforcing what your company beliefs are, but having a look at the company as a whole, they are moving towards being self sufficient such as with their A series microprocessors, the rumored ARM MacBook (which would make them not need Intel and seeing as their contract expires this year, it makes sense to promote their pro-green actions).\n\nThis would make it so that Apple will eventually control the entire process of manufacturing, from buying the minerals from Miners to giving the product in the hands of the customer, which is cheaper than buying components through other companies such as the Intel CPUs for the current MacBooks. \n\nNow for the statement, it looks like you think that the recycling company was hired for the pure sense of recycling, and you\u2019re right, they were: but if Apple was truly sticking by their chance of being pro-green, wouldn\u2019t you think that Apple shouldn\u2019t have an issue with them reselling phones the phones that Apple provides them. The recycling company wouldn\u2019t have phone repairers (because it would be unwise to set a specialized department for one specific client), hence its more than likely for the devices to be sold to people who would like Apple devices but can\u2019t afford new ones, or phone repairers that believe that the devices have a longer lifetime. \n\nIn short, it sounds like you believe that since the company has been hired to recycle, they should only do that, which is completely fair, but if you had the opportunity to support your business further and not break the ideals of your client (being pro-green as reselling actually does reduce pollution by a minuscule amount), wouldn\u2019t you opt for that offer?",

        "body": "I think NVDA and AMD are fairly valued compared to each other, but incredibly overvalued compared to Intel. NVDA/AMD are likely also fairly or undervalued compared to the broader markets - which are grossly overvalued.\n\nFor AMD - they will soon be revenue constrained based on TSMC capacity. ATM, it looks like they're selling everything they produce. As more and more of their sales mix shifts to TSMC fabs, they will become more constrained. Even with the better products, they will only ever be able to grow revenue by a predictable amount. They're consistent, but with this constraint in place, I don't know how you can justify their current valuation.\n\nNVDA - I think they are currently worth more than INTC, while INTC makes twice the operating income that NVDA makes in total revenue. Not only this, but INTC is actually still growing revenue. \n\nThe whole TAM is expanding, such that even though NVDA and AMD have comparable or superior products, INTC is actually still growing at a respectable pace and generating considerably more revenue and profit. Part of this comes down to the fact that INTC is less supply constrained - huge fab space. Part of this is that even though AMD products are generally superior, they aren't superior for the average consumer - i.e. people buying laptops for general work, people buying desktops for general work. INTC wins in gaming, but AMD works in productivity (parallel workloads), but has a worse software stack.\n\nNVDA is growing in the server space, but not unperturbed. Competition is growing faster than NVDA is improving, and this space will be under attack in the coming half-decade. On the gaming front, NVDA is seeing it's gap close against AMD, but NVDA still has a far superior software stack. INTC is entering the GPU space in both server and consumer segments. This will still take them time, but in this time, they'll likely also remedy a lot of their FAB issues.\n\nOverall, I think AMD and NVDA have more downside than upside risk atm. They're both very vulnerable to competition, fighting for fab space and very vulnerable to any trade issues (fabs are overseas).\n\nJust my own thoughts, though.",

The real question of their growth comes from their Foundry platform which caters toward the commercial sector. The investor day video mentioned that they are slowly decreasing the time it takes to integrate their software into a new company. This is promising because it's been said that each new application of the software into a new company is somewhat a new build in itself.\n\nI think that those who've actually worked with the software have the most credibility since they can speak to its effectiveness. I've never worked with the software, but I like the idea of being able to run a business around it. I don't think it'll ever be as ubiquitous as Microsoft Office since the price and effort to start is pretty damn high.\n\nTheir real obstacle is trying to get more companies to hop onboard. With the controversy behind the history of the company, that remains to be seen. Since Palantir is the subject of frequent controversy, the \"bad\" press could serve as catalysts for the stock. I could give a fuck what the software is used for, I just see that it works and has potential to grow.\n\nIMO, I don't think either bear or bull can predict this one.

This matters because Microsoft needs to win consumers over this November. The last generation of Xbox had poor quality exclusive games which led to Sony acquiring the lion's share of consumers for their PS4 due to their strong exclusive games. This will roll over onto the next generation this fall with Sony showing strong exclusives and backwards compatibility.

The hardware is a stopgap to that goal, a showcase product meant to standardize development and rally other OEMs (like Surface), and to a lesser extent a bet hedge. They barely even need to sell consoles going forward except to maintain a customer base in the short term and court developers while they acquire more IP and let internet infrastructure improve a little. The real product is x-cloud and an eventual combining of the Xbox and Windows game libraries, completely platform-agnostic for a monthly fee. This supposed squabble over console exclusives is Sony's game, and they're going to keep playing it like they always have until Microsoft eats their lunch and dinner.\n\nThat's my take anyway.",

So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted.

With portfolio margin u can mitigate risk a lot better, as you essentially have a lot more buying power, but this requires over $125k in ur account. TSLA had an incredible up move earlier this year, but only if u stubbornly held ur naked call at least 3 days without mitigating risk steadily would u have taken a massive loss. \n\nI mainly sell premium whenever IV gets absurdly high and i sell around 20-35% chance ITM. 1st day it moves against me I let it ride, and 2nd day if I don't see good movement the way i want, and it is continuing against me, i'll roll if it's close to expiration and trend seems weak, or will take a strict loss otherwise. Winner are 100% profit max, and I generally go for 50-90% profit, so ideally you want to cut losers at no more than 50-90% loss. Maybe 5% of the time you get a 500% loser overnight on news and it's usually best to take the loss sooner than later. Go for a quick dead cat bounce / 9 EMA retrace or sell immediately.\n\nMy best bought calls are far OTM long term 3-15 month calls on steady upward momentum tech stocks I strongly believe in. I think most people need to learn this side first before selling naked calls. \n\nMy best naked call sales are in the 1-6 week period on meme stonks where IV has reached such a high level that buying an ATM call now costs 4-10x what it did recently. I sold calls and bought put spreads on TSLA 3 times this year, when it first hit $950, $1550, and $500 post split. All three I recognized the IV was relatively high, hourly upward momentum was cooling off, there was an overnight gap up to fill, 1000/1500/500 are nice round numbers to take profits at, and price level felt very unstable. \n\nI'm selling calls and have puts on ZM and SNOW right now, both are extremely overvalued at 100x revenue and I would definitely be taking profits at these levels.",

People who have spent years on here in this ridiculous quest to find \"THE NEXT BIG SHORT\" (because the movie made people apparently think it was easy peasy) rather than look for what to invest in. Rather than useful, productive discussions to generate ideas on what to invest in, there have been tons of \"ARE STUDENT LOANS THE NEXT BIG SHORT?\" No. \"HOW ABOUT....?\"  and incessant, low/no effort attempts at top calling over the years.\n\n\". Or maybe it\u2019s not actually a bubble and thats just a buzzphrase that\u2019s meant to scare people?\"\n\nIt's become over-used in this sub to the point of absurdity. This sub is basically a circle of bearishness - certain at the bottom (December 2018, March) that the market is going \"much lower\", upset at the market at the start of the rebound (April and May of this year) and now the bubble discussions again.\n\n\"I just don\u2019t see how we can have such an awareness of the tech bubble\"\n\nTech can get ahead of itself. It has multiple times in the last few years (I think has again, although this crisis has IMO resulted in people being more reliant upon tech and I think a lot of that reliance sticks after this crisis eventually ends) and there have been significant rotations at times out of tech. If one took these rotations as confirmation of their bias that \"SEE? ITS A BUBBLE!\" they missed out on what were buying opportunities.\n\nAlso I don't know that there's this massive awareness aside from this sub where people are often looking for any excuse to be bearish.",

And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted.

There is a reason they have already been able to enforce the patents against random Chinese companies.\n\nDon't believe me? Lets look at what happened when Google Waymo, one of the largest companies in the world, tried to sue Uber for LIDAR patent infringement:\n\n[https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html](https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) **rejected 53 out of 56 claims in Waymo's 936 patent**...One of the reasons for the rejection is that some of the core design solutions were **previously patented by another lidar manufacturer, Velodyne**. Coincidentally, Velodyne used to sell its lidars to Waymo before the latter decided to build a product of its own from scratch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Theoretically, **Velodyne could now accuse Waymo of infringing its own 558 patent**, based on the USPTO's recent ruling.",
