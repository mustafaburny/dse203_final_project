With current R&amp;D and CapEx requirement it will be impossible for new players to enter the market (Except for China entering the NAND market next year, danger alert).\n\nThere's now only 6 companies selling NAND (Samsung,Hynix,Micron,Intel,WDC,Kioxia(Toshiba) and 3 companies selling DRAM (Samsung, Hynix, Micron). This used to be different in the past with 10+ companies having large market shares in both NAND and DRAM. Many companies have gone bankrupt or have been taken over by bigger players. See: Micron buying Elpida in 2013.\n\nIf these companies 'become smarter' and limit supply so that it doesn't exceed demand and hurts pricing, profitability in the memory business could improve greatly. \n\nEspecially in the DRAM business this seems likely as there's only 3 players instead of 6. China is aiming to enter the NAND market with their own products next year, but they are failing to get proper DRAM manufacturing started at all. Hightech DRAM is generally more difficult to produce than NAND.\n\nIn mid 2021 there will be a transition to DDR5 memory for server/cloud chips which will be a major tailwind for DRAM starting from ~mid 2021.",

I still have that HDD, it's a 640GB Western Digital. Probably worth less than $10 now.

        "body": "Certainly! u/internet_DOOD, I do what facelessarya1 said. :) I don't like to read a lot of news myself, so u/facelessarya1's method is on point for me.\n\nThere's a guy on YouTube named [Andrei Jikh](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGy7SkBjcIAgTiwkXEtPnYg), and he's quite a treasure trove of information for dividend growth investing (DGI). Worth checking out.\n\nI mainly use the morningstar 5 star rating system with [simplysafedividends.com](https://simplysafedividends.com) to pick the stocks I want to buy. I also have a spreadsheet that I keep track of everything, and this helps guide my decisions.\n\nMy goals for my DGI portfolio are 1) transition myself from being a consumer to an owner-consumer, and 2) one day have this portfolio's dividends cover my living expenses. I keep all this in a taxable account, as this is my F.I.R.E. fund. My retirement accounts will be used for my ailing health at 65+, but I plan on quitting the workforce before then.\n\n**Goal #1**:\n\nI started by buying 1 share of the company I work for. I have been working retail for 15 years, and some days it can be rough. By owning just 1 share, I mentally feel more empowered. My boss is being a jerk? Not a problem as that day they are working for me.\n\nThen I bought 1 share of companies I really like that pay dividends. Apple, Ford, Western Digital, etc. I like these companies as a consumer and I use their products.\n\nThen I started buying 1 share of companies that I use. Campbell's, Hormel Foods, Kellogg's, Coca-Cola, etc. This was the most fun part of my journey. I'd buy some food, and quickly check to see who makes it. I'd go home and buy 1 stock and feel empowered. :)\n\nOwning 1 share has made a difference for me. I ate at Olive Garden the other day, and I find a greater satisfaction knowing I own at least 1 share. I may never get to drive a Ferrari, but I've got 1 share and that feels nice too!\n\n**Goal #2**:\n\nWith DGI, the idea is to invest into quality companies that will continue to pay increasing amounts of dividends each year. I'd like for the dividend growth rate to be higher than the inflation rate (generally 2-3%) so that my purchasing power remains the same or even increases every year. I try to buy companies that pay 3.65% or more, and are safe companies. There are stocks that pay 8% dividends, but if it's not sustainable then it's a no-go for me. I learn about how sustainable dividends are from simplysafedividends.com. I picked 3.65% because for every $10,000 invested, I get $1 per day. My goal is $100 per day, so I'll need $1 million invested at 3.65%.\n\n**How I Buy Stocks**:\n\nI have gotten to where I have 121 different companies, and I'd like to learn more about how to pick stocks. I take 3 pieces of data and find a company that fits.\n\n*Data 1*: In my spreadsheet, I have a pie chart that shows me how much I've allocated to each sector. I like to put between 5-20% into each sector. Just arbitrary numbers I picked for myself. I'll keep this pie chart in my mind.\n\n*Data 2*: I'll google \"factset earnings insight\" and find the latest pdf. I look for the \"Sector-Level Forward 12-Month P/E Ratios\" and keep a mental note of the 3 sectors that are the closest to their long-term P/E average.\n\nTo learn more about this, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMfvalBaZGI) is the video I learned from.\n\n*Data 3*: I'll go to [simplysafedividends.com](https://simplysafedividends.com) and see which companies are safe and paying 3.65%+ in dividends. From these 3 pieces of information, I can find a company to buy more of. Sometimes I'll buy a company paying less than 3.65%, but it has to be a really good company. Like Apple, Johnson and Johnson's, Wal-Mart, etc.\n\nI like to own non-dividend paying companies too, but I'll keep it to a maximum of 5% of my portfolio. This serves as added impetus for me to invest, as if I want to buy 1 share of Amazon @ $3,000, I'll need $60,000+ invested. In reality, by the time I get to $60,000, Amazon may be a lot more and I'll have other non-dividend companies occupying some of that 5% space. Still fun to try!",
