        "body": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

As long as peers ($TYL, $AXON, $MAGT.TO) do well as a group, I don't have issues with continuing to accumulate $CLBT.   \n  \nI think the biggest challenge here is that there's not enough public float for any institution to open a position in size; PIPE isn't selling, SUN isn't selling, IGP isn't selling, cost to borrow has been consistently high since merger close, etc... And there's no public support since it's not an exciting stock. All to these combined result in repeated red days with really low volume. We will have to play the patient game.  \n  \nIn the meantime, I've diverted my attention over to Gogoro and Playboy. lol",

You can get even lower collateral requirements if you go a little OTM on both the put and call, e.g. short 430 put and long 485 call, with collateral of just over $10k.

I\u2019m about 90 different positions, I realize I have too many small positions. My large positions have done very well though. NVDA, AVGO, TER, TTD, MA, BRKB, C, BAC, SHOP, TSLA, ZBRA, GOOG, AAPL are my large blue chip holdings.\n\nEdit : I realize I\u2019ve lucked out with timing and won\u2019t get 30% a year every year but I\u2019m thankful for the portfolio I\u2019ve managed to put together and believe it could outperform long term or get dumpster fucked who knows.",
