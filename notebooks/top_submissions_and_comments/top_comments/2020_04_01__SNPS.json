Does someone come to your home to repossess the hardware?\n\nDropbox - meh - how is this any different than icloud... oh, that's right, it works across both platforms\n\n- Gilead - good for now - They'd better have some sort of moated COVID-19 solution\n\n- Rapid7 - meh - does staying at home mean everyone becomes a hacker?\n\nSplunk -  probably fine - I mean, this stuff has been around for years and is already part of most CI/CD/DS environments\n\nPayPal - meh - The fintech space is going to heat up as people start P2P garange selling every god damned piece of shit thing they own to make rent/mortgage and PayPal ain't it.\n\nApple - probably not a good choice - supply chain issue / not generating a continuous stream of content for users to consume what they're locked down\n\nSynopsys - meh - Do you think there's going to suddently be a bust of electronic development?  During the Q4 2018 draw down, they were below $90/share.\n\nMicron - meh - I'm sure they'll get to $90/share one of these years; Q4 2018 saw them at $30/share\n\nMicrosoft - meh - seemingly impervious... probably due to all those Office 365 subscriptions they've been selling for the last month; we'll see how long those subscriptions last when everyone get back on their Office exchange server.\n\nWestern Union - No. - Why send money home when you can actually go home since your restaurant job doesn't exist any more.\n\nStarbucks - No. - Anyone care to compare Luckin's fraud with the number of Starbuck store closures?\n\nFacebook - Yes. - I don't use facebook, but I can just imagine what a cesspool it will become when the only thing people can do to vent their frustration is use facebook.\n\nIntuitive Surgical - No. - I'll never let a robot anywhere near my insides after watching the Netflix documentary The Bleeding Edge.",

Those are the names to *not* bet against. \n\nNow go find the buyback kings (looking at you TXN) and buy puts on them all the way down. Anyone who used massive buybacks to paper over their huge executive comp? Puts. Anyone who borrowed (with their borderline bullshit BBB rating) to do their buybacks? Puts. Anyone who kept their BBB rating for years, despite having enough cash flow to pay down debt and get a better rating? Puts. \n\nThe BBB thing is a longer story and none of you will read it anyway, but it\u2019s a big deal that we\u2019ll start noticing in the coming months.",
