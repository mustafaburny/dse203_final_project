I bought ARKK  last year in june @ $56 and  sold half my shares in dec for @$133 for 18% return on the total investment.  I made back my initial investment and then some.  I sold more in jan for $140. I kept 25% of the original shares. Just bought some more at $98 last week.   I am holding long term the original 25% since I have already made my investment back. The recent stock I bought I will sell at least half when the stock is over $145 and hold the rest, selling when it has spikes, but for the most part I will hold it. Doing this allows me to look at this stock as purely a cash vehicle selling at whatever price for a gain. I dont have to time the market after i have my initial investment back I do this with all my stocks, except the dividend plays.   I do this alot FB, TSLA, SQ, NVDA, and  Adobe, been setting up SNAP with this strategy.  I constantly do this recoup and reinvest. Use mostly Roth it saves on taxes.  I try to hold 25% of my portfolio in well researched speculative growth stocks for long term. I bought tesla in 2016 at $41 made back my initial investment.  Bought more for $42 in 2017 made back my initial investment and  little while holding the majority of shares that i bought. January sold at $800+ for pure profit.",

It's only a stock and it's just business. Hell the stock I've held the longest in my portfolio is coming up on maybe 3 years? I've never held a stock anything close to 20 years so I have no clue what a company would have to do for me to stay around for holding it for 20 years. Now there's some industries that lend themselves to longevity in terms of investments. Banks, for example, tend to be very long term investments. I plan on holding $BAC for as long as humanly possible and I'm open to finding other banks to hold onto as they come along. Why? Because the median age for banks in the U.S. is 100 years old. A century. That's a lot of time to compound investment gains (this is assuming a perfect world and nothing goes wrong and everything compounds neatly and perfectly for the entire time you're holding the stock). What's the median age for a tech firm? No clue but it isn't 100. Don't focus too much time on what tech names can last that long. We're seeing the lucky few. Hold for as long as your reasons for why you bought are in place. The moment they leave. Sell. Nothing personal, strictly business.",

Has the most untapped revenue verticals (video, AR/VR, payments, Angie's List type of service referrals, hardware (Portal/Oculus), dating, WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nAdobe - a \"baby FAANG\" that has more room to run, market cap-wise, than FAANG. \n\nSalesforce - same reason as Adobe above, baby FAANG. \n\nIntuit - under the radar, category killer with tax and accounting software \n\nPinterest - scarce social media property that is adding e-commerce functionality with Shopify. \n\nWISH - WISH's global eCommerce marketplace has an affordable/entertaining mobile shopping experience. Its focus on value conscious consumers, unique array of unbranded product selection from global merchants, and data science driven approach is very sophisticated. In terms of upside, there is potential in local delivery/fulfillment, branded inventory efforts &amp; a subscription revenue stream. The Company is projecting positive EBIT in 2022. A modest 4x P/S multiple at that time should result in a doubling of the stock price from current levels.\n\nCronos (CRON) - big tobacco's Altria (MO), the largest tobacco company in USA, backs this company with 45% ownership and will likely plug and play its products like a light switch upon federal legalization into its huge point of service network of over 250,000 locations (i.e. convenience stores, etc) is the cannabis company that will likely be the ultimate winner. They are avoiding expensive growing methods by using a creative approach announcing that they will be introducing synthetic cannabinoids for the Canadian market for a 10 cents a gram:\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cronos-to-sell-lab-grown-pot-products-in-canada-this-year-ceo-1.1556188\n\nAside from Cronos, I think the ancillary cannabis companies are the way to play weed stocks because they don't contain cannabis and hence allow listing on the most liquid exchanges such as Nasdaq and institutional money can pour into these cannabis related names now/today as opposed to being shut out of other companies that contain cannabis because institutional money usually has mandates to not allow investing in something that is Federally illegal:\n\nHydrofarm (HYFM) - IPOed in Dec and a leading hydroponics manufacturer and distributor\n\nGrowGeneration (GRWG) - leading hydroponics retailer\n\nWeedmaps (SSPK) - unique, direct to consumer (DTC), cannabis play on the intersection of tech and cannabis. A type of Uber, Amazon, Yelp and Shopify all rolled into one for cannabis products. A SPAC that will turn into WeedMaps during sometime in the 1st half of this year. This one is special. \n\nTim Seymour's cannabis ETF (CNBS) owns a big position in WeedMaps and smaller positions in GrowGeneration and Hydrofarm:\n\nhttps://www.amplifyetfs.com/cnbs-holdings.html\n\nTwitter (TWTR) - is a unique social media equity that has achieved critical mass. It may have kinks in it in its current state, and yes, I think Dorsey being so egotistical to think he can be a co-CEO of both Square and Twitter is disgusting (as is his beard), but there is a user base there. It might shock people that the political user base only comprises a low teens % component of their total user base with the rest being news, sports and entertainment. Twitter has made some acquisitions recently of Squad and Breaker that really puts them into interesting territory of peer to peer browsing, audio and podcasting - things people should not overlook. \n\nCoinbase (COIN) - is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is gonna be huge because this is the first time we are going to be able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value.",

Some are great, some aren\u2019t.",

It's very sticky, is transitioning to a cloud-first subscription model and will soon have reliable constant streams of revenue, and is rated 4 stars by Morningstar.
