        "body": "I'm going to disagree here and say that VTI is actually a lot better than VOO, and also that any total market fund is better than the S&amp;P500. A couple of important reasons: factor investing and front running. TLDR, but VTI, buy more VXF, get rid of VOO.\n\nFirst, factor investing, Small caps over time perform better than large caps because of their higher risk premium and the company's size and maturity. Since VTI has small cap exposure, there is should be slightly higher risk, but also higher returns. In recent years, the performance of VOO has outpaced VTI because small caps have actually underperformed due to the rise of large cap tech, but this is not the case historically or from a risk premium standpoint. You can see this if you include periods of small cap outperformance for example between 2003 and 2007. If you include this period, SPY went up 391% and VTI went up 449%, excluding dividends.\n\nSecond, front running. Some people might not know that the S&amp;P500 does not actually hold the 500 largest companies in the US. VTI and total market indices actually hold many companies that have larger market cap than many of the s&amp;P500 companies. For example Square (SQ), a favorite around here, has a market cap of 112 billion, or around the market cap of Intuit (INTU), the 76th largest companies in the S&amp;P500. The reason for this is that the S&amp;P500 index itself is not exactly passive but have requirements of market cap, longevity, profitability and quality as well. Why is this important? because since the index changes continuously, you would know when a company will be included or excluded. Since so much money is invested in the S&amp;P500, you would also know that when some company has been included, there would be a ton of forced buying from those passive index funds. And if you know that there will be a lot of buying of the stock on a certain date, investors can and will front run this buying by increasing the stock price and pulling out after the passive indexers have been forced to buy in. The perfect example here is Tesla. It was not in the S&amp;P500 despite having a huge market cap because of profitability concerns. When it was announced that Tesla would be included, the price shot up quickly in January, leading passive index investors to not only miss out on this performance but overpay when front runners have finished buying. You can see this in VXF, which holds stocks that are NOT in the S&amp;P500, so Tesla was in VXF but not anymore, and SQ is in VXF. During the same period from 2003, VXF went up 660%, excluding dividends, way better than both VTI and VOO, due to both size factor and lack of front running drag.",

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

TSM, Samsung and INTC have near-term headwinds in terms of earnings based on semiconductor demand simply because it takes so long to expand capacity. The front-end winners in current semi production efforts are going to be those who supply the tools, products and services that go into these fabs that are planned for construction: AMAT, ASML, TER, LRCX, to name a few. Secondary effects on earnings from this will come 1-2-3 years down the line for the semi manufacturers themselves, depending on whether or not they are expanding/upgrading an existing facility, or building one from the ground up.\n\nThe end-users of these semiconductor products (GM, F, NVDA, AMD, etc.) will be the last ones to benefit from expanded chipmaking capacity, as easing the demand crunch allows them to resume normal sales levels. Note that for auto mfrs, this has a ripple effect on rental car companies, who sold all of their fleets in fire sales last year and now can't replace them because the auto mfrs can't make cars.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is booked up for the foreseeable future; these bookings have prices agreed well in advance, and are almost certainly not subject to TSMC's recent statements that they plan to increase prices; that will happen with new bookings down the line.",

        "body": "Your analysis is probably true for delta, but the problem with playing those names using vol is that the IV is higher. Options trading is most useful when you get the gamma cheap while also calling the direction right.\n\nI'm buying INTC 23Apr 70c because resistance at 65 has kept IV muted. My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr. I hate talking in terms of resistance in general, but looking at the long-term chart as well as price action in the morning after the Intel Unleashed event, it certainly seems like you'd need a big catalyst to justify a breakout beyond 65. I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",

        "body": " TL:DR - looking for feedback on a simple hi return stock screen and thoughts on how to rank results.\n\nEarly 60's, simple, diversified, buy and hold retirement portfolio approach my whole life. Looking at working probably another 5-10 years and starting to get a lot more active in my portfolio. Nothing crazy and I'm fundamentally a conservative+ investor, but I do not subscribe to moving 100% into ultra safe right before retirement. Portfolio size is low 7 figure for reference.\n\nOver the past few months I subscribed to a couple of authors on Seeking Alpha and have tried out a few strategies with minimal exposure and have a good idea of how to use some of the approaches in my portfolio. I want to develop my own screens because at least on Seeking Alpha, the authors I've found charge a small monthly fee for their updates. It's nothing huge, and for me at least has been worth seeing their approaches, but nothing I want to pay for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm going to put together a dividend screen/strategy and a \"better than cash\" parking lot strategy. Pretty basic and straightforward. I also just got started on putting together a screen to identify a more hi growth strategy - thought being on a monthly basis invest in the top 4 stocks that fall out of the screen. Would love some feedback on the screen (I'm stock knowledgeable, but certainly not an expert). When looking at the screen and giving feedback keep in mind my objective: not looking for the perfect approach or for mega returns, I'm an 80/20 kinda guy so looking for a decent, simple to execute strategy to reliably give back a growth-class return. (And using the Fidelity screener as that's where my portfolio is).\n\nScreen as it stand currently:\n\n* Tagging Energy, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Industrials sectors\n* Market cap down to Medium (as defined by Fidelity: 6-33B)\n* 13 week price performance down to 13%\n* 3 yr annualized Beta of 1.1 and up (conflicted on whether this really helps the screen)\n* Very Bullish or Bullish analyst recommendations (Summary score from StarMine)\n* Forward EPS 3-5 yrs high to very high (16.5% and up)\n* EPS growth Projected year versus last year high to very high (40% and up)\n\nAs an example, running that screen today resulted in a list of 7 stocks (sorry not allowed to link image or would give you a shot of the fundamentals):\n\n1. AMAT - Applied materials\n2. FANG - Diamondback Energy\n3. EOG - EOG Resources\n4. NXPI - NXP SemiConductor\n5. KKR - KKR &amp; Co\n6. LRCX - LAM Research Corp\n7. MU - Micron Technology\n\nSo the thought would be to run this first day of every month and put a set amount in the top 4 stocks in the filter. I would guess some stocks might stay in for months, some might rotate in and out quickly.\n\nMy question is basically around how to rank. So do I just pick a screening metric (or some other metric) and do a simple rank on that metric to determine top 4, or do I create a formula to weight and aggregate multiple metrics into an overall score and rank on that?\n\nSorry for the long post - thank you to those who stuck with it and are willing to share your thoughts.",

That's why I left a few disclaimers saying to take this all with a grain of salt.

Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes.

I got a little over 500%. Too bad I'm too pussy to put more than a few hundred in any one option. My logic was wrong though. Micron didn't announce any new capex. \n\nBut the infrastructure bill has 50bn for semi conductors and tsmc came out and said their spending 100bn on semi manufacturing.\n\nEverything is green though so we all make money last few days I hope.\n\nGood luck and happy Easter brother.",

        "body": "Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&amp;P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat. That\u2019s as of 0630.\n\nThis follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&amp;P\u2019s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?\n\nCouple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&amp;A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden\u2019s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.\n\nNot much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.\n\nThat\u2019s all I got. Don\u2019t fall for any April Fool\u2019s jokes. You\u2019ve been warned (Voltswagen, er Volkswagen did a good job of preparing you for that as well).",
