        "body": "Everyone who is commenting on this company needs to search two things.\n\n\"In-Q-Tel\" + \"Palantir.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel\n\n&gt;Originally named Peleus and known as In-Q-It, In-Q-Tel was founded by Norm Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed Martin. Michael Crow served as In-Q-Tel's first CEO. In-Q-Tel's mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests. Origins of the corporation can be traced to Ruth A. David, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science &amp; Technology in the 1990s and promoted the importance of rapidly advancing information technology for the CIA. In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community. In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences.\n\n&gt;Former CIA director George Tenet says,\n\n&gt;&gt;We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ... In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ... enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger, and to adapt the technology that online booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results.\n\nA few hits:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jk3mhd/palantir/\n\n&gt;This patriotism is almost the fundamental idea of Palantir. The company's filed to go public says it \"does not work with clients or governments whose positions or actions are incompatible with the mission to support Western liberal democracy and its strategic allies.\" The fact that the main clients of Palantir are precisely the US security forces and intelligence services fully reflects the company's commitment to this mission.\n\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/aoc-calls-for-investigation-on-palantir-before-surveillance-company-goes-public/\n\n&gt;\"Palantir's numerous transparency and governance issues have been flying completely under the radar as they launch their public offering,\" Jacinta Gonzalez, a senior campaign organizer at Mijente, said in a statement. \"We're glad Representatives Ocasio-Cortez and Garcia tasked the SEC with investigating and are eager to find out why the agency has not done so.\"\n\nhttps://www.forbesindia.com/article/100-most-innovative-companies/how-a-deviant-philosopher-built-palantir-a-ciafunded-data-miner/36101/1\n\n&gt;The bottom line: A CIA-funded firm run by an eccentric philosopher has become one of the most valuable private companies in tech, priced at between $5 billion and $8 billion in a round of funding the company is currently pursuing. Karp owns roughly a tenth of the firm\u2014just less than its largest stakeholder, Peter Thiel, the PayPal and Facebook billionaire. (Other billionaire investors include Ken Langone and hedge fund titan Stanley Druckenmiller.) That puts Karp on course to become Silicon Valley\u2019s latest billionaire\u2014and Thiel could double his fortune\u2014if the company goes public, a possibility Karp says Palantir is reluctantly considering.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2020/10/01/2-reasons-you-should-avoid-palantir-stock/?sh=1b90fae7485a\n\n&gt;For example, Ocasio-Cortez is concerned that in 2009, Palantir\u2019s shareholder report revealed that the CIA\u2019s venture arm \u2014 In-Q-Tel \u2014 held 10% of Palantir. However, she noted, its S-1 \u201cdid not say whether that investment was still in play or how many Palantir shares In-Q-Tel held.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.iqt.org/\n\nHere is the In-Q-Tel website. Palantir is under Analytics in their Portfolio section. There is honestly not much on the site, as you might expect.\n\nLong PLTR.",
