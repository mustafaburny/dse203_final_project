It would have taken 5-7 days (according to another DD) for the shares to be sellable. \n\nSoros promised to divest their 18.5M shares (as of Jan) on principle. Those should be hitting the market by now. \n\nThe tech selloff has also contributed to keeping PLTR depressed. Cathie, however, has been gobbling up the shares at every dip. \n\nFinally, unless you are an insider and know more than the rest of us, Palantir's software claims are pretty standard for enterprise software. Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Siemens, etc., make those claims regularly. I don't think Palantir is special but they do have momentum and high profile clients. \n\nOverall I think PLTR is getting ready to take off, but they might find some resistance along the way. I'm in.",

        "body": "I have experience in setting up Snowflake in a Fortune 100 company. And I have also worked on Google Bigquery, AWS Redshift, and Azure DWH in the past. Here are my thoughts on its potentials.\n\n1. Snowflake is a way better product than Bigquery, Redshift, or Azure DWH. It automatically handles all legal database SQL syntax(Oracle, SQL Server, etc.). So data migration from the legacy database is less complex with a minimum learning curve. This is true not just for developers but for all the end-users like Analysts.   \n\n2. Multi-Cloud: It can be hosted in AWS, GCP, or  Azure. This might sound irrelevant. Here is why it's important. Let's say a company started using Bigquery because Google is the preferred partner. After a couple of years, things have changed, and the company decided to make Azure the company's preferred Cloud vendor. Now it's not that easy to migrate your Data warehouse from Bigquery to Azure DHW. With Snowflake, you are not tied up to a particular vendor. The point here is Snowflake gives flexibility, and enterprise companies love this flexibility. \n\n3. Snowflake integration is pretty neat. It integrates with GCS, AWS S3, etc., and with other APIs natively.  Sample use case. Running an ML model(API) on top of Snowflake data using SQL. You don't need to be an ML expert to run a model. Anyone with basic SQL can do this.  This is one example, Applications are endless.\n\n4. Data sharing and Data marketplace. They are building a data catalog complemented by the data sharing feature\u2014essentially data as a service. More data demand -&gt; More data listed in catalog -&gt;  Network effect growth through sharing-&gt; Customer exponential growth-&gt;More money. I believe this will be huge, which is the main reason I'm bullish on Snowflake. Because snowflake supports multi-cloud,  it's not easy for other companies like Google/AWS to replicate this.\n\n5. Snowflake Customer retention is really high, and I strongly believe this will continue to remain so. Most of Snowflake's customers are Enterprises.  In my experience, companies switch or change databases for 3 main reasons. 1. Scaling or maintenance issue 2. License or hardware end of life or no longer supports 3\u2014cost savings. Snowflake is highly scalable and utilizes cloud infrastructure with zero maintenance. So issues 1 and 2 do not exist. For the cost, it is charged per usage. It's way cheaper than any other legacy database like Oracle, HANA, etc. Basically, once an enterprise adopts Snowflake as their data warehouse, I don't see any reason for switching unless something terrible goes wrong.  Many companies still bear Oracle because of the complexity and cost of migration even though they really want to.\n\n6. They have some unique features. One that stands out for me is the feature called Time travel. ( Read about it https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html. This is mind-blowing. They also have the ability to create, schedule, run data pipelines without the need for any ELT/ETL tools. ( Including setting up dependencies). For enterprise companies, this may not be valid but definitely useful for startups.",

        "body": "So my perspective is that those two are actually in very different places from a regulation perspective.  \n\nGoogle is likely to get continually more regulated as time goes on and data privacy becomes a bigger issue.  I would say it doesn't actually fall under most current anti-trust legislation which is related to price competition and its revenue area is actually advertising where there is lots of competition BUT I agree that practically it is enough of a monopoly that it will likely get dragged into it.  I sold my Google and FB a few months ago, both just to take profits and because I think there's a solid chance they spend the next 2-4 years in continuous litigation and hearings over how to manage data more responsibly and how they should be regulated.  Doubt anyone can agree to anything, but it will put a damper on their acquisition and expansion sprees.\n\nAmazon is a very different case as Amazon isn't really a monopoly in any way, they just compete in SO MANY categories that it feels that way.  But when you look at it...in e-commerce, its hard to call someone a monopoly when Walmart, Target, Costco Best Buy and every other big box compete with them; AWS is fighting tooth and nail with Microsoft Azure, Google could, IBM, Oracle etc.; \n\nWe can keep going down the list - Prime video competes with Netflix and Hulu; Amazon logistics competes with UPS and Fedex and Uber Cargo...so while their everpresence in our lives makes it feel like it MUST be a monopoly, its actually hard to identify anywhere specifically that Amazon isn't subject to pretty intense competition by big players, thus hard to make a case for anti-competitive behavior or anti-trust violations.",

However that's not what matters for that part of the business: Everything's plumbed together with ETL stages, and queries that feed into other tools as needed. It's all about crunching TB or PB of data to make complicated correlations. The user interfaces are just there to prototype and run one-of queries, not run a business.\n\nFor data scientists the data would be fed into 3rd party, like python, R or GUI tools like Tableau to generate charts, via existing \"connectors\".\n\nThe things I consider is there's a vast amount of legacy data and processes in companies that are all databases and SQL scripts that need to be migrated. You can't move any of that without the compatibility.\n\nI think that's why there's no direct comparison to PLTR which offers tools to build from scratch your analytics. Furthermore I don't believe a small business would be the target customer for Palantir either. If anything Palantir will pull data from Snowflake as one of its many inputs.\n\nIf anything  small businesses would buy integrated solutions. These solutions can be implemented on top of Snowflake. In fact companies are created on top of Snowflake's infrastructure now. Would you expect a small business to run Oracle. no. A fortune 500 company? yes.",

His next prediction is that due to the events next week: The concept of Ides of March, GameStop 2nd hearing (and all the media attention that it comes with), stimmy cheque, quadruple witching day, XRT and other ETFs rebalancing their ETF and making GameStop smaller in their holding due to the manipulation they saw (meaning Shitadel has been shorting through XRT and with them being closed on the 19th they will have to buy back), DTCC rule coming becoming activated around the 19th and quite a few other reasons. Next week has a higher than usual chance for the squeeze to happen. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s guaranteed though. But keeping a positive mindset that with each day passes, we are getting closer to the squeeze regardless of a date, that will do us good and keep our spirits strong.

Low and behold, half hour past the bell, there was no significant rebound and the RSI indicator showed that it was excessively oversold. So I bought a call and watched. It followed Fibonacci resistances and support with an upward support line and a much flatter resistance line. It was trading over VWAP, the net inflow into the NYSE was strong that day, ORCL constantly staying in the upper sections of the Fibonacci LINES, SAR showed bullish signs and nearly every time it broke resistance and ran up. \n\nAll of that TA gave me information and likely trends to inform if I should stay in or where to look to get out. But it took the fundamentals of knowing how to skim an earnings report, understanding pricing in dividends, and other understandings of fundamental research showed me that there is a play to be had. TA isn't an end all be all, not even close. But to say it's bullshit is as dumb as using it to try and find every pattern that shows up. Stocks run and there *are* patterns to when they will when no other external catalysts are on it. TA helps me see which direction is more likely and if I should wait or take action .",

Strong, long lasting companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Qualcomm, etc. hardly have any competition whatsoever in reference to the companies listed in the NYSE (unless you count stagnant/dying firms like Oracle or Nokia, but that\u2019s really stretching it). Only thing I can really think of is Facebook v Twitter and some e-commerce stuff like Alibaba v Amazon. Either way, the examples are seldom. \n\nThat said, I appreciate your advice immensely. Thank you :)",
