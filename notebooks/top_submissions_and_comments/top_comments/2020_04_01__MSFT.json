Do MSFT for 20 years and you'll have pretty much the same returns as 5 years (edit: plus dividends*).",

Buffet evaluates what he thinks a company should be worth before looking at the stock price and sees how it compares. The guy in the big short saw systemic flaws in the mortgage industry and traded on that. Both are frequently wrong short term, but usually right long term. If you think Microsoft (just picking a company) has the management, products, vision, and capabilities to double their income in 10 years, you should buy them regardless of what their stock price is or does over the next year. If you are right about those core pieces, the stock price will eventually reflect the success of the company. Anything short term is just gambling.",

The fact of markets is that its driven by 80% financial institutions who are not barred from holding short positions. The market is irrational in the short term, but its never irrational long term. \n\nTake a look at the VIX, its at 42. This implies that SPY can move 12% up or down as driven by premium prices. This means that the underwriters of options (the guys you buy options from) are pricing in this movement. Now lets look at SPY's movement the last 2 weeks, gee what do you know? its moved up 12% well within the expected volatility of the market. \n\nThis means that the SPY index can swing up or down 12% within this month, and it will mean absolutely NOTHING. It would be considered random noise.\n\nNow during the last 2 weeks we've had 2 uncertainties become certain.\n\n1. PPP was activated and disbursed\n2. Fed commited to buying Equity based securities\n\nThese were the 2 big driving factors of the gains.\n\nNow if you scrutinized the winners and losers of the last 2 weeks of gains, you can notice a theme. Companies like MSFT/AMD/NVDA/Netflix are rewarded. Can you think of a rational reason why that is? Compared to say BA? This is proof the market is evaluating companies rationally corp to corp.\n\nNext, I want all the bears to understand that in the history of 100 years of equity movement, the stocks only moved down 4% of the time ( vs 96% of the time up) and in addition, bear markets only lasted 200 days on average. With the way algos reacted and the fed, you can expect this bear market to be compressed at LEAST by a factor of 2. Lets say 100 days. Now we've had market reaction for over 60 days now. this means, we are likely already halfway through this market correction statistically.\n\nKnowing the above quantifications, how many are actually brave enough to continue to short? It makes no sense logically given the above.",

        "body": "Losses calls (formely called earnings calls) template that companies can use this year:\n\nGood afternoon {COMPANY} shareholders, we have very exciting news to share with you regarding our cash flow from this last quarter.  As many of you know, 90% of our work force has been working from home, jiggling the mouse every 15 minutes to appear active in Microsoft Teams, while beating their dicks raw to porn and day drinking in their underwear for the past 45 days.\n\nThe remaining 10% of our work force has been designated as essential employees, and have been in the office compiling reports about which of these dick beaters will be the first that we let go upon the grand re-opening of the US economy.  Laying off at least half of our dick beating workforce will save us enough cash to be able to start buying back shares of our stonks again, boosting EPS by {UNREASONABLE\\_PERCENTAGE}.\n\nThanks to the free money printer, we haven't had to outlay much working capital to continue to pay our work from home employees, as JPOW has been cranking that money crank till his eyes started bleeding and he had to hire an intern to take over.  In addition, team JPOW has been buying up our high yield bonds that we've been issuing, further preparing us to continue our very efficient stonk buyback program.\n\nWhile we can't issue guidance at this time, we all here at {COMPANY} want you to know that we are very excited about what 2021 is going to look like.",

Now nVidia are very well positioned to take advantage of this but there is no guarantee they will be the only players in this field, in fact I expect the software guys to come and steal their lunch because: \n\n1) Game publishers are rich as fuck and have all the money necessary to create this AI hardware divisions\n2) Epic Games who own Unreal Engine are 49% owned by Tencent and China has been ramping up their own silicon lately, and I can guarantee they will not miss this chance of controlling PC gaming hardware\n\nBasically nVidia's pie will continue to dwindle on the PC gaming and their growth on emergent markets will also be capped pretty soon.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk",
