I also like some of the fabless chipmakers like AVGO, TXN, and NXP. TSMC might be good as well. Ultimately, you could spread out across some names, or maybe a semiconductor ETF like SOXX or PSI.",

FB is reasonably priced for growth.\n\nMSFT seems to fit in well with your theme, and maybe ADBE, too. \n\nYou might also want to buy some semiconductor stocks (AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Lam Research, Taiwan Semiconductor, etc.), or an ETF like SOXL (or the unleveraged version) -- with the ETF, you don't have to pick the right winners.",
