        "body": "For me it's usually a warning sign when I see a stock going up and up like that.  Even so, if the fundamentals are there, it may still be a good time to hop on the train.  So the next thing I look at is the P/E ratio.  FTNT currently has a P/E ratio of over 100.  For comparison, the S+P 500 is at about 28 right now, with a historical mean of about 16.\n\nI don't know anything about the company, but a quick Google search says that they're in cybersecurity.  I guess investors are betting on them being important in the near future due to all the ransomware attacks, etc., therefore they're willing to pay an extremely high multiple for future earnings.\n\nMe personally, I don't buy stocks like that.  It's speculating.  Yeah, if the growth story pans out, better to get in now than later.  But if it doesn't, you're left holding a very big bag.  Every now and then you might get an Amazon for $250 even when people like me are saying it's overvalued.  But do you think all the companies trading at this valuation are going to end up being the next Amazon?  Probably not, so it's basically gambling.\n\nI prefer to invest in companies with a valuation that is reasonably justified in the present, while still taking into account *reasonable* expectations for growth based on historical numbers and trends.  It's a winning strategy that doesn't rely on the rosiest of assumptions in order to pan out.",

Palo is somewhere in the middle but they have great perception from customers.

If we're talking pure security I like check point for gateways and public/ private cloud northsouth &amp; eastwest. I like Zscaler for remote access and secure internet browsing.

        "body": "As someone who has worked with most security products and all of those vendors I'll give you some food for thought.  First off, all of these companies have very different businesses. only a few of them have overlapping products and I'll explain below. \n\nEDR- Endpoint detection and remediation, previously called End point protection (EPP) or antivirus (AV)\n\nCrowdstrike is focused purely on Managed Detection and remediation (MDR) and EDR solutions - Protecting endpoints IE. Laptops, phones, tablets etc.. Fortinet has their own EDR solution but it doesn't compare to crowd strike's.  Z scaler and Net do not offer an EDR solution by my knowledge and it's the reason that Zscaler has decided to integrate heavily with crowdstrike for EDR telemetry &amp; Illumio for micro segmentation &amp; workload protection. When using these products in unison you can produce an architecture which can follow a zero trust methodology. It will share intel between them (what we call telemetry data) for quicker remediation's, and actively defending your network instead of the products being separated into silos. \n\nIE. Crowdstrike finds a ransomware on one of your endpoints, Illumio can quarantine the device from the rest of your network, &amp; Zscaler can update it's signatures to prevent the transmission of this ransomware again. \n\nPause here - If you don't know what Zero Trust Security (ZTS). It is a methodology which says that protecting the perimeter of your network is no longer effective in reducing breaches / incidents. Ex. a castles moat is no longer good enough, instead lock each door and ask whether someone has permission to enter that room. In technological terms a Zero trust methodology should include continuous authentication, workload protection, &amp; micro segmentation.  A lot of companies say \"I sell Zero trust\" but in reality nobody sells ZTS, ZTS is a way to manage your network which some companies may sell a component of.\n\nFirewalls - on premise or in the cloud\n\nZscaler, Net, and Fortinet, all have cloud firewall offerings but not all of them do the same function / business.  to my knowledge Fortinet is the only firewall vendor ( out of these 3) who has the partnerships to spin up cloud based firewalls with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc. Zscaler and Net have their own private clouds which they allow you to secure pass traffic through and middle your traffic securely. This can be great for a company with all mobile workers as you don't have to invest in your own firewall appliances to be getting enterprise grade protections. They have a per user per month model and they can protect you from internet access as well as give you a secure backdoor into your applications behind your private clouds. Fortinet has this functionality with hardware appliances but not the same model as Net / Zscaler. (I've never used a Net gateway so I can't speak to which is better between them and ZS, I've used ZS before I like it).\n\nFortinet has the best on prem firewalls out of all the companies above. They don't have the best on prem firewalls in the business, but they excel at Small and medium business (SMB) and their hardware is designed to support Software defined wide area networked (SD-WAN) architectures. I have seen these in action with a hub-n-spoke architecture and they worked well. \n\nDDOS- distributed denial of service \n\nCloudflare is the only company above to provide a DDOS solution. I don't think they are the best in the industry but they do a good job. A note on Cloudflare is that they are a diverse company with a lot of verticals. Some are security related otheres are services that I know little about. I don't think you are comparing apples to apples with any of these companies so understand where each has strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFinal thoughts-\n\nTo round out your portfolio you may want to look into companies that sell SIEMs IE. Splunk, darktrace, microsoft sentinal, IBM's Qradar. Okta is an Identity Access Manager provider (IDAM) and they are also a heavy player to the authentication component of ZTS.  You should also consider reading Mitre, gartner, and NSS labs reports to compare how customers feel about these products as well as their security scores. Being the best at security doesn't correlate to having the best stock price. Palo and Crowdstrike have the best mind space - yet some of the oldest vulnerabilities that are left unpatched. All of these companies will continue to grow due to industry trends and each of them have their own slice of the security pie. My 2 cents.",

        "body": "Possibly Very Bullish Sectors for the Next 3-12 Months Amid Troubled Times. The examples below are certainly not buy recommendations. Just examples.\n\nBelow is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\nAnyway enjoy the dips now because these are likely to get beefed up as the supply chain &amp; worker shortages unwind\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

Intel has been an iconic business for my entire adult lifetime and has survived many troubles. I'm not looking for a moon stock, just something that is likely to keep It's value for the next 20 years or so, grow modestly, and keep paying the dividend. Bleeding edge chips are not going to fuel growth forever. Soon we will reach the limits and needs of human perception, and performance/graphics improvements won't have as much value as in the past.\n\nThe covid and climate crises appear to predict a contraction in globalization  and a simplification of supply chains, which may benefit Intel in the near future. Its name recognition, market cap, low p/e, importance to American interests, and forward looking attitude all indicate a \"buy\" to me.

For a long time I have been trying to convince my friend to drop Intel stock (mostly based on their shrinking market share, your data nicely adds), but he still believes in the power of inertia. Nevertheless, I had gathered a list of stocks one IMO can use instead, not overperformative, but solid. \n\nI think that top pick is ASML - instead of betting on a sloppy big player in a growing market, you switch to the main supplier of players in this market. \nTexas Instruments and Analog Devices are good picks if you trust in the electronics segment as a whole, and they provide a wider product mix in terms of electronic components and integrated circuits.\nAnd my favorites also are companies, that produce good measurement instruments. I do solid state physics, and there is funny coincidence - producers of devices I like and use generally show good performance at a stock market. Those are Ametek, Agilent, Keysight, Danaher (Fortive).\n\nWhether you have the opinion on these companies, I would highly appreciate it.",

These are long term investments for my portfolio though\n\nMy actual dividend portfolio only consists of O, IRM, and IEP. In that order, they increase in yield percentage. IEP pays the most at 8 dollars a year for a nice yield of 14.61%. Dividend stocks are great but can quickly be unprofitable if the losses offset the payout so its good to buy dips and monitor performance as needed.",

I will just mention the main one along with some publicly traded companies.  The main buzz word or \"thrust\" right now is \"Digital Twins\" for \"remote viewing.\"  Matterport MTTR is mapping and storing the interiors of the world which will be used at some point in the future for the metaverse.  The reverse of this is Snapchat SNAP whose glasses will merge the digital world into your viewing and will be able to record the two together for content posting.  A larger aspect is that 5G is using mmWaves so that mmWave radar can also be part of the 5G towers.  This will allow unmanned drones to fly and film and allow remote viewing in real-time.  MmWave radar chips are now being added to phones (I think mostly from TXN) so that the drones can ping them to navigate indoors unmanned.  These chips also are supposed to work with augmented reality Snapchat or Magic Leap type apps.  Not investment advice.  This is a very boring post for a subject I'm actually excited about.

        "body": "My favorites are blue chip/large cap stocks and I've made some nice returns by doing so. They are not risk-free but way less risk compared to small caps/short squeezes. The strategy is literally buy low, sell high lol. Study the daily chart and find the lows and high of the stocks. Some stocks like to bounce within a range for weeks or even months.\n\nA super great example is TXN. It reached 197 in April and it usually bounces down to its lows (174-180) and bounces back up to 190s. It has repeated this pattern for MONTHS and just yesterday, it hit 186 and today it bounced right back up. AXP has also been fairly predictable, lows (155-161), and highs (171-179). When stocks break out of their range, then I usually stop trading it for awhile to see the new boundaries. At what price you sell is up to you, but my minimum goal is a 2% return but if the stock is looking strong I try to aim for 5% or above. During this choppy market recently, I've also been having major fun with SBUX, V, WM, UPS, AMD, VTI.",

No worries, they will apply the same tech to gpus and beat them with raw power and let the open software comminty take care of the software side.\n\nThey are also buying xilinx to get better tech in computation and access to new markets (automotive, aerospace, special computation loads in datacenters, etc).\n\nTo sum Up, AMD will be 200 in less than 12 months.",

        "body": "defo the synergy effects should be sizeable. AMD desperately need more talent. they lost so much in the years prior to ryzen. Xilinx has the serious talent they need. not to mention Xilinx had to work out chiplets years ago, they likely have considerable IP that is invaluable to AMD\n\nXilinx is actually currently more profitable than AMD, however, they are a lower volume producer, so I could assume their wafer costs could defo see improvement under AMD who has the volume to get the cost down (they also don't need bleeding edge so maybe this is also how AMD will continue to fulfil the WSA or whatever is left of that but they would still need to port over which isn't cheap)\n\nAMDs management has really got good at execution, so id expect this merger assuming fully approved which Id see likely will go well and we will see the benefits long term.",

There's no good news coming for AMD and a lot of bad ones:\n\n\\- Intel will leapfrog AMD by the end of October with Alder Lake and AMD has nothing to counter with for the next year and a half. This is massive in terms of sentiment change, from \"AMD is the best\" to \"AMD is behind\".\n\n\\- TSMC capacity is all booked by Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, preventing AMD from improving their node process. They just do not have enough money to outbid competitors.\n\n\\- Intel will release its own mid-range GPUs early next year, undercut on pricing, and use TSMC capacity to starve AMD.\n\n\\- Supply shortages are not getting any better, preventing AMD from capitalizing on their current advantages. By the time they are resolved, Intel will capitalize on laptop and server processors with Alder Lake using its own capacity.\n\n\\- Xilinx merger may get cockblocked or delayed by China, as well as force AMD to make costly concessions.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw a few astrological lines and prey.",

        "body": "Man, it does appear to be an absolute no brainer if you're super bullish on AMD.\n\nHowever, I'm in a particular scenario at the moment where I might not want to buy XLNX yet, and should try to wait a bit longer.\n\nBasically, I feel like a pretty significant market correction is going to happen the week of November 2nd with the next big Fed meeting. I think the market will be down pretty big in November and December.\n\nHalf of my portfolio is in cash. \n\nHalf of my portfolio is in play, and the reason it's still there is because I do believe there might be one more mini-bull rally before we get closer to November 2nd. My 2nd largest position is in AMD.\n\nMy plan is to try to milk whatever mini-bull rally happens prior to November 2nd. I see October 20th or 21st as the last chances to exit before everybody starts to get really nervous about November 2nd. Starting Monday, I only have about 8 or 9 more market days for half this portfolio.\n\nThen I might be jumping 100 percent to cash. This of course will be a temporary move, but I'm expecting November and December to just be months that most stock enthusiasts would like to forget. So, it's going to take a lot of discipline for me to hold out for the real lows that I'm expecting (at least 25 percent of all-time highs).\n\nBasically, I think when I buy back in either in November or December, I will load the boat with XLNX shares over AMD shares, but who knows if the spread will be as big then? Or maybe the merger will have been announced as final.",

Since they actually don't manufacture their chips and instead rely on TSMC for doing so, they are actually limited by the shortage. \n\nThey have the better product compared to Intel especially in the hugely important server market. They are gaining market share, but the lack of supply actually saves their rival at the moment. Similarly they'd have no problem selling more CPUs in the laptop/desktop market, chips for the PS5 or hugely in demand GPUs (even though nvidia still has an edge there). \n\nThey'll also buy Xilinx, which adds some nice synergies with the FPGAs. I feel like they most of all need to work on their software and GPUs, but they kind of already have the product range that nvidia would like to achieve by purchasing ARM (which so far doesn't seem to happen).",

        "body": "Just a quick comment about AMD. I've traded the stock back and forth since February, and I can tell you that the stock was mostly not doing much of anything for long stretches, and then it finally had a big breakout, that pushed it above $100. This happened in this most recent 6 month period, so it seems like AMD is this outstanding performer in the most recent 6 months, but for 4 of those months, it didn't do much of anything.\n\nI still love AMD by the way. One of my favorite stocks going forward.\n\n(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",

Scaled up production and synergy effects should so some work as well.\n\nI'm really not sure how the market will react, so it's just a wild guess from my side.
