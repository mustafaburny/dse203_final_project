        "body": "For me it's usually a warning sign when I see a stock going up and up like that.  Even so, if the fundamentals are there, it may still be a good time to hop on the train.  So the next thing I look at is the P/E ratio.  FTNT currently has a P/E ratio of over 100.  For comparison, the S+P 500 is at about 28 right now, with a historical mean of about 16.\n\nI don't know anything about the company, but a quick Google search says that they're in cybersecurity.  I guess investors are betting on them being important in the near future due to all the ransomware attacks, etc., therefore they're willing to pay an extremely high multiple for future earnings.\n\nMe personally, I don't buy stocks like that.  It's speculating.  Yeah, if the growth story pans out, better to get in now than later.  But if it doesn't, you're left holding a very big bag.  Every now and then you might get an Amazon for $250 even when people like me are saying it's overvalued.  But do you think all the companies trading at this valuation are going to end up being the next Amazon?  Probably not, so it's basically gambling.\n\nI prefer to invest in companies with a valuation that is reasonably justified in the present, while still taking into account *reasonable* expectations for growth based on historical numbers and trends.  It's a winning strategy that doesn't rely on the rosiest of assumptions in order to pan out.",

Doesn't matter what I do, shit goes the opposite direction almost immediately. I'm why FTNT stopped doing that thing where it always goes up. I'm why Amazon tanked a month ago. Same with ELY and so many more. Even Boomer stocks aren't safe. I'm why JNJ has gone down since Aug and PG since mid Sept. If I touch it, it's going south. I literally cause the peak to reverse in anything I touch. Guaranteed. I used to be very good at SPY, but now even that has inverse.  \n\n\nI feel like I have a duty to use these powers for good. It's too late for me, but you can benefit. I figure, if I start a website publishing my moves in real time, people would pay to subscribe and do the opposite. You literally can't go tits up if you do the opposite of me. But I can only assume such a sure thing would get me in hot water with the SEC.",
