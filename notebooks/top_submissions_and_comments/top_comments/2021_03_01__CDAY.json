It would have taken 5-7 days (according to another DD) for the shares to be sellable. \n\nSoros promised to divest their 18.5M shares (as of Jan) on principle. Those should be hitting the market by now. \n\nThe tech selloff has also contributed to keeping PLTR depressed. Cathie, however, has been gobbling up the shares at every dip. \n\nFinally, unless you are an insider and know more than the rest of us, Palantir's software claims are pretty standard for enterprise software. Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Siemens, etc., make those claims regularly. I don't think Palantir is special but they do have momentum and high profile clients. \n\nOverall I think PLTR is getting ready to take off, but they might find some resistance along the way.

        "body": "I have experience in setting up Snowflake in a Fortune 100 company. And I have also worked on Google Bigquery, AWS Redshift, and Azure DWH in the past. Here are my thoughts on its potentials.\n\n1. Snowflake is a way better product than Bigquery, Redshift, or Azure DWH. It automatically handles all legal database SQL syntax(Oracle, SQL Server, etc.). So data migration from the legacy database is less complex with a minimum learning curve. This is true not just for developers but for all the end-users like Analysts.   \n\n2. Multi-Cloud: It can be hosted in AWS, GCP, or  Azure. This might sound irrelevant. Here is why it's important. Let's say a company started using Bigquery because Google is the preferred partner. After a couple of years, things have changed, and the company decided to make Azure the company's preferred Cloud vendor. Now it's not that easy to migrate your Data warehouse from Bigquery to Azure DHW. With Snowflake, you are not tied up to a particular vendor. The point here is Snowflake gives flexibility, and enterprise companies love this flexibility. \n\n3. Snowflake integration is pretty neat. It integrates with GCS, AWS S3, etc., and with other APIs natively.  Sample use case. Running an ML model(API) on top of Snowflake data using SQL. You don't need to be an ML expert to run a model. Anyone with basic SQL can do this.  This is one example, Applications are endless.\n\n4. Data sharing and Data marketplace. They are building a data catalog complemented by the data sharing feature\u2014essentially data as a service. More data demand -&gt; More data listed in catalog -&gt;  Network effect growth through sharing-&gt; Customer exponential growth-&gt;More money. I believe this will be huge, which is the main reason I'm bullish on Snowflake. Because snowflake supports multi-cloud,  it's not easy for other companies like Google/AWS to replicate this.\n\n5. Snowflake Customer retention is really high, and I strongly believe this will continue to remain so. Most of Snowflake's customers are Enterprises.  In my experience, companies switch or change databases for 3 main reasons. 1. Scaling or maintenance issue 2. License or hardware end of life or no longer supports 3\u2014cost savings. Snowflake is highly scalable and utilizes cloud infrastructure with zero maintenance. So issues 1 and 2 do not exist. For the cost, it is charged per usage. It's way cheaper than any other legacy database like Oracle, HANA, etc. Basically, once an enterprise adopts Snowflake as their data warehouse, I don't see any reason for switching unless something terrible goes wrong.  Many companies still bear Oracle because of the complexity and cost of migration even though they really want to.\n\n6. They have some unique features. One that stands out for me is the feature called Time travel. ( Read about it https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html. This is mind-blowing. They also have the ability to create, schedule, run data pipelines without the need for any ELT/ETL tools. ( Including setting up dependencies). For enterprise companies, this may not be valid but definitely useful for startups.",
