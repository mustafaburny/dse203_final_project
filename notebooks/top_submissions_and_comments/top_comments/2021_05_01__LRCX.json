Chasing often results in buying high and selling low.  \nLook for solid companies with a sound business and plenty of future growth.  Learn to always check p/e and p/s ratios before buying.  See what the stock traded prior to covid, did they launch something new or improve their business during covid?  If not, why would the company be worth more now than it was pre-covid?  Always have a hold philosophy before buying (is it 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years before you think you may want to sell it?)  \nNow is a great time to start buying some of the big tech and some of the other moderate p/e tech companies that will be long-term (3+ year) winners like AMD, SKWS, TSM, LRCX, AMAT.  This does not mean go all in on them but rather start buying with a plan.  Look at the solar and green-tech companies, if you find something with a p/e below ~40, research it maybe buy a few share and keep it on the radar.  Now is a great time to start buying small positions in longterm winners that have been beaten up.  This however, is not a time I could recommend looking at too many things that are still unproven.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't look at small positions in things like weed, on-line betting, eV, big data, just keep those risks as a small part of your portfolio.",

I'm a fan of semiconductor plays like , QCOM, Lam research, AMD and intel (long hold, short is hairy.) I like big tech with good earnings and decently low peg and pe multiples. Tech is presenting some good buying opportunities, but the market is rampant with companies that just simply won't make it. Stick to blues chip names that have gotten beaten up and dca into a solid position. Anything else speculative, may be comparable to catching a falling knife.\n\nApph isn't terrible and has promise. \n\nEV is solid, but very expensive for most investments right now, as most don't turn a profit. Tesla barely even turns a profit and is the first mover. To play this space, I would go with legacy automakers like Gm or ford or volkswagen, as they are on a path to integrate EVs into their lineups. \n\nOther than automakers, I would buy lithium miners like Livent or albemarle. Precious metals like palladium and rhodium related stocks may also be good buys because PGM metals are used in EV cars as well as ICE cars. \n\nRight now, industrials are good, although with the inflation narrative, stocks with pricing power are in demand. Healthcare, tobacco, oil (eh, I'm bullish, but I'm biased), food and beverage (pepsi, Coca-Cola, etc) will probably do decent under this volatility, but won't make you heaps of money either. \n\nBanks are also decent buys, I like Citi and BAC. They will do well under inflation BUT have already went on a bit of a tear so dca into a position may be smart.",

TSMC has stated that prices will go up for new orders, but they are still working through the backlog that has been under contract for some time, and the new pricing won't take effect yet. This, plus the threat of China, is what's keeping the $TSM price depressed right now. Beyond that, they have nothing but tailwinds from a business perspective for the next several years. \n\nLook for the semicaps ($AMAT, $ASML, $TER, $LRCX, $KLAC, et al) if you want plays that will see action first from the TSMC, Intel and Samsung capex spending. The fabs will benefit from this capex second, while the fabless companies ($NVDA, $AMD, $AAPL, etc.) will see the benefit of this extra capacity last.",
