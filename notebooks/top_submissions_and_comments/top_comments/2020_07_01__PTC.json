        "body": "I started buying shares of TSLA in 2012, because I saw how successful Elon was with paypal. What I'm trying to say is I've followed the stock for a long time. Think I have a decent feel for it, although it is still wildly unpredictable at times.\n\nI'm in a discord with some guys who were chasing TSLA all day buying calls and puts, but kept getting stopped out. So I thought about the inverse.\n\nLooking for an EOD play, I decided selling OTM TSLA calls could be a way to collect premium considering how Theta would be aggressively gnawing at them.\n\nFirst sold a TSLA 7/24 1485c first time TSLA came up to 1450, with the hypothesis that TSLA wasn't going to break the high of the day, nor shoot up to 1485.\n\nWhen I saw the double top forming around 2:30 I sold a TSLA 1475c thinking bulls wouldn't be able to push it up any further. And it did stay in a downwards trend for the rest of the day. \n\nNext I sold a 1470c as the stock surged around 3:15 and actually collected larger premium. \n\nI also tack SPY closely and could see that wasn't shooting up so I sold a 1450c pretty late in the trading session because I didn't think it was likely to regain 1450 before closing considering how SPY was moving.\n\nI managed them closely as was ready to buy back the contracts if TSLA started to shoot up, which it is known to do. \n\nI just set the calls to fill at market and they would take quite awhile to fill. Like over a minute, which has never happened to me with Schwab; market orders usually fill right away. \n\nI decided to ride them out the whole way to expiration to collect the full premium. Schwab always pays either night of or next day with expired contracts.\n\nI understand that there is theoretically infinite amount of risk, but thought the chances the calls expiring OTM and collecting the premium outweighed the risk; so I sold the calls.",

Going to try my best next week to not be a sheep following the herd here buying into whatever hype is being discuss and thinking more independently and only sharing my plays if I deem it to be a good one for the long term. \n\nBeing down 75% all time hurts and makes me want to quit trading but like some dude messaged me saying \"don't quit at the bottom\" so I'm not giving up. Not yet. I turned $600 to $9k in june before losing it all buying only naked calls, and then turned whatever was left ($750 to 13K between june 26th - july 10th) on pretty much Tesla, AMZN, FB, PYPL, Fastly and a couple other tech stock options. \n\ntl;dr , its been a shitty month but I'm not giving up just yet. back to the lab to come up with a solid game plan for august to make these tendies back and keep this time. 100K by December and Lambo soon. \n\nHave a good weekend everyone",

        "body": "I'm from Vietnam and our money has little value, 500usd is like average monthly salary here. It's pretty hard to access US stock trading from where I'm from. I got a TDA account, they allow foreign account, then ask a friend of mine in the US to fund it and I send him money over Paypal or Transferwise. My countries doesn't even allow bank wire to fund international investing. \n\n\nI started in Feb with the SPCE crazed, missed TSLA, MSFT due to TDA handling my account creation a bit too long (was my fault at first but their handling was the main problem). Proceed to make big with SPCE in a week, I turn 2k into 6k and it was amazing, that's like a year of salary for an average person here and still being in uni that was a dream for me. I work pretty hard to make money here, part time and trying to open my own company and making 6k in such a short amount of time was crazy. \n\n\nI did spent a few years learning before I was 18 (to be allowed to create an account). Wanted to get in heavy on AMD when they were sub 2 (I study Computer Engineer and love PC so I kinda felt how big Ryzen was) but didn't have the chance. \n\n\nSo after SPCE was around Feb 20 and the market started crashing, lost a lot to sub 1k then I moved to SPY put and made back to 3k.\n\n\nThen lost a bunch on The Witching. Down to 300 and proceed to lose them with put when market shoot back up. Finally some friend decided they wanna give it a go and invest some money with me trading and he'll just watch.\n\nHaving learnt a bunch from my past experience, I managed to turn his 500 into 4000 with pennystock and I get to keep 2000 which was back to even. Took a lot of good risk management and making multiple small smart play.\n\n\nThat was a month ago, now I'm down to 800 but I'm feeling like I'm getting a lot better compares to when I start.\n\n\nMost of the lost was due to lack of day trading with penny stock and some momentum options play gone wrong.\n\n\nMy biggest mistake and biggest gainer was both due to going too big on a position. I'm learning to control that.\n\n\nAnw, that was a long rant, I never really share these things since there's no one around me that I can talk about this. All I hear people say is that I'm gambling, which might seems like it looking at my history but I kinda think it's justified right now due to never before seen volatility.\n\n\nI learnt a lot and feel excited for my trading future but man the losses take their tolls. Probably gonna finish uni next year and try to get my company of the ground while doing small investing. Learning about the market, news and general financial, business helped me a lot with my career I feel.\n\n\nHope this somehow answer your question and good luck to us all. At the end of the day I just want everyone to live more comfortably with their side income and seeing the loss porn might be hilarious but there's always a person behind those loss as well as their family. It's fine if you lose 100k while sitting on millions but man some adults just scares me and I'm grateful to learn from their mistakes.\n\n\nI want to make 25k before the end of next year so I can day trade. Just making 100 usd a day would allow me to fund my company and let my parents retire soon especially during this harsh Covid time. \n\n\nVietnam was free of covid for a month or two but just yesterday we have emergency news that a case popped up and spread.\n\n\nSorry for my long rant, hope you all enjoy your weekend and get those tendies next week. Sorry for my bad English :)",

A lot of car companies are moving toward EV or self driving. amazon started as a pure commerce play and its now one of the leading \"tech\" companies. \n\nDiversify your holdings with stuff you believe in, dont be afraid of \"tech\" - they're going to be the biggest growth stocks &amp; a lot of them are very safe bets.",

        "body": "Personally, I find a lot of the alt coins to be quite scammy and doesn't really solve a hair on fire issue (yet). \n\nHowever, bitcoin and to some small extent ethereum to me do serve a purpose. In a world where everything is built on credit and money is being printed like crazy, it shouldn't be considered crazy to invest in btc as an insurance.\n\nI get a lot of people mention gold. I love and hold quite a bit of precious metals as well, however seeing how the future generations are much more in tune with technology, they may be more inclined to stick with digital currencies instead of gold. My biggest paranoid with gold sometimes is buying fakes.... This issue doesn't really occur with bitcoin as long as you're not buying bitcoin gold or something stupid.\n\nAnother reason why bitcoin may be worthwhile to consider is the market cap at where it's at right now. Currently bitcoins market cap is almost half the size of Tesla. Sure it looks expensive at 13k CAD each but in the grand scheme of things, it could actually be extremely undervalued.\n\nThere are around 44 million millionaires in the world right now and there will only be a fixed cap of 21 million bitcoins. So in reality there isn't enough bitcoins to go around for every millionaire there is. Not to mention much of the original bitcoins have been lost in the early days. \n\nAnother thing I look at is the direction of how governments are treating crypto. PayPal, Goldman Sachs and visa are all looking to hire ethereum developers. The US federal reserve is endorsing an eth-backed alternative to LIBOR. I think these news are a positive tailwind for this asset class.\n\nEdit: corrected number of millionaires",

Venmo is also a huge component of paypal\u2019s portfolio. People are getting hard-on\u2019s for $SQ but I think SQ is in a worse position than PayPal. Venmo has 54 million users to Cash App\u2019s 22 million. SQ has a phenomenal POS system but physical storefronts took a big hit in Q2 which generates that revenue for them. I\u2019m long SQ and PayPal but I\u2019m way more confident in $PYPL. \nEdit: added everything after the first sentence cuz I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how this guy doesn\u2019t seem to realize that Q2 earnings don\u2019t reflect the immediately prior months.",

        "body": "Bruh, it's based on future expectations.\n\nAMD is grabbing market share like a hungry slut (not just in consumer PCs but also in consoles, enterprise, servers, etc), and INTC just continues to fuck up everything. It's honestly sort of amazing how many mistakes Intel has made in the past year or so, and they are legitimately at risk of becoming completely uncompetitive.\n\nThey basically lost 100% of the enthusiast/custom PC market overnight, and most of their revenue now comes from contracts with Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc for desktop and notebook CPUs (and a few other random components, like wifi and Bluetooth cards). And, these companies will almost definitely be looking to AMD, as Intel's 7nm chips aren't expected to be available until *at least* 2022, and AMD is already mass-producing. Depending on how hard these companies ditch Intel, it could be an actual death blow. \n\nAnd that doesn't even bring up the issue that things are shifting more and more to mobile platforms, where Intel completely failed. Companies like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm absolutely dominate in the mobile SoC sector and managed to castrate a titan when Intel attempted to enter that market and failed miserably. \n\nIt's bad news all around. \n\nDoes that mean they can't come back? No. Of course they can. But the concerns are real.\n\nWhat other major stocks have you seen recently crash 13% on earnings then just... Stay there? Flat? We are in the most legendary dip-buying market of all time, where almost any dip will be bought without any logic, and yet no one would touch INTC, which is one of the biggest tech companies in the world.\n\nIt's a bit concerning.\n\nYour DD is basically \"bruh, it's Intel. And they made a lot of money in 2019.\" But that's frankly just not very good DD my friend.",

Then there are the companies that make the devices we buy to connect us to 5G (Apple, amazon, google, and eventually, Tesla). Finally there are the service providers like Verizon att and t mobile that connect our devices to the 5G network. \n\nI suggest starting at YouTube. There are videos that explain what each company does and their role in the 5G network and pick which one you like the most. \n\nHowever, I wanted ALL of the companies with not a lot of money so I went after the 5G ETF (ticker: FIVG).",

        "body": "**RICK** \\- Not fond of this one. In the current environment, I see no upside.  \n\nRecognia has detected a \"Head and Shoulders Top\" chart pattern formed on RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc (RICK on NASDAQ). This bearish signal indicates that the price may fall from the close of 12.63 to the range of 7.25 - 8.25. The pattern formed over 24 days which is roughly the period of time in which the target price range may be achieved.\n\nRCI Hospitality Holdings Inc has a current support price of 11.03 and a resistance level of 15.32.\n\nA Head and Shoulders Top is considered a bearish signal. It indicates a possible reversal of the current uptrend to a new downtrend. A perfect example of the pattern has three sharp high points, the middle one being the highest, created by three successive rallies in the price of the financial instrument. The technical event occurs when the resistance marked by the neckline is \"broken\", thereby confirming the pattern.\n\n**NCLH** \\- It could be some time before you see returns on this one. Of all the cruise lines this one is probably in the best shape, financially. Long term hold, but be cautious.\n\n**MGM** \\- Another high risk stock. Again, this will likely come back in the long term, but I think you could do better with a solid tech stock or ETF in its place.\n\n**DKNG** \\- Probably overpriced, currently, but a decent long term pick.\n\n**QCOM** \\- solid company, great potential for both short term and long term. Buy lots of this one. Price target is $103; buy for under $90 if possible.\n\n**TMUS** \\- May struggle a bit in the next few weeks, but this is a solid pick. Might be a bit overpriced at the moment, but I think it will climb to $120 by the end of the year. Great long-term stock.\n\n**ETSY** \\- I think this is a decent pick, but it may be overbought at the moment. See if it dips, and buy the dip.\n\n**SQ** \\- I really like this company and this stock; but, again, I'm concerned that it may be overpriced. I'd watch for a dip, and buy then.\n\n**BA** \\- This one could be a good mid-term swing play. The MAX will be re-certified, and when that happens, I think the stock will pop. That said, the market for new jets may take years to reach the levels it was at a year ago. Buy, watch for the pop up, then sell.\n\n(Just my opinion. I own shares of NCLH, MGM and TMUS)",

        "body": "There are safety considerations with electromagnetic (EM) radiation.  Visible light, radiowaves, x-rays, etc are some of the bands on the complete spectrum of frequencies.  \n   \n[There are ionising and non-ionising bands as per this chart.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/375/cpsprodpb/2682/production/_107885890_5ggraphic-nc.png)  \n  \nFor ionising radiation like x-rays we have to limit exposure because it is harming our cells' dna. For non-ionising radiation we have to limit exposure because body tissue heats up when it absorbs them.  \n  \nConsider sunlight, which is a broad band of EM. We can feel infrared heating us up but we can't feel the UV burning us.  \n  \nWell, [5G is going to use frequencies up to about 100GHz](https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/30805-50906-An-illustration-of-the-areas-of-spectrum-5G-could-operate-within-via-Qualcomm-xl.jpg) which is much lower frequency band than sunlight and is not ionising radiation.  \n  \n5G is actually using microwaves so you know it can cook your flesh, except the power output of your phone's radio is kept well under the safe limits. The phone towers are a higher power output but the inverse square law means the receive level is quite low by the time it gets to you, and because of the number of mobile users, 5G towers and 4G towers are very close together transmitting on low power because that gives a cleaner signal and more data throughput.  \n  \nFinally I will quote the safe limit of 100GHz microwave output. [This NIH page mentions 10 Watts per square meter and 0.08 Watts per Kg.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765906/) A 5G phone will never get anywhere near that and the tower signal will be received by the antenna at about 0.0000001 Watts  and I would guess that your body would absorb about 1 milliWatt max from the tower. \n  \nSo because we have blood and sweat cooling us down, the tiny bit of heat is no issue. We're talking milliwatts total, compared to   sunlight which is about 1000W of radiation per square meter and some of that is ionising, unlike 5G. And even sunlight isn't too bad in moderation but 5G is fine as a low level background signal. Actually if you look on a spectrum analyser... there is a noise floor at 100GHz with signals here and there anyway.  \n  \nI hope that puts it into perspective... 5G is basically low power warm radiation and doesn't modify DNA (doesn't cause cancer). And it can't cook you because the power output is low, like TV and FM signals. It is like TV and radio signals but a higher band and with a much more efficient modulation scheme for data throughput.  \n  \nThanks for listening to my TED Talk.",

This means that the company has been aggressive in debt financing which could shoot them in the foot if they cannot pay it off. But long term debt has been decreasing since 2018 which shows that they know that the company is over levered and have been paying off the debt. The company is extremely profitable with high margins and a high ROE/ROA. The P/E is in the high 20s which shows that investors expect high growth from the company which could hurt investors if the company cannot keep up with the pace. While the P/B ratio has been thrown aside by the investing community I still believe that it is an important metric. QCOM has an extremely high P/B ratio of 30+. Finally, the company has a worrying although not deadly current ratio of 1.5 which measures a company's ability to may off short term liabilities  (You **DO NOT** want a company with a current ratio &lt;1)",

The only company they could get to use nvidia chips for anything, but their own products was nintendo, and they had to sell them at cost to nintendo to make it happen.  All nvidia has is rasing prices on consumer graphics cards and that will run out of steam eventually.\n\nComma.ai developed a self driving camera system with nvidia chips back in 2017-2018, but then the nvidia exec product developer got fired and replaced.  The new one refused to sell chips at a fair market rate and demanded they buy entire mini-pc boards at 5 times the price, not just the chips.  Comma wasted $100k in r&amp;d developing a product they no longer had chips for. Now george hotz praises qualcomm, not for being cheap(gotta buy in larger batches), but for being consistent and reliable as a chip source so they can actually design a product around a chip and not get screwed.\n\ntl;dr nvidia is too expensive for anyone to use their chips, not because the chips are expensive to make, but because they have crappy pricing and don't guarantee supply unless you are a huge company.",

This alone tells me they probably have had a target before inception. Why? He has a full time dedicated career with a full plate. A man in that position is highly unlikely to undertake such a large endeavor on the possibility of acquiring a deal. Given his position and connections,  It is far more likely that he stumbled across an amazing opportunity or was approached by one. After consultation and/or careful deliberation, starting a SPAC was the fastest way to raise money and get this target to market. Given his background and ties I would also conclude that the target company will be in INDIA, which by the way has been making leaps and bounds in network expansion. IMO, they are hammering out the terms with the target now.  5G has already begun its rollout. So, it is in their best interest to announce sooner rather than later.",

Especially illumina and crispr. \n\nThe only category I didn't feel was well represented in your portfolio was dividends. \n\nI hold XOM and IP for the dividends. IP is also defensive  in that it doesn't move much up or down. Just puts out dividends. XOM is hard to recommend, but those shares have been in my family since before I was alive and have paid for themselves many times over. \n\nI also hold some home builder tickers. Toll brothers and Lennar have been good to me, plus I like their products. \n\nYou mentioned tickers you may have missed. I push $pool on here any time someone asks that. It is my dark horse that no one else runs, but I love it. Just look at it.",

I would definitely buy these over QCOM or INTC. \n\nIf you want more growth (and therefore risk), you can go with AMD, MU, QRVO, or SWKS. Though do keep in mind that NVDA is growing very quickly. \n\nAlso, AVGO has a nice dividend.\n\nMy top semiconductor stock is NVDA. I want to buy in, but it\u2019s pretty overvalued. But it also keeps going up.",
