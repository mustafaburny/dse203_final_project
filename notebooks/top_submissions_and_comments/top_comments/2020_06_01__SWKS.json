Every time the market over reacts (or a stock makes its own correction), it's another opportunity to buy back and lock in profits. Very seldom do I actually have options go all the way out to expiration when I'm playing the long game. A shorter duration is just too volatile and too dangerous.\n\nSWKS 15 Jan $175 is paying $4.70 (3.46% in 7 months) with 32% upside in 7 months.\n\nIf I want to have little more upside, I can always take less premium, but when stocks are getting a little bit toppy, I'm comfortable staying a little bit closer on my strikes as I'm convinced (contrary to most of the professionals posting on Internet websites) that stocks do not always go up to new highs every single day into perpetuity.

The sectors that you say are overvalued are the sectors that are relatively immune from the effects of the pandemic and have strong earnings growth. \n\nFWIW, this is my portfoliio from the largest position down to the smallest: MSFT, WING,TWLO, UNH, CRM, TTWO, HON, CSCO,V, AEP, AMZN, SWKS, BX, HD, REGN, NVDA, AAPL, EEM, VZ, JPM, NFLX.\n\nIn addition, about 8% is presently in cash. My strategy is to tend to sell strength and buy weakness. YTD return is more than 6.5%.",

Look at SWKS or SKM if you want a legit 5g play that might still be a little under the radar).",
