The real question of their growth comes from their Foundry platform which caters toward the commercial sector. The investor day video mentioned that they are slowly decreasing the time it takes to integrate their software into a new company. This is promising because it's been said that each new application of the software into a new company is somewhat a new build in itself.\n\nI think that those who've actually worked with the software have the most credibility since they can speak to its effectiveness. I've never worked with the software, but I like the idea of being able to run a business around it. I don't think it'll ever be as ubiquitous as Microsoft Office since the price and effort to start is pretty damn high.\n\nTheir real obstacle is trying to get more companies to hop onboard. With the controversy behind the history of the company, that remains to be seen. Since Palantir is the subject of frequent controversy, the \"bad\" press could serve as catalysts for the stock. I could give a fuck what the software is used for, I just see that it works and has potential to grow.\n\nIMO, I don't think either bear or bull can predict this one. I started a small position (200 shares at $10.00) and will probably buy more as it dips.",

This matters because Microsoft needs to win consumers over this November. The last generation of Xbox had poor quality exclusive games which led to Sony acquiring the lion's share of consumers for their PS4 due to their strong exclusive games. This will roll over onto the next generation this fall with Sony showing strong exclusives and backwards compatibility.

People who have spent years on here in this ridiculous quest to find \"THE NEXT BIG SHORT\" (because the movie made people apparently think it was easy peasy) rather than look for what to invest in. Rather than useful, productive discussions to generate ideas on what to invest in, there have been tons of \"ARE STUDENT LOANS THE NEXT BIG SHORT?\" No. \"HOW ABOUT....?\"  and incessant, low/no effort attempts at top calling over the years.\n\n\". Or maybe it\u2019s not actually a bubble and thats just a buzzphrase that\u2019s meant to scare people?\"\n\nIt's become over-used in this sub to the point of absurdity. This sub is basically a circle of bearishness - certain at the bottom (December 2018, March) that the market is going \"much lower\", upset at the market at the start of the rebound (April and May of this year) and now the bubble discussions again.\n\n\"I just don\u2019t see how we can have such an awareness of the tech bubble\"\n\nTech can get ahead of itself. It has multiple times in the last few years (I think has again, although this crisis has IMO resulted in people being more reliant upon tech and I think a lot of that reliance sticks after this crisis eventually ends) and there have been significant rotations at times out of tech. If one took these rotations as confirmation of their bias that \"SEE? ITS A BUBBLE!\" they missed out on what were buying opportunities.\n\nAlso I don't know that there's this massive awareness aside from this sub where people are often looking for any excuse to be bearish.",

        "body": "That is when factors that Nikola can't control come into effect. Their positioning on everything I think is to prop stock price until then, which used to include the now canceled Nikola World. \n\nThings that happen in Dec.\n\n1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. \n2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.\n\nQuarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. \n\nRest is storytime:\n\nIf this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.\nSell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. \n\nSo how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the \"new management\" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. \n\nSo the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:\n\nhttps://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98\n\nOkay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.\n\nFantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.\n\nBut there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.\n\nNow we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone. \n\nI know that was long story time. But if you believe they are fraud, then think about what you would need to do if you knew it was a fraud and had millions locked up and you wanted out with out seeing the inside of a jail cell.",

Once your cash heavy and people start to question you, take that cash and \u201cpartner\u201d with reputable names. GM and CNH Industrials are, to my understanding, just providing services. Now if nikola admitted that they don\u2019t have the expertise to build what they promised, they would be done with. \n\nThe trick is to call these contracted companies \u201cpartners\u201d.  Partner suggests a joint venture where both parties are contributing to a mutually beneficial goal. In the case of Nikola, the \u201cpartners\u201d have no skin in the game, if Nikola folded tomorrow, all they would lose is a paycheck for services. Now if your a contractor working for another company, you\u2019d be stupid to admit there is a problem publicly, so these companies express optimism knowing they have nothing to lose. All this builds investors confidence as the house of cards keeps being built.\n\nI could be wrong, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what this is. I am short Nikola.",

The fed successfully destroyed the concept of a savings account being viable in 12 years.\n\nBut there is something even more sinister which crippled people's pocketbooks.

IIRC only stores in the NE and west coast have places that offer those anymore. Price matching is dead at Walmart. Companies like qoutient used to offer 300 plus printable coupons and now barely carry 100. Some of it has gone digital, but in a decade grocery stores have basically killed any type of deal shopping by the masses and instead have pivoted to selling more expensive products through better marketing.\n\nJust goes to show you how there can be a gradual trend over years that can erode buying power.\n\nI used to see people in front of me in line with a coupon coupons here and there, now it's more cartful of stuff and insert credit card.

        "body": "That is when factors that Nikola can't control come into effect. Their positioning on everything I think is to prop stock price until then, which used to include the now canceled Nikola World. \n\nThings that happen in Dec.\n\n1. The GM contract has to be finalized by Dec 3. \n2. Lots of share lockups end in December as well.\n\nQuarterly reports don't mean shit for them. Everyone already knows they don't make money and don't expect to make money anytime soon. \n\nRest is storytime:\n\nIf this company is a fraud here is what the insiders want to do.\nSell their investment with out losing money or getting caught up in legal battles for fraud. \n\nSo how do you do this? Your shares are locked up until December. Therefore you want stock price to stay as high as possible until you can. But you can't come out and double down on fraud; currently Trevor Milton is the fraudster at the center of the story and you are an unlucky defrauded investor. Definitely don't want the \"new management\" to also get caught up in the narrative that they are lying about capabilities which is what got you into this mess in the first place. When you sell out you also don't want to be in the cross hairs for legal repercussions. You just need out and your bare minimum goal is not at a loss. \n\nSo the first thing you do is change the narrative, maybe release some kind of new management plan. Scrub everything related to the impossible promises from trevor milton. Maybe something like:\n\nhttps://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-executing-strategy-and-vision-to-deliver-innovative-technology-energy-and-transportation-solutions-98\n\nOkay. Interesting, look at that. Nikola One and Two are completely gone, badger isn't mentioned. Completely focus on the only thing that might actually exist, the 'Tre' (which was built and designed by another company). Make a timeline 2+ years out where everything important to the core value of the company starts to happen. So far out no more questions on that. Great now you don't have to showcase anything in the near future. No fuel cells, no nothing other than a battery truck with the 'Tre'; also primarily in Germany/Europe. Also decouple yourself with GM expectations.\n\nFantastic, you have now set yourself up to deliver nothing from now until when you can sell your shares other than show a working 'Tre' which was already built by someone else. And announce a hydrogen partnership (keyword announce a possible partnership, not do anything). Throw in a little disclaimer at the bottom that all of these deliverables depend on market conditions. Awesome. You just stabilized the discussion around what your company does into speculation, away from fraud and you don't have to prove anything that has been contested before you can sell your shares. Also you have removed the wild claims and have a luke warm timeline focused around the 'Tre'. SO when you walk away, you haven't defrauded anyone. When nikola becomes a shitty company with their single crappy BeV truck the 'Tre' that is exactly what you just timelined out for people.\n\nBut there is still one more thorn in your side. Nikola world. Promised in december to hype up prices, but needs to have deliverables. They promised to show off al this awesome shit like the One the Two the Tre and the Badger. Plus some other hydrogen shit and software. Fucking problem we have here mate, we just excluded all of that shit from our new management plan and we clearly don't have any of it. What do? Cancel Nikola world. Perfect.\n\nNow we have sell in December, there is no narrative or defending tervors fraud. And when this company becomes a one trick pony with just the 'Tre' or they try to pivot to a commercial hydrogen provider, we haven't defrauded anyone. \n\nI know that was long story time. But if you believe they are fraud, then think about what you would need to do if you knew it was a fraud and had millions locked up and you wanted out with out seeing the inside of a jail cell.",

The thing is that somebody tickle with what inflation or deflation is gonna do down the road or keep rates 0% for the next 3 years, you gotta give me a break with that. And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted. I just wish he would back away from financial markets, because that is not going to be about real economy and employers and employee. Not him tinkering with printing money and buying APPL bonds.\n\nHe is not wrong though.",

There is a reason they have already been able to enforce the patents against random Chinese companies.\n\nDon't believe me? Lets look at what happened when Google Waymo, one of the largest companies in the world, tried to sue Uber for LIDAR patent infringement:\n\n[https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html](https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) **rejected 53 out of 56 claims in Waymo's 936 patent**...One of the reasons for the rejection is that some of the core design solutions were **previously patented by another lidar manufacturer, Velodyne**. Coincidentally, Velodyne used to sell its lidars to Waymo before the latter decided to build a product of its own from scratch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Theoretically, **Velodyne could now accuse Waymo of infringing its own 558 patent**, based on the USPTO's recent ruling.",

So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now.

The company filed bankruptcy and as part of the restructuring dropped their outstanding shares into warrants, at a conversion of 2.5%. The warrants are good for three years for the new ticker, DEN. Long story short, the company fucked you big time. Turned your shares into shit, restructured, launched new shares at around $17 a share and now have a shit ton of cash and you have a warrant for the new stock. Good luck. \n\nPlus side, the warrants are up 96% premarket today, told you to buy the dip....lol",

With portfolio margin u can mitigate risk a lot better, as you essentially have a lot more buying power, but this requires over $125k in ur account. TSLA had an incredible up move earlier this year, but only if u stubbornly held ur naked call at least 3 days without mitigating risk steadily would u have taken a massive loss. \n\nI mainly sell premium whenever IV gets absurdly high and i sell around 20-35% chance ITM. 1st day it moves against me I let it ride, and 2nd day if I don't see good movement the way i want, and it is continuing against me, i'll roll if it's close to expiration and trend seems weak, or will take a strict loss otherwise. Winner are 100% profit max, and I generally go for 50-90% profit, so ideally you want to cut losers at no more than 50-90% loss. Maybe 5% of the time you get a 500% loser overnight on news and it's usually best to take the loss sooner than later. Go for a quick dead cat bounce / 9 EMA retrace or sell immediately.\n\nMy best bought calls are far OTM long term 3-15 month calls on steady upward momentum tech stocks I strongly believe in. I think most people need to learn this side first before selling naked calls. \n\nMy best naked call sales are in the 1-6 week period on meme stonks where IV has reached such a high level that buying an ATM call now costs 4-10x what it did recently. I sold calls and bought put spreads on TSLA 3 times this year, when it first hit $950, $1550, and $500 post split. All three I recognized the IV was relatively high, hourly upward momentum was cooling off, there was an overnight gap up to fill, 1000/1500/500 are nice round numbers to take profits at, and price level felt very unstable. \n\nI'm selling calls and have puts on ZM and SNOW right now, both are extremely overvalued at 100x revenue and I would definitely be taking profits at these levels.",

        "body": "&gt; My understanding is that there was a housing bubble in 2008, but nobody really knew about it until it was too late. (Side note: I\u2019ll be straight with you, my \u201cunderstanding\u201d of this comes from The Big Short).\n\nThat's oversimplified.  Lots of people knew that housing was overpriced.  The issue was not that housing was overpriced but that tranches of higher quality housing bonds could get destroyed.  That was what many (but not everyone) failed to see.  Moreover it was difficult to bet against (as the movie demonstrates) so you had to be committed and skillful to be on the other side.\n\nIf you mean middle class investors they often didn't realize that housing could crash.  The USA hadn't ever experienced a gerahousing\n\n&gt; With this tech bubble, it seems like everybody knows about it.\n\nIn term of \"the tech bubble\" a better comparison might be the 1990s.  But let's be clear 3 things are going on all at once.  \n\n\n1)  Bond yields are very low which means stocks are higher than they would be with higher interest rates.  This should and does benefit growth stocks more than value stocks.  Many of big tech names are growth stocks, companies like: Dell, Intel, Samsung are value.  \n\n2)  People from 2008 are freaked out about issues of underlying quality.  So quality stocks are benefiting (low debt...).  I don't think investors are correct on this one (I'm tilting against quality) but I understand the rationale for overpaying for quality.  Essentially quality stocks are effectively a lot let risky when there are concerns about deflationary recession and the possibility for inflationary strong growth at the same time while most other assets won't do nearly as well.  Many tech names have excellent quality: low/no  debt, cash on hand, few physical assets, sticky reoccurring revenue, ability to reduce costs quickly...\n\n3)  There are some tech stocks trading at insane multiples large enough to boost the entire sector if you are doing something like cap weighting.\n\n&gt;  Seems kind of unlikely to me that everybody is sitting around investing their money in tech knowing that it\u2019s a large bubble that will eventually pop. \n\nInvestors frequently buy terrible assets thinking that they will get out before others.  When investors stop making a case for discounted value of future dividends or earnings yield and instead start talking in terms of market action and short term price moves they open the door to lots of people playing hot potato.  \n\nTake TSLA.  TSLA is currently valued at $400b.  If we assume that profits of Tesla will be factored back into the business and stock trades at a P/E of 20 with a 10% margin on their batter business 20 years from now... we do some math.  To get a 14% return (given the risk not unreasonable) Tesla would need to be a $5.5t company selling $2.75t a year in batteries.  Does that seem likely?  Does anyone believe that scenario?  \n\nIf you buy quality assets at a good price you'll do fine.  If you buy overpriced assets and hold for a very long time you'll do worse than you should but still OK.  If you buy overpriced assets watch them decline, grind through it for a decade and then sell you will lose a lot.  Investing isn't easy which is why everyone will recommend discipline.",

People who have spent years on here in this ridiculous quest to find \"THE NEXT BIG SHORT\" (because the movie made people apparently think it was easy peasy) rather than look for what to invest in. Rather than useful, productive discussions to generate ideas on what to invest in, there have been tons of \"ARE STUDENT LOANS THE NEXT BIG SHORT?\" No. \"HOW ABOUT....?\"  and incessant, low/no effort attempts at top calling over the years.\n\n\". Or maybe it\u2019s not actually a bubble and thats just a buzzphrase that\u2019s meant to scare people?\"\n\nIt's become over-used in this sub to the point of absurdity. This sub is basically a circle of bearishness - certain at the bottom (December 2018, March) that the market is going \"much lower\", upset at the market at the start of the rebound (April and May of this year) and now the bubble discussions again.\n\n\"I just don\u2019t see how we can have such an awareness of the tech bubble\"\n\nTech can get ahead of itself. It has multiple times in the last few years (I think has again, although this crisis has IMO resulted in people being more reliant upon tech and I think a lot of that reliance sticks after this crisis eventually ends) and there have been significant rotations at times out of tech. If one took these rotations as confirmation of their bias that \"SEE? ITS A BUBBLE!\" they missed out on what were buying opportunities.\n\nAlso I don't know that there's this massive awareness aside from this sub where people are often looking for any excuse to be bearish.",

And I gotta tell you, nobody is asking JPow one question that I would be asking if I was in FOMC press conference. So Mr. Powell, if the markets drop 10%, would you just print another $10TN, what number would you go to, what number is high enough for you? And nobody is asking that question. And that is the big worry. He can never ever rollback what he is doing now. If he today just said I am gonna stop printing money, Dow would be down a thousand points and that is what I mean by markets being addicted. I just wish he would back away from financial markets, because that is not going to be about real economy and employers and employee. Not him tinkering with printing money and buying APPL bonds.\n\nHe is not wrong though.",

Lets look at what happened when Google Waymo, one of the largest companies in the world, tried to sue Uber for LIDAR patent infringement:\n\n[https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html](https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-waymo-self-driving-lidar-patent-infringement-uber-velodyne.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) **rejected 53 out of 56 claims in Waymo's 936 patent**...One of the reasons for the rejection is that some of the core design solutions were **previously patented by another lidar manufacturer, Velodyne**. Coincidentally, Velodyne used to sell its lidars to Waymo before the latter decided to build a product of its own from scratch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Theoretically, **Velodyne could now accuse Waymo of infringing its own 558 patent**, based on the USPTO's recent ruling.",
