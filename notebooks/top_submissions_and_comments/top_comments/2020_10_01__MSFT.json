        "body": "Which part specifically? How companies manage cash deposits, the way revenue is taxed depending on where profit is booked, or the actual purchase of Mojang?\n\nEdit: happy to answer any of the points as much as I'm possible to.\n\n**Cash management:**\n\nCash is held by companies in the countries in which they book profit. We'll cover that in more detail later. To move cash is hard, and expensive. If you move cash from country A to country B you open yourself up to be taxed on that new arrival of cash in country B, either as income, or additional wealth. If country B has unfavourable tax rates then that can be a problem. How and why do they accumulate cash in a variety of countries...\n\n**Transfer Pricing:**\n\nLet's say you make a product in country A, it costs $1 to make. Country A has a tax rate on corporate income of 50%. That's bad. Country B has a tax rate of corporate income of 10%. That's good. If you make $10 profit in both countries, you keep $5 in A, and $9 in B. So, it is advantageous to make as much profit in country B as possible, and make less profit in country A. How do you make profit in country B for a product made and sold in country A? Transfer pricing.\n\nSetup a company (CA) in country A making your product. Setup another company (CB) in country B. Company CA makes a product for $1, sells it to Company CB for $2, and company CB sells it to the consumer for $10. What you've just done is transfer the profit of the sale to country B instead of country A.\n\n* Country A had a product made for $1, sold for $2. Profit before tax: $1, tax paid $0.50, net profit $0.50\n\n* Country B bought a product for $2, sold for $10. Profit before tax: $8, tax paid $0.80, net profit $7.20\n\n* Total cash in: $7.70\n\nIf you had made it in country A, and sold it in country A with no transfer price you would have come off worse.\n\n* Made for $1, sold for $10. Profit before tax: $9, tax paid $4.50, total cash in: $4.50\n\nOn a single product you generated $3.20 more in cash by moving the cash to country B.\n\nThere are all sorts of legal restrictions on what transfer pricing is fair, depending on the country and governments. It is why tax havens exist, and lots of companies have shell companies in those tax havens. Companies have been taken to task by implementing huge tax-avoiding strategies through this method. One good example is Starbucks, who ship the beans around the world but through complex chains of companies retain the profit in the lowest tax regions. Amazon does the same, Google too, Microsoft, Apple, you name it.\n\nIf you're into corporate finance, which probably 0.000000000000% (rounded up) of you are, the site [tpcases.com](https://tpcases.com/) is an interesting read. It has loads of news and articles on this kind of tax minimisation strategy.\n\n**Mojang Purchase**\n\nSo, you've accumulated a ton of money in a tax favourable country or countries, how do you spend it back in country A with high taxes? You either declare the income in country A, and move the money, then pay an awful lot of tax. Or, alternatively, you keep the cash offshore, and use it for things with lower tax rates than moving it back to country A.\n\nMicrosoft's policy for some time, at least the mid 2010s has been to use their offshore reserves to purchase companies outside of the reach of American taxes, and other higher tax countries.\n\nAround the time they bought Mojang they were doing the same to a lot of other companies. It's a good use of your huge cash deposits, effectively saving the difference between purchase price and the tax you would have paid. It is effectively a discount on the price of whatever asset you're buying. By spending the cash you have strategically, you can minimise the costs associated with that spending, and companies generally would like to reduce to a sustainable level the amount of cash they keep on hand. Sitting on cash does not generate income like investing it, in products, assets, anything that generates revenue above terrible interest rates or secure investments in markets which are generally very risk averse for companies and so have little potential upside.\n\nFor this reason companies keep cash in a variety of places, ready to be used (or transferred elsewhere) for things like this. In a perfect world they would bring it all back in to e.g. America (or other HQ country) but this would bring with a need to declare it, have it audited and taxed, and companies try to minimise that as much as possible.\n\nAny more questions I'm happy to try and help, depending on when I read it.",

I asked Amber if they had any sponsors when I was concerned about where the prize money was coming from. It was answered with crickets.\n\n5. Chat was filled with nothing but racist epitates, political noise, and sexual innuendo on every game. Who is going to want to sponsor that?\n\n6. Again, who is going to pay to advertise here? Avg of 600-700 players and the company has admitted many of those are bots. No one is going to pay to advertise to the members of /r/clis\n\n7. A knowledge member described exactly how such a hack could take place and what a rookie programming mistake it was. Doesn't inspire confidence when providing a company with my personal information.\n\n8. Probably but hasn't.\n\n9. When I'm investing my money yes I expect the company to be able to monetize at launch. On launch you could purchase coins, cancel the purchase and still keep the coins. Now there is no option at all. I stand by the fact that no one in their right mind will purchase coins. If the top 50 get paid and 100 out of 600 players get 10/10 in an insane time removing wrong answers won't help someone win. Even if they got the answer right they couldn't do it fast enough.They have had nothing but empty promises.\n\n10. The first game I got 4th for $48. Withdrew to PayPal that night and have received zero dollars. I am aware every player was told they won money that first game (another flaw) but I actually did and have the screenshot.\n\nI firmly believe we as retail investors should look out for each other. That's what this sub is about. Calling out good opportunities and warning about bad ones.\n\nIf you want to diamond hands and hold them good on you I hope it goes to the moon. I think it's headed the opposite way and would like to provide information to others that might help them.\n\nMy post is not about hurting CLIS, it's about sharing information to retail investors like myself. I've made a lot of money on /r/pennystocks because people can share information.",

No I don\u2019t know when the next ER will come out. \n\nSomeone should really ask the CEO how shares go up when they\u2019re buying back.
