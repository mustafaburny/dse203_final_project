They are still the gold standard in that space which is huge in any cloud based computing platform. But they might not grow as much with AMD looking better.\n\nThat being said a safer long term bet, as well as just a good indicator of the tech industry in general I'd look at the analog semiconductors such as ADI and TXN. Their stock maybe suffering from some overinflation as well, but the last five years both stocks have been generally moving upwards. With more Boomer ran industries such as Industrials/Automotive/and Medical industries are starting to invest heavily in \"electrifying\" their industries so analog semiconductors are now breaking into new markets at high rates. Also in the next couple years ADI will aquire Maxim, which is the combination of the second and third largest analog semiconductor companies. \n\nAlso even the Intel and AMD chips need supporting circuitry which analog semiconductors still use.\n\nAlso because how sales work in that industry, a decrease in semiconductors typically precedes a decrease in the tech market. \n\nFor short term gain I think semiconductors aren't the best play, these industries typically grow but can be hard to pin down in short term.\n\nI'm waiting for a pullback, because I don't think we are out of the woods of a recession yet. And if it does I'm going to try to pick up stock and maybe some longer term options about ATM for a decent chance at profit because a yearly decline in semiconductors is pretty strange (INTC is still above a year ago even though they have done pretty bad as far as semis go in the last few months)\n\nSource: I work in the Semiconductor industry.",
