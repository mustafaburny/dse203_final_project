For example i have been buying BMY and ABBV on a 30% discount (3.5% and 5.5% dividend respectively). But also stocks with a lot of growth potential like ENPH and LRCX. I am not done buying so whenever they get cheaper I spill in some more. These are not recommendations but stocks I have found potential in. \n\nGood thing about dividend stocks is that they tend to have a more stable price and not swing down that much.",
