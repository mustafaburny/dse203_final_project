I am not done buying so whenever they get cheaper I spill in some more. These are not recommendations but stocks I have found potential in. \n\nGood thing about dividend stocks is that they tend to have a more stable price and not swing down that much.",

Just the tip, lmao, am I right, famma-lam?\n\nBut before we get started, make sure to *smaaaaaaash* that Like button, tap the ass of that Subscribe button, and ring that notification bell. [Doorbell chime sound.]\n\nToday\u2019s stock of the day is an old-school stock called Enron. A lot of old ass motherfuckers used to make bank on this shit in the late 90s and the early 2000s, I guess during the Vietnam War or some shit. Anyway, this shit was lit, they had dope ass energy products and MA BOI Kenneth Lay is the CEO! His fucking last name is **LAY**! So you know my boi KL lays more pipe than just oil pipelines. He\u2019s probably getting *all* the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders pregnant.\n\nSo that brings us to tip 2. Before you invest in a company, always look at the CEO. If he looks like a fuckin\u2019 nerd, **left swipe that bitch**. But if he\u2019s a dope-ass motherfucker with a bangin\u2019 name? Back up the truck, and get ready to make a buck.\n\nAlright that\u2019s all the tips I got for you right now. I\u2019mma bout to to hit the bong and trade some Tesla and Carnival Cruise options.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to sign up for Battle Legends using my affiliate code. You\u2019ll get 65,000 gold coins.

I don't plan on buying travel or much of retail for example, but I do want to hear what they have to say.

Don\u2019t be afraid of a drop just average costs if it drops dramatically. \n\n- Adobe should do well with this stay at home. School is requiring the use as well as businesses from home. \n\n- Amazon is essentially showing its untouchable currently. I\u2019m large into amazon as well. \n\n- Disney is another powerhouse that you\u2019ll never need to worry about. The lost revenues over the following 8 months could cause a dramatic drop, in this scenario don\u2019t panic and average your cost. \n\n- Enph - energy, I\u2019m not familiar with this company. \n\n- Facebook is another powerhouse good pick. \n\n- Google - Great pick. \n\n- MasterCard is also a good pick, hold this. Average if it comes down to although you shouldn\u2019t have to they trade rather high. If you\u2019re at a major loss with their recent decline. Average in the next 3 months when there\u2019s a better understanding how financials will deal with crisis. (You shouldn\u2019t need to) \n\n- Microsoft - I love microsoft. They are on a tear currently. Teams daily usage is up 12 million users in the last month, this is major. Their competition is \u201cwork\u201d slack technologies who I am also Long. \n\n- Netflix has been great good pick. \n\n- Nike is a great pick. I could expand but they\u2019ve always done well. Constant increase throughout the life of their stock. \n\n- Nvidia is a powerhouse as well. Great pick. \n\n- Starbucks is great. I haven\u2019t followed them through the virus but they\u2019re a strong company large capital, their profits are also great. Good pick. \n\n- Square I like square a lot. Square has major potential in different avenues. Cash app, lending (they just got approved to lend during this time). Prior to the virus square was on a tear. I\u2019m long on this I got in early and am very big on square. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in diversification:\n\nAll that being said you really are big into tech, I would suggest diversification. \n\n\u201cOxy\u201d - occidental petroleum is a good long term stock. They\u2019re trading extremely low currently due to oil wars, corona virus, issues on the board and the purchase of anadarko. (This scares a lot of investors but you seem to want long term investments) it\u2019s a steal at 15$ a share. \n\n- Johnson and Johnson is a powerhouse. \n\n- Jet blue &amp; Delta - long term great investments. Short term extremely risky. \n\n- Walmart: trading high but they\u2019re only going to go even higher when this is over. \n\n- AT&amp;T and Verizon: AT&amp;T trades fairly low with a large dividend. GREAT LONG TERM. Verizon has been extremely strong throughout the years.  \n\n- Ford on the long term has a lot of upside trading around half of its average price. Ford pays dividend and  history has proven America will never let ford fail. \n\n- USO is an ETF that tracks United States Oil, It\u2019s trading extremely low, no reason not to diversify with this. ( The oil war between Saudi and Russia is coming to an end, this should do well in the long term) \n\n- Have you put any though into mutual funds to also diversify ? A good managed funds typically has large returns and low risk. \n\nReach out to me if you\u2019d like.",

Although the entire industry is getting raped and most of them are not getting any government bailout, still Carnival owns almost 50% of the market and financially the most stable one. Now, plenty of other similar companies will go out of business this year or next and if Carnival manages to pull this through they have the opportunity to increase their market share way above 50%. \n\nThis is a long play and not without risks and I don't like cruises so will not go for it.\n\nOther than this I believe technology stocks which provide cloud services or the infrastructure/hardware to it will remain in high demand (Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google) or companies with loyal and huge fan base (Apple) are safe bet. I also like Applied Materials, basically they're providers to semiconductor manufacturers equipment and technology wise. \n\nI'm personally also looking at Visa, Mastercard and Paypal as they still have plenty of growth potential as I see still many developed countries are relying on payment with cash.",

Had been hesitant to invest because the market seemed bloated, but now could be a good time to get in. \n\nNo debt, getting married in next 12 months, buying house in next 12-18 months. Will keep funds for wedding, down payment, closing costs, furniture/upgrades and 6 month emergency fund as cash. \n\nSeparate from those funds, my financial picture is basically 1/3 401k (target date fund), and 2/3 cash. I want to put that cash in the market over the next few weeks/months. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\n\\- Reallocate 401k to more growth oriented funds to ride back up over the next couple years. \n\n\\- Invest the cash 50% in ETFs, 50% in individual stocks. \n\n\\- ETFs: 1/3 QQQ (tech heavy, tracks to NASDAQ), 1/3 MTUM (momentum companies, mainly S&amp;P), 1/3 LGLV (large cap low volatility, mainly DJI). I feel like these 3 give a good swath of the market while being able to outperform it. \n\n\\- Sotcks:  5 low risk: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, MA, V. 5 medium risk: SBUX, MCD, JPM, DEO, DIS. 5 higher risk: MGM, SYY, YUM, MAR, FANG. Will have to keep a close eye on those last 5 before jumping in. \n\nQuestions:\n\n\\- It's best to keep my down payment and emergency fund as cash, right? Will need it in 12-18 months. \n\n\\- What do you think of those ETFs/Stocks? Both overall allocation and individual picks?\n\n\\- Other things I should be investing in other than stock market? \n\nAppreciate it folks!",

Exp: 4/9 Reason I did a spread and not naked was due to lack of capital at time being.\n\nI'm new to TA but wanted to try using what seem to be the most intuitive indicators for me - RSI, VWAP, and 50/200 MA.\n\n**My DD**\n\nWhen I entered the position, RSI seemed good but has gone up to 56 now, so that's got me a little bit worried.\n\nHowever, APT has crossed and come over the 50MA line 3 times in the last 5 days, which I read now as a support rather than a distance. It has also directly bounced off the 200MA which is good to see as well.\n\nMarket EOD was $18.xx or so, but VWAP is around $15\\~. Perhaps a good entry tomorrow for a long position will be if it returns to VWAP, but regarding the explosiveness and nature of the stock I'm also debating just buying ASAP with expiry for next week.\n\nAs for the strike price I'm looking at, I'm looking at around $25/26, which is where it peaked last time in early march.\n\n**Sentiment** \\- Talks about Americans getting used to the idea of having to wear masks. The thing is 3M, DuPont, etc. make PPE (personal protection equipment) but really APT has been sort of the front man of that for a while now. \n\nWith fear going to spike up again this week, I think it'll be good to get in and take a long. Plus volume was only 20 million today, so hasn't been \"discovered\" by the media yet. \n\nAny tips/advice for a newbie would be very beneficial.",

That requirement fundamentally means that every node everywhere has to constantly consume 5-20mbps of incoming transaction data, 24/7/365 and that's assuming no significant growth in transaction volumes.\n\nEven with aggressive pruning of transactions, the volume of data to accurately summarize the net worth of 7 billion people plus their various businesses, teams, organizations, accounts and otherwise would be extraordinary (trillions of transactions, at least - possibly a petabyte of data).\n\nIn the current blockchain concept, any transactions that have any significant notable value to the network have to be recorded on this chain, or they can't be verified.  Concepts like lightening network on bitcoin can \"shard\" some of this off, but these side transactions are fundamentally unverified, and the money used in them is fundamentally locked out of the main wallet of anyone using these channels, making them practical for certain activities (say, buying some gum), but impractical for something like transacting your rent, or any other dollar value that you value.\n\nSome concepts of more broad global sharding of the main chain exist, but under \"proof of work\" that doesn't really work well without establishing \"trusted nodes\" to referee the sharding and that doesn't make the decentralization proponents happy.\n\nIt's probably possible to design something, maybe using a proof of stake system with stakeholders pooled into smaller shards, but that runs a greater risk of having network takeovers, unless you have a referee system that patrols for large movements of stakeholders into shards in order to pool stakes and subvert the voting system for monetary gain.\n\nIt's not a solved problem and no platform currently exists that could plausibly take over world currency transactions, or even a smaller credit card player like Discover, in terms of size and volume.\n\nProof of work, in my opinion, is a poor tech and while I play in crypto as a speculative instrument, I view it like a penny stock in a worthless industry from a true fundamentals perspective.\n\nBut that's just my educated opinion.",

        "body": "Here\u2019s my analysis of the market from a technical and fundamental perspective. On the TA side, the stochastic momentum indicator on the daily candlestick chart is showing that bullish momentum is slowing down. Furthermore, the more damning indications are the fact that the S&amp;P failed to break above the 20 daily MA when reaching it and also failed to break through the 38.2% fib retracement level at 2640 at least three separate times which was also where Friday\u2019s high was around. \n\nFrom the fundamental side I believe that focus is shifting from the stimulus bill and relief actions(which was a big driver in last week\u2019s gains) and the market will instead start pricing in the rapidly growing amount of COVID cases as well as the extended lockdown of the economy. This will only be exacerbated once financial reports start coming out for companies and the true damage is revealed. We also have the weekly jobless claims report tm(with a projected figure of 4 million) and the unemployment rate on Friday(which is projected to be around 3.7%). I believe that all of this will drive price down to test the lows and possibly break below them. Things are only gonna get worse for at least a month but we may start seeing a recovery at the end of April or in May. This is just my analysis though, if anyone wants to chime in with their own opinion I\u2019d love to hear it!",
