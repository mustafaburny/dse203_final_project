This might cause some shift though it may not be drastic. A lot of factors go into this. The biggest one I tend to see is people don't set up their space to be a hybrid work/live place. They just do work where they usually entertain (living room/couch, on their laptop) and this leads to much faster burnout because you can easily work too much, or get easily distracted and struggle with focus because you're giving your mind mixed signals. It's been very important to me to have an office space, whether that's a dedicated desk in a living room or a completely dedicated office in the house. With the right setup I think working from home is fantastic and most people would probably enjoy it, but with the wrong setup most are going to get very tired of it and want to go back to an office asap. So in my opinion we won't see a \"plummet\" but there will likely be some noticeable effect from workers who got in the right cadence and prefer working at home.",
