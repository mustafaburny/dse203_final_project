This might cause some shift though it may not be drastic. A lot of factors go into this. The biggest one I tend to see is people don't set up their space to be a hybrid work/live place. They just do work where they usually entertain (living room/couch, on their laptop) and this leads to much faster burnout because you can easily work too much, or get easily distracted and struggle with focus because you're giving your mind mixed signals. It's been very important to me to have an office space, whether that's a dedicated desk in a living room or a completely dedicated office in the house. With the right setup I think working from home is fantastic and most people would probably enjoy it, but with the wrong setup most are going to get very tired of it and want to go back to an office asap. So in my opinion we won't see a \"plummet\" but there will likely be some noticeable effect from workers who got in the right cadence and prefer working at home.",

Both of these companies make the float glass, temper it, and then put it in laminated frames. They they sell this glass to companies like JELD that puts it in framesand then sells it to the consumer for residential projects. For larger projects contractors buy this glass to put it in buildings they are building.\n\nPPG doesn't even make glass anymore. They only make paint. Their glass sector looks like it was bought by Vitro and is traded on MXN.\n\nYou literally have corning in there. They make specialty glass as in glass that does not go in commercial or residential buildings.",

One of my positions I sold was a bunch of GLW 24c that I had bought at 0.11 and sold at 0.5. On Friday those calls dropped down to 0.22. I wanted to buy back in but I couldn\u2019t. Now they\u2019re at over 0.6. If I hadn\u2019t been so stupid I could\u2019ve already tripled my money. Instead I\u2019m sitting in cash, unable to buy, shedding a tear for missed tendies.",
