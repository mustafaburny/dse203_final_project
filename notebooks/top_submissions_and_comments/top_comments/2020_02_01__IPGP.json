Broke one of my rules and didn\u2019t take profits to re-roll (It\u2019s so close to 950! 10% day!) and watched them slowly bleed. Had a small recovery near EOD though with tesla and nvda calls. (Praise NVDA)\n\nI made a goal of $30k by end of Feb. a couple weeks ago on here, so I can\u2019t be mad about hitting that on an 11% day though. Still holding tesla and nvda calls (3/6a and 3/20s) too, as well as the usuals like MSFT and AAPL. New goal is $35k by end of Feb.\n\nThank you for attending my WSB diary.
