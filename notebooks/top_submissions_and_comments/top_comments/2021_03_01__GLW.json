I usually look for ones 25% below where they have been in the past \\~2 years.\n\nLow debt\n\nPast growth, starting. to turn the corning again  on revenue - maybe hit by covid. \n\nIf they talk about the stock a lot on CNBC in the morning shows it is probably too late. In general CNBC only talks about large stocks so mid and small caps are generally what I end up with. Generally you can follow the trends they talk about Industrials, etc.\n\nPick what's next not what's happening now.\n\nMaybe pick up a couple Banks or Reits below book value - that are improving or their is a reason they will improve (opening economy)",

This uniquely positions Lumen to meet the needs of companies seeking highly reliable, low-latency network infrastructure designed to move massive amounts of data.\u201d\n\nThe first phase of this overbuild fiber network, completed in June 2019, connects more than 50 major cities throughout the U.S. and represents another powerful asset in Lumen\u2019s vast global fiber-optic network, which includes a purpose-built long-haul network and dense metro networks designed to stay ahead of the growing data demand. The second phase of this expansion will include areas in Europe and will be completed by early 2021. The expanded infrastructure, using the latest optical innovations from Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW), will enhance performance levels across Lumen\u2019s network, benefiting businesses, government agencies and providers seeking fiber to build their own secure, scalable networks for demanding next-generation applications.\n\nThis project uses Corning\u2019s SMF-28\u00ae ULL fiber and SMF-28\u00ae Ultra fiber in a hybrid Corning\u00ae SST-UltraRibbon\u2122 cable. With a silica core design, SMF-28 ULL fiber offers the lowest loss of any terrestrial-grade optical fiber and will provide the CenturyLink network with a boost in optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) which can extend optical reach at very high data rates. The added capacity will further improve the scalability of the network to meet the high bandwidth demands of emerging technologies and applications such as 5G, augmented reality, high-definition video streaming and the Internet of Things.\n\n\u201cA next-generation network requires next-generation optical infrastructure, and we believe Corning's fiber and cable innovations will enable Lumen and its customers to unlock the opportunities presented by the Internet of Things and other transformative technologies\" said Dr. Bernhard Deutsch, vice president and general manager, Corning Optical Fiber and Cable. \"With the expanded optical reach and capacity provided by our ultra-low-loss fiber, Lumen will magnify the capabilities of their expansive, scalable fiber network.\u201d\n\nLumen was able to quickly and cost effectively complete the first phase of the project using multi-conduit infrastructure already in place. The company is currently selling routes to large enterprise companies and content providers in the U.S. and will work with customers to add additional routes as needed.\n\nKey Facts:\n\nLumen is creating an extensive 4.7-million fiber mile intercity fiber network across the U.S. and parts of Europe.\nThe first phase, comprising 3.5 million fiber miles, was completed in June 2019.An additional 1.2 million fiber miles will be added by early 2021.\nLumen is currently selling fiber routes to large enterprise companies and content providers in the U.S.\nMulti-conduit infrastructure allows Lumen to quickly and economically deploy new fiber technology or    add network capacity as needed.\nThe expanded fiber network utilizes Corning\u2019s SMF-28\u00ae ULL fiber and SMF-28\u00ae Ultra fiber, creating the largest ultra-low-loss fiber network in North America.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n *See Lumen\u2019s expanded intercity network map:  http://filecache.mediaroom.com/mr5mr_century_link/183014/FiberMap_Update0719_FINAL.jpg\n\n *Hear Andrew Dugan explain the benefits of the fiber network expansion: http://origin-qps.onstreammedia.com/origin/multivu_archive/MNR/Century_Link_Dark_Fiber_Andrew_Dugan_Proof_v4.mp4\n\n *Learn more about CenturyLink Dark Fiber:  http://www.centurylink.com/business/networking/dark-fiber.html\n\n *Learn more about Corning\u2019s SMF-28\u00ae ULL fiber and SMF-28\u00ae Ultra fiber: https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/products/communication-networks/products/fiber/smf-28-ull.html\n\nAbout Lumen Technologies \n\nLumen Technologies is the second largest U.S. communications provider to global enterprise customers.
