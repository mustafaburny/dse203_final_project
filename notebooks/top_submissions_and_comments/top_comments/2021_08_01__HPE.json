Supposedly Agilent still treats their employees great.\n\nTheir gameplan is to make high quality stuff and sell it at fat margins to deep-pocketed customers. I work at a company that stacks their labs with Agilent gear, and as long as their quality stays high, I doubt we will move away from them. We also buy buckets of licenses for their software... it's an industry standard in our niche and we have a decade's worth of designs built on it.\n\nLike another poster said, it's a very anti-WSB play. Agilent's a company that has pretty much zero chance for explosive growth (their big customers are more or less fixed), but will keep making steady money. They have entrenched connections in the corporate world and will maintain those as long as they keep making good products. \n\nIf they slip on quality, they're going to find that building power suppliers and oscilloscopes isn't exactly rocket science, and someone else will slip into their high-end niche. But so far they've avoided the rot that took the rest of HP for 20 years.",

        "body": "\"Transitory\" is the market word of the year. Insofar as there being any hope of a recovery, the same could be asked of any company not running on all cylinders. It's not as if Intel is the only laggard company out there. If you are familiar with their product line, their plan ahead, and believe they have a way forward, then you have your investment thesis. And like any idea or plan, it may or may not pan out in the end. I personally think that Intel has drawn the ire of new retail investors as they have neither the momentum (as you indicate) nor the swagger that AMD and NVDA bring to the table. And it's standard these days for market dregs to put out the occasional hit piece on punching bags like Intel--see this article, for instance: [U.S. near deal for Nvidia supercomputer as it waits for delayed Intel machine](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-near-deal-nvidia-supercomputer-190754396.html), which beneath the headline and the typical punishment despite market-scale supply chain problems essentially says that the Intel machine will, in the end, be the better performing machine against AMD and NVDA for HPC purposes:\n&gt;The $500 million contract called for Intel and partners to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance, or the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second. Now, the first exascale computer in the United States will likely be a different machine at a different lab - Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee - built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co with chips from AMD expected to be delivered later this year. The Polaris machine at Argonne will not be as powerful as the Intel machine, the sources said. Based on Nvidia's A100 chips and AMD's Rome and Milan chips, the Polaris computer will be able to make some exaflop calculations but mostly work at slower speeds.\n\nI think Intel has a legitimate shot at building on what they have, and it is valued cheaply compared to peers on the belief of others that it doesn't. Even as a laggard in cutting-edge design, it enjoys regular business with the US government and provides HPC services and infrastructure. Outside of Gen-Z'ers and Millennials, I doubt the flair of AMD or NVDA will cut through the sticker shock when Intel components will do work just fine. To put it simply, I think rumors of Intel's demise have been greatly exaggerated. Top insiders at [Intel](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-intc/intel/news/who-has-been-buying-intel-corporation-nasdaqintc-shares) seem to be either holding or buying more of their own stock, save for tax/bill purposes. That runs counter to both [AMD](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-amd-insider-buying-and-selling-2021-08-2-3/) and [NVDA](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-nvda-insider-buying-and-selling-2021-08-2-3/), where there has been almost entirely insider sales since Q2 2019. It's clear that Intel insiders think their stock can be bought cheaply in the assumption of future appreciation, while its competitors are cashing in on their own holdings while the sun is shining brighter than ever. At the end of the day, you make your investment thesis and stick to a plan. Will this last? Or will things be a bit different 5 years from now?",
