They further had difficulties with Boeing 747 and the Tristar. But starting 1975, they both gained at least 10x by 1980\n- Hewlett-Packard had been solid performer all the way through the 1970s\n- GEICO had a near death experience in 1976, but survived this close call. Buffett bought 45% of the company for $50 million in a secondary around 1978. He acquired the remaining company for $4 billion in 1995. BRK is up 20x since then, while the comparable Progressive is up 60x\n- Wang Labs was a star performer during the period you specified, but missed the boat of PC revolution and went bust by 1992.\n- Home Depot went public in 1981, and was already up several times by 1983.\n\n--------\n\nConspicuously missing from my list are oil and commodity stocks. The main reason is OP specified the end date as 1983 instead of 1980. By then, they all had crashed and burnt. Gold and silver mining stocks were particularly annihilated between 1980 and 1983. That carnage was comparable to Dot Bombs between 2000 and 2002.",

Note, too, there was a DoorDash survival thread from a few days ago the looks pretty identical. What I wrote there, and I'll write again:\n\n&gt;\\[H\\]ere's the high-level bullish case on why it may be quite risky to short them:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Their revenue is growing at 2x per year -- 200% -- that's tremendous growth you can't find in too many other places and has held steady for 3 quarters.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;They have 4B in cash on hand, so even if they lose 100M/quarter, as the did recently, they can still stay afloat for 40 quarters  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Most important, cost of revenue (money going to drivers, restaurants and coupons) is only 52% of revenue  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What this last point means is that once they stop being in growth mode, they can presumably cut other costs significantly and still have a nice profit margin. That is, if they fire all the coders and middle managers, their margin would be 48%, which is plenty good. if people are hooked and they get rid of coupons and start squeezing restaurants and drivers, they'll make even more.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Or another observation: if they return to the same proportion of cost of revenue from 9/2020 (43% vs. 52%), but just stay the same size, they'd have broken precisely even, even with all their inefficiencies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When your face is pressed close to the glass, it can be hard to see economies of scale at this size.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Disclosure: I wouldn't touch the stock, long or short, with a 10 foot pole. I'm not crazy.\n\nand\n\n&gt;\\[To\\] reiterate the bull case (there's a million reasons why this wouldn't come to fruition) but back-of-the-envelope: restaurant revenue is \\~$1T, takeout \\~$300B, Doordash could eventually take 10% of that, say $30B, which puts revenue just below Oracle, about the same as Tesla, Raytheon and HPE. Those market caps are $250B, $700B, $130B and $20B.So, if you squint, DoorDash at $60B can slot right in there.I could do a fancy due diligence thing with forward free cash flow yadda yadda yadda, but I'm not that committed.\n\nHope that's what you were actually looking for.",

Supposedly Agilent still treats their employees great.\n\nTheir gameplan is to make high quality stuff and sell it at fat margins to deep-pocketed customers. I work at a company that stacks their labs with Agilent gear, and as long as their quality stays high, I doubt we will move away from them. We also buy buckets of licenses for their software... it's an industry standard in our niche and we have a decade's worth of designs built on it.\n\nLike another poster said, it's a very anti-WSB play. Agilent's a company that has pretty much zero chance for explosive growth (their big customers are more or less fixed), but will keep making steady money. They have entrenched connections in the corporate world and will maintain those as long as they keep making good products. \n\nIf they slip on quality, they're going to find that building power suppliers and oscilloscopes isn't exactly rocket science, and someone else will slip into their high-end niche. But so far they've avoided the rot that took the rest of HP for 20 years.",

        "body": "\"Transitory\" is the market word of the year. Insofar as there being any hope of a recovery, the same could be asked of any company not running on all cylinders. It's not as if Intel is the only laggard company out there. If you are familiar with their product line, their plan ahead, and believe they have a way forward, then you have your investment thesis. And like any idea or plan, it may or may not pan out in the end. I personally think that Intel has drawn the ire of new retail investors as they have neither the momentum (as you indicate) nor the swagger that AMD and NVDA bring to the table. And it's standard these days for market dregs to put out the occasional hit piece on punching bags like Intel--see this article, for instance: [U.S. near deal for Nvidia supercomputer as it waits for delayed Intel machine](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-near-deal-nvidia-supercomputer-190754396.html), which beneath the headline and the typical punishment despite market-scale supply chain problems essentially says that the Intel machine will, in the end, be the better performing machine against AMD and NVDA for HPC purposes:\n&gt;The $500 million contract called for Intel and partners to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance, or the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second. Now, the first exascale computer in the United States will likely be a different machine at a different lab - Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee - built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co with chips from AMD expected to be delivered later this year. The Polaris machine at Argonne will not be as powerful as the Intel machine, the sources said. Based on Nvidia's A100 chips and AMD's Rome and Milan chips, the Polaris computer will be able to make some exaflop calculations but mostly work at slower speeds.\n\nI think Intel has a legitimate shot at building on what they have, and it is valued cheaply compared to peers on the belief of others that it doesn't. Even as a laggard in cutting-edge design, it enjoys regular business with the US government and provides HPC services and infrastructure. Outside of Gen-Z'ers and Millennials, I doubt the flair of AMD or NVDA will cut through the sticker shock when Intel components will do work just fine. To put it simply, I think rumors of Intel's demise have been greatly exaggerated. Top insiders at [Intel](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-intc/intel/news/who-has-been-buying-intel-corporation-nasdaqintc-shares) seem to be either holding or buying more of their own stock, save for tax/bill purposes. That runs counter to both [AMD](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-amd-insider-buying-and-selling-2021-08-2-3/) and [NVDA](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-nvda-insider-buying-and-selling-2021-08-2-3/), where there has been almost entirely insider sales since Q2 2019. It's clear that Intel insiders think their stock can be bought cheaply in the assumption of future appreciation, while its competitors are cashing in on their own holdings while the sun is shining brighter than ever. At the end of the day, you make your investment thesis and stick to a plan. Will this last? Or will things be a bit different 5 years from now?",

AMD is yielding off of old Keller designs and nvidia has cuda for crypto / etc., but neither of those are moats\n\nHere's a list of all the semicounductor fabs in the world: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_semiconductor\\_fabrication\\_plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)\n\nMost of them fucking suck in terms of density, because, most things aren't iPhones and don't need cutting edge nodes (cough cars cough cough).\n\nBut, if you'll notice, intel isn't *that* far behind. In fact, they're among the closest to taiwan semi, and we get into niche things like 7nm not really being 7nm (it's more about transistor density, where intel 10 is close to taiwan 7, etc.)\n\nAnd in terms of durable competitive advantage - chip fabs are like nuclear reactors, highly capital intensive, highly complicated, hard to run == giant moat.\n\nFor value investors, you buy from pessimists, and intel pessimists follow jimmy crames saying they don't have 7nm, while Pat is investing 20 billion in new fabs building out that moat. Even if they fab crappier chips there's a shortage, companies that need chips (like fucking everything) will buy from intel if it's attractive. Also USA national interest won't let intel go under, especially with the alternative consolidating into taiwan  \nThat's not to mention the top line consumer initiatives like their new GPU line and continuing processor line, which could adapt to RISC-V / ARM if needed (they have the cash flow for R&amp;D to do it).",

Hopefully with the new CEO and some renewed vigor after being humbled by AMD/Nvidia recently, Intel will execute the next 6-12 months well.

        "body": "I'm a pretty big computer hardware enthusiast.\n\nI'm putting my money on Intel right now.\n\nAMD is coming off a brilliant 5 years with breakthrough CPUs every generation and have recently recovered ground in the GPU space as well. They are running on a high, and their P/E ratio shows it.\n\nIntel has struggled to get good products to market recently. Their laptop offerings have been decent, but margin on laptop CPUs is nothing like the retail desktop CPU margins that AMD is feeding on. Intel's desktop offerings have been very uninspiring, still being on 14nm for it's flagship offerings.\n\nI see Intel turning this around starting late Q4 2021 or early Q1 2022. They have products on the horizon like Alder Lake that are a huge departure from current CPU designs, much more akin to how many ARM CPUs work, with heterogenous cores (also known as big.LITTLE architecture). So they have a new core design (Golden Cove, which is sort of new, as it's used in current Rocket Lake CPUs, and Gracemount, which is their new high efficiency cores, similar  to the older intel Atom CPUs). Alder Lake is also the first mainstream desktop line to finally run on Intel's 10nm process, which despite the naming, is even denser than TSMC's 7nm process that AMD currently uses. Preliminary benchmark leaks show Alder Lake with quite incredible single core and very competitive multicore performance compared to AMD. \n\nIntel also has follow on product lines in Raptor Lake (which is an expected optimization of Alder Lake) as well as Meteor Lake, which should be a major node shrink and new core design.\n\nOn top of all of this, Intel is also just about to bring it's new Xe graphics architecture into a consumer dedicated graphics card product, the first ever for Intel. Preliminary benchmark leaks suggest that this will arrive with their high end card being very competitive with mid-high level AMD and Nvidia cards. Given the current shortages of GPUs, a performance competitive card is basically guaranteed to be a money maker.\n\nCouple this with the fact that Intel is currently in the process of a major expansion of their semiconductor fab factories. They are going to the prime beneficiary of the US government's new focus on expanding domestic semiconductor production. Intel is in the preliminary stages of possibly purchasing Global Foundries, the other major American semi-conductor contract foundry (which was actually spun off AMD at one point). Intel has indicated they are looking to expand their business as a 3rd party manufacturer of semi-conductor chips, which is a HUGE business right now, with many companies bidding record amounts to secure contracts on production capacity.\n\nIntel is currently undervalued. It's an established company many decades old, with dominant market share in the server and consumer PC space, very large company that is well positioned to capitalize on many of the market situations in semi-conductors and technology.\n\nThey are also trading at about a P/E ratio of 12, which is not only an excellent ratio for a technology company, it's an excellent ratio for a company in any space. Their competitors are trading at P/E ratios between 30 and 100. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Intel is likely at a low based on their recent products, but may be on the uptick now and are well placed to benefit from current tech trends. I think now is the time to buy and hold them for the mid-long term. I'm buying right now with the expectation that their stock price could be at $150 by late 2023. \n\nThank you for listening to my Ted Talk.",

        "body": "I have mixed feeling on selling prior to earnings. Beucase of exactly what happened. If youre buying weekly options then yeah, youre playing with fire holding options through earnings. But if you have options contracts that has a lot of time left after the earnings call then you have time to recover. If your options contracts has months left until expiration then holding through earnings is not going to hurt you too bad. I bought calls on AMD at the end of June and they were down 50-80% leading up to earnings. I have been slowly (maybe prematurely) selling my calls all for profits of 150-300%. My calls expired in September, November, and December. I like to stagger mine. \n\nWith that being said, I think people grossly missunderstood the position AMD is in. The signs were all there. Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely.",

So for example the glass screen, it's made by Corning, the same company that makes Gorilla Glass, which really developed on the Pentagon's budget to make super durable glass for the military, point being this is an extremely secure technology that the Pentagon has a vested interest in not letting others have access to. And this puts into perspective the fight for independent statehood of Taiwan \\[1\\], which hosts/controls TSMC, pretty much the only fab company other than Intel making competitive chips. China's chip fab capabilities are usually on the magnitude of 28nm down to around 10-14nm, where the state of the art in the US/Taiwan/Israel/other US satellites are now at 3nm. \n\nAnother example is Boeing (US) and Airbus (France), and how China is completely dependent on these two companies for their airline industry. The technology in commercial airplanes is so great that it took China/Russia decades to kind of - maybe build unreliable competitors, and the US / France (US satellite) isn't going to just let that tech slip for free. Again my point being, Nike can be replaced, but the high tech industry can't be so easily.\n\n\\[1\\] https://thediplomat.com/2020/12/taiwan-chips-and-geopolitics-part-1/",

Imagine that this has the added bonus of dividends to investors, despite being publicly traded for less than a month.\n* [Modest capex spend in their S-1; immediate FCF generation](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021013318/1?cik=1783879&amp;hl=1029918:1029933&amp;hl_id=4yjqwnqyi) - capital light business that is shitting free cash flow L2Y. Help me understand why RH is such a shit investment again?\n\n* Cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, and other logical fallacies that /r/investing and /r/stocks are ***ridiculously*** susceptible to (me speculating here) - most $HOOD bears arrive at their thesis from extrapolating personal experience over RH's entire user base\n * e.g. - reddit incorrectly assumes the RH the user base consists of day traders looking to profit off of short term price movements that are based off of what the billions of other public capital market participants are going to do in the immediate term.....rather than making buy/sell decisions based off of firm-specific and macro fundamentals. \n * The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of investors see brokerages as offering a commoditized service where you're offering the same service at the lowest cost. **The smart money** sees RH for what it is: a brokerage that charges me $0 in fees and is awarding me free yield. Why tf would I trade away additional return in the form of lower fees relative to what another brokerage would charge me? \n\nSo, again, I'm open to hearing a rational bear case on RH or any sort of pervasive, idiosyncratic risk associated with the ticker that isn't being properly reflect in the current share price.",

        "body": "I have mixed feeling on selling prior to earnings. Beucase of exactly what happened. If youre buying weekly options then yeah, youre playing with fire holding options through earnings. But if you have options contracts that has a lot of time left after the earnings call then you have time to recover. If your options contracts has months left until expiration then holding through earnings is not going to hurt you too bad. I bought calls on AMD at the end of June and they were down 50-80% leading up to earnings. I have been slowly (maybe prematurely) selling my calls all for profits of 150-300%. My calls expired in September, November, and December. I like to stagger mine. \n\nWith that being said, I think people grossly missunderstood the position AMD is in. The signs were all there. Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely.",

The biggest thing TSMC did to get the upper hand over Intel was order a shit ton of ASML EUV photolithography tools early on. ASML took years to fill those contracts due to how complex their production is (these tools cost ~$100M each). I didn't directly work on the EUV tool, but saw the effects first hand of how Intel's first EUV tool streamlined several difficult manufacturing steps in our 7nm technology. But we couldn't get enough of them in time. Before this the companies were close on process technology; Intel was maybe even slightly ahead. Whether this persists once Intel's orders with ASML can be filled remains to be seen.\n\nAn interesting development is the Japanese semiconductor manufacturing tool companies (e.g., Nikon, Canon, TEL) have EUV tools coming soon. If only I knew which of these might follow an ASML like trajectory  in the markets.",
