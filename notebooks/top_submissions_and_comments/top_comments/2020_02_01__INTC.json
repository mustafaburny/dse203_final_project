Combine that with the fact that the Xbox scarllet, ps5 and switch 2 are all around the corner with AMD hardware and you can see alot of reliable demand from them going forward and a clear edge over their only other competitor in the market.\n\nNow if that will translate to stock prices is hard to say but it seems likely that AMD will grow some and is unlikely to fail or fall below its current mark given all this.",

You could have held but you'd be stupid to (maybe you hold a couple, make sure they are free by now). You then scoop up some more on market open day after earnings, making sure it gapped up hard enough to matter of course (which it did this time) and day trade them by 2PM for a paltry 20-50% gain. Just like Intel. This is a rippling pond.",

        "body": "Long AMDer here:\n\nI've bought in AMD in 2017 - when it was in low teens. I've been following AMD very closely as I am a PC enthusiast.\n\nAMD has a lot of momentum going for them at this time.\n\n1. They're at parity for single threaded performance vs Intel counter parts; at a much lower price\n2. More cores/threads for less money\n3. More efficient than Intel processors (This is huge as Intel was super far ahead).\n4. EPYC server chips winning contracts/new business everday\n5. Outselling Intel CPUs by the mountain load\n6. Upcoming consoles PS5, Xbox Series X, Atari VCS all uses AMD chips\n7. AMD supplying server GPUs to google (for Stadia)\n8. Next generation RND2 GPUs (and big Navi) to be released this year)\n9. Ryzen 4xxx to be released this year (with another massive leap in performance)\n\nI could go on but Dr Lisa Su and team has really outdone themselves and they're not stopping anytime soon.\n\n**That being said, there is a certain level of speculation;** the current price is mostly fuelled by their recent product performance/sales (YoY) and that Intel is behind process node (extremely difficult to get ahead once you're behind). Should AMD simply execute their current roadmap for the next 3 years, I foresee a reasonable possibility for AMD to break 10 billion yearly revenue by 2022.\n\nI have slowly reduced my holding in AMD over the last 3 years to avoid over exposure (and to take profit). As of today, I still hold a very sizeable holding in AMD with no plans to reduce my position. I'm sure the stock will go up/down; but at this point I'm in it for the long haul.",

As more and more companies are moving to the cloud, also cloud business from existing customers is growing by leaps and bound, there is more than enough room for both of them to grow. Along the way, AMD technology will prove it's worth and hopefully grab bigger of server market share.\n\nTo your VMWare point, I wasn't aware of it, and it sure is cause for concern. They are by far the largest market shareholder in server virtualisation space, especially for companies who have too much money to throw and are not worried about reducing costs.

I'm not sure if Samsung would be able to buy equipment in South Korea and then ship it to China but if so, that'd help ASML, AMAT, LRCX, etc. \n\nAlso this may actually help margins for American equipment suppliers because in general, China's chips are cheaper and lower margin products, which don't require top-of-the-line equipment. \n\nA third thing, try to find if the semi equipment suppliers were banned from shipping to Huawei/HiSilicon already last May. If they aren't allowed to ship to China, but their by-far largest Chinese customer was already off the table, the impact may not be as significant. \n\nGood luck! And disclosure I have a position in LRCX.",

        "body": "EE is what you need to understand circuit design. You should be able to infer the advantage with a CS degree. As you know, CPUs with a smaller nm construction uses less watt per instruction and have lower heat dissipation requirements. This is the primary reason analyst harp alot on nm. Secondly, the chiplet design generates yields far better than monolithic designs. The yield difference I believe is 15% right now. It will actually be even bigger when you scale down smaller. This means that AMD is producing faster, cheaper, lower watt usage chips than Intel. This advantage is most pronounced in the datacenter space where watt usage and heat energy are paramount. Since you are in the field (I assume) you should be aware of the amount of large scale enterprise software moving to the cloud. The AI/ML machines are being powered by AMD to some extent. All the applications on AWS and Azure? Those will be amd soon enough. When IoT and 5g scales out you can bet AMD is well positioned to host the server apps that sit in the cloud.\nThis is why investors are excited.\n\nNow will Intel come back? Absolutely but were talking about 2 years minimum due to the requirement to redesign chips from the ground up.",

Inside Nokia exist what was once Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs, Motorola wireless network infrastructure. \n\nThe main reason for low price  is Nokia's [ReefShark](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2018/01/29/nokia-launches-reefshark-chipsets-that-deliver-massive-performance-gain-in-5g-networks/) chipset supplier (Intel) who could not deliver.  Nokia had to cancel dividends because  they need to spend more into R&amp;D and redesign stuff.  Profit margins suffer because the FPGA based chipset is more expensive than anticipated.   This is probably just temporary setback but  very  bad one. There were even some rollout delays.

However, When things calm down and USD/CNY goes down, I would expect FXI to actually shoot up faster than SPY (percentage wise). Most investment houses seem to expect USD to come down in 2020, which would actually be bullish for FXI.\n\nBUT! While the Coronavirus fears are worsening, FXI puts. There are tons of optimistic news out now about a \u201ccure...\u201d I personally think if you\u2019re not in it already, you\u2019re already a bit late to the party. \n\nIf SPY goes back to the 327/329 area next week (perhaps late Monday/Tuesday), I would buy puts on SPY rather than FXI.\n\nEDIT: I might be totally wrong too.

The price has more than doubled in 6 months. 100% of the time that Tesla\u2019s stock has had upward moves that large it had at the very least a 10-20% decline following. That means if you sold now and price still continued up to $700 and then decline 20% you could buy back at $550. However, imo, since Tesla is now at an all time low of short sellers and is being priced at a 3x multiple of GM stock. It is likely to eventually return to and retest support at $400 before continuing its trend higher. Most will not agree with me but people typically don\u2019t agree with bearish views at tops. Just like when it gets back to $400 everyone will say not to buy even though that\u2019s the best decision to make at that price.",

So, in this instance, the spread actually was more profitable because the move wasn't very big.\n\nHowever, 5 days later on 11/13, they release initial D+ numbers and had a huge jump.

        "body": "\n&gt;I really appreciate you taking the time .....I totally see it now with my MA example. \n\nSure thing, glad you got it. I hate to see people losing money that they shouldn't have to, especially if I can help prevent it by simply helping them work out the numbers! \n\n\n&gt;I could sell the feb 7 $277.5 put and collect Friday\u2019s bid of .85 that would be premium of $850 on 1000 shares. \n\nYup, that's correct (keeping in mind that at Monday's open the prices are likely gonna be different; but you got the idea).\n\nAlso, again, I'd recommend not hitting the bid, but rather trying first at mid price or maybe even a bit better. Eg, I see a 0.85 x 0.90 market on those puts (from Friday). I'd try to sell that put for maybe 0.88 first, and then lower my price penny by penny til I get my fill. I also would lower it all the way to the bid, as I would consider I'm being completely ripped off of I have to go all the way there (unless I had a very strong need to do it, like to close a position to prevent massive losses; but not to open a new one).\n\n\n&gt;And the way to protect myself from a loss would be to close the position early before Im down \n$850 and use my premium to prevent loss ?\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure is clear - and, again, because of Put-Call parity, it applies to both a short put and a covered call trades - is that this premium you receive is not really \"a cushion\", not really a way to protect you from losses.\n\nLooking at the short put trade may actually help to see this thing I'm gonna talk about more clearly, but remember the exact same thing applies to CC, just maybe a bit harder to see as things are a bit less explicit.\n\nOnce you sell that put, you don't \"make 850 USD\". You are making a transaction in which 850 USD are exchanged for something worth 850 USD. You have 0 profits of losses initially. So there isn't really an 850 USD cushion.\n\nYou're effectively getting 850 USD now to assume a liability valued by the market at 850 USD now. \n\nIf AAPL goes down, or if IV increases, the premium of that put is going to increase, meaning that you'll be at a loss: you'll have 850 USD cash, and a liability of more than 850 USD market value. \n\nSay AAPL moves in such a way that the put is now worth 1.00. You're at a loss of 0.15 per share, or 150 USD. You can close everything and take that 150 USD loss. More explicitly, you initially received 850 USD to assume a liability, and then you paid 1000 USD to rid yourself from that liability: a 150 USD loss. Notice that the 150 USD loss doesn't even require you to close your trade: you're at a loss simply because you have 850 USD cash and a liability worth 1000 USD cash. It's an \"unrealized loss\", which doesn't mean \"unreal loss\", it's very real! \n\nIf the position is going against you, you can close it at any time, and take (or realize) the loss. A common threshold people use in short put trades is to not let the loss become bigger than the max profit you were looking at. So in this case, this rule of thumb would lead people to close the short put by buying it back for 1.70, if it starts going that way. People usually talk about this by saying stuff like \"close for a loss at 2x the premium received\". \n\nSo this way of \"protection\" is really just getting out of the position - at a loss! - in order to prevent the losses from possibly getting bigger, much bigger. Sometimes people resist it thinking that they may want to hold longer \"to see if it comes back\": problem is, it may also go further! \n\nThere are many other ways to protect yourself, too.\n\nFor example, you could buy a put at a lower strike. It reduces your profitability, since you'll be spending part of the premium you got to acquire this protection. But it effectively limits the max you can lose. Eg if you buy the 270 put, you'll be paying around 0.62 (mid of 0.60 x 0.64 that I see here), but if AAPL tanks to, say, 250, you'll be forced to buy it for 277.5 (your short put) but you have the right to sell it for 270 (yourong put). The trade off is that now, on 10 contracts, the max profit you're looking at is 230 USD (850 USD from selling the 277.5 usd, 620 USD from buying the 270 put). **This is exactly a vertical spread.**\n\nAlternatively, you could short a bit of stock: this reduces the effect of the put increasing in value (this increasing your losses) as the stock price goes down: the profit on the short balances put some of the losses on the short put. People usually think about doing this kind of stuff when the delta of their short put gets too big and scary. Disadvantage is that if the stock moves up, you lose on the short stock position, and this loss can eventually even get bigger than the profits from shorting the put... so it has to be managed actively. **This is usually referred to as managing or hedging delta (and can be done in other ways, too, like reducing the size of the short put position, or selling OTM calls basically transforming it into a strangle, etc).**\n\nSo many possibilities...\n\nIf you want to explore more about this, check whether your trading platform has some good support for risk analysis for options. You didn't mention what it is, so I'm gonna comment on a few popular ones around here. \n\nToS has an OK tool in the Analyze tab: it works well for simple positions, it's pretty easy to use, but it simply cannot handle a more complex position with many legs without slowing down to the point where it becomes unresponsive for 10s of seconds.\n\nIB has absolutely amazing support for analyzing options portfolios in the Risk Navigator tool: it can handle whatever book of option you throw at it with fantastic performance, and IMO it has an incredibly superior model to ToS's, both in terms of its default settings as well as in terms of offering incredibly powerful ways to tweak it if you want (you probably don't, at least not initially).\n\nRobinhood has nothing. Well, it calculates your \"break even\" for single legs... But frankly, I wouldn't trust even that number without verifying it myself every time as RH is just... well, it's RH. \n\nTastyworks is something I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think this aspect would've changed much, since all I see is they trying to push a \"novel\" risk analysis approach: it sucks in this area. (it emphasizes too much this notion of \"probability of profit\", which is really absurd IMO as it isn't anywhere close to reflecting risk, especially in non-trivial positions). \n\nI'll share a couple of screenshot from IB later when I get to my competition so you can get a sense of what it looks like, and how you can explore ways to possibly protect yourself from big losses.",

Why not sell an extremely otm put with a short expiration date of a stable stock like an index? Let\u2019s say you sell a out of SPY at $30 below market value that expires tomorrow. Now I know it would only be worth like $10 when it expires. But would this nearly guaranteed profit make the risk of unlimited loss worth it? I know I\u2019m probably missing some key aspect, please fill me in.",
