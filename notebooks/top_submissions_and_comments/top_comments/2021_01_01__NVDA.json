Nvidia for obvious reasons and their new AI tech, and Disney because they've been slowly taking over the digital entertainment market (i.e. ESPN and all the new streaming hits) and once their parks are doing well again it'll probably accelerate really quickly.\n\nCybersecurity is only just getting going too with nearly infinite room for growth, Zscaler and Crowdstrike are doing extraordinarily well.\n\nFor more risk, my renewable riskies (but are still leaders in their industry) are BLDP, SEDG, LAZR, and QS. BLDP and SEDG are reliable, the others fairly speculative but with strong futures if all goes well. I'm looking forward to Lion going public soon, as Amazon backs them. I have some in Fisker as well, I think they've got potential and they seem to have their ducks in a row this time around with a manufacturing partnership already lined up.\n\nAnd then some of the pot stocks, Aphria has good numbers and IIPR deals in buying properties for new dispensaries instead of dealing with the trickiness of making pot profitable.

I moved it into my E*Trade account and bought FANNG It worked well... but one stock in particular crushed it... $NVDA [in @$63] From that point forward I was chasing the fast money.\n\nI then decided to get approved for options, and  like most most of you, I wasn\u2019t a retard (yet). I played it safe and bought LEAPs on $SQ [in @ $24] expiring 2 years out. Satisfied with this decision and it\u2019s initial momentum I started studying up on options... when I came across /WallStreetBets.\n\nThe hype stock at the time was AMD... several others came and went. I saw so many people YOLOing on weeklies I thought it was hilarious and said I\u2019d never do that.\n\nI did however become riskier with my trades... I got approved for margin and maxed out on FANG, bought more LEAPs and decided to put 10% of my portfolio on an $ADBE earnings with OTM calls... they printed... +700% or $15k in like 48 hours. It was my very first weekly... I was officially a retard.\n\nNow at this time, the Trump rally was like 18 months strong and every small dip recovered within a week... so I was sure at the next dip, \nI\u2019d capitalize. At the time $AMZN was just on fire so at that next dip I bought $2000 OTM Calls expiring one month out... the EV on this was EXPENSIVE. So I was really pushing the limit.\n\nThen came the dip. (Summer 2018) Only this time, it didn\u2019t recover, the market just sucked ass for like a week... I got margin called and had to sell all my stocks at a loss, but held on to all my options. The $AMZN call evaporated instantly. And by then I had lost like 2 years of gains $130k in about three days.\n\nAt that point I was terrified that the whole market was going to collapse... that there was something I was not privy to. Like the housing bubble of 2008... so I sold everything I had left, and stopped investing for a year.\n\nThe recovery came and went, the summer of 2018 just looked like a speed bump in hindsight. So I told myself I\u2019d wait for the next dip... I was patient. \n\nWaited over a year and boy did that dip come. COVID-19... up 320% since COVID. Never had the courage to tell anyone about my shitty summer of 2018 until now... It\u2019s a lesson I had to learn otherwise I\u2019d still be trading like a lunatic until I hit a land mine. So those of you posting losses feeling like it\u2019s the end of the world... \ud83c\udf7bcheers to getting your cherry \ud83c\udf52 popped and welcome to /WallStreetBets\n\n\n** green line shows E*TRADE balance before it was merged into Robinhood.\n\n**TLDR - crazy gains 2 years ago trading like junior varsity retard, lost 80% in three days. Now making it back trading like a Varsity retard",

        "body": " \n\nSo for the past year or so I\u2019ve become more knowledgeable and invested in the stock market. Through reading and watching YouTube videos online, I\u2019ve taught myself technical analysis and the ability to distinguish well-run companies from bad ones. One company in particular that I\u2019ve been following has been AMD.\n\nAMD is a company that is close to my heart and many of you as well because we use their products. Whether you\u2019re PC Master Race or a console player, AMD has had a significant impact on your gaming life. With the release of their new Ryzen Zen 3 CPUs and 6 series graphics cards, they have completely turned the Computer &amp; Graphics industry on its head and are siphoning a growing percentage of market share from industry leaders such as Intel and Nvidia.\n\nThis became very evident when they announced their Q4 earnings report this past Tuesday. To put it simply, they CRUSHED IT. AMD\u2019s revenue was up 45% in 2020, led by the growth of the companies server CPU and game console CPU segments which increased by 176% year over year.\n\nOn the earnings call, AMD\u2019s CEO, Lisa Su, gave great guidance and announced AMD expects 37% revenue growth in 2021 despite supply issue concerns due to the pandemic.\n\nSo why am I writing all of this? Since AMD announced its earnings on Tuesday, the stock has plummeted almost 10 percent due to market manipulation. It\u2019s no secret that large hedge funds are trying to cover the losses they\u2019ve endured in stocks like $GME and $AMC by shorting well-performing stocks that retail investors are heavily invested in. And yesterday Robinhood facilitated this transfer of wealth by preventing retail investors from buying more than one share of $AMD at a time.\n\nHerein lies the problem. We are told in this country to pick ourselves up by our own bootstraps. To put in the effort and the work and you\u2019ll be rewarded. But the events of the past week have made it evidently clear that the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d only applies to a select segment of the population. Because whenever the working class beats the rich at their own rules, they immediately change the rules to punish us. It\u2019s honestly sickening.\n\nSo what can we do to combat this? Essentially, what the large hedge funds are doing right now is a high stakes game of rob Peter to pay Paul. They have lost billions in $GME and $AMC so now they are attacking (shorting) larger market cap stocks to make up the difference. WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO DO THIS. If we do not fight back, we will allow them to continue the status quo of changing the rules for their benefit.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, but we need to do what we can to protect companies such as $AMD and any of the other companies Robinhood has targeted over the past couple of days. If we\u2019re able to beat these hedge funds at their own games, maybe our government can finally intervene, which could lead to policy reform/regulation that supports the retail investor. Maybe I\u2019m being overly optimistic, but who knows. I think we really have a revolution on our hands here if this becomes a full fledged grassroots movement.",

It's not only you it's human.  Growth from this place of mental suffering will come.  Just use this energy for something good.  Do some research.   Find the next big thing.
