It's really, \"if it didn't have a dividend would you still invest in the business itself and why?\" \n\nThere's just been a lot of people on here who put dividend first and fundamentals second and that's where I get concerned/where the downside comes in when people invest in things like mortgage REITs because they have 10%+ yields (or had, in many cases.)\n\nSome REITs are fine, but in those cases you can make a case for the business, like Prologis and growth over time of e-commerce (largest warehouse REIT, with tons of last mile warehouses around the globe, as well as Amazon's biggest landlord  (https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2017/11/21/amazons-landlord-how-the-e-commerce-boom-propelled-warehouse-king-prologis-to-new-heights.) \n\nThat's back to new highs (and like many other charts, the speed of the bounce is rather remarkable), but that's an example of dividend + being able to make a long-term case for the fundamentals to continue over the long-term (short-term, e-commerce doing well, other things certainly slowing but stock doesn't seem to care much as it's nearly back to where it was in Feb before the downturn.) There's also the cell tower REITs back to 52 wk highs (SBAC, AMT) and data centers (EQIX) doing well. So there's REITs worth consideration if the market corrects, but in those cases it's \"good long-term fundamental story and happens to also have a dividend.\"",
