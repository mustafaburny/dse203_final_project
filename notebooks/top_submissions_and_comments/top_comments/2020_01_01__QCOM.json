        "body": "Question for those more researched... will starlink render 5g useless? How about all cell services? World wide wifi seems like the end of that. The only problem to work out would be receiving. Moving from the satellite dish down to an antenna in the phone. Obviously it's some years away before that happens but once we could receive starlink internet strait to mobile devices it would end cell services right? So 5g good play on a &lt;5 timeline but not so much later? Could starlink internet be received directly to a mobile device ever? Would cell services just connect to starlink with their towers then broadcast it to the cell phones over 5g frequencies? I'm just trying to get an idea of how things will workout once the full stain grid is up. Is Qualcomm the best 5g play?",

Buying in the afternoon always screws me.  It happens the worst on stocks like Disney, where all the option value is priced in at the very beginning of the day.  When traders realize Disney isn't going to move that day, those options lose a ton of value even though the stock price doesn't move much at all.  You can think you are buying a low at 1:30, but the option value will continue to drop until EOD.  On stocks like Disney and QCOM, i mostly buy EOD, and sell next day at open.",

If we believe growth forecasts.\n\nAs you aluded, Intel's desktop processors have fallen years behind AMDs, who are eating Intel's entire consumer market. However, Intel still have big business in corporate desktops and laptops, with the likes of Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Acer. Intel is also diversified into network controllers, SSDs and embedded ICs.\n\nIn the long term, and I'm surprised no other reply has mentioned this, the writing is on the wall for the x86-64 architecture, which means the writing is on the wall for both AMD and Intel, unless they do something.\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm are invested in making Windows run great on ARM, as is Apple with macOS. This is because ARM is cheaper, and gives twice the battery life. Performance and compatibility are rapidly catching up.\n\nMicrosoft's Surface line has already begun switching from Intel x86-64 to Qualcomm ARM. I am expecting Apple to announce a switch from Intel x86-64 to Apple ARM next year, and it will be a permanent switch, as they look to tightly integrate Mac and iPhone, as well as double their battery life, as well as reduce costs. The Mac represents 5% of Intel's revenue, and it will hurt. But Dell and Lenovo together represent nearly 30% of of Intel's revenue, and they are only waiting on more Windows software to run natively on ARM, and Qualcomm's higher end processors to arrive, which are both inevitable.\n\nIntel can make a comeback. It is a great microprocessor architect. If it went fabless, it could easily compete with AMD and Qualcomm. If it leveraged it's massive size and clout, it could, with some years, lay down the R&amp;D to catch up without going fabless. They probably need new leadership willing to take bigger risks to move faster in these directions.\n\n2020 is probably going to be okay for INTC. The Surface is the first alarm bell. The Macintosh will be the next. Both are relatively small markets, but I would not hang around to watch Dell and Lenovo follow suit.\n\nI hold a small stake in INTC. As AMD valuation is already through the roof, I will be transitioning that stake into TSM and QCOM.",

The premise of M1 is that they let you build your own \u201cETF\u201d if you will (they call it a pie). Pies can contain many different types of securities (stocks, ETFs, etc). \n\nOnce you create a pie, you can deposit as little as $10 to fund it. Since M1 has a concept of fractional shares, you would be able to buy both a portion of Qualcomm as well as a portion of OLED. By purchasing both, you greatly reduce your risk of a failure in your portfolio (being more diversified helps to prevent a situation like one company going out of business). \n\nYou can add as many or as few securities to your pie as you feel comfortable with. Once you have your pie, you can adjust it as you see fit. M1 supports rebalancing too (eg if you have 2 securities and you want them to both be 50%, M1 can readjust for you if one company gets too heavy.)\n\nBy building your own actively managed portfolio, you can control the securities that you\u2019re exposed to, while also making every dollar that you have work for you throughout the year (no more waiting and only putting dollars in the market when you can afford a whole share). As auto investing as a feature offered by M1, some people find it helpful to just automatically add to their portfolio every pay period.",
