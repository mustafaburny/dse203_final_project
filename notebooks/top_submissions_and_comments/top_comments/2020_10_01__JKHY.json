        "body": "Honestly, the industry is consolidating. FIS and FISV have gotten so big that JKHY either needs to acquire or be acquired to stay competitive. In addition, the new FISV CEO is a moron. I expect that company to fall apart. They're hemorrhaging talent and lack clear direction with Jeff Yabuki gone. While the First Data acquisition made sense from a product and economies of scale stand point, the First Data culture and executives were nothing short of toxic waste. So how that plays out in the future is anyone's guess. I'm still waiting to see how some of the start ups handle the space's changes. However, there is an opportunity for sure for some kind of NCR/JKHY/Q2 type merger. For sure the space will continue to grow immensely and FISV will not capture that growth. So it is an industry like any other with its own quirks.\n\nI think it is important to understand this industry's history. A great article in this space (dated now) is: https://www.americanbanker.com/news/can-big-four-core-banking-vendors-oligopoly-be-broken\n\nWhen the industry big four was viewed as D+H/Harland, Fiserv, FIS and JKHY. The deal was back then, FIS was ~6B, JKHY ~2B, D+H/Harland ~2B, FISV was ~5B in revenues.\n\nLook at the industry's revenues today... (Q2 2020):\n\nFiserv: 14.4B\n\nFidelity National Information Services: 12.2B\n\nNCR Corporation: 6.7B\n\nFinastra (the old D+H/Harland): 1.9B\n\nJack Henry &amp; Associates: 1.7B\n\nTemenos AG: 0.9B\n\nQ2 Holdings: 0.4B\n\nSo if the bottom 5 combined... at 11.5B it would switch from the old four company oligopoly described above to a new three company oligopoly.\n\nIn the last few years, Fiserv has acquired as major acquisitions Open Solutions, First Data, Dovetail and Monitise.\n\nFIS has acquired WorldPay, Vantiv, Clear2Pay, Sungard Data Systems, mFoundry and others.\n\nWhat has JKHY done? There has been acquisitions but in terms of revenues and products... it has been inconsequential. So if you continue to hold JKHY then what is your best case scenario? What I would see happening is Vista Equity Partners the owners of Finastra could buy JKHY and some other small players like Q2 to create a real competitor. With FISV leaking hard on revenue, I would expect a new company like to be a real competitor. So then JKHY would likely be bought out at a premium.",

With that said, the niche they serve is being hollowed out very quickly, as the number of small banks and credit unions is rapidly shrinking. \n\nJkhy, in my opinion, needs to make a sizable move outside of their current competency, or should be acquired itself. \n\nAs far as your specific holding question is concerned, I am certainly not qualified to make that decision. But you should assess your potential tax implications from a sale, and where you might place your capital if you did sell.",
