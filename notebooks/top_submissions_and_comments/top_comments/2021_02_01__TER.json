        "body": "I can share what I follow and learned after making so many mistakes. I used to trade weeklies but burned many times due averaging or trade going to opposite direction. So, after losing 50% of portfolio then I stopped the weeklies.\nNow, I only trade in growth companies after reseraching. I follow four rules mostly:\n\n1. High growth companies (usually have high IV as well) - I have leaps for PLTR, NIO, XPEV,SKLZ, SQ, MVIS, ABNB etc.( had DKNG, SE,RIOT and JMIA but sold too early yet made goos money)\n\n2. ER corrected companies- I buy leaps for those companies which have good performance but got corrected. Like EHTH, QCOM,AMD, CRM,U,UNH, ANTM, ENPH.\n\n3. Companies which have been consolidation phase- NVDA, CRM since,  I can't time them well so I buy longer period calls and IV is relatively low so they price not that bad for me.\n\n4. Upcoming trends: like currently semi conductors shortages so i bought TSM, TER, AMD, QCOM and NVDA are also in that sector. Also, traditional internal combustion engine companies like GM and Ford making headlines on Ev  and current initiatives are making me bullish on that so I have been buying their leaps too. I missed the TSLA train but I dont want to miss others.\n\nLeaps give me 70%-80% success rate in this bullish market. It may not give very fast returns but helps me focus on my full time job give me less stress than short term trades.\n\nSorry for the long message.",

There are several issues between very long lead times, capacity constraints, varying wafer formats/sizes, limited equipment, and one limited commodity (that I couldn't find a way to play).  After this I moved my portfolio to be about 30% semi mfg equipment (LRCX, TER, AMAT, KLA) and 15% in some of the bigger chip players like AMD &amp; NVDA.  I couldn't go into INTC because after my DD, I think it will take several years to turn the INTC boat - it takes years to design chips and tooling before even trying to get them fabricated which has a 26 week lead time.  There was one automotive chip supplier (NXPI) that appeared to be ahead of the demand curve so I bought a little of that too.  I still need to do more DD but would strongly recommend doing the DD yourself as every corner I turned made me believe there will be great growth here for the next several years.",

I have a ton of questions but will try to keep it brief and let others ask before I add to the list below:\n\n* Regarding your last raise are you able/willing to disclose who the 4 institutional investors were?\n* Of the markets TER currently operates in, which do you think presents the most lucrative opportunity? Are there any particular states you're looking at that you don't currently operate in?\n* For JW: Given your background in pharma, do you see any place for TER to operate in that space (a la TBP/GWPH)? \n* For JA: Is there anything you learned at your time with FreshDirect that is translating into your role at TerrAscend?\n* For both: What expectations do you have regarding the evolution of retail licensing? A common thesis is that Cannabis will eventually be like Tobacco/Alcohol where the retail locations won't be operated by the producers. Is this a reality you see playing out or do you think states will protect the current paradigm of retail licensing?",

I personally don't think TSMC is a good benchmark here as the foundry services offered by ON aren't the / shouldn't be the primary draw and it's not really a \"pure-play\" org. IMO, the competitors I'd be looking at are Texas Instruments, Diodes Inc, Broadcom (to a lesser degree), Infineon and maybe Qualcomm. Unfortunately, due to time constraints I haven't got as good a grasp on this one as I should have. I'll certainly be looking into this as a next step along side just doing more general research on competitors.\n2. Potentially this was poorly explained. Essentially they are selling fabs that have historically been relatively low margin. Yes this reduces capacity (at least short term), however as the new fab they have built is brough up to speed, they expect the capacity to increase overall. Additionally, the new fab promises to be higher margin, allowing them to improve overall FCF / NOPAT. The current expectation is it should be up and fully running by 2023. I think there is some technological advantage to this as well. The fab they're buying is an existing GloFo (Global Foundries) fab that manufactures on 300mm wafers. This new fab will allow them to transition from a number of 200mm wafer fabs to the new one. I think there's also some CMOS technology licensing / knowledge transfer taking place but that's not really been an in-depth focus for me.\n\nUseful reading around item 2:\n\n* [https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2019/05/15/on-semiconductor-and-globalfoundries-both-win-with-its-430m-fab-10-deal/?sh=3f749f561b34](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2019/05/15/on-semiconductor-and-globalfoundries-both-win-with-its-430m-fab-10-deal/?sh=3f749f561b34)\n* [https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/semi-buys-glofo-east-fishkill-fab-2019-04/](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/semi-buys-glofo-east-fishkill-fab-2019-04/)",

However, 3+ years out (and assuming a successful implementation of the current management plan) I think they are actually relatively undervalued. If you look at trailing P/E it's actually lower than those of Texas Instruments and Diodes Inc (among others). For me it's more about the promise / expectation of improvements in financials, upgrades in technology etc. which I think will allow it to gain market share in some growing areas.\n\nPersonally, I randomly picked ON just to work on improving my own analysis skills, but after reviewing I decided to go in with a small sum.

Elon is more of a hype man than anything else - it's why his stock is so high, he keeps saying big things that don't match what actually happens on the ground. I've done a fair amount of research into the guy, and my conclusion walking away is that he's mostly another billionaire, but one who's been smart enough to do a PR campaign and to do some good things for the world.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the PR campaign good stuff makes it harder to get people excited about stuff that's better for the world but harder to make a buck on, like existing public transport options and reducing demand for ICE vehicles through maintenance and buying used rather than the trade-offs of just switching wholesale to EVs at once. He is a very, very smart man, but lots of stuff, especially his recent play in crip tie, make me suspicious.",

Some light reading that [/u/draemon\\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, [\"here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly\".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\\*\n\nInvestopedia \\[\"Short and Distort\" - illegal short tactic \\]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are \u201cforced\u201d sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or \u201cprop\u201d desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing \u201cvolatility\u201d**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated \u201cdumps\u201d of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.\n\nsource: [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html)\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don't exist to scare us.

The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It\u2019s illegal market manipulation at its finest.\n\nHedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.\n\nIn reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you\u2019d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.\n\nSo, stop panicking pussies. They\u2019ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven\u2019t already.

The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game.

I'm not ape gang, but I want you to know there is no real pressure to sell shares. There is only your own pressure at staring at a \"loss\". If you're down just forget about it and hold it until it's green. Trust me I sold at the bottom of March because money got too tight and I would rather have eaten ramen and lived in a box for two months after that V shaped recovery of the market. Squeeze might happnen, it might not. I do believe GME will have a much bigger market cap in a few years though if Ryan Cohen does his magic.",

The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**\n\nShort Attack:\n\n1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n3. Spread disinformation through \"analysis\" to get people to sell their stocks because \"the fundamentals aren't there\". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, [\"here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly\".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\\*\n\nInvestopedia \\[\"Short and Distort\" - illegal short tactic \\]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are \u201cforced\u201d sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or \u201cprop\u201d desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing \u201cvolatility\u201d**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated \u201cdumps\u201d of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices.

There are other hedge funds trying to fuck over Melvin and Citadel - since they compete.\n\nThink of it like Mercedes vs. BMW.\n\nMercedes is going to try and fuck BMW as hard as possible (or visa versa) so they take all of their money &amp; clients.\n\nDFV just opened the eyes of retail investors, and we're along for the ride.\n\nTLDR; SOME hedge funds are also on our side, attempting to push these guys out of business. A short squeeze can be over a long period of time, it doesn't have to be an exponential burst of growth in the stock. IF you hold it long term, it WILL put them out of business AND the price will climb while they claw their way out.",

        "body": "1.  Patience !!  Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away.  If you do - this whole plan falls apart.  Do not be tempted by small profits.  You need to hold and not sell.  We also have to keep buying.  For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers.\n\n2.  Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100.  If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher.  Please, everyone, stop saying \"lets get this to $30\" or \"let get this to 100\".  This has so much more potential than those low numbers.  Patience, and hold.  \n\n3.  How does a short squeeze work:  Watch this video &gt;&gt;&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY \n\n4.  What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling?  This video will show you:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc       \n\nFamiliarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.\n\n- They will manipulate the market to drop the price.  DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy.  DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.  \n\n5.  Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price.  Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period.  However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up.  The price, technically speaking, is infinite.  \n\n6.  Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account.  Just open another broker account and buy through there:  Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying.  If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.\n\n7.  Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing.  You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.\n\n8.  What is short selling:  &gt;&gt; https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp  \n\n9.  Short selling does not expire.  Options do expire.  Familiarize yourself with the difference.  Link here:  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp  \n\n10.  Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this.  With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.  \n\n11.  Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares.  Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading.  Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m).  Please understand the difference.\n\n12.  Again.  I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both.  To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up.  HOLD.  Buy, and HOLD.  Do not sell for small profits",

There were Wall Street folks who stood to gain by all of the WSB hype.

The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**\n\n \nShort Attack:\n\n1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n\n\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n\n\n3. Spread disinformation through \"analysis\" to get people to sell their stocks because \"the fundamentals aren't there\". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n\n\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.\n\n\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n\n\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n\n\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, \n[\"here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly\".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info, /u/blancochocolate)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*\n\nInvestopedia [\"Short and Distort\" - illegal short tactic ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are \u201cforced\u201d sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or \u201cprop\u201d desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing \u201cvolatility\u201d**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated \u201cdumps\u201d of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.\n\nsource: http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don't exist to scare us. They don't know our apps don't even have a sell button, only a liftoff button for the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19 \ud83c\udf14 \ud83c\udf16 \ud83c\udf1b \ud83c\udf1c \ud83c\udf15",

You could lose money,  or you could make a boatload of money - both are possible.**   \n \n\n**8. What is short selling: &gt;&gt;** [**https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)   \n \n\n**9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference.

Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.**   \n \n\n **11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the number of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the number of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.**   \n \n\n**12. Again. I  cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.**   \n \n\n**I hope this helps many.**",
