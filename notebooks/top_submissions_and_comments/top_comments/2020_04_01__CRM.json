Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

JEDI contract will help secure future government contracts and helps further to move the legacy applications from Cobol or whatever language to .Net/ C#\n3. Has Visual studio, .net ( asp.net, c# and vb.net) to compete against java. Also SQL server competes directly with Oracle DB\n4. New Xbox releasing this year\n5. Linked helps during hard times like this\n6. GIT Hub - 60% of the worlds open source software projects are stored on GIT hub\n7. Azure which is the crown jewel and competes with AWS\n8. VR/ AR with Hololens and hardware with surface\n9. I assume they will buy Service now or Sales force since Microsoft Dynamics is not that of a great CRM tool.",

All cloud SAAS in fact. Calls on \"cloud\" MDB, AMZN, SPLK, AKAM... (Wait WTF CRM?!)\n\nI've also talked to others at Uber, Airbnb, and their spend is down but not substantially. Just because nobody is traveling doesn't mean that the bulk of their cloud costs go away. That's how they get ya, scale up is easy, spin down is difficult. Also considering the operating cost of \"cloud\" is already budgeted, there's not generally a need or desire to reduce cost.\n\nWith absolute confidence, AWS internally is achieving a net higher level of compute utilization, meaning more of those processors racked up in the datacenter are generating revenue versus losses. AWS storage is similarly seeing increased utilization (most companies never delete data).\n\nNet result I believe is a substantial up for AWS and \"cloud\". Running my own numbers AWS revenue likely increased over 10%, AWS costs likely increased substantially less. Here's an example from Limelight networks:\n\n&gt; I'm very pleased with the quarter we just reported and the prospects for the remainder of 2020 and beyond. Let me review the details. Q1 revenue of $57 million is our highest reported first quarter revenue in our history.

Uber was oversold until they said they have plenty of cash to get through the crisis. Match Group was oversold until news came out that online dating app usage was up due to coronavirus.\n\nThe market is not intelligent lol. It\u2019s fucking stupid on certain things and very accurate on others. But don\u2019t assume the market is rational by any means. The market overvalues certain stocks while undervaluing others only to later be like \u201coh shit. Why did I miss that?\u201d\n\nMy investing is primarily in disruptive technologies and computing. I\u2019m an experienced software engineer and digital marketer who\u2019s run multiple businesses so yes, I better be smarter than the market when it comes to tech. Now with healthcare, I don\u2019t understand it at all whatsoever so I avoid it for the most part. The patents and R&amp;D flying around make me nervous and I don\u2019t understand how to pick winners outside of what analysts might recommend.\n\nBut yes, with tech, I understand technology. I work with this stuff everyday and have been following trends for over a decade. Am I smarter than half the market that doesn\u2019t even know how to work a computer? Yes. You\u2019re damn right I am.\n\nI could tell you exactly who is going to win the cloud wars and who is going to dominate IOT and 5G because I work with this stuff everyday. Microsoft for instance is the most underrated company out there today and going to kick ass over the next 5 years with Sateya Nadella at the helm. I can say that because I write applications in C#, use Azure, DevOps, and Xamarin. I\u2019ve tracked their company for over a decade and seen the good, bad, and the ugly. I understand Micron because we use their embedded microchips on our circuit boards. I understand AWS and Google Cloud cuz I\u2019ve actually used their stuff. I was around when Salesforce became a thing. I remember writing e-commerce applications before Shopify was a company. I was writing code before the first smartphone was released.\n\nHalf the people I talk to don\u2019t even know who AMD is or what they even do. They don\u2019t know the name Lisa Su or why AMD is kicking the shit out of Intel and why Nvidia should be damn nervous right now.\n\nSo all this bullshit about how people can\u2019t know more than the market is just plain stupid and insulting. Don\u2019t even trade stocks if you think that\u2019s true. Take your ETF gains and get the fuck off this sub",

        "body": "Sure. So, when I interview, I ask myself three things to weed thru candidates.     \n        \n1. Can they do creative, innovative things while following standards?              \n2. Could I and my team be locked in a room with them for a month without murdering them?     \n3. Do they specialize in anything I need?      \n       \nYou'd be surprised how many people only pass one of those, and maybe ~15-20% pass all three for even a Jr. dev spot.      \n       \nRegarding making things pretty, [Google Material](https://material.io/design/introduction/#principles) is a great way to learn principles of asthetics and functionality. Some love it, some hate it, but at the very least, the concepts are important to consider.     \n       \nRegarding \\#1, I look for recency of projects and tinkering. I especially like to see portfolio sites with git repos with change logs. It's rare, but it's so helpful for me and them -- even if the work isn't as strong as another candidate, just having the commits logged goes a long way with me. Also, you'd be amazed with how many devs don't know how to use git or GitHub.      \n      \nFor \\#2, I like candidates who understand that no one is perfect, including themselves. Teamwork is what makes great apps, and if you can't helpfully point out the errors of others or graciously accept someone pointing out your mistakes, no one wants you around. But, these people are obvious, and the fact that you're asking my advice here leads me to believe you'd do just fine on this one -- unless you microwave fish or clip your toenails at work or something.      \n      \nAnyway \\#3, the last guy I hired specialized in React with Postgres. Dude before that had a ton of AWS experience. Lady before him absolutely crushes with RXJS and Charts.js. Guy before that, NoSQL. Before him, Salesforce integration.      \n     \nYou can try to learn everything, and that's valuable in management positions, but knowing the nitty gritty details of a specialty is important and will help land jobs.    \n    \nI can't really tell you what to start learning, but I will say my favorite teacher is Max at Academind: https://academind.com/learn/our-courses/       \n       \nThe Academind YouTube Channel is also great, as is Fireship.io and the Fireship Youbube. I'm more of an Angular guy than React, but for React, I think my guys like Codevolution YouTube and I think FreeCodeCamp has a few great React courses. If you're willing to pay, there are dozens of great courses on LinkedIn Learning. That's what we use for continuing ed at our work. Each dev is required to watch one full course a month on their specific area. We also require one other course in an unrelated thing (e.g. project management, Photoshop, Marketing, Accounting, etc.) every other month. We want them to understand other's jobs so they can work with them well, or as background for if/when we automate job functions.     \n     \nHope that helps. Best of luck, mate.",

        "body": "Hey there! Happy to give some feedback. Overall, I think this portfolio is certainly on its way, but I'd really need to know your age-range, risk tolerance, and personal investment goals. That said, you are perhaps a young, growth-minded, and relatively risk-tolerant investor, based upon your holdings. I think the roughly 50% weighting in a large cap growth index fund is adequate. At that point, I think it's certainly acceptable to branch out into individual equities (again, this is only if my previous assumptions are correct).\n\nThat said, I would personally drop FTEC. Why? Because technology is a broad sector with lots of real, discernible winners in there. Instead of picking all of them, I'd load up on those winners. To me (and to you), MSFT is one of those winners. They dominate. They're well managed. They've got growth in the form of public cloud--a long-term secular tailwind. I'd also throw ADBE and CRM in there as well.\n\nAs for TSLA, I don't like the financials or dynamics of the auto business. Sure, they're not just an auto company, but that's a significant portion of their operations. Management-wise, Musk is an incredible innovator, but I don't see him as an equally incredible CEO. That's just a terribly brief version of my 2 cents, but if you know better, go on right ahead.\n\nAs for COST, I think it's a real winner. Sure, the valuation is rich, but it is seriously one of the best businesses around. I'd go so far as to say I like it even better than AMZN. Hope this helps. Good luck!",

I bought MSFT for $136, CRM for $119, NKE for $61, and MA for $215. However, right after I bought, we had the rally, and prices haven\u2019t really gotten back down to where I first bought in. This has been making me hesitant to continue buying in, because I thought prices would keep falling. Am I making a mistake by not continuing to buy in weekly? Do you think prices will get back down to those levels? I\u2019m worried that next week we\u2019ll have another \u201cbear market rally\u201d and prices won\u2019t get back down to where I\u2019m hoping. But I also realize that they could, it just may take longer than I\u2019m expecting. I also realize that by dollar cost averaging, I should stick to my set buying interval. Maybe weekly was to aggressive and I should do monthly? Thoughts?",

Microsoft Teams  will eat slacks lunch and the new office 365 cloud subscription model which started on 4/21 has teams included. I believe corporations will slowly dump slack because of the higher costs and join Teams. Unfortunately it cannot take on zoom as zoom is a superior video conferencing tool.\n2. JEDI contract will help secure future government contracts and helps further to move the legacy applications from Cobol or whatever language the state's are running to .Net/ C#\n3. Has Visual studio, .net ( asp.net, c# and vb.net) to compete against java. Also SQL server competes directly with Oracle DB\n4. New Xbox releasing this year\n5. Linked helps during hard times like this\n6. GIT Hub - 60% of the worlds open source software projects are stored on GIT hub\n7. Azure which is the crown jewel and competes with AWS\n8. VR/ AR with Hololens and hardware with surface\n9. I assume they will buy Service now or Sales force since Microsoft Dynamics is not that of a great CRM tool.\n10. If azure can prove its reliable for NBA, it will open doors for international games like Soccer, Formula1, Olympics etc..",

If you recall a couple of years ago, we laid that out we expect to be meaningfully above that\"\n\n&gt; Literally they hired, AlixPartners, a world-class consulting firm with particular expertise in performance improvement and cost optimization.\n\n&gt; its Q1 subscription revenue guidance calls for 10.5% y/y growth, which means that Cornerstone is planning for roughly 30% margins in 2020 (was 10% or something)\n\n&gt; most of Cornerstone's annual revenue is already locked in\n\n&gt; consolidated 2019 results suggest Saba will net roughly $250 million in annual subscription revenue for the company. Saba is also expected to \"substantially increase unlevered free cash flow\".\n\n&gt; Saba will at least increase market share in their respective markets.\n\nWell I at least should be critical, and these are some concerns:\n\n&gt; They are taking on a huge $985 million term loan to finance the deal.\n\n&gt;layoffs that are happening across the U.S. will lower Cornerstone's billings, which could lead to a lower subscription rate given their pricing schema\n\nHowever, I really believe that investors will take note when they see the free-cash flow they are generating, their improved operational margins combined with an un-modeled acquisition that represents 33% of their current revenue.\n\nMy prediction until earnings is this: $CSOD will retest $32.50 sometime by May 1. I think it lingers around $31.50-$32.50 until just before earnings where it breaks to the upside at $33.50. If earnings are a hit, maybe we see upward of $35-$37.",

Currently work for a security startup, so take my advice with a grain of salt.\n\nI would stay away from the ETFs right now. I don\u2019t think they provide a lot of value over something more generic, and I believe there will be a contraction in cyber security. Winners will win but overall it\u2019ll drop.\n\nA few reasons why: \n\nPre covid19- big vendors like Microsoft and AWS were already doing great adding security tooling to their enterprise IT offerings.\n\nTraditional AV... what consumer would buy that in a world of smartphones, tablets, and PCs that come with Defender?\n\nNetwork security gear is threatened by cloud vendors.\n\nMany security tools aren\u2019t made for modern development and IT management practices. A lot of old crap was made in the days where security teams could and would just say \u201cno you can\u2019t do that\u201d.\n\nA lot of old companies in cyber ETF fit that bill.\n\n**During** covid-19, I think a lot of companies will spend on remote work (Citrix, VPNs, Zoom, cloud services) - some of which actually benefits traditional security vendors.\n\n**Post** covid-19, I think many will try to have a GOOD remote work environment, and favor cloud based solutions, zero-trust setups with reverse proxies instead of VPNs, etc. Cisco did a good job buying Duo there, it bridges their gap between old and new. ZScaler has a huge valuation because it fit the description for that kind of modern tool to investors.\n\nThe next year will be interesting. I expect more consolidations l, acquisitions, and tamer VC funding and hopefully valuations that are more logical.\n\nTL;DR I wouldn\u2019t touch ETFs because I don\u2019t much of a lot of companies in them but there\u2019s going to be some change that\u2019ll open up the market to those innovating for real (few of which are publicly traded - but there\u2019s some).",

I also read many articles, some books and YouTube (i'll come to this later). \n\nThan I bought some ETF' and still was virtually trading. Once I got the feeling and experience I needed I started to invest and convert from ETF to stocks. \n\nIt was all OK, I was doing ok. Had like 5-6 stock's, gaining some one digit greens. \n\nAnd then I went full retard mode. I watched some daytrading YouTubers, I almost felt the thousand of dollars waiting for me to pick them up. I thought I know some tech analysis strategies, I thought I can time the market and I thought speculating is the way to go. \n\nIt wasn't. I lost 30%. Sort of depressing. I withdrew my money and waited until the feeling I need to get this back quickly is gone. \n\nWithout being emotional I went back to the market and started my initial process. And stayed there. And making money again. Not much, but making it. \n\nThe thing is once you have a strategy and even if it does work out in some cases- you can make a root cause analysis. And see what was wrong. When you gamble - there is no process behind this. Noting to review. You can't review bad luck... \n\nMy portoflio now looks as follows:\n\nLow risk: MSFT /JNJ / PHG\nMid risk: Netflix / Roku / Citrix / SAP / 3M / Biogen\nHigh risk: Tesla / Inseego\n\nI'm not very active, but also I cut loses quickly not wishing for a recovery. Sometimes good choice , sometimes bad. I stopped thinking though about the money I have not gained, I'm rather happy about the money I haven't possibly lost. \n\nAs you see with my portofilio im picking rather safe stocks, even if they are in my mid risk strategy part - they aren't really so risky.",

Its not a light switch.

Big correction - not really. \n\nI'll elaborate and this is my opinion. I might be very wrong like I've been many times. \n\nI think the market now has established the winners, companies doing ok and those who are majorly affected. That's sort of a stabilization in this time. We know who is who. Who's naked and who's well dressed up. \n\nWhile im sure Airlines, Cruises, Entertainment will keep getting smashed, on the other side companies like MSFT, NFLX or Citrix should do very well. \n\nSome of them will be corrected. Like Netflix - this stock will be corrected. Rather later then sooner, but will get a hit. \n\nMSFT? Not so much I think. Theyr AzureClouding and work from home systems are market leaders. \n\nI would not buy BA, MGM or Bank stocks. \n\nI agree 200% on:\n\n[...] we haven\u2019t seen the downstream effect on real demand yet. Even amazon is reporting an earnings miss\n\n\nAmazon is a very interesting case. While the demand on many products should make the company sales go down, on the other hand - if you think online shopping, Amazon pops up immediately. And this situation will speed up the online...ization of the world. \n\nI dont see a major S&amp;P correction due to the leaders pushing this train, but some stocks will be slaughtered. For sure\n\n\nI think mate we are actually on a similar page, just a different point of view and expression.",

They are having ER this week. Should rise even if it doesn't beat expectations as the outlook looks good. \n\nIdk about IBM. Haven't analysed them recently as since 2016 they were on a decline. They might be back on corona, but didn't hear anything great from them recently. Deeper analysis recommended.",

This could be a run-up play, or it could continue going up past earnings. $CSOD is barely above its lows from the crash and is in a pretty good position to start its bull run. I think one of the biggest things investors are looking for in $CSOD is free cash flow, and according to the CEO:\n\n&gt; we now believe our standalone unlevered free cash flow will be meaningfully higher than that.\n\nI even think this \"meaningfully higher\" comment, is even higher. This quote comes from before March where we learned that their activity stats are through the roof. Their subscriptions have likely gone up, which means their free cash flow has probably grown significantly. This signals to investors a place to safely park investments.",
