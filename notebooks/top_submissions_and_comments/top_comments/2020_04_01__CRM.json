Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

JEDI contract will help secure future government contracts and helps further to move the legacy applications from Cobol or whatever language to .Net/ C#\n3. Has Visual studio, .net ( asp.net, c# and vb.net) to compete against java. Also SQL server competes directly with Oracle DB\n4. New Xbox releasing this year\n5. Linked helps during hard times like this\n6. GIT Hub - 60% of the worlds open source software projects are stored on GIT hub\n7. Azure which is the crown jewel and competes with AWS\n8. VR/ AR with Hololens and hardware with surface\n9. I assume they will buy Service now or Sales force since Microsoft Dynamics is not that of a great CRM tool.",

Has Visual studio, .net ( asp.net, c# and vb.net) to compete against java. Also SQL server competes directly with Oracle DB\n4. New Xbox releasing this year\n5.

VR/ AR with Hololens and hardware with surface\n9. I assume they will buy Service now or Sales force since Microsoft Dynamics is not that of a great CRM tool.\n10.

Right now Atlassian trades on 21x forward sales with 31% sales growth, Okta trades on 21x forward sales with 32% sales, etc, so Zoom could conceivably trade higher than 20x forward sales in a couple years time.",

It includes payment processing as well as part of the monthly fee.\n\nFrom my experience, people are very slow to cancel subscriptions tied to their websites, especially when it\u2019s not breaking the bank. This is how Shopify retains its business and continues to grow.\n\nIt\u2019s competition has never and will likely never catch up. I\u2019ve used platforms like BigCommerce, Magento, and even dated a gal that worked at Volusion in Austin and none of them stack up with what Shopify offers.\n\nShopify is right up there with Adobe and Salesforce as a great growth stock to own with all subscription based revenue.

The room to growth becomes very questionable when a lot of these e-commerce companies have been burning cash, the whole model is now under question. VC funding has stopped, completely.\n\nDropshipping is likely to be another casualty in post COVID world - cheap stuff from China, which is mostly consumer discretionary, isn't going to grow 50% a year with unemployment rising, if anything businesses will see declining sales of these. You might see unemployed people starting more of these business, but they'll not offset decline in merchant solutions revenue (dependent on sales).\n\n3) Unlike Amazon, Shopify doesn't control it's destiny. It relies on its sellers to be successful. I do like the fulfilment aspect but again, Shopify relies on its sellers to be successful selling through their own marketing- it doesn't bring organic traffic to its customers the way Amazon does.

Huge differences, marketspace has grown significantly and Intel is dropping the ball right now? That's what happens when you feel too fucking comfortable. Large corps sign multi-year contracts with Intel, it's not a switch one year to another. Take Salesforce for example, look at the almost decade long contracts they've signed. Right now companies are giving AMD a shot and they have been taking advantage of taking market share now, this is what truly matters, you can look at history 10-20 years ago if you want, but that won't tell you anything about today's market. Can Intel get their shit together and recapture the tiny marketshare they lost and prevent further fleeing? Yeah, they definitely have a shot. AMD is poaching their people and it has been playing well into their strategy. Intel has hopefully been getting it's shit together, however this doesn't discount AMDs strategy and execution these last few years, yeah they got real lucky as well. Servers are another huge area AMD has been killing it recently. Anyway, yes valuation is high, however consider how the market has been changing and all the large contracts expiring and about to expire. \n\nAs for Tesla, very optimistic, they are far ahead of themselves, however they will lead past vehicles, they'll be laying down future infrastructure and grow much larger than anyone expected imo, however it's a ways away so they'll have their ups and downs imo.

Sitting on a shit ton of cash everyone waiting for him to buy anything and instead he sticks to his guns, says everything is overvalued, and gives money back to shareholders.\n\nNow, especially if we do have another leg down, he has enough cash on hand to acquire companies for half of their market cap 2 months ago. \n\nHe wouldn't have sold Delta shares during the \"rally\" if he thought it was truly a V shaped recovery. \n\nI'm with the Oracle.

Look back over time at how the stonk tends to trade around VWAP and the upper/lower bands.\n\nMost of the time, you should see that the stock will want to \"float\" back to VWAP throughout the day-sometimes it doesn't, but it's better than just trying to trace a chart with your finger on robinhood and guestimate purely off price and not volume.\n\nCombine this with time and sales flow to get an idea as to the momentum.  It's something you need to just play with and get a feel for.\n\nMy approach is basically - has the stock plunged well below VWAP, and pierced the lower bound?  I probably wouldn't go short but will consider going long to catch a bounce back to VWAP.  Inverse?  Consider going the other way.  Sitting at VWAP and VWAP is flat?  Probably won't touch it as I'm not an oracle  \n\n\nIt's not a silver bullet though and won't always work - I've seen SPY explode over VWAP and just keep reaching upwards, beyond the upper band.

Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

The only top of the mind thoughts I had are:\n\nGo with individual stocks if you enjoy stock picking, you can index in your 401k and ESOP.\n-drop oracle from the list\n- add AYX and possibly ANET to your tech list, everything else on there looks great.\n- I like higher growth names in healthcare as well, LVGO, GH, HQY come to mind as all long term plays (I also own Illumina, watching NVTA but don\u2019t love it)\n- PINS and SFIX seem to have a lot of upside from current levels as well, (SFIX popped pop my radar due to incredible amounts of insider buying). \n\nHope this gives you some decent ideas, either approach seems well thought out and would work fine.  I guess it depends on how much time you want to dedicate to it and how much you enjoy stock picking.",

Similar as it is in the world of investing in mutual funds/ETFs in a 401k/IRA (diversify and avoid pricey managed load-fee funds) there is such a thing as diversifying in options trades (not all-in on SPY or SPY and QQQ, place only small % on a position, include a contrarian position, don't overpay, always keep sufficient \"dry powder\"/cash equity that allows for repositioning in trades you believe in but market moved against in near term, have plan when to enter/exit before making a trade, don't get emotional, cut losses sooner rather than later, etc).  \n\nYou know you're in trouble if this applies:  \n\n\\--&gt; If you catch yourself using the word \u201chope\u201d.

The reason he got such a huge following was because his earliest posts seem to do just that and as time moved forward it became clear to everyone that no one can predict and not even the most detailed thorough TA can give away clues for what will happen a week+ down the road.  \n\nHave a fun ride on this rollercoaster of a market!

Right before the first discovery of the books being cooked we had recommended he take $10 mm of his company stock and do a Charitable Remainder Trust.  I forgot exactly what his lifetime income would have been....like half a million a year.  He declined and so he lost about $70 mm when the stock tanked.   They moved the hdqtrs to Colorado from Silicon Valley and somehow clawed their way back to profitability and a high stock price.  The second time I met with the client we recommended a $5 mm CRT again to lock in some diversification and life time income as well as generate some tax deduction so he could sell some of his low basis company stock.  Again he declined.  The second time he lost nearly all of what was that time about $60 mm of stock.  Brilliant people don't always make the best decisions.",

If the answer is no, then perfect, that's the problem that smart contracts solve. Trustless transactions.\n\nPersonally I'm bullish on: Ethereum, Chainlink, IOTA, Bitcoin.\n\nBTC: I see this as being an eternal legacy store of value. Highly illiquid, should be treated as digital gold. The hedge of the space.\n\nEth: Most promising and popular platform for innovation, moving to proof-of-stake meaning improvements to efficiency and it's got a better 'at scale' thanks to the addition of layer 2 development on top.\n\nChainlink: 'The' Oracle network. This requires a bit of technical knowledge to understand, but this network works in conjunction with other types of DLTs. It solves the biggest problem of smart contract technology. Essentially it lets DLT applications make API calls to external systems (the web). I'm most bullish on this by far.\n\nIOTA: an outlier, a potential game changer. A more exploratory type of network that uses DAG tech which could ultimately be the fastest and cheapest per transaction. The team has made great progress and this tech has the potential to disrupt the rest, but their scope of work and vision is massive.",

JEDI contract will help secure future government contracts and helps further to move the legacy applications from Cobol or whatever language the state's are running to .Net/ C#\n3. Has Visual studio, .net ( asp.net, c# and vb.net) to compete against java. Also SQL server competes directly with Oracle DB\n4. New Xbox releasing this year\n5. Linked helps during hard times like this\n6. GIT Hub - 60% of the worlds open source software projects are stored on GIT hub\n7. Azure which is the crown jewel and competes with AWS\n8. VR/ AR with Hololens and hardware with surface\n9. I assume they will buy Service now or Sales force since Microsoft Dynamics is not that of a great CRM tool.\n10. If azure can prove its reliable for NBA, it will open doors for international games like Soccer, Formula1, Olympics etc..",
