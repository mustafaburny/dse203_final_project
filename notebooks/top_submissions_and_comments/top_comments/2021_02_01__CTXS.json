        "body": "To play devil\u2019s advocate here: Many people don\u2019t get excited about dips because they don\u2019t have any money, or very much money sitting on the sidelines. I see advice on here all the time telling people to not attempt timing the market. People point to studies saying \u201clump sum investing beats trying to time the market\u201d. So lots of people buy ETFs or index funds of various sorts and \u201clump sum\u201d invest. If they don\u2019t have years of experience behind them, then they start to panic and think they\u2019re doing it wrong when their numbers turn all red. A lot of subreddits are filled with people sharing how much money they\u2019ve made from whatever strategy they employed. It makes sense that these new investors feel disheartened from their efforts. \n\nI know someone who just invested a ton of money in the past few months and are now seeing lots of red. One example is they bought 100 shares of Apple at $139 and this morning realized they were down about $2,100. Now all they talk about is selling it. \n\nI encourage people to take emotions out of investing (including feeling excited about dips) because it is an event to understand rather than have emotional reactions to. Dips are a time to re-evaluate their holdings. If they are good holdings and the outlook is good continue to hold or buy more. If they are uncomfortable holding it further then move the money into something else. If you get excited about every dip then you are prone to buying irrationally which just as bad as selling irrationally. \n\nContinuously buying dips is potentially a great strategy and also potentially dangerous. I know people who bought tons of GE back in the year 2000. It was the biggest company in the world. It was \u201cApple\u201d back then. As it dipped they kept buying more and more and to this day they are still down (20+ years later) over 70% in that holding. This is dangerous. If that money were invested in the S&amp;P 500 for example they would\u2019ve come out much better. Same thing happened with Qualcom, Hewlett-Packard, AOL, Merck, Ericsson and so on and so on. In the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s people bought the dips endlessly on these stocks and never recovered or waited like 20 years before it finally recovered. These were not small unheard of companies. These companies were heavily traded and hotly talked about stocks back then. They were big deals back in their day. Microsoft and Google turned out to be great long term holds but Yahoo and AOL did not. It\u2019s easy to look back in time and judge it all, but back then people made very convincing cases for why AOL and YHOO would be the best.  They were convincing at the time but history proved them wrong. \n\nThis is why I encourage ETF investing, especially if you are a novice investor. Betting on AOL and Yahoo would\u2019ve lost a person a lot of money but investing on the whole rise of the internet/PC is great because Microsoft and Google more than made up for it. It\u2019s also why I encourage people to re-evaluate their holdings regularly (monthly is probably best). I also encourage dividend investing but that\u2019s a slightly different thing from this discussion. \n\nYes, dips can be a time to buy more, but they are also an invitation to re-evaluate one\u2019s holdings without emotions. I often buy during dips but I caution people about buying everything during every dip. In my 25 years of investing I\u2019ve become a fairly conservative investor (very boring portfolio) so take my old man advice for whatever you think it\u2019s worth, I guess.",

I diversified in DAL, HPE, HPQ, WFC, and BRK.b and got a loss on all of them because I got bored of waiting.\n\nNow I opted to split my account, have $2k in a long-term automatic portfolio and $1k I mess around with day trading. My strategy is to look for big market caps taking a sudden drop for a very reactionary reason (earnings a few % below expectation but generally considered a good company still) and buy at those prices and sell at 5-10% return.",

He believed in their model of selling PCs they built to business customers.  He followed the company religiously.  \n\nThen years later, all of a sudden the company decided to get on the low margin business of selling TVs to retail customers.  Dell never built their own TVs sonthey were just another reseller.\n\nThis caused my client to decide to sell his now $1 million in Dell.
