Think of the way they counted dinosaurs at Jurassic Park (the book) where the system counted anything it found and stopped at what the designated number (238 dinosaurs) because the system was programmed to stop there. So it never took into account that there could be more dinosaurs. Until Malcom suggested a change to the parameters and the system showed there were 292 dinosaurs now on the island.  \nThe DOL does the same thing.   \nThings they don't use as data:  \n1 worker multiple jobs because all jobs added are under the fulltime threshold of 40 hours.  \n\"Left the market\" - once you're off unemployment, you don't exist.   \nPay - Are these 1 million minimum wage jobs? 1 million middle class sustainable jobs?   \nWhat is work? Content creators, craftspeople with their own shops or Etsy, freelancers, driving rideshares/gig economy, etc..   \nHours - If you are working 12 hours a week and get a paycheck, if it runs through one of the payroll services (Paychex, ADP) you are counted.   \nUncompensated labor - taking care of family, old or disabled. These people are putting a lot of work in, but \"it doesn't contribute to the GDP\".  \nThese numbers are pageantry with no substance. But, you know - gotta pump those numbers up to juice the market.   \nBecause you know, the market is the economy. /s",
