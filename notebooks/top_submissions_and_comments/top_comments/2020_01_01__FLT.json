        "body": "In super simple terms:   \nA short sell means borrowing a stock in order to sell it - promising the original owner you'll pay them back the original stock at a future date. Imagine Joey thinks Company A's stock is too high at $100. If he wants to short sell the Company A's stock, he could go to a broker and borrow someone else's share (in this case he could borrow Jimmy's stock) and sell it at $100 - promising to give Jimmy back his share in the future. If Joey is right, and the stock drops to $80, then he can buy back Company A's share at $80 (and give it to Jimmy) and keep $20 for himself. If on the other hand Company A's share goes up to $120, Joey is out of luck and will have to pay $120 to give back the share to Jimmy - thereby losing $20. You can see why short selling is dangerous - in this situation, Jimmy at most could have gained $100 (if Company A's price had collapsed to zero), but at most could have lost an infinite amount of money.   \n\n\nSo what do you do if you want to bet against a company, but don't want to short sell? You might instead consider a put option. A put option is buying the right to sell a company's stock (for a premium) at a specific price (known as the strike) on a specific date\\*. So instead of short selling, maybe Joey will buy a put option that says for $1 he can buy the right to sell Company's stock for $100 in one year. If in a year the price of the stock is above $100, then the option will expire worthless - as anyone would rather sell at a higher price than at $100. If the price is below $100 in a year, then Joey will be able to exercise his option and take his earnings. Unlike selling short, now Joey is at most only losing the premium of the option, and at best earning $100.   \n\n\nA call option is the opposite of a put option. A call option is buying the right to buy a stock at a given price on a future date. For $1 Joey might be able to buy the right to buy a shares of Company A for $100 in 1 year. If the shares are above $100 in a year, he'll make money, if they're below his options will expire worthless.   \n\n\nOptions are slightly tricky in that their value is not just comprised of the difference between share price and the exercise price, but also volatility and time value. You can read more about Black Scholes which is how options are priced elsewhere. You can also read about strategies about combining patterns of options to construct more sophisticated trades (like iron condors).\n\n  \n\\* Note - European and American options are different here.",

This counts are ordinary income for the market value of the stock on the day you receive it.\n2) Selling the stock for a profit. This counts as a short-term or long-term capital gain (depending on how long you held it) of the amount its price increased by.\n\nFor example, suppose you received a free share of AAPL on July 30, 2019. AAPL closed at $213.04 that day, so you would report $213.04 as income. Now suppose you sold it on December 31, 2019 for $291.52. Your short-term capital gain is $291.52 - $213.04 = $78.48.

        "body": "Iran and the US probably made a deal where Iran had to give up its power in the region in exchange for easing the sanctions. The price? Iran has to give up its Quds leader. In one move, Khamenei has also consolidated his own power by taking out someone who, in the past, has threatened military coups in the event of left-wing movements and relations with the US. By doing this, he has severely reduced Sepah\u2019s power while simultaneously allowing for sanctions to be gradually eased. Most people don\u2019t understand this, but IRGC is getting so powerful that it is actually threatening the very existence of the Iranian government as it is. Soleimani was essentially its key leader, and by giving him up, Khamenei has consolidated his power. This is what most likely has occurred. Otherwise, why did it take so long for the US to kill this guy? He\u2019s been active in Iraq and Syria for the past decade.\n\nAlso, some IRGC hardliners wanted Soleimani to run for president. There\u2019s an internal war between the clerics and the IRGC for power in Iran. While someone like Rouhani or Ahmadinejad could just be puppets for Khamenei, Soleimani would actually not be a puppet president. Given that Rouhani is also in his last term, if Soleimani ran, he could present as a viable candidate. The only way that Khamenei could consolidate power for the clerics was to take him out. Again, if you were in Iran right now or know about how the Iranian government works, this scenario would probably be what you would be thinking right now as well.",

The orders from e.g. the hedge fund quant traders are much higher risk for the MM because they're informed: if those quants start buying heavy, they probably know something. The MMs now have much higher risk on their inventory. Because the MMs have this possibility of much higher risk, they have to be compensated for it: **market makers widen their bid-ask spreads where they may be trading against informed adversaries**.\n\nNow, a firm that has a PFOF agreement with a broker such as Robinhood knows exactly what kind of orders to expect: uninformed orders that are as good as a coin flip, from a clueless trader sitting on his couch. This carries much less risk. For this reason, MMs don't need such a wide bid-ask spread as they would need to post on the public exchanges. With the lower risk, they can afford to (1) pay Robinhood for their customers' orders, and (2) trade with narrower bid-ask spreads ultimately giving retail traders better prices than NBBO.\n\nYou can read more on this topic if you search for *adverse selection*.",

During a recession certain sectors or industries perform better, these are typically tied to what is viewed as a necessity to the consumer. An example would be utilities. \n\nNow, if you are asking who will survive recessions, a good indicator is the leverage ratio. How much is funded with debt compared to equity? This helps assess financial health of a company. You can look at days cash as well. This answers how many days of operations can the company fund purely off the cash on it's balance sheet. Total assets turnover or TAT can show how well the companies assets are used to produce sales. There are several others, but I think this is sufficient to send you on your path. \n\nDuring a recession you may find it easier to just pick ETFs that track underlying growth indexes and buy them at a cheap entry. Check out the performance of the Nasdaq 100 from 2009 to now. Looks tasty right? Not to say those market conditions will be replicated, but a similar strategy may be easier with lower risk than picking individual stocks. Good luck!",

Are these assumptions right? Assuming they are correct... \n\n- First thing, it might be more helpful if you include a more precise specification of the contracts you're trading, especially when you report about past trades.\n\nEg, today there's no F options with 16 DTE. Someone looking at this in 1 month might be confused. In this case, it seems that you're talking about Jan 17th expiration. Same for GPRO. \n\nAlso, it's useful to mention the trade price. In this case I can't really know how much you bought the options for.\n\n- Second thing, you seem to be calculating the return wrong. \n\nIt seems like you calculated return as how much the cash balance changed on that week. This is not how it's done.\n\nYou have to compare account values, which is not the same as cash balance. The reason for this is that while you do have the assets in form of cash, you also have liabilities (the short options). \n\nYour \"week one starting account value\" is 5k.\n\nYour \"week one ending account value\" is equal to your ending cash balance *minus how much those options are worth now*.\n\nYour F option closed Friday at 0.09 so the position is worth -9 USD. Your GPRO option closed at 0.07 so the position is worth -7 USD. Your cash balance is 5000 + 5.85 + 3.85 = 5009.70 USD. Adding it all together, you find the ending value.\n\nThe ending value is 4993.70 USD. This is a P/L (or loss) of 6.30 USD. \n\n**Week one return is then a loss of -0.126%.**\n\n- Third, in regards to the strategy itself.\n\nThe amount you're collecting in premium seems incredibly low. This is because (1) the underlyings are super low priced, and (2) your options are very close to expiration. \n\nThis leads to a situation where you're collecting almost no premium, a significant percentage of which is being spent on fees, and you have pretty significant risk due to a lot of Gamma. \n\nOne way to improve that is to sell options with more DTE, for example. You'll collect more premium, the percentage of premium you spend is fees is significantly reduced, and so is your gamma risk.",

        "body": "Strictly as a broker:\n\n1. Fidelity is the best all round broker by a small margin because you get cash on your sweep account without having to manually move into money market. Vanguard also pays cash (more than Fidelity) on their sweep accounts but Vanguard is lacking in the technology department as far as their app and web platform so I prefer Fidelity.\n2. Most of the other brokers don't really have enough differentiating factors in my opinion to say one is \"better\" than another. Vanguard is great, but their technology is lacking. Between the others, they all have easy to use apps and websites. Etrade, Schwab, and Ally tend to have the better website platforms and highly rated Android and iPhone apps. IBKR and possibly TD Ameritrade are good for advanced traders. If you don't go with fidelity, I would literally just choose based on which app or web platform you like the most.\n\nBroker plus other banking services:\n\n* The Fidelity rewards 2% cashback credit card is good enough to serve as a primary credit card. For this reason, combining your broker and credit card platform both at Fidelity for simplicity is a good option. Fidelity also offers a checking account with fee free/reimbursed ATM usage but their checking account platform is not as good as Schwab or BoA.\n* Schwab is a great all round broker. Although they do not pay cash on sweep accounts, their easy to use and fee free/reimbursed checking accounts make up for it. I personally use Schwab for brokerage and checking (and an Amex credit card).\n* Ally Invest should be way more popular than it is. Their saving account rates speak for themselves so combining Ally savings/checking/brokerage accounts is a win win win situation. Their web platform for brokerage is also excellent and might be my favorite overall. They also have a large ATM network and will reimburse up to $10 in ATM fees per month.\n* Etrade offers a checking account with unlimited free ATM usage and fee reimbursement and a competitive rate Savings account. Etrade's offerings are very similar to Ally Invest in my opinion. I don't know how one would choose between the two except that I like Ally's website and app more. With things changing so quickly at brokers right now, I'm not sure that Ally Invest, or especially Etrade, are sustainable. I could see Etrade being acquired very soon. This is another reason why I stick with Schwab.\n* Merrill Edge combined with their Preferred Rewards program is excellent and if you have enough assets with them you get up to 5.25% cash back on a no annual fee credit card for a category of your choice, 3.5% cash back on groceries, and 1.75% cashback on everything else. You really can't beat this. If you have enough assets with BoA/Merrile Edge, you also get unlimited ATM fee free/reimbursed.\n* Chase YouInvest is a decent platform but it feels really new and not fully fleshed out. They only added options trading a few months ago I believe and they definitely have the most basic platform being only a couple notches above Robinhood as far as features which can be a good and bad thing since it is pretty simple to use. Now that they have options trading, I would recommend Chase YouInvest, especially if you are going to combine your assets at Chase. Like BoA Merrill Edge, you have to have a certain amount of assets with Chase to get fee free ATM usage with reimbursement.\n* TD Ameritrade is a great brokers with nothing much to offer by way of banking features or their own investment products. Because of this I am not surprised that TD was acquired. They have an advanced trading platform but I'm not sure that it's worth it since they have below average app reviews on Android. I basically use my phone for everything and so the app is really important to me. For these reasons TD Ameritrade didn't really stand out to me.\n\n\\*\\*One other caveat....if you trade inverse and leveraged ETFs such as UVXY or TQQQ, respectively, certain brokers do not allow trading of these securities. Vanguard and Chase do not allow trading of either. Merrill Edge does not allow trading of inverse ETFs. If not for this I would probably be with Merrill Edge in order to get the 5.25% cashback credit card or Chase to utilize their credit cards and checking account. I know Fidelity and Schwab allow trading of either leveraged or inverse ETFs, but I am not sure about the other brokers.\n\n\\*\\*\\*I have personally used Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, and Chase YouInvest extensively. I have experimented with Merrill Edge, Ally Invest, and Etrade.",

In my opinion you should never be all in cash, and if you do hold cash it should only be because you are without a stable income, so that you can\u2019t average down if something drops, and you need that reserve cash.\nThat\u2019s just how a I like it.\n\nIronically with the new earnings projections the stock is actually cheaper, compared to it\u2019s expected cash flow, then it was 3 months ago. So from a fundamental standpoint you are better of buying the stock now, then you were 3 months ago.\nAlthough if you ask me, then I think cash flow estimates are a bit too optimistic looking 5-10 years out.",

        "body": "Ok. If you're going to play vix options, there's something everyone needs to understand.  The options are not based on the spot VIX. They are essentially based on vix futures for the corresponding month. \n\n That makes buying calls doubly expensive. Because let's say for example, you want to buy the April 15 call.  The April future is at 17.1 right now. So calls on that 15 strike are already ITM, and you're going to pay $3.20 for them. But as expiration gets closer,  the futures also converge to the spot price. Meaning if vix stays under 15 the future price is going to gradually decay and you lose money on not just the option price due to theta,  but also on the fact that the underlying future is decaying.  \n\nSo if you're going to do this,  I would highly recommend spreading it. If you buy a 15C, at least sell a higher strike. Maybe a 22C. Sure you cap your upside,  but you also save a dollar on premium. \n\nTLDR: VIX options are a bitch if you don't understand them",
