Trust me, they spend an absolutely crazy amount of money and effort to track down and shutdown fraudulent stores. They use both automation and manual reviews of accounts, and have some very impressive detection technology in place. They also restrict all sorts of high risk type stores from their gateway outright.\n\nThey operate their own payment gateway, and both Visa and Mastercard hold heavy obligations to gateway owners when it comes to preventing fraud. Shopify has one of the more sophisticated programs Ive ever seen in my career in SAAS.\n\nThe main issue with that type of fraud prevention, is that its always inevitable that fraudsters will start recognizing the approach Shopify uses to detect them, and then they change their patterns. This results generally in a wave of fraudulent stores getting through until reported. Its really an endless game of cat and mouse, and theres some very big companies around the world that constantly open stores and attempt to get around the preventative measures. \n\nTo say that scams don't violate their T&amp;C and that Shopify doesnt care is just downright ridiculous. In the end of the day Shopify ends up eating the costs of the chargebacks when visa and mastercard come calling. Its not only 100% in their best interest to combat fraudulent stores, but they are fully obligated to by owning a payment gateway.",

        "body": "This doesn't capture the full story though. Note that after the end of the Bretton Woods system (the policy of pegging US dollars into gold), the US dollar was able to maintain its status as a world reserve currency by using petrodollar recycling (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrodollar_recycling). In simple terms, observing that oil is what drives the whole production of goods, you go to Middle East companies with a shit ton of oil and make a deal: \"I'll protect your land with our strong military, in exchange you sell all your oil in only our US dollars.\" Since everyone needs oil to make stuff (not just for fuel, it has a ridiculously large amount of utility), every country in the planet now needs to have dollars to fuel their economy, so demand for US dollars skyrockets worldwide.\n\nThe problem is, in order to keep the status quo of the dollar from being a global currency, you need to have a constant outflux of dollars from the country, so that is why the US has become an import-driven country with immensely large trade deficits. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triffin_dilemma) As a result, deindustrialization sweeps the country while cheap imports from the overseas replace domestic products, and the country has effectively become one fucking giant shopping mall, all thanks to the troops on Saudi Arabia. Industrial areas heavy affected by deindustrialization (such as the Rust Belt) are fucked over decades, and as a result right-wing populism (ex. Trump) rises as a reactionary force against globalism.\n\nAnother problem: who benefits from the US dollar being a global currency? Mainly the bankers (who get to keep churning out dollar-related financial products), and global megacorporations (who get to conduct businesses with credit from the banks). Also, and as bankers start to be the dominant force in politics, credit becomes a solution for everything, so the government let people \"borrow\" their way out of stagnant low wages and high costs of living (such as housing, medical care, and education) instead of fixing the fundamental problems. This all leads to accelerating economic inequality (especially for the millenials). And while the government bails out large banks and corporations for making risky or even fraudulent decisions (using the well known PRINTER GO BRRR), now there is an increasing left-wing populist voice (ex. Bernie) to fuck those bankers and corporations, and use that newly printed money to the actual people instead. \n\nWhile in the states the status-quo Democrats and Republicans (the neolibrerals) are increasingly pressured by populism from both sides (left/right wing), from the foreign world it's going to be a game of musical chairs - it's going to be about who dumps the dollar first. And probably China is going to fire the trigger at some point, as they have stopped buying US treasuries for their surplus dollars from their exports starting from 2013, and instead is loaning those dollars off to other third-world countries for them to build infrastructure, and in return expand their political influence around the world. Also, rethink why China is trying to invest a shit ton of money into renewable energy, they're not just doing this for the \"environment\", they're also doing it to detach themselves from the petrodollar system. A self-sustainable energy grid without dependence on resources from foreign countries ensures that you'll be more independent from fluctuating oil prices, as well as the political/economical instabilities surrounding it (for example, the Iranian revolution leading to the 1979 oil crisis). \n\nIn conclusion, the US is fucked, and unless you change this current system, coronavirus isn't going to be easily eradicated, and mass evictions and riots will continue to happen. It's either a slow, painful death (maintain the system until it disintegrates) or a quick one (actually try to overhaul the system from what you have).\n\nThe words got a little bit dense because it's rather insufficient to capture the problems of the neoliberal US economical/political system in a single Reddit comment. For a much detailed explanation, I recommend reading the article \"The Fraying of the Petrodollar System\" (https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/), as well as Mark Blyth's talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGuaoARJYU0) if you don't like reading too much.",

Think basic stuff like Apple, Walmart, Visa. Stocks you won't see swing too wildly in price. Other stocks with more volatility, such as Tesla, have a 65% maintenance requirement.\n\nMaintenance requirement means the amount of your investment you need to *personally own.* I can sit on $100,000 in Apple stock (and realize the gains of 100k of apple) that I only had $30,000 to pay for. Schwab would front me the other $70,000, if I had appropriate collateral in my account. Keep in mind if it drops by a penny, I'm now in a maintenance call.\n\nAnyway, because of GME's recently crazy volatility, they bumped the maintenance requirement to 200%. If I have $10k in GME, not only do I need to own those shares outright, it's going to eat into another $10k off of the rest of my marginable securities, forcing me to have more equity in my account. Schwab also put a 200% maint req on Kodak when that crazy bullshit was going on.",

        "body": "I just started my own company - the second time I've done this in Canada.  I wanted to say \"This isn't true!\" when I read the article, but the further I read, the more I agreed with it.  \n\nMy first company has succeeded and is a Canadian success story - a public biotech, though I was pushed out after 3 years, so I wasn't part of it from start to end.  I was there as CSO long enough to do SR&amp;ED, though.  It was soul-sucking.  I've heard others use that term and I whole heartedly agree.  Soul-sucking is exactly the right word for it.  However, the company was a biotech, so it was possible to build those milestones and write all those summaries in a way that didn't rip out all of the innovation from the company.  The whole thing fell to me to write it up, so the engineers were isolated from it while I was there.\n\nThis time around, I'm CEO, and we've taken a different strategy.  We will look for Canadian funds, eventually, but our first investors are international, and we're trying to draw Bay Area money north.  We're going to pretend we're in the Bay Area, really, and just do things the Bay Area way.  I spent the last 6 years there at startups, and I've got a good sense of what that culture entails.  There are ways to bring that culture North.\n\nI have to say, though, that this trap is worse than even the article suggests.  My co-founder isn't canadian, but we want to bring him to Canada to continue working here.  The time zone difference to Europe is kinda rough, and we can't do it forever.  However, in order to bring him here on a startup founders visa, we need to have a Canadian investor - exactly what the article warns is one of the problems.  It's not sufficient to have investors, it has to be an investor from the list of \"acceptable Canadian investors.\"  That is utter bullshit, but hey, we're still too small to argue that with the government.\n\nAs the article points out - Canada thinks it's helping startups, but in reality, it's stifling them.",

Check out Peter\u2019s reaction in the opening moments of this clip when he gets asked if they\u2019re building the next $400bn company.  \n\nThey are one million percent going public now and it is highly likely to be through CCIV given the SPAC size. After seeing all these Lucid commercials on TV 24/7, I am actually beginning to think the rumor was purposely leaked by Lucid to create hype around their public debut ahead of car launch this spring.
