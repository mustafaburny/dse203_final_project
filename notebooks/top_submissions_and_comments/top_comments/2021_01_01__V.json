Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:\n\nWe were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.\n2.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.\n3.\t\u2060\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n5.\t\u2060\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n6.\t\u2060\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n7.\t\u2060\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.\n\nI saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.

It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.

They provide deep insight with plenty of url references for you to check out the source material for yourself.\n\nTwo Part Video Series (18 min total) about the SEC's Investigation Of Naked Shorting Of Sedona. A case study on how naked short sellers have destroyed hundreds and hundreds of publicly traded companies. He then goes on to explain how this can go on to effect the broader market:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5cMQLJRUo&amp;t=8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5cMQLJRUo&amp;t=8s)\n\nNine part (Approx 80 min total) series about the corruption of our capital markets due to naked short selling and \"failures to deliver\". He goes over a number of topics just as FTD's (Failures to deliver), how prevalent they are, how long they can last for and the risk they pose to the financial system. He also talks about the DTCC and it's role in clearing money and shares through the market and how it has a history of downplaying the amount of FTD's. Just watch the first (5 min) video and you'll be hooked:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWzOjB8qtU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWzOjB8qtU)\n\nIf you didn't watch the above series at least watch part 5 where he explains how the entire market could collapse as a result of a short squeeze on a heavily naked shorted stock:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKc0KQvvfWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKc0KQvvfWE)\n\n&lt;1 min Video of SEC Chairman stumbling over his words as he answers the question \"do you know of the possibility of short selling taking down Bear Stearns\":\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKWiE\\_rKXk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKWiE_rKXk)\n\nVideo explaining how someone bought WAYYY OTM weekly puts on Bear Stearns the day before Bear Stearns started tanking due to over ten million illegal naked short sells and how this started the Global Financial Crisis:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUKSU1qahgE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUKSU1qahgE)\n\nPart 2 of the above video where he goes over the SEC's lack of response to the naked short selling of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcjssQSthNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcjssQSthNU)\n\nPart 3 about how hundreds of millions of naked short sales of Lehman Brothers stock put the final nail in the coffin of the company causing the GFC. The SEC did nothing. Hedge fund managers like Jim Chanos and Steve Cohen have too much money and power to ever be prosecuted:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48eSoTNByQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48eSoTNByQ)\n\n3 Min Video of a debate on Bloomberg where this Wall Street guy is arguing that short sellers should be able to sell short at will and should never have to actually borrow shares to be able to short:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oerYirYVFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oerYirYVFE)\n\nThe Bear raid on Overstock.com and the journalists that enabled it (10 min):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHQeZ9czrKc&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHQeZ9czrKc&amp;t=4s)\n\nCase study: In the final days of selling of Lehman Brothers stock there we over 150M failures to delivery naked shares sold short when the stock was selling for about $0.10. Imagine LEH ended up not going bankrupt. Imagine something happened and the price suddenly rebounded dramatically. These 150M naked shorts would be caught with their pants down and it would get bloody. The amount it would cost the financial system is the actual number of shares out there x the mean price those shareholders are willing to sell them for (knowing they have the buyers bent over a barrel). There have only ever been 71M shares of GME issued but institutions claim they own 102M shares of GME so how many shares are out there? Lets guess there are actually 200M shares out there and the average shareholder sells for $1000. That's $200B. If there is 333M shares and a $3000 share price that's $1T off of a measly $1B company that naked short sellers got greedy on. Who's going to foot this bill?\n\nTLDR; We're probably not even buying and selling actual shares of GME. When it looked like GME was \"on the ropes\" and there was a good narrative of why they should go bankrupt naked short sellers likely naked short sold an unknowable amount of fake \"IOU\" shares of GME because they thought it would for sure go bankrupt. This plan has worked for them hundreds and hundreds of times in the past making them hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. Some high profile examples include: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When these sharks smell blood in the water nothing is stopping them from naked short selling tens of millions of fake shares (over 100M in the last three days of Lehman Brothers) to innocent buyers who think they're getting a good deal which ultimately go to zero and equate to an infinite profit margin for the short sellers. What they didn't expect with GME was a bunch of retards doing what we've done over the past months and exposing their fraudulent naked short selling. We have no way to be certain how many shares are actually out there but [/u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnnydaggers/) post shows there was 1.7M shares failed to deliver in December (before shit even hit the fan). The thing is this threatens to undermine the publics confidence in the entire system. How do we know that the shares that we think we are purchasing are actually legit? We could literally being paying good money for something that doesn't actually exist. What this means for GME is someone is going to have to step up and actually pay up for all of these phantom shares that aren't even supposed to exist. What price they will pay nobody knows.",

Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede. That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nEdit1: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit2: I wish I was Elon's adopted asian child\n\nEdit3: we like the stock\n\nFull Casino? They just showed their hand before the river. ALL IN GME\n\nhttp://isthesqueezesquoze.com/",

Imagine LEH ended up not going bankrupt. Imagine something happened and the price suddenly rebounded dramatically. These 150M naked shorts would be caught with their pants down and it would get bloody. The amount it would cost the financial system is the actual number of shares out there x the mean price those shareholders are willing to sell them for (knowing they have the buyers bent over a barrel). There have only ever been 71M shares of GME issued but institutions claim they own 102M shares of GME so how many shares are out there? Lets guess there are actually 200M shares out there and the average shareholder sells for $1000. That's $200B. If there is 333M shares and a $3000 share price that's $1T off of a measly $1B company that naked short sellers got greedy on. Who's going to foot this bill?\n\nTLDR; We're probably not even buying and selling actual shares of GME. When it looked like GME was \"on the ropes\" and there was a good narrative of why they should go bankrupt naked short sellers likely naked short sold an unknowable amount of fake \"IOU\" shares of GME because they thought it would for sure go bankrupt. This plan has worked for them hundreds and hundreds of times in the past making them hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. Some high profile examples include: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When these sharks smell blood in the water nothing is stopping them from naked short selling tens of millions of fake shares (over 100M in the last three days of Lehman Brothers) to innocent buyers who think they're getting a good deal which ultimately go to zero and equate to an infinite profit margin for the short sellers. What they didn't expect with GME was a bunch of retards doing what we've done over the past months and exposing their fraudulent naked short selling. We have no way to be certain how many shares are actually out there but [/u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnnydaggers/) post shows there was 1.7M shares failed to deliver in December (before shit even hit the fan). The thing is this threatens to undermine the publics confidence in the entire system. How do we know that the shares that we think we are purchasing are actually legit? We could literally being paying good money for something that doesn't actually exist. What this means for GME is someone is going to have to step up and actually pay up for all of these phantom shares that aren't even supposed to exist. What price they will pay nobody knows.",

Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n\n\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n\n\n3. Spread disinformation through \"analysis\" to get people to sell their stocks because \"the fundamentals aren't there\". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n\n\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.\n\n\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n\n\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n\n\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don't exist to scare us.

Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:\u00a0We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.\u00a0Do I have your attention? Here goes:\n\nYesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.\n\nYesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.\n\nLast night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n\nToday, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n\nAt approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n\nTwo minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n\nThe trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this:\u00a0The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.\u00a0What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said\u00a0a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him.\u00a0Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM\u00a0DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"?\u00a0Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.\n\nRemember the movie\u00a0Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede. That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nEdit1: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit2: I wish I was Elon's adopted asian child\n\nEdit3: we like the stock\n\nFull Casino?

That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede. That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nEdit1: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit2: I wish I was Elon's adopted asian child\n\nEdit3: we like the stock\n\nFull Casino?

It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\n EDIT for all you people who like to see me fling my poo around: I made this its own post now.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bku5/some_thoughts_on_the_unprecedented_attack_that/",

They provide deep insight with plenty of url references for you to check out the source material for yourself.\n\nTwo Part Video Series (18 min total) about the SEC's Investigation Of Naked Shorting Of Sedona. A case study on how naked short sellers have destroyed hundreds and hundreds of publicly traded companies. He then goes on to explain how this can go on to effect the broader market:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5cMQLJRUo&amp;t=8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5cMQLJRUo&amp;t=8s)\n\nNine part (Approx 80 min total) series about the corruption of our capital markets due to naked short selling and \"failures to deliver\". He goes over a number of topics just as FTD's (Failures to deliver), how prevalent they are, how long they can last for and the risk they pose to the financial system. He also talks about the DTCC and it's role in clearing money and shares through the market and how it has a history of downplaying the amount of FTD's. Just watch the first (5 min) video and you'll be hooked:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWzOjB8qtU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWzOjB8qtU)\n\nIf you didn't watch the above series at least watch part 5 where he explains how the entire market could collapse as a result of a short squeeze on a heavily naked shorted stock:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKc0KQvvfWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKc0KQvvfWE)\n\n&lt;1 min Video of SEC Chairman stumbling over his words as he answers the question \"do you know of the possibility of short selling taking down Bear Stearns\":\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKWiE\\_rKXk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKWiE_rKXk)\n\nVideo explaining how someone bought WAYYY OTM weekly puts on Bear Stearns the day before Bear Stearns started tanking due to over ten million illegal naked short sells and how this started the Global Financial Crisis:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUKSU1qahgE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUKSU1qahgE)\n\nPart 2 of the above video where he goes over the SEC's lack of response to the naked short selling of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcjssQSthNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcjssQSthNU)\n\nPart 3 about how hundreds of millions of naked short sales of Lehman Brothers stock put the final nail in the coffin of the company causing the GFC. The SEC did nothing. Hedge fund managers like Jim Chanos and Steve Cohen have too much money and power to ever be prosecuted:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48eSoTNByQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48eSoTNByQ)\n\n3 Min Video of a debate on Bloomberg where this Wall Street guy is arguing that short sellers should be able to sell short at will and should never have to actually borrow shares to be able to short:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oerYirYVFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oerYirYVFE)\n\nThe Bear raid on Overstock.com and the journalists that enabled it (10 min):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHQeZ9czrKc&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHQeZ9czrKc&amp;t=4s)\n\nCase study: In the final days of selling of Lehman Brothers stock there we over 150M failures to delivery naked shares sold short when the stock was selling for about $0.10. Imagine LEH ended up not going bankrupt. Imagine something happened and the price suddenly rebounded dramatically. These 150M naked shorts would be caught with their pants down and it would get bloody. The amount it would cost the financial system is the actual number of shares out there x the mean price those shareholders are willing to sell them for (knowing they have the buyers bent over a barrel). There have only ever been 71M shares of GME issued but institutions claim they own 102M shares of GME so how many shares are out there? Lets guess there are actually 200M shares out there and the average shareholder sells for $1000. That's $200B. If there is 333M shares and a $3000 share price that's $1T off of a measly $1B company that naked short sellers got greedy on. Who's going to foot this bill?\n\nTLDR; We're probably not even buying and selling actual shares of GME. When it looked like GME was \"on the ropes\" and there was a good narrative of why they should go bankrupt naked short sellers likely naked short sold an unknowable amount of fake \"IOU\" shares of GME because they thought it would for sure go bankrupt. This plan has worked for them hundreds and hundreds of times in the past making them hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. Some high profile examples include: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When these sharks smell blood in the water nothing is stopping them from naked short selling tens of millions of fake shares (over 100M in the last three days of Lehman Brothers) to innocent buyers who think they're getting a good deal which ultimately go to zero and equate to an infinite profit margin for the short sellers. What they didn't expect with GME was a bunch of retards doing what we've done over the past months and exposing their fraudulent naked short selling. We have no way to be certain how many shares are actually out there but [/u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnnydaggers/) post shows there was 1.7M shares failed to deliver in December (before shit even hit the fan). The thing is this threatens to undermine the publics confidence in the entire system. How do we know that the shares that we think we are purchasing are actually legit? We could literally being paying good money for something that doesn't actually exist. What this means for GME is someone is going to have to step up and actually pay up for all of these phantom shares that aren't even supposed to exist. What price they will pay nobody knows.",

        "body": "Okay listen up y'all, we're in for an eventful day for sure tomorrow. Anyone that says they know exactly what will happen is blowing smoke up your ass. Here are a few things to keep in mind\n\nThe hedgefunds/deep pockets/whales **proved** to us today that they will stop at nothing -- *apparently including illegal manipulation* -- to try to shake out weak-ass \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udc50and keep us from our tendies. **Expect them to get even nastier**. These soulless excuses for people get real nasty when cornered and when their balls are on the line.\n\nWhat this means is expect the unexpected by taking a moment to think through some possible scenarios. \n\nAt this point, I'd like to confirm what everyone here already knows -- I'm just as fucking retarded as everyone else and nothing qualifies me to give financial advice, and that's not what this post is. This is simply me thinking out loud in preparation for the next phase of this escalating war, so take it or leave it idgaf just do your own research when it comes to investments blah blah \n\nAlright now that that's out of the way, let's talk about the coming days. [Like I said the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6ea1b/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_28_2021/gl004gk/), this is **NOT** guaranteed to happen tomorrow. Shorts **DO NOT EXPIRE** and they've **PROVEN** that they're willing, to be ridiculously charitable, to bend the rules. Keep this in mind, and for the love of god *DO NOT PANIC SELL TOMORROW* ~~if~~ when things get nasty. This could very well stretch into next week or beyond.\n\nProbably on our fun little trip down to the 100s today some of the shorts were able to cover in preparation for whats coming. But certainly not all of them, because **you autists fucking did it**. They made it to where all you *could* do is sell, **AND WE DIDN'T SELL**. I'm so fucking proud of all the \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50out there.\n\nThis has only strengthened my resolve to hold, and from reading the comments here all evening, a lot of you feel the same way. They've made this fucking personal, it's a matter of principle now, and I bought more shares at close just out spite. IDGAF if we go to zero ^(and ^don't ^think ^we ^are) -- but for *once* we hold at least *some* of the power here, and while it could be a week (or more) before all of this plays out, the underlying thesis still stands though -- so long as we don't sell, they suffer. \n\n#So let's talk exit strategy.\n\nWhile this has morphed into a righteous cause, I'm sure there are many of you still thinking of those sweet sweet tendies to be had. \"Maybe if I set a limit sell at just under $1000, I can still get mine before the big sell off\", shit like that. Of course we all want our tendies at the end of the day, but we're in such a unique position where we can pretty much name our price. But not exactly.\n\nThere's a certain price beyond which the economic fallout for the whole economy would simply be unacceptable to those in charge, and we'd see government/regulators step in and shut it all down and ruin the party. Of course no one can really say how high that limit is, but if you think the billionaires will let you hurt them to the point of systematic restructuring of the whole economy, know that they have favors to call in and power beyond what you could imagine. Don't believe me? [Look at all the repercussions they faced for their fuckery in 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcJmzEawWi0). \n\nSo we can't all set stop losses for $100k, because \n\n* a) they won't allow it and \n\n* 2) even if they did, enough people would (probably) take profits before it got that high.\n\nAt the same time, we can't (and shouldn't for legal reasons) just all get together and agree to set limit orders for $690 or $4200. \n\nSo as long as \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50stay strong, I think we could see $1k pretty easily. Probably some people will take profits then, but I think we can do better than this. I read yesterday somewhere that brokerages are not able to lend your shares to shorts if you have open limit orders on them, and I believe everything I read on the internet so unless someone shows otherwise, I think it makes sense to do so if possible at the limit you'd like (for me, &gt;$1k). \n\n# We like the stock, we want to see them suffer, and we want our tendies.\n\nFor me, it really is less about the tendies at this point though and more about seeing some of these elitist gatekeeping bastards get what's coming. I understand that not everyone feels the same, and that's okay. It's okay to take profits. However, if you feel the same as I do, this is how I'm planning on going into tomorrow, the next week, and possibly the further out than that: \n\nI plan on setting a limit order in the ballpark of $1k for ~10% of the shares that I hold. This will **cover the cost basis, I won't sell all of my shares, and it keeps most of the pressure on by only injecting a small amount of available shares for the shorts**. After that, I'm playing on house money and I can sleep like a baby with  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 while we crank things up to 11. They'll short ladder us down? I'll long ladder the mfers up. Limit orders at regular intervals, but not offering them all of my shares at one price (idk, every $500?). **If they want liquidity to cover their shorts, they'll have to pay for it. IF THEY NEED MORE, THEY'LL HAVE TO PAY MORE.** \n\ntl;dr: Don't give them all your shares at one limit price. Spread that shit out for maximum tendies and maximum pain \n\n$GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:\n\nWe were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.\n2.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.\n3.\t\u2060\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n5.\t\u2060\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n6.\t\u2060\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n7.\t\u2060\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.\n\nI saw an unsubstantiated post from a user (u/zshub) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nCredit: u/PlayFree_Bird",

That's what a liquidity crisis is.\nListen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede. That's how we win.\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",
