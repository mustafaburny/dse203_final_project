If you want to prep up for your ride, would recommend meditating, yoga, and building up psilocybin/THC use. Cut alcohol and try to your mind/body/spirit in a good overall shape where you don\u2019t have any inner demons haunting you. \n\nUsually letting go of your ego and realizing your entire life is just a projection of YOUR particular soul\u2019s consciousness and that we (all humans) are all connected on the same proverbial energy length, with constant negative lower energy beings (the cabal running the world bank and the show) trying to keep humanity from discovering its true powers if it were able to collectively unite through love. \n\nThe left v right divide are just silly games to keep the lower and middle class distracted while the rich perpetually take advantage of knowing more then they do. Slavery never died, it just evolved. The sooner you realize you are a slave, the sooner you can be free. \n\nA good DMT trip will show you all of this, but changing your life for the better and being a good person is an even better start. You can create you own reality by using a combo of psychohistory, astral projection, lucid dreaming, and transcendental meditation. Check out the Randonautica app. \n\nWhy do you think you have to sleep for a third of your life and scientists still don\u2019t know really know why or what goes on in there? The knowledge is being hidden from you. Good luck finding the truth my friend and happy tendies.",

Instead of relying on someone else to protect it for you, you have to take some initiative. Writing down a code to put up takes like 20 seconds and can save heart ache such as that. Plus many of my wallets I don\u2019t need the wallet keys themselves, just a pin or password like any other account. \n\n5-30 minutes isn\u2019t enough although I\u2019ve sent as little as .00001 and as high as .037 and never had to wait more than 10 minutes for it to be confirmed.\n\nWhy are banks busy when you call? Because someone else a legitimate questions, others are stupid and will need help with the most simple of things despite how streamlined it\u2019s made, or as simple. The only thing people seem to have the most problems with is forgetting to protect themselves. \n\nThat\u2019s also not true either. What I use to store my coins is insured up to more than I\u2019ll ever have, I think like 100 million. There\u2019s not many people who are sending their bitcoins into a wallet they can\u2019t have total control of. There\u2019s not really any reason to do that considering some exchanges let you link your wallet or give you one to control while you use the exchange platform. I\u2019ve also yet to hear of any platform \u201cforgetting\u201d their users key they store anymore than I hear of bank losing your routing number. \n\nOh I am but I also see how dumb people have no choice but to catch up regardless. Like I said, 15-20 years ago, the people who\u2019d call others computer geeks, think it wasn\u2019t going anywhere, now have a computer in their pockets they\u2019re are on everyday. 10 years isn\u2019t much time in the scheme of something being completely new, something that blows up to big to fast is usually just a phase, this has slowly become more mainstream and serious. I mean even some 401ks will mess with bitcoin. Many online retailers, some stores. You can buy bitcoin at atms now. \n\nThe problems you mention may exist for some users, but some of that also appeals to many people who want more control over their money, while simultaneously protecting against their dollars inflation. Chances are if waiting a few minutes or backing up your keys is to much, it\u2019s not something your interested in regardless. It\u2019s never been easier than now and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll only get easier.",

Oh, and guess who hired him soon after to fix their internal processes? Intel. Intel only escaped the Opterons because they went into disaster mode and scaled up a P3 derived core from their small Israeli team, and that core happened to hold the keys for the next 15 years of architecture development. Otherwise it would have been 5+ years of AMD pushing to 75%+ market share. \n\nDisruption does happen, and this exact story has played out before with the same chip architect. Intel isn't going to shit out an iterated and optimized Infinity Fabric chiplet lineup (thus their yield problems with monolithic cores that's currently taking them down), and this time Intel lost the fab lead as well.\n\nOne more 6-12 mo. delay and they will have to outsource to TSMC/Samsung where they have no reserved capacity and no tool chain integration. Intel's top guy in the Xe program was spotted last year at Samsung's 5nm tape out. You're just waking up now to facts that semiconductor investors have been trading on for years. The depth of Intel's fab problems was first reported before 2017. Swan's ER call last year where INTC lost 10 billion in market cap while he talked made me laugh like a comedy show. The company has deep flaws and doubling down on denial and avoidance has put them right in the edge of massive risk. 5 years from now its very likely that everyone realizes Intel should have started going fab agnostic years before now, as soon as it was clear the fab moat was critically breached, which would have been 4+ years ago internally.\n\nAMDs biggest challenge will be getting through to mediocre elitist and brand loyal engineers.",

I work in the Infosec community, and I was actually very intrigued when I read this post as my company is looking to move to a private cloud solution that offers us scalability and maintainability cheaper than AWS, Azure or GCloud. Since we are in the security business, we have requirements that we need to have full ownership of the encryption keys etc. Nutanix provides absolutely fucking no benefit even in that space. Their private cloud solution brief is a marketing ballache and hurts my damn nuts just to read. Their background is hella shady and I don't see any customers who would want to head dick first into a solution that locks them in for 20 years either. What a waste of time and money.",

My grandfather worked for Ford for 40 years and is one of many, many former employees that make up Ford's gigantic pention liability. Additionally, Ford has been a big source of dividends, which decreases stock price on payout. Additionally, Ford employees are unionized, so any gains get watered down before the investors see them. Peep the 5yr price history on Ford, expect more of that, leveling out if you're actually optimistic.\n\nOh, and F is discontinuing production of its cars. I am currently typing this in a Ford fusion, love this car. Ford is counting on people like me to trade in my keys and buy F150s and SUVs, but a lot of people are just not going to do it. The new Broncos look dope, but most people will just buy a comparable car from a different make.",

You spend weekends waiting for Monday to come around to trade again, you spend work days after 4pm looking at your phone for AMH moves and scrolling through pages to try and find the next big trade. At the end of the day you ran the race and thought money was happiness. Now you realized it's not, and I think a lot of people need to realize this too. \n\nA lot of people trading think if they can just make a million or two they'll be happy and if they ever reach that, they'll realize it doesn't make them happy. Sure maybe buying a few things makes you temporarily happy, but what happens when when you feel exactly the same as before? You start thinking, oh maybe if I can make 10 million or 20 million. You'll keep reaching for a number that you think will bring you happiness and if you ever get to it, you'll only increase that number. Ultimately living your life without meaning. I'm Mexican and travel to where my parents grew up often and one thing I can say for sure is that the poorest towns in Mexico have some of the happiest people I've ever met. And I think this is due to the fact that they've accepted their state and realized money doesn't bring happiness. Love, compassion, unity and friendship are the true keys to happiness. If you can learn to trade and make money while keeping those keys in your life. You'll be truly happy.",

When you do it for a living or day trade heavily you need level 2 data, hot keys, complex order types, watchlists, detailed charts w/ multiple timeframes, etc. \n\nYou'll have to excuse the music lol but check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAYPciJkajI this is old but gives you an example of what you get w/ a real dedicated day trading broker (this is Speedtrader Pro using DAS). This is also just one monitor and looks slow due to the 30fps framerate on the video...in real time it's insanely fast and on the other two monitors I have about 20 more charts so I can watch a whole list of stocks all at once and react in seconds if needed. Watch at 3:25 you'll see how fast the volume comes in on this as someone takes out the last 50,000 shares of a big 150k block that was sitting at $2.45 and how quickly it pushes up from there. You'll never see stuff like this on a broker like RH or Webull. Fidelity and Schwab and the other major ones (like TD, etrade, IB, etc) also have \"pro\" software like this, but it's still very sub-par to something like DAS on centerpoint (edit: IMO of course lol). \n\nAnyway, wasn't trying to insult you. Tbh it's probably unlikely OP even wants to trade like this or needs something this advanced but it's good to know it's out there if so :)",
