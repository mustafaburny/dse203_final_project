My grandfather worked for Ford for 40 years and is one of many, many former employees that make up Ford's gigantic pention liability. Additionally, Ford has been a big source of dividends, which decreases stock price on payout. Additionally, Ford employees are unionized, so any gains get watered down before the investors see them. Peep the 5yr price history on Ford, expect more of that, leveling out if you're actually optimistic.\n\nOh, and F is discontinuing production of its cars. I am currently typing this in a Ford fusion, love this car. Ford is counting on people like me to trade in my keys and buy F150s and SUVs, but a lot of people are just not going to do it.

Something about them is no longer working. \n\nSecondly, MRK\u2019s press release for their phase 3 trial of [Islatravir](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/more-than-70-countries-at-risk-of-running-out-of-hiv-drugs-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html) is set to begin soon after their presentation at the AIDS 2020 virtual divulging that the Phase 2b results proved that their drug has higher efficacy and safety from the analyses. \n\nThirdly, MRK has a proven track record for putting up great [earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-earnings-surprise-streak-could-161004767.html), and most analysts are bullish already about them for their earnings coming out 7/31. And will be even more so in the near future thanks to their EIDD-2801 exclusive rights from RidgeBack Therapeutics for an antiviral for covid until others produce a sustainable vaccine, and more so because they\u2019ll likely make up the shortage for HIV meds with current meds and their upcoming Islatravir. \n\nFuthermore, MRK just got [FDA approval](https://www.mrknewsroom.com/newsroom/news-releases/news-details/2020/FDA-Approves-Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-First-Line-Treatment-of-Patients-With-Unresectable-or-Metastatic-MSI-H-or-dMMR-Colorectal-Cancer/default.aspx) to use Keytruda for first-line colon cancer. Which will only drive their earnings. \n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t share the seeking A article, but it goes into further detail about why antivirals will be very important in the coming months since vaccines are still projected to be at least 6 months out, if not longer. If you want to see the SA article just google \u201cAntivirals Rather Than Vaccines for COVID-19\u201d\n\nAlso, the EIDD-2801 candidate they have rights to from RidgeBack is currently in quite a few trials, but one of the more pertinent one is in South Africa where they\u2019re needing 50 HIV positive people to see if it can help prevent covid in them, but also they\u2019re secretly hoping by sheer luck that the same drug can help manage HIV at the same time it prevents covid. \n\nSticking with my originals 7/31 $85-$90c, and 10/16 $90-$95, but I\u2019ll also add 1/21 $100-$105c since there are many analysts setting $100+ fair values for eoy.\n\nEdit: TL;DR\u2014 MRK $85+ calls cause they make the good drugs for bad things and it make printer go brrrrrrrr.",

        "body": "I find all of this hilarious tbh. Bruno Wu is a freakin' billionaire. Not saying rich people don't do illegal things, but it just doesn't seem worth his time to make up fake deals in order to create fake PR for a small company to siphon investor's thousands of dollars. He's an American citizen who is chairman of an American company and if he wanted to just make money, he could chill out and invest his billion dollars -- which would be a lot easier than creating a lot of fake news in hopes to gain a bit more capital through some shell company. It just doesn't add up for me or seem worth his time. I'd imagine companies doing shady things want to stay on the downlow, and Ideanomics is doing the opposite of that",

And the government can and will seize them, whenever it needs more money to spend. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102\n\nAs to the FUD toward Bitcoin :\n\n1. All tech starts complicated, then the iPhone comes along and fixes it, see Libra and the abject fear from government officials just the suggestion created. The first email providers were clunky as hell, you had to set up these two different servers, one to send, and one to receive, it was the dumbest thing ever, it could never catch on that way, but it was clearly better than snail mail, and once a decent web client abstracted away the hard part, then it took over, and the rest is history.\n\n2. Bitcoin is easy to steal with malware, at least from a software wallet, but Hardware Wallets make this almost impossible, and once you get one, its no longer an issue, unless someone tricks you into sending your Bitcoin to them, but people have been tricked into sending Western Union wires to thieves as long as sending money has been a thing, so its not much more steal-able, with precautions.\n\n3. Proper backups make this very unlikely, but not impossible. Anything can be lost, if its physical. Most people just have money in the bank, and its not going to get lost very easily there, so some care is required to avoid this problem.\n\n4. 3000 + new digital currencies have already been created, and some people have purchased them, but then again, some people bought Venezuelan Bolivars as well, but then they learned not to buy candy wrapper money, and then they stopped. A new digital currency doesn't make Bitcoin worthless, its just another thing people might buy, and then they will learn not to. I could offer you a hunk of Pyrite, but only a fool would buy that instead of gold...\n\n5. Yes, requires these things, but modern smart phones have all three of these things, and most people have one, so its less of a barrier as it appears.\n\n6. This is always possible, but since Bitcoin is a distributed ledger, any successful hack could be rolled back (old copy of who owns what is used), or the coin forked to an unbreakable variant (hard fork upgrade), so its not as catastrophic as it appears.",

Seems likely, and it will be bad PR when it happens. Or, if it hangs in the balance long ehough, they might get their revenue right enough to finish renovations and start an impressive Fintech Hub, however I'm not holding my breath for that.\n\nWu was the one to push for Fintech Village, that seems to be what his sights are set on, while Alf seems much more interested in expansion into green energy services.",
