There's a real possibility the same thing will happen with Tesla regardless of how \"revolutionary\" the company is seen by its supporters. \n\nTesla is worth more than 12 times its forward sales.

Yeah, maybe corporate shifts towards WFH a bit more but that space is already occupied heavily by Cisco/Microsoft. Plus they have no chance of landing the biggest tech companies who are developing their own solutions.\n\nMeanwhile Tesla is much more than electric cars. They are a clean energy company in a world that is going to have to shift that direction heavily and quickly in every industry. But even if you want to stick to cars EV sales are currently around 8% of global sales. That's supposed to go up to 33% by 2025 and 51% by 2030. That is some serious room to grow.",

        "body": "OP...this is some DD done by someone in our AVCT/SPAC discord.\n\nIm super long AVCT...my only other play is PRPL.\n\nSummary\n\nAmerican Virtual Cloud Technologies (NASDAQ: AVCT) is a technology services company focused on selling solutions with communication, connectivity, security, and collaboration software and hardware. AVCT resells software and hardware products from vendors such as Cisco and Meraki to customers in a variety of market segments including oil/gas, healthcare, and finance. AVCT also offers value added services including architecture consulting, support/maintenance, and 24/7 monitoring with NOCs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistory\n\nAVCT is a former SPAC that emerged from Pensare Acquisition Corporation, shich went public in July 2017 as a blank-check company designed to take a private company public. Pensare was formed with then intent of merging with a telecommunications company and had backing from Navigation Capital Partners (a private equity firm based out of Atlanta) and MasTec (a $6.5B+ revenue infrastructure services company).\n\nPensare initially planned to merge with TPX Communications but the deal fell apart in  May, 2019. In July, 2019 Pensare announced a new deal to merge with Computex Technology Solutions, a 30+ year old technology services company. The deal closed in April, 2020 and Pensare changed its name to AVCT.***\\[***\n\nCurrent Market Cap\n\nAVCT is currently trading at a market cap of around $85m. The stock price is $4.35.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBullish Indicators\n\n\\* The CEO used to be a senior executive at MasTec. This could mean that MasTec will be helping AVCT closely to secure new revenue streams and close deals.\n\n\\* The CEO is a former entrepreneur who started a company called \"nsoro\" and sold it to MasTec.\n\n\\* Leadership has experience at major companies including AT&amp;T, Panasonic, and Vonage.\n\n\\* In past public filings AVCT has indicated a deal with AT&amp;T that could bring up to $400m a year in revenue.\n\n\\* One of AVCT's focuses is UCaaS (Unified Communication as a Service). This is a category of software that helps employees to work remotely. Remote work is a strong trend right now.\n\n\\* AVCT executives have announced via a press release that they intend to continue acquiring more companies to grow revenue.\n\nSource: [https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/computex-looks-to-grow-acquire-during-covid-19-crisis](https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/computex-looks-to-grow-acquire-during-covid-19-crisis)\n\nRisks\n\n\\* Publicly available filings from Computex indicate less than $90m yearly revenue. This was reduced from over $100m in revenue due to an FASB accounting change that forced Computex to reduce the revenue it recognizes upfront.\n\n\\* There is significant risk of dilution to at least 37m shares. The merger was closed with additional a PIPE that requires assigning debentures to investors. These debentures can convert into shares and penny warrants that would raise shares outstanding to around 37m. There is further possibility of dilution from approximately 14m AVCTW warrants which have a strike price of $11.50.\n\n\\* The deal with AT&amp;T may or may not generate $400m of revenue.\n\n\\* AVCT's first earnings report is coming out in August, so there is not yet firm knowledge on what financials for the latest quarter look like.\n\nVery Bullish Price Target\n\n\\* In the very bullish case, we expect AVCT to trade at 2x TTM revenues\n\n\\* If the AT&amp;T deal generates revenues in addition to existing revenue from Computex, total annual revenues could be $600m ($400m from AT&amp;T deal and $200m from existing Computex revenues).\n\n\\* At 2x EV/TTM (assuming insignificant debt) and full dilution (including public warrants) this would place stock price above $20 and warrant price between $8 and $10.\n\nBullish Price Target\n\n\\* In the bullish case, we expect AVCT to trade at 2x TTM revenues\n\n\\* If the AT&amp;T deal generates no revenues in addition to existing revenue from Computex, total annual revenues could be $200m.\n\n\\* At 2x EV/TTM (assuming insignificant debt) and full dilution (including public warrants) this would place stock price at $8 and warrant price at $1.50.",

In addition, a substantial majority of our free customers historically have not converted to paying customers and we expect this will continue in the future.\n2. The term of our current agreement with Baidu expires at the end of 2020. Since the on-going tensions between US and China might have an affect on this agreement.\n3. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\n4. Sales and Marketing Expenses are increasing at a rapid pace\n5. Their competitors are well established and they always pose a threat, see below the list of them in each domain\n   1. On-premise hardware network vendors, such as Cisco Systems Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., FireEye, Inc., Imperva, Inc., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., and Riverbed Technology, Inc.;\n   2. Point-cloud solution vendors, including cloud security vendors such as Zscaler, Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. through Umbrella (formerly known as OpenDNS), content delivery network vendors such as Akamai Technologies, Inc., Limelight Networks, Inc., Fastly, Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc. through Edgecast, domain name system vendors services such as Oracle Corporation through DYN, NeuStar, Inc., and UltraDNS Corporation, and cloud SD-WAN vendors\n   3. Traditional public cloud vendors, such as [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), Inc. through Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc. through Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Corporation through Azure, and Alibaba Group Holding Limited through Alibaba Cloud\n\nIt is expected to have fierce competition, they will increase their Research and Development expenses too to ensure they are able to offer better products at competitive prices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not bear thesis though but a bull point, they have acquired S2 systems in 2019 who are known for Browser Isolation. Cloudflare and google collectively did a research on Browser Isolation. Even though, the results weren't promising, they are working towards it.   \n\n\nAlso, a key point to note is, Cloudflare leverages the idle network bandwidth to provide the free service to their customers since the highest priority is given to enterprise customers. By doing so, they were able to increase their exposure as well as establish more routes that been said, they want these customers to at least go for pay-as-you-go subscription which might help Cloudflare in terms of revenue.",
