That way they can sell a cpu with 64 cores for a tenth of the price of an intel one AND with higher margins than them. \n\nThe \"unique\" knowledge is that they plan on doing the same with GPUs and down the line they will just mix CPU and GPU (and FPGA after they merge with xlnx later this year) dies in the same package tailored to customers.",

Let's count the ways:\n\n1) AMD's acquisition of XLNX increases Total Addressable Market significantly  \n2) AMD's acquisition of XLNX increases AMD's access to manufacturing capacity at TSMC (XLNX + AMD wafer allocations)  \n3) AMD's acquisition of XLNX increases AMD's ability to extract the most out of their partnership with TSMC and TSMC's nodes (**fact:** XLNX has one of the best fab teams due to their extensive partnership with TSMC and being a \"pipe-cleaner\" for leading edge nodes)   \n4) AMD's acquisition of XLNX diversifies AMD's IP and grants them access to myriad programmable accelerator solutions developed by XLNX (these are all but guaranteed to make their way into AMD products as chiplet-based, flexible accelerators)  \n5) AMD's acquisition of XLNX opens a door for AMD to break into the growing, profitable 5G market  \n6) AMD's acquisition of XLNX gives AMD a jumpstart toward Software-Defined Silicon (SDSi) and/or Software-Defined Compute\n\n&gt;...a stodgy technology vendor with little to no synergy...\n\nXLNX earns over $3B a year and is growing that revenue at double-digit rates... how is that \"stodgy?\" I've already covered your lack of understanding on synergy.",

        "body": "\n\n\n&gt;&gt;I don't take pleasure in entertaining internet trolls, but since I don't want to see you spreading misinformation to others, I'll bite...\n\n&gt;My first clue that you don't know what your talking about:\n\n&gt;&gt;buy shares of whoever paints gold stars on Lisa Su's parking spaces at all of AMD's **fabs**\n\n&gt;**Fact:** AMD doesn't own any fabs.\n\n**Fact:** r/whoosh has a new champion.\n\n&gt;The only guise under which you can call this acquisition a \"mistake\" is viewing it through the lens of: \"I'm a short-term shareholder and wanted to make a quick buck and get out.\"\n\nTry: \"I've been in the engineering business for thirty years and know exactly what these two companies do and it's not a synergy.\"\n\n&gt; From any other standpoint, this acquisition is a win.\n\nThis outta be good.\n\n&gt; Let's count the ways:\n\n&gt;1) AMD's acquisition of XLNX increases Total Addressable Market significantly  \n\nAMD accesses its market just fine, as does XLNX. They aren't the same market so it doesn't increase scale for the things either company builds. Your answer would have the same value if they had bought Krispy Kreme.\n\n&gt;2) AMD's acquisition of XLNX increases AMD's access to manufacturing capacity at TSMC (XLNX + AMD wafer allocations)  \n\nOnly if they stop shipping XLNX product to free up the wafers. They could have paid a lot less to TSM to get the capacity away from Xilinx.\n\n&gt;3) AMD's acquisition of XLNX increases AMD's ability to extract the most out of their partnership with TSMC and TSMC's nodes (**fact:** XLNX has one of the best fab teams due to their extensive partnership with TSMC and being a \"pipe-cleaner\" for leading edge nodes)   \n\nSo now AMD is paying full price for shakedown testing of vendors that they previously got for free. Nice.\n\n&gt;4) AMD's acquisition of XLNX diversifies AMD's IP and grants them access to myriad programmable accelerator solutions developed by XLNX (these are all but guaranteed to make their way into AMD products as chiplet-based, flexible accelerators)  \n\nAMD's IP doesn't need diversifying, and XLNX's lowers the average value of the collective IP basket. There might be some value in putting XLNX FPGA arrays on AMD chips but it's a niche within a niche, not the vast meadow of easy money you need it to be.\n\n&gt;5) AMD's acquisition of XLNX opens a door for AMD to break into the growing, profitable 5G market  \n\nAbsolutely nothing was stopping them and they're years late to that party. 5g isn't growing, the majority of the value in it was taken as low-hanging fruit already. Adding gigabit wifi to Teddy Ruxpin dolls isn't going to reduce the vast Goodwill charge that's coming to AMD shareholders' future.\n\n&gt;6) AMD's acquisition of XLNX gives AMD a jumpstart toward Software-Defined Silicon (SDSi) and/or Software-Defined Compute\n\nOld tech. Xilinx does that now, and doesn't make as much profit from it as AMD makes from its existing business lines. Combining the companies won't refresh it or make it more profitable.\n\n&gt;&gt;...a stodgy technology vendor with little to no synergy...\n\n&gt;XLNX earns over $3B a year and is growing that revenue at double-digit rates... how is that \"stodgy?\" I've already covered your lack of understanding on synergy.\n\nYou're projecting on who understands what.\n\nFirst XLNX *revenue* is $3B. Its *earnings* are $600-800M and those have been flat for many years, and actually declining 20% since 2019 despite revenue growing 20% to that 3B in 2019.\n\nXLNX is not a growth center, which is why synergy has to be the focus, and the lack of it is key to understanding the problem here \n\nThe only way AMD improves XLNX is if they overhaul the crufty, confusing development system that comes with XLNX products and increases the velocity of design wins before XLNX FPGA gets replaced by some better software-customizable hardware methodology. There's no way XLNX improves AMD enough to be a good value.\n\nI'll accept that you don't actually know what you're talking about and admit that I don't have all the information in the world, so I'll wait for someone else to find a way this deal makes a net profit for AMD.\n\nMeanwhile, take a gold star; you can have one of Lisa's.",
