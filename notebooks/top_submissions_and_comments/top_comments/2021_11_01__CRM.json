Each birthday I give them $1000 to add to their portfolios, and $1000 each at Xmas. The eldest two are sitting on almost 75k each, and the youngest is just under 70k. \n\nBy the time they\u2019re 21 and have access to their accounts, they should have around 150k perhaps more if the bank of mum and dad don\u2019t raid it\ud83e\udd23. It gives them a leg up to start their lives. They\u2019re not allow to blow it on cars etc, they can use a bit for travel, but I\u2019m hoping it can get them in to the property market and or keep the portfolio going until they\u2019re much older. They\u2019ve had one really lucky break with one share which has doubled and makes up good slice of their portfolio and pays big dividends each year. That aside it\u2019s been pretty basic investments. If it was the US market it would stocks like MSFT, CRM, TSLA, AAPL that I\u2019ve tipped money in to. So relatively low risk and just playing the long game and I\u2019ve not sold a single share in that time. \n\nChrist I wished my parents had done a similar thing for me and my sisters when I was young.",

The top cloud providers have similar offerings but snowflake (imo) is a step ahead on features and allows a company to not get locked into one cloud provider as snowflake can sit on top of aws or gcp etc. the database has elements of processing and storage. \nMy take on why there are so many companies in the data space is data has many processes behind it. You source the data (from say $CRM), you store the data, you load the data, you process the data, you monitor your processing, you send a report. Each of those steps could be a different company technology behind it",

I bought stocks I wouldn\u2019t have normally bought, at prices I wouldn\u2019t have normally paid. It was a lapse in judgement and a short-sighted mistake by me. The DD was not strong enough looking back now. \n\nMistakes happen. I have -40% and -50% bags I was holding on to for some lifeless tickers. I knew they wouldn\u2019t go any lower, but I could not guarantee they would ever go any higher. I decided to cut my losses and invest what was left into $NVDA, $AMD, $AAPL, $TQQQ, $CRM, and $SPY. \n\nMy thought process was:\n\nI\u2019ll make that 50% back in 24-48 months, which is better than hoping that 50% crawls back to an unprecedented hyped explosive level highs like it was in Feb 2021. I agree with your idea and think you should cut your losses and buy something you\u2019re more comfortable owning. (As long as you can afford it, which if you\u2019re investing it, I assume you can)\n\nBest of luck!",

        "body": "I don't know if I'm comfortable with putting any tech companies on this list because even 10 years is a long time for tech. Take for example Nokia and Blackberry. Still surviving but struggled for many years despite being so popular in its heyday. \n\nI'll go with mine. Corning, 3M, J&amp;J, P&amp;G. All of these companies have stood the test of time and we are using their products in everyday life whether we know it or not. They are well diversified and would still do fine even if any one of their product has issues. E.g. J&amp;J and their baby powder",

        "body": "You are a value investor it sounds like.  Remember always:\n\n**There is never value in the absence of fear. There is never fear in the absence of justification.**\n\nFigure out what risk the market is scared of (what is creating the discount to intrinsic value) and decide if this is a risk you are willing to hold a lot of.  When you answer yes then understand most other people don't want to take on that risk.  Your willingness is what is getting you paid.  \n\nWhat Zacks hated about Corning was:\n\n* Severe supply chain problems both at Corning and it auto customers are going to be very bad for earnings short term.\n\n* 60% of revenues are in e Display and Optical segments.  China is a big customer and Chinese producers are coming on line.  Threat to earnings in the longer term.  Additionally they felt sapphire substrates are a superior product to gorilla glass. \n\n* debt to equity is high.  With a drop in earnings a dividend cut is likely which will pummel GLW.\n\nIt is trading at twice sales and 17x earnings for what is best case in Zack's opinion.  \n\nSo do you think Zacks are wrong or right?  If right or you don't know:  Do you have exposure to Chinese panel makers or sapphire substrates so Corning diversifies you?  Corning obviously benefits from demand inflation and gets hurt by almost anything else.  Are you in a position where demand inflation hurts you so you can take on this risk?  \n\nIf you think they are right and are likely to be harmed by those risks.... then you don't have an advantage.",

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

I was blown away that Zuck did not even once mention it. they are basically making a more modern version of this, and they are going to try to shove their oculus to everyone's face. \n\nThe value proposition is valid, it is that 3d gaming is the future of social chatter. \n\nThe VR push  however is going  to be a major flop. No amount of high tech is going to change the fact that a blindfold is not something you want to wear for long. Also, Facebook sells attention, and AR is the opposite of attention, it's distraction. \n\nUnity will benefit enormously from this,  but mobile gaming will lose a lot of momentum for a long time. \n\nHere is what people buy in second life: Avatars, avatar skins, avatar clothes, penises, vaginas, sexy clothes, even more sexy clothes. Basically take the most superficial and vain doll-dressing app and pump it up by 10 times or so, that's the future. No, it won't be the hub for tech and work and education and research, it will be as vapid and vain as facebook and instagram are now. \n\nFacebook will probably push its own, controlled and censored \"crypto\" to people. This will be their most controversial move,  but maybe their lobbyists are already in agreement with US govt. This is about ensuring that the next global payments system is controlled by the US govt.",

        "body": "Yes. \n\nNMG - Nouveau Monde Graphite - A Canadian company rumored to have a deal with Tesla, or at least another major EV manufacturer, for Li-Ion battery anode graphite. Telsa just took delivery of Anode equipment in TX and the timeline for both companies seems to line up. They could have Ford, VW, or whatever as a customer but it doesnt matter. The point is that NMG is on the verge of major revenue very soon. I'm expecting an announcement of who their customer is by Q1 or Q2 but it could be sooner or it could be later.  \n\nPYR - Pyrogenesis - This is a company who's about to break out with an order of magnitudes revenue increase from any one of many verticals such as 1. Their partnership with HPQ Silicon and their battery anode material. 2. The iron ore pelletization industry. 3. They're in the last stages of qualification with a tier1 aerospace manufacturer for their titanium powder. Other things like their waste to energy systems and other things will continue to add revenue gains to their bottom line. \n\nAXU - Alexco Resources -  This is a Canadian Silver mine that just began production, but is still valued as a non-producer, and they are about to report earnings. Silver itself would appear to be on the verge of a price increase due to inflation and other things and silver mines trade at a high beta to the price of Silver, generally they move in price by 2X-5X of whatever Silver does. \n\nDo your DD!",

        "body": "Roughly equal. \r\n\r\nIf I had to cut one, I\u2019d cut Alexco... Silver is a different kind of play. \r\n\r\nI'd split between PYR and NMG. \r\n\r\nWhat if you bet hard on PYR because it's got a list of massive things that can make it pop any day, but NMG announces who their big EV customer is and it jumps to something like $30-$50? Then what? \r\n\r\nWhy couldn't it do at least that? Look at what PLL did when they announced. That's Piedmont Lithium. You never know how the market will react, it could take longer. \r\n\r\nLithium is 1% of the Cathode in a Li-Ion battery, Graphite is typically over 95% of the Anode. \r\n\r\nJust like PYR, NMG has some massive things about to happen.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, you could peel off maybe 25% and give birth to a Fidelity account. With it you can access the OTC. That\u2019s a different kind of wild, be careful and stick to the fundamentals. Do deep DD, YouTube is your friend. HPQ Silicon's ticker is HPQFF. They've figured out how to efficiently and responsibly process and form Silicon in a way where it can be used in the Anode and displace up to 20% of the Graphite. HPQ's partner is PYR. Silicon adds a lot of performance to a battery. \r\n\r\nTesla just received their anode equipment at Texas. If Tesla is the customer of NMG and HPQFF, with how quickly they move, its hard to know when we'll know something. It could be tomorrow or it could be months, perhaps quarters. Both NMG and HPQ have signed NDAs with major battery/auto manufacturer(s). At minimum they\u2019ll tell us when every last detail is finalized or when there\u2019s a material change to the business and they\u2019re required to disclose.\r\n\r\nI'm eager to find out who it is... it might not be Tesla, it could be Ford, VW, or someone else. Maybe it\u2019s more than one? No one knows. \r\n\nDiversity is really important. It's better to have more than one moon shot. \n\nHave you looked at Dogecoin? Things go up when there's more buyers. Usually there's more buyers during peak media. When SpaceX launches the DOGE-1 mission in 1Q22 and sends a satellite in orbit around the moon, what do you think the media cycle will be like around Dogecoin?",

Not a good company. Cash flows and profits with fundamentals is what values a company in the long term. I only buy LEAPS options on companies I am 100% are going to do well/appreciate on the stock market within the next 90-365 days. This includes AAPL, HPQ, GM, and F. Even though I am fully confident in Palantir the company, PLTR the stock has been slow to gain. I will hold shares until I see steady and faster growth in the share price.",
