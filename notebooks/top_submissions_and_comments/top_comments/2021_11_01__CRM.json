I have three kids, aged 14, 12, &amp; 10. About 7 years ago they were each given 10k from their grandpa to open an investment account. I opened an account for each them here in Australia trading on the ASX. I\u2019ve only purchased blue chip shares that pay 4-10% returns year in year out, and all those dividends are reinvested back in to those stocks when issued. Each birthday I give them $1000 to add to their portfolios, and $1000 each at Xmas. The eldest two are sitting on almost 75k each, and the youngest is just under 70k. \n\nBy the time they\u2019re 21 and have access to their accounts, they should have around 150k perhaps more if the bank of mum and dad don\u2019t raid it\ud83e\udd23. It gives them a leg up to start their lives. They\u2019re not allow to blow it on cars etc, they can use a bit for travel, but I\u2019m hoping it can get them in to the property market and or keep the portfolio going until they\u2019re much older. They\u2019ve had one really lucky break with one share which has doubled and makes up good slice of their portfolio and pays big dividends each year. That aside it\u2019s been pretty basic investments. If it was the US market it would stocks like MSFT, CRM, TSLA, AAPL that I\u2019ve tipped money in to. So relatively low risk and just playing the long game and I\u2019ve not sold a single share in that time. \n\nChrist I wished my parents had done a similar thing for me and my sisters when I was young.",

There could be a 2T company with 1000PE, that will never make over 50bn profit.\n\nSecond - Tech.\n\nI will define that as a company that sells a product or service that enables companies or people produce their product.\n\nGreat Tech stocks today.\n\nAAPL and MSFT pass the profit check and they sell products/services that enable people\n\nGOOGL sort of qualifies - profit check and they have products and services that enables people but they primarily make their profits by being a 21st century advertising billboard which may disqualify the profit \n\nGreat tech stocks in 5-10 years\n\nAMZN - people would consider this already a great tech stock but profits not passed yet, it is only a matter of time though\n\nCompanies that will likely achieve over 50bn profit (great) and they sell service/product that enables people (tech)\n\nNVDA, TSM, Samsung\n\nCompanies that are arguable\n\nTSLA - is it a tech company? Or are they just selling a product? Cars don't enable people to produce things, it's a product with a function. Unlike macbooks, MS office, semiconductors that are tools for people to create things. If we consider cars tech, then every company becomes a tech company because they all sell a useful product/service. But cars don't help create anything. \n\nORCL, INTC, CRM, ADBE are the companies in the 200-400bn range but probably won't get there. ADBE at 5bn profit, 50bn in 5-10 years is just unlikely. CRM profits are 500mil, unlikely. INTC and ORCL profits are not increasing.\n\nV, MA, PYPL - unlikely profits over 50bn and also not really tech companies. Their products/service don't enable people/businesses to produce things, it helps people do one thing - transfer funds which is what all financial companies do.\n\nAll the other tech companies are so far off the 50bn profit hurdle that it is unlikely they'll meet it in the next 5-10 years, or ever. \n\nMaybe you don't agree with my definition of great or tech but if we have an environment of negative interest rates then market cap will be meaningless as everything would be inflated. Also, had to use a narrow definition of \"great tech\" otherwise there would be too many companies in a loose definition",

Companies compete and can\u2019t afford to risk losing competitive advantage by not adopting it.\n\n- I\u2019ve been checking indeed.com and the job listings for Kafka are consistently going up\n\n- Soros - Reflexivity Theory - fundamentals don\u2019t matter (see GME)(Although I do believe in the Qualitative value of the company, Quantitative will get there). Since it\u2019s trading in this range it will probably continue to do so. \n\n- Finally by virtue of having a high stock price more people will hear about the company and know it, so it will fuel adoption of the product.

Snapchat is now what the West comes closest to being a \u201csuper app\u201d (the model is WeChat, Tencent\u2019s flagship). If it keeps buying big companies, Salesforce could even move with Microsoft one day. And if it continues on its current course long enough, one day more goods may be sold on Shopify\u2019s platform than on Amazon\u2019s.\n\ncompany faced a user revolt triggered by an unpopular redesign, falling rates following the automatic auctioning of advertising space, and an exodus of executives. The value of its shares fell sharply, dropping below $ 5 in late 2018, less than a fifth of the price they started trading.\nSnap has since staged one of the most incredible turnarounds in tech history. When the company released first quarter results in April, it again surprised analysts positively, just as it did in recent quarters. Revenue increased 66% year over year to $ 770 million. The number of daily users reached 280 million, an increase of more than 50 million over the same period. As a result, the company\u2019s stock price is up 213% over the past 12 months to $ 53.\u00a0\n\n\nFacebook\u2019s social-media fortress looks a lot less safe now that it has at least 2 major competitors: America\u2019s Snapchat, a social media network owned by Snap, and TikTok, the short-video app run by ByteDance, a Chinese web giant. According to information revealed in a current wave of leakages, Facebook\u2019s teenage users in America now invest 2 to 3 times longer on TikTok than on Instagram",

Here are some of my milestones, though YMMV:\n\n**Year 0-1**\n\n* Being surprised that a stock beat on earnings and went down.\n\n* Buying an unprofitable stock on hype, watching it go down 10-20% and hoping it goes up so you can sell it for a smaller loss (TWTR for me).\n\n* Wondering how you're ever supposed to get to 30 stocks, when you're sitting at 5 and tempted to go all in on your biggest holding.\n\n* Reading lots of Buffet/value stuff and memorizing cliche quotes.\n\n* Caring at all about technical analysis, stop losses, shorting, dividends, splits or the specific price of a share.\n\n* Buying stocks because of M&amp;A.\n\n**Years 2-3**\n\n* Buying a large cap value stock that went down and doing the surprised pikachu when it keeps going down. (INTC).\n\n* Selling your first double-bagger for a profit... and watching it 5x in the future. (W)\n\n* Learning about factors, Sharpes, Shiller P/Es, Buffet ratios and worrying about macros in general.\n\n* Thinking about sectors, fundamentals, valuation ratios, growth etc.\n\n* Spotting an ETF that's been beating you (with lower risk) all this time.\n\n* Learning how to buy on the dip.\n\n**Years 4-6**\n\n* Being ok selling a long-term loser.\n\n* Feeling good about buying a broad-based ETF.\n\n* Diversifying by choice and not necessity.\n\n* Not playing earnings and focusing on the long term.\n\n* Holding all your capital gains to long-term.\n\n* Thinking about share dilutions, buybacks, cash flows, cap ex., moats and network effects.\n\n* Kind of half-assed doing some DCFs and valuations, and then moving on.\n\n**Years 7+**\n\n* Thinking about position sizes, correlations, macros, yields and rates.\n\n* Playing small positions in earnings again because it's cheap beta lol.\n\n* Sticking with allocations even if they're uncomfortable. Wondering why you'd ever go 25+% on one move.\n\n* Searching out guidance on the 10Q.\n\n* Being OK selling on the dip.",

        "body": "Intel is mainly behind because they failed to order a lot of EUV machines early unlike TSMC and Samsung. This can be fixed by spending a bigger share of the profits on capex and buying a lot of these advanced EUV machines themselves and that is exactly what they are going to do and what pissed of some investors. Intel announced they will be the first to receive the next iteration of even more advanced EUV machines soon.\n\nBy being a foundry Intel can use all their IP for their customers. This will give them an advantage over TSMC and Samson for a sizable chunk of the market. Simply because they can throw in this IP so customers can design product only intel can make. Their packaging techniques are not the same as those of TSMC and at least a sizable share of the market will benefit from these. I'm not going to claim they will steamroll TSMC but they will be able to take market share. It's a new market. It will be the same as AMD doubling their data center business by taking a few percentages of market share from Intel. In the foundry business TSMC will be like Intel and Intel will be like AMD.\n\nAs a foundry you can make whatever the client designs. Intel clearly stated they will go for a mix and match strategy where clients can combine external IP like ARM with Intel IP like packaging or networking. X86 will always have a place but Intel clearly accepted that it's not only x86 anymore and they are adapting.",

        "body": "Not really crazy. I mean, yes, it's hard to predict how high it'd go, but the trend of investing in chips, CPUs, and other advanced hardware is a follow up to present day economic and geopolitical news - ie the competition between the West and China, which is centered around chips; and the global chip shortage, which is the result of various supply issues, that is factoring into their price.\n\nThe market might seem random at times, but it's rational in the *long-term*. Global trends eventually transform into market facts. \n\nFor example:\n\n* Peak oil + climate change -&gt; rise of electric vehicle and new energy companies\n\n* Money printing + global corporate taxes -&gt; rise of bit coin and other ways to avoid taxes / hedge against inflation\n\n* Chip supply issues + competition vs. China -&gt; rise of chip companies\n\nWhat's hard in all this is picking the winners. Just because chip companies are on the rise doesn't mean all of them are doing well. Example: Intel. Just because people are dumping more money into bit coin, doesn't mean all of the currencies are doing well. Just because the market is loving electric vehicles, doesn't mean all electric vehicle companies are having gains like Tesla.\n\nThe noise is there and will always be there. You either live with it and buy into an ETF and accept modest gains, or you try to gamble on which company is going to take it all. That's where the challenge is.",

Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.

They don't need gov't money but if they can get subsidies that's a good thing.\n\nIntel has made numerous mistakes in the past, but not using EUV lithography is one of the biggest and it's being corrected. If you put TSM's 15x EV/EBITDA multiple on INTC, it goes from $49/share to $124/share. There's hidden value in INTC and EUV lithography utilization is worth a lot (just look at ASML).",

This will give them an advantage over TSMC and Samson for a sizable chunk of the market. Simply because they can throw in this IP so customers can design product only intel can make. Their packaging techniques are not the same as those of TSMC and at least a sizable share of the market will benefit from these.

Aaapl I would buy under $140 etc. Msft I would buy under $300 etc.\n\nINTC is a buy right now under $50. Jan 2024 Leaps at $50 or shares look fantastic.\n\nDon't buy in all at one time. Maybe buy 1 share of some of your favorites and use that as your baseline to buy more. See if you can buy at a better price each time.\n\nStart paper trading to start to get a feel for the market.",

It was talked about during the questions, the write offs start directly after the investment but the profits take some time to materialize.\n\nLower margins are only an issue if revenue is capped. For a long time Intel revenue was capped simply because they had such a huge market share in their markets that revenue growth was simply impossible. Even now if they manage to take back AMDs share in the datacenters for example it will be a limited growth of their revenue. For a long time the best way to predict Intel profit was focusing on margins.\n\nIf they enter a new market like the foundry business the margins could become lower but revenue will also be able to grow massively again. As long as revenue growth compensates the lower margins profitability can go up even if margins go lower.\n\nIntel annalists are still using their old model for predicting Intel profits. One of them even publicly claimed it was impossible for Intel revenue to grow but we all know they are entering the GPU market soon so revenue will most likely grow. With the global foundry business the growth potential is huge even if they'll only be able to grab a 10% of the global market in the first years.\n\nSo margins are important for profitability and especially if revenue growth is limited.

Whoever has overbuilt will suffer.",

        "body": "&gt; Intel is mainly behind because they failed to order a lot of EUV machines early unlike TSMC and Samsung\n\nthis is wrong. it show me you have no understand on how foundry work. if all you need is off the shelf equipment then why Intel struggle with 10nm for so long. TSMC's didn't use EUV for their 7nm. TSMC only started to use EUV for 5nm.\n\nYou can use DUV for 7nm node process. Foundry is not just buying equipment and operate it. You spend resources to develop FinFet and now GAA. \n\n&gt;By being a foundry Intel can use all their IP for their customers. This will give them an advantage over TSMC and Samson for a sizable chunk of the market. Simply because they can throw in this IP so customers can design product only intel can make. \n\nthis is not correct. if Intel want to license out their x86. Intel will have to do it like ARM. Foundry like TSMC send out kit to fabless so fabless can design chip according to their node process for max yield. It's the same for x86. that's why Intel outsourced to TSMC for Intel chip and guess what. Intel have outsourced many chip to TSMC for over years!\n\n&gt;As a foundry you can make whatever the client designs.\n\nDidn't you say only Intel can make x86?",

Almost all advantages the others have over Intel right now can be explained by TSMC and Samsung getting the majority of the EUV machines delivered. \n\nAs soon as Intel gets those machines too (they already have a deal with ASML and Intel publicly claimed they will be the first to use the next iteration of EUV machines) and get's them running up to speed this advantage of the competition will be gone. \n\nPat isn't bluffing about Intel leadership in the near future, he knows he is getting his machines. All he had to do was to piss off some investors by diverting a bigger share of the profits to capex so the hardest part has been done already.",

As someone who used to work in the datacenter INTC days in the datacenter are numbered.  They are so far behind not only in computing power but the most important factor in the future is energy.  Why do you think companies like TSLA etc are going up so fast.  It's all about energy and INTC has failed hard in this department.  \n\nAll these investors and analysts with no idea of the tech.
