There is potential for cloud/AI to change things, but investors will jump on anything that mentions it without a clear value proposition, in the same way adding \".com\" to your company name boosted its valuation.\n\nI agreed with your first point, but not entirely here. First, I absolutely agree cloud is a \"buzzword\". However, cloud is absolutely going to be critical/beneficial to future business. The problem is many folks still have bizarre notions of what it does (especially when they conflate it with \"AI\"). There are plenty of cloud operations that are killing it, especially during these pandemic/WFH times. Cloud server/database monitoring tools, cloud collaboration tools, cloud communication platforms, cloud phone routing, cloud analytic tools, cloud CRM platform, cloud security suites, etc. \n\nCloud just means removing the need to locally host/maintain these applications. Locally hosted means overhead, personnel, and maintenance. Sometimes is much more lucrative to pay a company a monthly fee, for their proven, web-based service, than to produce/bring something in-house.",

Charging more per paying user (increasing price), increasing usage base, and converting non-paying customers to paying customers. There's ample runway in all three of these paths, and as Zoom is already profitable, it is operating at a tremendous level of operating leverage like a typical fully scaled SaaS company, every additional dollar on the top line is contributing mightily to the bottom line.\n\nZoom currently being valued at 80x revenues sounds crazy, until you realize a value investor like Warren Buffet just bought into Snowflake at similar p/s metrics.",

        "body": "I don't want to disagree, but I think the past few years haven't been normal trends.  We had a huge correction in late 2018 almost solely based on the fed maybe wanting to increase interest rates.  Tech stocks have soared way above regular valuations and you could have made alot of money this year by selling when the price got super ridiculous and buying back in when the price was just overpriced.  I think the classic \"hold forever or you'll get burned\" comes from 1) normal economic/social/economic times, 2) when stocks are priced based on valuations.\n\nBut we've just been seeing loads of speculation the past few years - Snowflake, Tesla, Uber, Lyft, Beyond Meat, Zoom, Docu, CRM.  I am not sure it makes sense to apply the supposed time tested wisdom with stocks like this especially in 2020, when they are up and down, up and down, up and down\n\nI do think at at some point some of our time-tested wisdom will again become obsolete.  Things change.  In 2020, Warren Buffet's strategy is doing not well, for example",

As for REGI, I invested a couple years ago and since then they have shot up during the lockdowns. I think it's fairly valued finally, but if you want to buy in I wouldn't discourage you. They have so many positive catalysts going for them right now. With higher RIN prices, rejections of oil refinery exemptions from the renewable fuel standard, price target increases, Blender's Tax credits through 2022 and a future renewable diesel plant TBA, I'm still very bullish on this stock long term. Not to mention they could beat earnings in Q3. As for ENPH, I've been doing research on the company and its fundamentals before I invest in them. From what I've learned, the company seems to be rising due to recent analyst upgrades along with positive sentiment for renewables in general. I'd say that long term, clean energy is a great investment and you won't regret buying in even at it's high valuation. My advice, I'd look more towards a mix of clean energy stocks in ICLN or TAN, which will give you exposure to solar stocks broadly.",

The lineup for their technology and what they have coming in the pipeline is certainly going to be taking larger market share away from SEDG.   \n\n\nI love SEDG, but I love ENPH a little more. Both investments won't go wrong though.",
