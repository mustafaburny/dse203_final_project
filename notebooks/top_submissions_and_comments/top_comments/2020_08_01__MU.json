If it doesn't have a decent amount of free money, everything will tank because everyone hates not getting free money. And, if it's restricted to SkyWorks and other DARPA dong suckers, everything will tank.     \n       \nAlso, why are you dipshits still fucking with MU? It has been complete shit for ages.

They're also working with two of the largest energy suppliers in the fucking world to convert gas stations to include charge stations in exchange for a cut of the charge revenue.\n\nThat's the other part of their appeal. They're conducting their business in a very clever way, working with big oil so they can stay in the energy game with fossil fuels on their way out the door. Plus they fractionalize ownership of fleet vehicles to make it easier for companies to convert by the government mandated deadlines, they're working with the electric mine project and taking a 5-8% cut of some battery sales (usually 40% of the total cost of some EVs.)\n\nThey're laying themselves over every foundation of fast, efficient, cost effective green energy which is also going to box out competition. On the same note the McMahon's (Shane, founder) are very well connected in Asia and his mother is on the energy council in the United States. Bruno Wu (Chairman) is very well connected as well, and his wife is very powerful also, most recently as a board member for government ran Sun Media. \n\nThere are faster plays out there, undoubtedly, but in the market this one going up is about as sure a thing as you can get.",
