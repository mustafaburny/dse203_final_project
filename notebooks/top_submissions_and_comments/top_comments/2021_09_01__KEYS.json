        "body": "A lot of people are investing in crypto-ETFs and crypto-mining stocks without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual crypto. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. That is a pretty big risk even though they can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage wallets, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can easily confirm their legitimacy and I have been stacking free Satoshis for a few years now.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not completely insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your crypto\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

Which is very convenient.  \n\\- Single platform with whom you have to share your payment information. This is safer than relying on many different developers, whose forte is probably not payments handling, but game development. Even freaking Sony had issues with data breaches. Smaller developers might not even notice that someone hacked them.  \n\\- Single account system. Except when developers really want to push for their own garbage and force you to also have a separate account with them. So less hassle with remembering usernames and passwords. Though this can be remediated with a password manager.  \n\\- Solid feature set: cloud saves, automated updates, chat, game reviews, Steam Input, etc.  \n\\- No more hassle dealing with inputting CD-Keys on install or game time. Which has been generally replaced by...  \n\\- A DRM solution that is not too annoying, at least compared to other draconian ones we've seem over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor developers:  \n\\- Access to a large customer base, to which your game is offered (and might be promoted) in the Store page.  \n\\- No need to build your own solutions to common problems. Payments is a big one (if you mess it up, you messed up REAL BAD), multiplayer lobby invites, discussion boards, in-app payments, DLCs, etc.  \n\\- Steam servers take the bulk of the network and storage cost for downloads, updates, cloud saves, etc.  \n\\- As Steam handles a lot of the above, it is easier for Indie developers to succeed, as they can focus on making games instead of the boilerplate stuff.\n\nIn general, Steam is one of the largest reasons why PC gaming has progressed so much. For example, I don't think we'd have such a vast amount of successful indie games otherwise.",

This provides the highest level of security you can have for your crypto, because the keys to your coins are on the chip inside the device, and not on the internet like they would be if you use a hot wallet like MetaMask. I engraved the seed phrase to my Ledger on a metal plate made specifically for crypto seed phrases. I store the seed phrase and Ledger in a safe. \n\nIn the future as my portfolio grows, I will up the security by splitting the seed phrase on to 3 different metal plates. Each plate will have 2/3rds of the phrase and all 3 will be stored in a separate location, so in order to recover the wallet you need 2 of the plates. This prevents a thief from only needing the one plate. Additionally, on top of the seed phrase you can put another password that can be stored in your mind. This is also all on top of a 7-digit pin for unlocking the Ledger anytime you turn it on.\n\nIf you're going to buy a cold wallet, I recommend a Ledger and ONLY buy it off the official Ledger website.\n\nWatch videos on how blockchain technology works. I recommend Bitcoin and Ethereum to be at least 70% of your portfolio. \n\n  \nWhen you're ready to invest, watch videos on how to buy from an exchange and how to transfer the crypto to your wallet. There are many resources online. If you get a Ledger they basically make it idiot-proof with their instructions. It's not as complicated as many people think. You just have to check the address and know what you're doing. There is no institution that will help you if you screw it up.  \n\n\nI would caution you, that we are deep into the current bull run, and a crash isn't guaranteed but likely in the next 6 months.

Not only did he lose the money, but he had to take delivery and ended up with a house full of gourds. He spent some time trying to sell guards, turn them into instruments, and make them edible. It seems he had some success with the last one.\n\nThen he noticed the price of rhodium metal had skyrocketed, and saw an opportunity to recoup some loses. Unfortunately, not only did he buy rhodium at record high prices.. what he received wasn\u2019t really rhodium. \n\nThen he switched gears and did some illegal beekeeping in Uruguay and got caught. So he fled back to the US, arriving with $14. After settling back in, he considered transporting an ant colony across the country with the apparent goal of selling encryption keys based on the random movements of ants. Turns out transporting ant colonies across state lines is illegal, so nothing came of that idea.\n\nNow he\u2019s doing Uber Eats deliveries on his bike, but he ate a customer\u2019s order recently and may need to find a new gig.\n\nI\u2019m not going to link to his profile, because I don\u2019t want him to be harassed. It\u2019s vitally important that he continue to document his adventures. Also, he represents the values of WSB better than 99% of you. So the disparaging comments are horseshit.\n\nThe legendary u/deepfuckingvalue and Jenks have two things in common. They spotted unique setups for financial gain, and they swung for the fucking fences. DFV also had a background in analysis, and spent a substantial amount of time verifying the setup, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s a multimillionaire and Jenks is eating decorative gourds.\n\nBut Jenks is tenacious, and true WSB royalty. I\u2019m hoping one of his crazy ideas connects and he retires with a Lambo made of rhodium and a mansion full of gourds.",

        "body": "Absolutely, I\u2019d be happy to. Let me start off with why I hold so long. The simple answer is that this is my strategy, to buy and hold. To be more specific, if you look at history, the market continually grows over time, especially when you look at long periods like 10, 15, 20 years. We have obviously had some major corrections and recessions that have pummeled the market, but the market has always come back over time. Timing the market is impossible, especially for those who are not in the business of buying/selling stocks. I\u2019m for all intents and purposes and amateur and I know there\u2019s no shot I\u2019m timing anything in the market. Also, I diversify my investments, which allow me to be in a position to own stocks in sectors that are up at any given point in time. Many business sectors have cycles where they perform well for several years, then go into a slump for several years. This gives me the opportunity to sell and pull some cash if I happen to need it. I try my best to never pull from my investments, as my long term goal is financial independence by my mid-50s. Hopefully this adequately explains the why, so let me know if you\u2019d like me to clarify any of these points.\n\nAs for some of the stocks I\u2019ve purchased showing an increase of 1,000% or more, here are a few examples:\n\nKEYS - I purchased two blocks, one in \u201899 and one in \u201801. My share cost is just over $15, with today\u2019s price being about $175. This is just over 1,000% in gains.\n\nMA (MasterCard) - My cost in 2010 was $25.45, today it\u2019s trading at $354 for a gain of over 1,200%.\n\nMSFT - My cost in 2011 was $26.95, and today it\u2019s trading at $289 for a gain of 975% (I know, under a 1,000% but still pretty good).\n\nI have many others in the 700-800% range as well. One of the things you may notice is that I\u2019m investing in larger, stable companies. I\u2019m also strong on stocks that pay out dividends, which is what I use to fund additional positions.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m a complete amateur with all of this. I just know over the (very) long term most stocks (and the market overall) are always up. I cannot time the market, so I\u2019m incapable of picking short term winners and I don\u2019t really try. I just go by history, and if something I like drops, I add to it to bring my cost down in the hopes it will go back up again over time. I hope this helps!",

        "body": "A lot of people are investing in crypto-ETFs without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual crypto. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. That is a pretty big risk even though they can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage wallets, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can easily confirm their legitimacy and I have been stacking free Satoshis for a few years now.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not completely insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your crypto\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the crypto-asset, it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your adjusted cost base (ACB) for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your ACB for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really crypto itself, but rather, it is in the application of blockchain technology which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the crypto-assets itself simply have a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Moreover, investing is simply risk management and from a risk-adjusted returns perspective, having some excellent crypto-projects is better than not having any at all while I personally see this as the 12th sector in the overall global market index.\r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\r  \n\r  \n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\r  \n\r  \n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \r  \n\r  \n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: I am irresponsibly long Bitcoin/Ethereum and I sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

        "body": "A lot of people are investing in crypto-ETFs without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual crypto. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. That is a pretty big risk even though they can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage wallets, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\r  \n\r  \n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can easily confirm their legitimacy and I have been stacking free Satoshis for a few years now.   \r  \n\r  \n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\r  \n\r  \n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your crypto\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not completely insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.\r  \n\r  \n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your crypto\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.\r  \n\r  \n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\r  \n\r  \n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\r  \n\r  \n7.

For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger as well as the decentralization of this digital store of value combined with its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. \r  \n\r  \nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\r  \n\r  \n1.
