It's a Highlander situation, and there can be only one. You must acquire the entire market, because second place is death. If Myspace, Friendster, GooglePlus or any of the other dozens of 'also ran' social networks had beaten Facebook to the punch, getting Zuckerberg'ed wouldn't be a thing.\n\nIn other industries like brick and mortar food or retail, it's important to maintain profitability while expanding. Expansion will take decades. Walmart didn't show up in the 1960's and take over America. It started in the backwaters other retailers were ignoring and built out, year over year, decade over decade. Same story with Taco Bell and dozens of others. This model requires persistent profitability.\n\nSave an Ma Bell or Facebook type business, I'll prefer improved margins.",
