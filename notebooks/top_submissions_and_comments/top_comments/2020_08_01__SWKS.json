Its also less device focused and more of the network operating center/hubs that will be more critical than in 4G deployments with coordinating small cell data traffic. I like Skyworks bc it has less retail exposure than QCOM and has market share outside of handsets. I mention the others bc they are also heavily involved in 5G.",
